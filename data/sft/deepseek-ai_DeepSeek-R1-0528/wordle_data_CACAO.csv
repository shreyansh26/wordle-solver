We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
   C: ✓ (correct position)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word but wrong position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - C in the first position (because it's marked correct).
   - The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we had it in ""crane"").
   - The letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   Position 1: C
   The word does not contain R, N, E.
   The word does contain A, but not in position 3.

 Since the word has C at the start, and A is present but not at position 3, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using R, N, E.

 What letters can we use?
   Vowels: We have A (which we know is in the word). Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don't know yet.
   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven't ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.
   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let's check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.

 However, we also have two C's? The word ""cacti"" has two C's. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C's, that might be okay? But we don't know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don't have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.

 Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don't know about other positions.

 Alternatively, let's think of other words:

   ""CHAOS"": 
      Position 1: C -> good
      Position 2: H -> unknown
      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.

 The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:
   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it's not at position 3.

 In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.

 How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?

 Let's try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.

 Common words:
   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don't know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn't have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.

 Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.

 But let's try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.

 Considering the available letters, let me think of:

   Position 1: C
   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn't have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?

 How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as '-' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get '-' for A? Or if the word has two A's and one is at position 3? But we don't know.

 However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don't know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got '-') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.

 So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn't give new information. So it's better to try A in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

 Proposed guess: ""CHASM""
   C at 1 -> correct
   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be '-' again? Or maybe it doesn't matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it's not? Only if there's no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn't tell us anything new.

 Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.

 ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.

 ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.

 So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don't know about L and I.

 Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.

 ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.

 ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.

 Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven't eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.

 How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.

 How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.

 How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don't know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don't know.

 So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn't have R, N, E.

 Let me consider: 
   CACTI: 
      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.
      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don't know.
      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.

 And T and I are new letters.

 So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, let's think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?

 Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won't help? So we should avoid.

 How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.

 So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven't ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.

 Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn't get information about where it is? So it's better to include A to test new positions.

 So we want a word that:
   - Starts with C
   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)
   - Avoids R, N, E
   - Uses new common letters.

 Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don't know.

 Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.

 How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.

 ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can't use non-verified words? We must use English words.

 Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.

 How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.

 How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it's not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.

 After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.

 But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.

 Let's guess ""CACTI"".

 Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.

 Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?

 ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.

 Which word gives more information? 
   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.
   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.

 Both seem viable.

 Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let's compare:
   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.
   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.

 Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.

 We also haven't tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.

 So I'll go with ""CALMS"".

 Word: CALMS

<guess>calms</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

We know:
- The word starts with C.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A (but avoid position 3).
- Avoid R, N, E.
- Test new common letters to maximize information.
- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:
  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.
  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.
  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).

<guess>calms</guess>",calms,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
   C: ✓ (correct position)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word but wrong position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - C in the first position (because it's marked correct).
   - The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we had it in ""crane"").
   - The letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   Position 1: C
   The word does not contain R, N, E.
   The word does contain A, but not in position 3.

   Vowels: We have A (which we know is in the word). Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don't know yet.
   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:

   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let's check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.

 However, we also have two C's? The word ""cacti"" has two C's. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C's, that might be okay? But we don't know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don't have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.

 We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don't know about other positions.

 Alternatively, let's think of other words:

      Position 2: H -> unknown
      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.

 The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:
   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it's not at position 3.

 In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.

 Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn't get information about where it is? So it's better to include A to test new positions.

 So we want a word that:
   - Starts with C
   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)
   - Avoids R, N, E
   - Uses new common letters.

 Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don't know.

 Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.

 How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.

 ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can't use non-verified words? We must use English words.

 Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.

 How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.

 How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it's not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.

 After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.

 But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.

 Let's guess ""CACTI"".

 Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.

 Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?

 ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.

 Which word gives more information? 
   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.
   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.

 Both seem viable.

 Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let's compare:
   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.
   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.

 Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.

 We also haven't tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.

 So I'll go with ""CALMS"".

 Word: CALMS

<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

We know:
- The word starts with C.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A (but avoid position 3).
- Avoid R, N, E.
- Test new common letters to maximize information.
- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:
  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.
  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.
  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).",Guess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CACAO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
   C: ✓ (correct position)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word but wrong position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - C in the first position (because it's marked correct).
   - The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we had it in ""crane"").
   - The letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   Position 1: C
   The word does not contain R, N, E.
   The word does contain A, but not in position 3.

 Since the word has C at the start, and A is present but not at position 3, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using R, N, E.

 What letters can we use?
   Vowels: We have A (which we know is in the word). Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don't know yet.
   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven't ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.
   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let's check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.

 However, we also have two C's? The word ""cacti"" has two C's. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C's, that might be okay? But we don't know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don't have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.

 Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don't know about other positions.

 Alternatively, let's think of other words:

   ""CHAOS"": 
      Position 1: C -> good
      Position 2: H -> unknown
      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.

 The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:
   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it's not at position 3.

 In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.

 How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?

 Let's try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.

 Common words:
   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don't know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn't have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.

 Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.

 But let's try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.

 Considering the available letters, let me think of:

   Position 1: C
   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn't have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?

 How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as '-' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get '-' for A? Or if the word has two A's and one is at position 3? But we don't know.

 However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don't know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got '-') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.

 So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn't give new information. So it's better to try A in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

 Proposed guess: ""CHASM""
   C at 1 -> correct
   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be '-' again? Or maybe it doesn't matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it's not? Only if there's no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn't tell us anything new.

 Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.

 ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.

 ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.

 So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don't know about L and I.

 Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.

 ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.

 ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.

 Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven't eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.

 How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.

 How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.

 How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don't know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don't know.

 So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn't have R, N, E.

 Let me consider: 
   CACTI: 
      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.
      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don't know.
      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.

 And T and I are new letters.

 So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, let's think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?

 Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won't help? So we should avoid.

 How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.

 So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven't ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.

 Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn't get information about where it is? So it's better to include A to test new positions.

 So we want a word that:
   - Starts with C
   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)
   - Avoids R, N, E
   - Uses new common letters.

 Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don't know.

 Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.

 How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.

 ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can't use non-verified words? We must use English words.

 Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.

 How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.

 How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it's not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.

 After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.

 But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.

 Let's guess ""CACTI"".

 Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.

 Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?

 ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.

 Which word gives more information? 
   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.
   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.

 Both seem viable.

 Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let's compare:
   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.
   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.

 Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.

 We also haven't tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.

 So I'll go with ""CALMS"".

Because we know the first letter is C.\n      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don\'t know.\n      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.\n\n And T and I are new letters.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?\n\n Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won\'t help? So we should avoid.\n\n How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.\n\n So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven\'t ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.\n\n Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn\'t get information about where it is? So it\'s better to include A to test new positions.\n\n So we want a word that:\n   - Starts with C\n   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)\n   - Avoids R, N, E\n   - Uses new common letters.\n\n Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.\n\n How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.\n\n ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can\'t use non-verified words? We must use English words.\n\n Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.\n\n How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it\'s not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.\n\n After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.\n\n But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s guess ""CACTI"".\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.\n\n Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?\n\n ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.\n\n Which word gives more information? \n   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.\n\n Both seem viable.\n\n Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let\'s compare:\n   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.\n\n Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.\n\n We also haven\'t tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CALMS"".\n\n Word: CALMS\n\n<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nWe know:\n- The word starts with C.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n- R, N, and E are absent.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with C.\n- Must include A (but avoid position 3).\n- Avoid R, N, E.\n- Test new common letters to maximize information.\n- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:\n  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.\n  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.\n  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).\n\n<guess>calms</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  M: x (not in the word)
  S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the feedback:

- The first letter is C (from both guesses).
- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).
- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:
  R, N, E (from first guess)
  L, M, S (from second guess)

So the word has:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A

And the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.

We also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it's in position 2, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.

What are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.

We need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.

Let's think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: 
  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don't need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet.

But we haven't tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.

So the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.

The tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.

So the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

And the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates of other letters.

Common words:

- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let's check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B's? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Other words:

- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don't know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven't tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C's? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.

But we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That's correct? So we would have:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: C -> we don't know? It might be correct or not?
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: I

But we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C's, then it's possible? Or if not, then we know.

But we have other options.

Another word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C's? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn't have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C's? And we are testing T and H.

But we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an 'x', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', and if correct, we get '✓'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it's okay.

But we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don't know if there is a second C? So it's worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:

- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.

But we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:
  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.

This tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Similarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

""CAULD"" is not common? 

""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.

""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.

""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let's see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.

""CAPIZ"": not common? 

""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don't know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T's? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x's? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it's okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.

Better to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?

But ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

But let me think of more common words: 

- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)
- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)
- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don't know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don't know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a '-' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don't care? We just need to find the correct letters.

But we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That's inefficient.

Therefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Another option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B's? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? 

""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.

Alternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? 

Or ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C's? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.

But we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn't? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it's a trade-off.

But I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.

""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.

So ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.

But let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.

We can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D's? So duplicate? 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? 

""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let's stick to more common words.

""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? 

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? 

How about ""CARTY""? Not common? 

""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? 

""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? 

Wait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? 

Another common word: ""CABIN"" no? 

""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? 

""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? 

""CAPUT"" is the best so far? 

Another word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? 

""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? 

""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAULD"" -> not common? 

""CAUKY"" -> not common? 

""CAUPS"" -> not common? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? 

But we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? 

No, we need 5 letters? 

Another word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? 

""CAPHS"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? 

But to maximize commonality, let's choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? 

But we are playing to get information? So let's do ""CATCH"": 

  C A T C H

We know:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)

Then:
  Position 3: T -> we test T
  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? 
  Position 5: H

So we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a '-' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a '-' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an 'x', then there is no duplicate? 

But we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? 

Whereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? 

So ""CAPUT"" is better? 

But let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? 

""CAPUT"" is one? 

""CAPOT"" is another? 

""CADGY"" -> not common? 

""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? 

""CAFIZ"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is more common? 

But to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? 

But I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? 

""CAVAT"" -> not a word? 

""CAVES"" invalid? 

""CAXON"" -> not common? 

I think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". 

But let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can't, but I'll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? 

But I recall that Wordle uses common words? 

Another word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? 

""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? 

So not? 

""CAPUT"" it is? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? 

""CAPON"" has N? 

""CAPUT"" is the best? 

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"". 

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters? 

""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? 

Yes? 

So guess: CAPUT

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We hope to get information about P, U, T? 

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? 

If we get a '-', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? 

If 'x', then not in the word? 

And we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don't have duplicates in this guess? 

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". 

<guess>caput</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: CALMS**  
  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  
  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
  - L, M, S are absent from the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must start with ""CA"".  
  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  
  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  
- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  
- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  
  - Why?  
    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  
    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  
    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).  

<guess>caput</guess>",caput,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  M: x (not in the word)
  S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the feedback:

- The first letter is C (from both guesses).
- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).
- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:
  R, N, E (from first guess)
  L, M, S (from second guess)

So the word has:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A

And the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.

We also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it's in position 2, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.

What are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.

We need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.

Let's think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: 
  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don't need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet.

But we haven't tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.

So the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.

The tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.

So the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

And the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates of other letters.

Common words:

- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let's check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B's? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Other words:

- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don't know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven't tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C's? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.

But we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That's correct? So we would have:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: C -> we don't know? It might be correct or not?
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: I

But we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C's, then it's possible? Or if not, then we know.

But we have other options.

Another word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C's? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn't have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C's? And we are testing T and H.

But we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an 'x', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', and if correct, we get '✓'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it's okay.

But we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don't know if there is a second C? So it's worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:

- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.

But we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:
  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.

This tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Similarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

""CAULD"" is not common? 

""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.

""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.

""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let's see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.

""CAPIZ"": not common? 

""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don't know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T's? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x's? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it's okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.

Better to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?

But ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

But let me think of more common words: 

- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)
- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)
- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don't know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don't know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a '-' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don't care? We just need to find the correct letters.

But we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That's inefficient.

Therefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Another option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B's? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? 

""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.

Alternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? 

Or ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C's? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.

But we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn't? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it's a trade-off.

But I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.

""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.

So ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.

But let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.

We can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D's? So duplicate? 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? 

""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let's stick to more common words.

""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? 

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? 

How about ""CARTY""? Not common? 

""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? 

""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? 

Wait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? 

Another common word: ""CABIN"" no? 

""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? 

""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? 

""CAPUT"" is the best so far? 

Another word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? 

""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? 

""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAULD"" -> not common? 

""CAUKY"" -> not common? 

""CAUPS"" -> not common? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? 

But we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? 

No, we need 5 letters? 

Another word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? 

""CAPHS"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? 

But to maximize commonality, let's choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? 

But we are playing to get information? So let's do ""CATCH"": 

  C A T C H

We know:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)

Then:
  Position 3: T -> we test T
  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? 
  Position 5: H

So we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a '-' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a '-' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an 'x', then there is no duplicate? 

But we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? 

Whereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? 

So ""CAPUT"" is better? 

But let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? 

""CAPUT"" is one? 

""CAPOT"" is another? 

""CADGY"" -> not common? 

""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? 

""CAFIZ"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is more common? 

But to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? 

But I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? 

""CAVAT"" -> not a word? 

""CAVES"" invalid? 

""CAXON"" -> not common? 

I think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". 

But let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can't, but I'll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? 

But I recall that Wordle uses common words? 

Another word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? 

""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? 

So not? 

""CAPUT"" it is? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? 

""CAPON"" has N? 

""CAPUT"" is the best? 

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"". 

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters? 

""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? 

Yes? 

So guess: CAPUT

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We hope to get information about P, U, T? 

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? 

If we get a '-', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? 

If 'x', then not in the word? 

And we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don't have duplicates in this guess? 

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". 

<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: CALMS**  
  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  
  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
  - L, M, S are absent from the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must start with ""CA"".  
  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  
  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  
- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  
- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  
  - Why?  
    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  
    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  
    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).",Guess 3: caput -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,CACAO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
   C: ✓ (correct position)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word but wrong position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - C in the first position (because it's marked correct).
   - The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we had it in ""crane"").
   - The letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   Position 1: C
   The word does not contain R, N, E.
   The word does contain A, but not in position 3.

 Since the word has C at the start, and A is present but not at position 3, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using R, N, E.

 What letters can we use?
   Vowels: We have A (which we know is in the word). Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don't know yet.
   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven't ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.
   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let's check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.

 However, we also have two C's? The word ""cacti"" has two C's. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C's, that might be okay? But we don't know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don't have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.

 Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don't know about other positions.

 Alternatively, let's think of other words:

   ""CHAOS"": 
      Position 1: C -> good
      Position 2: H -> unknown
      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.

 The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:
   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it's not at position 3.

 In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.

 How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?

 Let's try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.

 Common words:
   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don't know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn't have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.

 Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.

 But let's try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.

 Considering the available letters, let me think of:

   Position 1: C
   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn't have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?

 How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as '-' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get '-' for A? Or if the word has two A's and one is at position 3? But we don't know.

 However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don't know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got '-') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.

 So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn't give new information. So it's better to try A in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

 Proposed guess: ""CHASM""
   C at 1 -> correct
   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be '-' again? Or maybe it doesn't matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it's not? Only if there's no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn't tell us anything new.

 Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.

 ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.

 ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.

 So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don't know about L and I.

 Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.

 ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.

 ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.

 Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven't eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.

 How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.

 How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.

 How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don't know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don't know.

 So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn't have R, N, E.

 Let me consider: 
   CACTI: 
      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.
      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don't know.
      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.

 And T and I are new letters.

 So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, let's think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?

 Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won't help? So we should avoid.

 How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.

 So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven't ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.

 Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn't get information about where it is? So it's better to include A to test new positions.

 So we want a word that:
   - Starts with C
   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)
   - Avoids R, N, E
   - Uses new common letters.

 Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don't know.

 Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.

 How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.

 ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can't use non-verified words? We must use English words.

 Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.

 How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.

 How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it's not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.

 After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.

 But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.

 Let's guess ""CACTI"".

 Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.

 Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?

 ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.

 Which word gives more information? 
   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.
   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.

 Both seem viable.

 Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let's compare:
   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.
   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.

 Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.

 We also haven't tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.

 So I'll go with ""CALMS"".

 Word: CALMS

<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

We know:
- The word starts with C.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A (but avoid position 3).
- Avoid R, N, E.
- Test new common letters to maximize information.
- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:
  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.
  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.
  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).

<guess>calms</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  M: x (not in the word)
  S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the feedback:

- The first letter is C (from both guesses).
- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).
- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:
  R, N, E (from first guess)
  L, M, S (from second guess)

So the word has:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A

And the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.

We also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it's in position 2, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.

What are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.

We need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.

Let's think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: 
  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don't need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet.

But we haven't tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.

So the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.

The tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.

So the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

And the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates of other letters.

Common words:

- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let's check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B's? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Other words:

- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don't know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven't tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C's? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.

But we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That's correct? So we would have:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: C -> we don't know? It might be correct or not?
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: I

But we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C's, then it's possible? Or if not, then we know.

But we have other options.

Another word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C's? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn't have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C's? And we are testing T and H.

But we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an 'x', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', and if correct, we get '✓'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it's okay.

But we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don't know if there is a second C? So it's worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:

- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.

But we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:
  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.

This tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Similarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

""CAULD"" is not common? 

""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.

""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.

""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let's see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.

""CAPIZ"": not common? 

""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don't know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T's? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x's? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it's okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.

Better to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?

But ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

But let me think of more common words: 

- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)
- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)
- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don't know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don't know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a '-' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don't care? We just need to find the correct letters.

But we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That's inefficient.

Therefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Another option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B's? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? 

""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.

Alternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? 

Or ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C's? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.

But we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn't? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it's a trade-off.

But I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.

""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.

So ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.

But let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.

We can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D's? So duplicate? 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? 

""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let's stick to more common words.

""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? 

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? 

How about ""CARTY""? Not common? 

""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? 

""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? 

Wait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? 

Another common word: ""CABIN"" no? 

""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? 

""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? 

""CAPUT"" is the best so far? 

Another word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? 

""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? 

""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAULD"" -> not common? 

""CAUKY"" -> not common? 

""CAUPS"" -> not common? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? 

But we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? 

No, we need 5 letters? 

Another word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? 

""CAPHS"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? 

But to maximize commonality, let's choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? 

But we are playing to get information? So let's do ""CATCH"": 

  C A T C H

We know:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)

Then:
  Position 3: T -> we test T
  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? 
  Position 5: H

So we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a '-' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a '-' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an 'x', then there is no duplicate? 

But we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? 

Whereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? 

So ""CAPUT"" is better? 

But let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? 

""CAPUT"" is one? 

""CAPOT"" is another? 

""CADGY"" -> not common? 

""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? 

""CAFIZ"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is more common? 

But to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? 

But I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? 

""CAVAT"" -> not a word? 

""CAVES"" invalid? 

""CAXON"" -> not common? 

I think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". 

But let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can't, but I'll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? 

But I recall that Wordle uses common words? 

Another word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? 

""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? 

So not? 

""CAPUT"" it is? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? 

""CAPON"" has N? 

""CAPUT"" is the best? 

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"". 

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters? 

""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? 

Yes? 

So guess: CAPUT

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We hope to get information about P, U, T? 

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? 

If we get a '-', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? 

If 'x', then not in the word? 

And we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don't have duplicates in this guess? 

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". 

<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: CALMS**  
  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  
  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
  - L, M, S are absent from the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must start with ""CA"".  
  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  
  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  
- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  
- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  
  - Why?  
    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  
    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  
    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).

Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don\'t know yet.\n   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.\n\n Let\'s think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Example words:\n   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven\'t ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.\n   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let\'s check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we also have two C\'s? The word ""cacti"" has two C\'s. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C\'s, that might be okay? But we don\'t know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don\'t have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.\n\n Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of other words:\n\n   ""CHAOS"": \n      Position 1: C -> good\n      Position 2: H -> unknown\n      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.\n\n The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:\n   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it\'s not at position 3.\n\n In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.\n\n How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?\n\n Let\'s try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.\n\n Common words:\n   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don\'t know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn\'t have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.\n\n However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.\n\n But let\'s try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.\n\n Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven\'t tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.\n\n Considering the available letters, let me think of:\n\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn\'t have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?\n\n How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as \'-\' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get \'-\' for A? Or if the word has two A\'s and one is at position 3? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don\'t know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got \'-\') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.\n\n So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn\'t give new information. So it\'s better to try A in a new position.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Proposed guess: ""CHASM""\n   C at 1 -> correct\n   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be \'-\' again? Or maybe it doesn\'t matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it\'s not? Only if there\'s no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn\'t tell us anything new.\n\n Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.\n\n ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.\n\n ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.\n\n So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don\'t know about L and I.\n\n Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.\n\n ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.\n\n ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.\n\n Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.\n\n But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.\n\n Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.\n\n How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don\'t know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don\'t know.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn\'t have R, N, E.\n\n Let me consider: \n   CACTI: \n      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.\n      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don\'t know.\n      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.\n\n And T and I are new letters.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?\n\n Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won\'t help? So we should avoid.\n\n How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.\n\n So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven\'t ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.\n\n Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn\'t get information about where it is? So it\'s better to include A to test new positions.\n\n So we want a word that:\n   - Starts with C\n   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)\n   - Avoids R, N, E\n   - Uses new common letters.\n\n Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.\n\n How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.\n\n ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can\'t use non-verified words? We must use English words.\n\n Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.\n\n How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it\'s not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.\n\n After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.\n\n But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s guess ""CACTI"".\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.\n\n Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?\n\n ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.\n\n Which word gives more information? \n   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.\n\n Both seem viable.\n\n Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let\'s compare:\n   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.\n\n Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.\n\n We also haven\'t tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CALMS"".\n\n Word: CALMS\n\n<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nWe know:\n- The word starts with C.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n- R, N, and E are absent.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with C.\n- Must include A (but avoid position 3).\n- Avoid R, N, E.\n- Test new common letters to maximize information.\n- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:\n  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.\n  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.\n  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).\n\n<guess>calms</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""calms""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  A: ✓ (correct position)\n  L: x (not in the word)\n  M: x (not in the word)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nNow, combining the feedback:\n\n- The first letter is C (from both guesses).\n- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).\n- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n\nAdditionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:\n  R, N, E (from first guess)\n  L, M, S (from second guess)\n\nSo the word has:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n\nAnd the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nWe also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s fixed.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nWhat are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nPossible letters for positions 3,4,5: \n  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don\'t need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know yet.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nSo the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nThe tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _\n\nAnd the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates of other letters.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let\'s check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B\'s? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don\'t know if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words that test more common letters.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don\'t know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven\'t tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C\'s? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.\n\nBut we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That\'s correct? So we would have:\n  Position 1: C (correct)\n  Position 2: A (correct)\n  Position 3: C -> we don\'t know? It might be correct or not?\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: I\n\nBut we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C\'s, then it\'s possible? Or if not, then we know.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nAnother word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C\'s? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn\'t have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C\'s? And we are testing T and H.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an \'x\', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get \'-\', and if correct, we get \'✓\'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don\'t know if there is a second C? So it\'s worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:\n\n- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.\n\nBut we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:\n  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.\n\nThis tests three new letters: P, U, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.\n\n""CAULD"" is not common? \n\n""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.\n\n""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let\'s see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.\n\n""CAPIZ"": not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don\'t know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T\'s? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x\'s? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it\'s okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.\n\nBetter to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?\n\nBut ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It\'s accepted in Wordle? I think so.\n\nBut let me think of more common words: \n\n- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)\n- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)\n- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don\'t know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don\'t know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a \'-\' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don\'t care? We just need to find the correct letters.\n\nBut we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That\'s inefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.\n\nAnother option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B\'s? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? \n\n""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CAPUT"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.\n\nAlternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? \n\nOr ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C\'s? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.\n\nBut we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn\'t? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.\n\nSo ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.\n\nWe can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? \n\n""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D\'s? So duplicate? \n\n""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? \n\nI think ""CAPUT"" is better.\n\nAnother option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? \n\n""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let\'s stick to more common words.\n\n""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? \n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? \n\nHow about ""CARTY""? Not common? \n\n""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? \n\n""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? \n\nWait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? \n\nAnother common word: ""CABIN"" no? \n\n""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? \n\n""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? \n\n""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? \n\nSo I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? \n\nBut let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? \n\n""CAPUT"" is the best so far? \n\nAnother word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? \n\n""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAULD"" -> not common? \n\n""CAUKY"" -> not common? \n\n""CAUPS"" -> not common? \n\nSo I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? \n\nBut we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? \n\nNo, we need 5 letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? \n\n""CAPHS"" -> not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? \n\nBut to maximize commonality, let\'s choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? \n\nBut we are playing to get information? So let\'s do ""CATCH"": \n\n  C A T C H\n\nWe know:\n  Position 1: C (correct)\n  Position 2: A (correct)\n\nThen:\n  Position 3: T -> we test T\n  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? \n  Position 5: H\n\nSo we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a \'-\' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a \'-\' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an \'x\', then there is no duplicate? \n\nBut we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? \n\nWhereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? \n\nSo ""CAPUT"" is better? \n\nBut let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? \n\n""CAPUT"" is one? \n\n""CAPOT"" is another? \n\n""CADGY"" -> not common? \n\n""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? \n\n""CAFIZ"" -> not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? \n\nI think ""CAPUT"" is more common? \n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? \n\nBut I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? \n\n""CAVAT"" -> not a word? \n\n""CAVES"" invalid? \n\n""CAXON"" -> not common? \n\nI think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". \n\nBut let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can\'t, but I\'ll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? \n\nBut I recall that Wordle uses common words? \n\nAnother word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? \n\n""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? \n\n""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? \n\nSo not? \n\n""CAPUT"" it is? \n\nBut let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? \n\n""CAPON"" has N? \n\n""CAPUT"" is the best? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CAPUT"". \n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters? \n\n""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? \n\nYes? \n\nSo guess: CAPUT\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nWe hope to get information about P, U, T? \n\nIf we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? \n\nIf we get a \'-\', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? \n\nIf \'x\', then not in the word? \n\nAnd we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don\'t have duplicates in this guess? \n\nSo it\'s good? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". \n\n<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - R, N, E are absent from the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: CALMS**  \n  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  \n  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  \n  - L, M, S are absent from the word.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Correct positions**:  \n  - Position 1: C  \n  - Position 2: A  \n- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  \n- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  \n- **Constraints**:  \n  - The word must start with ""CA"".  \n  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  \n  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  \n- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  \n- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  \n- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  \n  - Why?  \n    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  \n    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  \n    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  \n    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).\n\n<guess>caput</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: caput -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  R: x (not in the word) 
  A: - (in the word but not in position 3) 
  N: x (not in the word) 
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  L: x (not in the word) 
  M: x (not in the word) 
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  P: x (not in the word) 
  U: x (not in the word) 
  T: x (not in the word)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (from the x in the feedback)

So the word must start with ""CA"", and the remaining three positions (3,4,5) must not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

We know the word has the letter A? But wait, from the first guess we knew that A was in the word but not in position 3? But now we have position 2 as A? So that A is accounted for? And there is no indication of multiple A's? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? But we have to consider that possibility? 

Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A was in the word (via '-') but since we now know it was correctly placed at position 2 in the second guess, and we didn't get any additional indication of extra A's? So it might be that there is only one A? Or there could be more? But we don't have any information to suggest duplicates? So we proceed without knowing? 

But in the third guess ""caput"", we did not put any A apart from position 2? So we didn't test for another A? 

Now, we need to guess a word that starts with ""CA"", and the next three letters are from the remaining untested alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

List of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

So the absent letters are: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

What letters haven't been tested and are allowed? 

We have tested: 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
- From ""calms"": L, M, S (and confirmed C and A)
- From ""caput"": P, U, T

So tested and absent: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

Tested and present: C (position 1), A (position 2).

The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word starting with ""CA"" using only these letters? For positions 3,4,5.

Common words:

- ""CABBY"": C A B B Y -> uses B and Y? But B is allowed? Y is allowed? And we have two B's? That's acceptable? But ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver.

But note: we don't know if B or Y are in the word? We hope to test them? 

But wait, we are also testing for the possibility of duplicate B? 

Other words:

- ""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> uses D and Y? With duplicate D? 

- ""CAGED"": but E is forbidden? So invalid? 

- ""CAIRD"": not common? 

- ""CAJON"": uses J and O? J might be uncommon? But valid? Meaning a Peruvian box drum? 

But let's see more common options:

- ""CAFES"": has E and S? Forbidden? 

- ""CAGED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CAKED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N forbidden? 

- ""CAVIL"": L forbidden? 

- ""CAWED"": E forbidden? 

- ""CABOB"": not common? 

- ""CACKY"": not common? 

- ""CAFFS"": S forbidden? 

- ""CALFS"": L, S forbidden? 

So it's tricky? 

Another word: ""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> uses H, O, W? Avoids forbidden? 

""Cahow"" is a bird? Might be obscure? 

Another: ""CAIRD"": Scottish for a traveling tinker? Not common? 

""CAJON"": better? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

What about ""CALYX"": but L and S? L is absent? And S? Actually, ""calyx"" is C A L Y X -> L is absent? So invalid? 

""CANBY"" -> N forbidden? 

""CAPED"" -> P and E forbidden? 

""CAPOT"" -> P forbidden? We now know P is absent? So cannot use P? 

""CAPHS"" -> P and S forbidden? 

We must avoid P? Because guess 3 confirmed P is absent? 

Similarly, U and T are absent? 

So with the forbidden letters including P, U, T? So no? 

So back to: 

Let me list allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

Now, common words? 

- ""CABBY""?
- ""CADGY""? not common? 
- ""CAFIZ""? not common? 
- ""CAGOT""? but G and O? But we don't know if they are allowed? But avoid? Wait, not forbidden? 

""CAGOT"": a word for a Spanish outcast? Obscure? 

- ""CAHOW""? 

- ""CANDY"": N? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N? 

- ""CAJOLLO"": too long? 

5 letters only? 

""CAIRD""? 

""CAVED"": E forbidden? 

""CAWKS"": not common? 

""CAXON"": not common? 

Perhaps ""CABOB""? 

But ""caddy"" might work? ""Caddy"" as in golf? 

""CABIN"" is invalid? 

Another idea: ""CABIN"" is 5 letters? But has N? 

Wait, we have to avoid N? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAWED"" invalid? 

""CAYEN"": not common? 

""CAIRD"" might be acceptable? 

But let's look for words with vowels? We have A at position 2? So positions 3,4,5 can be consonants or vowels? 

Possible vowels? O, I? Remember, we know E is absent? So no E? 

Words: 

- ""CAVIE"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIO"": uses B and I and O? Avoids forbidden? So C A B I O? 

But we haven't used B before? Is that a word? ""Cabio"" is not common? 

- ""CABOB"" meaning shish kebab? Sometimes spelled ""kebab"" but ""cabob"" is a variant? 

But let's try to find everyday words: 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> meaning a container or in golf? 

""CADDY"" avoids forbidden? D and Y are allowed? But we have two D's? So we test D and Y? 

Similarly, ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? 

Other options: 

""CAJON"": if accepted, uses J, O? And N? Wait, ""cajon"" is C A J O N? But N is forbidden? So ""cajon"" has N? Invalid? 

Word ""cajon"": spelling? C-A-J-O-N? Yes, but N is forbidden? So we cannot use? 

""CAHOT"": not common? 

""CAKED"": E? 

We must avoid E? 

""CAKEN"": N and E? 

So few common words? 

Another possibility: ""CAMPO""? But M? Forbidden? We know M is absent? 

No, M is in the absent list? 

""CANOE"": N, E? Forbidden? 

Perhaps ""CABOC""? Not common? 

I think ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are the most common? 

So between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"": 

- ""CABBY"": tests B and Y? With two B's? 
- ""CADDY"": tests D and Y? With two D's? 

Both introduce two new letters? 

But we also want to test positions? 

We can choose which one? 

Let's look at the letters: 
- B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common consonants: B, D, H, O, Y? Vowels: O, I? 

But in 5-letter words starting with ""CA"", common words might be ""CABIN"" or ""CABAL""? But both have forbidden letters? 

Another word: ""CAFARD""? Too long? 

""CAIRD"": Scottish, meaning a piece of low ground? Might be accepted? But let's avoid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAVEMAN"" too long? 

Wait, 5 letters? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAVED"" is 5 letters? C A V E D -> but E is forbidden? So no? 

""CAVIE"": has E? 

So it seems like ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are candidates? 

But they have duplicate letters? So less efficient? But we have no choice? 

Another word without duplicates? 

For example, ""CABOY""? Not a word? 

""CADIZ"": but D, I, Z? Avoids? ""Cadiz"" is a place? But S is not used? If spelled ""Cadiz"", then C A D I Z? That's 4 letters? Wait, ""cadiz"" is C-A-D-I-Z? Five letters? 

""Cadiz"" is a proper noun? But Wordle sometimes allows? 

Unclear? 

""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> no repeats? And tests H, O, W? Three new letters? 

And ""cahow"" is a bird? I think it is acceptable? 

Similarly, ""CAJUN"": C A J U N? U and N? U is forbidden? We know U is absent? So invalid? 

""CAJUS""? not common? 

""CAJOLE"": too long? 

""CAHOW"" is a word? Let me confirm: cahow is a noun for a Bermuda petrel? But it might be in the dictionary? 

So if we can use it? 

Another: ""CAKIER""? too long? 

""CAKING"": K, I, G? But ""caking"" has E? No, ""caking"" is C A K I N G? Too long? 

5 letters: ""CAKIN""? Not common? 

""CAVEW""? not common? 

I think ""CAHOW"" is a valid choice? 

Since ""caput"" was accepted, ""cahow"" might be? 

Alternatively, ""CAVEW"" isn't a word? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

So I think I'll go with ""CAHOW"" because it tests three new distinct letters: H, O, W? And avoids duplicates? 

There is also ""CAVI"": not a word? 

""CAVID"": not common? 

Other try: ""CAFES"": invalid? 

So, guess ""CAHOW""? 

But note: We are not forced to include new letters? But that's the best way? 

If we don't, we might not find the word? 

So I choose ""CAHOW"". 

But let's double-check? 

Alternatively, ""CABBY"" is valid and common? And we test B and Y? 

Similarly, ""CADGY"" is not common? 

""CADGY"" means jesting? 

But Wordle might not include? 

Looking for common words, maybe ""CABBY"" is better? 

But I found ""CABOC"": Scottish for a fish? Not common? 

So i think ""CAHOW"" might be acceptable? 

But let's see the response? 

But to be safe, perhaps ""CABBY"" is better because it is more common? 

Or ""CADDY""? 

""CADDY"" is also common? 

Between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"", which has more common letters? 

Both are equally common? 

But since we have no info, either is fine? 

But we want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""CABBY"" uses B and Y? With two B's? 

""CADDY"" uses D and Y? With two D's? 

""CAHOW"" uses H, O, W? 

Since ""CAHOW"" tests three distinct letters, it's better? 

So i go with ""CAHOW"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed Positions**:
  - Position 1: `C`
  - Position 2: `A`
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Remaining Positions**: 3, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list and confirmed. Letters not yet tested include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word Structure**: The word starts with `CA`, followed by three letters from the untested set above.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word that tests multiple new common letters to gather maximum information for positions 3, 4, and 5.
- Avoid duplicates of `C` or `A` (though duplicates are possible if not explicitly ruled out).
- Given the constraints, ""CAHOW"" is selected:
  - Starts with `CA`.
  - Uses three distinct new letters: `H`, `O`, `W` (common and untested).
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T).
  - Valid English word (a type of seabird).

<guess>cahow</guess>",cahow,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  R: x (not in the word) 
  A: - (in the word but not in position 3) 
  N: x (not in the word) 
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  L: x (not in the word) 
  M: x (not in the word) 
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  P: x (not in the word) 
  U: x (not in the word) 
  T: x (not in the word)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (from the x in the feedback)

So the word must start with ""CA"", and the remaining three positions (3,4,5) must not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

We know the word has the letter A? But wait, from the first guess we knew that A was in the word but not in position 3? But now we have position 2 as A? So that A is accounted for? And there is no indication of multiple A's? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? But we have to consider that possibility? 

Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A was in the word (via '-') but since we now know it was correctly placed at position 2 in the second guess, and we didn't get any additional indication of extra A's? So it might be that there is only one A? Or there could be more? But we don't have any information to suggest duplicates? So we proceed without knowing? 

But in the third guess ""caput"", we did not put any A apart from position 2? So we didn't test for another A? 

Now, we need to guess a word that starts with ""CA"", and the next three letters are from the remaining untested alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

List of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

So the absent letters are: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

What letters haven't been tested and are allowed? 

We have tested: 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
- From ""calms"": L, M, S (and confirmed C and A)
- From ""caput"": P, U, T

So tested and absent: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

Tested and present: C (position 1), A (position 2).

The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word starting with ""CA"" using only these letters? For positions 3,4,5.

Common words:

- ""CABBY"": C A B B Y -> uses B and Y? But B is allowed? Y is allowed? And we have two B's? That's acceptable? But ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver.

But note: we don't know if B or Y are in the word? We hope to test them? 

But wait, we are also testing for the possibility of duplicate B? 

Other words:

- ""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> uses D and Y? With duplicate D? 

- ""CAGED"": but E is forbidden? So invalid? 

- ""CAIRD"": not common? 

- ""CAJON"": uses J and O? J might be uncommon? But valid? Meaning a Peruvian box drum? 

But let's see more common options:

- ""CAFES"": has E and S? Forbidden? 

- ""CAGED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CAKED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N forbidden? 

- ""CAVIL"": L forbidden? 

- ""CAWED"": E forbidden? 

- ""CABOB"": not common? 

- ""CACKY"": not common? 

- ""CAFFS"": S forbidden? 

- ""CALFS"": L, S forbidden? 

So it's tricky? 

Another word: ""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> uses H, O, W? Avoids forbidden? 

""Cahow"" is a bird? Might be obscure? 

Another: ""CAIRD"": Scottish for a traveling tinker? Not common? 

""CAJON"": better? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

What about ""CALYX"": but L and S? L is absent? And S? Actually, ""calyx"" is C A L Y X -> L is absent? So invalid? 

""CANBY"" -> N forbidden? 

""CAPED"" -> P and E forbidden? 

""CAPOT"" -> P forbidden? We now know P is absent? So cannot use P? 

""CAPHS"" -> P and S forbidden? 

We must avoid P? Because guess 3 confirmed P is absent? 

Similarly, U and T are absent? 

So with the forbidden letters including P, U, T? So no? 

So back to: 

Let me list allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

Now, common words? 

- ""CABBY""?
- ""CADGY""? not common? 
- ""CAFIZ""? not common? 
- ""CAGOT""? but G and O? But we don't know if they are allowed? But avoid? Wait, not forbidden? 

""CAGOT"": a word for a Spanish outcast? Obscure? 

- ""CAHOW""? 

- ""CANDY"": N? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N? 

- ""CAJOLLO"": too long? 

5 letters only? 

""CAIRD""? 

""CAVED"": E forbidden? 

""CAWKS"": not common? 

""CAXON"": not common? 

Perhaps ""CABOB""? 

But ""caddy"" might work? ""Caddy"" as in golf? 

""CABIN"" is invalid? 

Another idea: ""CABIN"" is 5 letters? But has N? 

Wait, we have to avoid N? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAWED"" invalid? 

""CAYEN"": not common? 

""CAIRD"" might be acceptable? 

But let's look for words with vowels? We have A at position 2? So positions 3,4,5 can be consonants or vowels? 

Possible vowels? O, I? Remember, we know E is absent? So no E? 

Words: 

- ""CAVIE"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIO"": uses B and I and O? Avoids forbidden? So C A B I O? 

But we haven't used B before? Is that a word? ""Cabio"" is not common? 

- ""CABOB"" meaning shish kebab? Sometimes spelled ""kebab"" but ""cabob"" is a variant? 

But let's try to find everyday words: 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> meaning a container or in golf? 

""CADDY"" avoids forbidden? D and Y are allowed? But we have two D's? So we test D and Y? 

Similarly, ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? 

Other options: 

""CAJON"": if accepted, uses J, O? And N? Wait, ""cajon"" is C A J O N? But N is forbidden? So ""cajon"" has N? Invalid? 

Word ""cajon"": spelling? C-A-J-O-N? Yes, but N is forbidden? So we cannot use? 

""CAHOT"": not common? 

""CAKED"": E? 

We must avoid E? 

""CAKEN"": N and E? 

So few common words? 

Another possibility: ""CAMPO""? But M? Forbidden? We know M is absent? 

No, M is in the absent list? 

""CANOE"": N, E? Forbidden? 

Perhaps ""CABOC""? Not common? 

I think ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are the most common? 

So between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"": 

- ""CABBY"": tests B and Y? With two B's? 
- ""CADDY"": tests D and Y? With two D's? 

Both introduce two new letters? 

But we also want to test positions? 

We can choose which one? 

Let's look at the letters: 
- B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common consonants: B, D, H, O, Y? Vowels: O, I? 

But in 5-letter words starting with ""CA"", common words might be ""CABIN"" or ""CABAL""? But both have forbidden letters? 

Another word: ""CAFARD""? Too long? 

""CAIRD"": Scottish, meaning a piece of low ground? Might be accepted? But let's avoid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAVEMAN"" too long? 

Wait, 5 letters? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAVED"" is 5 letters? C A V E D -> but E is forbidden? So no? 

""CAVIE"": has E? 

So it seems like ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are candidates? 

But they have duplicate letters? So less efficient? But we have no choice? 

Another word without duplicates? 

For example, ""CABOY""? Not a word? 

""CADIZ"": but D, I, Z? Avoids? ""Cadiz"" is a place? But S is not used? If spelled ""Cadiz"", then C A D I Z? That's 4 letters? Wait, ""cadiz"" is C-A-D-I-Z? Five letters? 

""Cadiz"" is a proper noun? But Wordle sometimes allows? 

Unclear? 

""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> no repeats? And tests H, O, W? Three new letters? 

And ""cahow"" is a bird? I think it is acceptable? 

Similarly, ""CAJUN"": C A J U N? U and N? U is forbidden? We know U is absent? So invalid? 

""CAJUS""? not common? 

""CAJOLE"": too long? 

""CAHOW"" is a word? Let me confirm: cahow is a noun for a Bermuda petrel? But it might be in the dictionary? 

So if we can use it? 

Another: ""CAKIER""? too long? 

""CAKING"": K, I, G? But ""caking"" has E? No, ""caking"" is C A K I N G? Too long? 

5 letters: ""CAKIN""? Not common? 

""CAVEW""? not common? 

I think ""CAHOW"" is a valid choice? 

Since ""caput"" was accepted, ""cahow"" might be? 

Alternatively, ""CAVEW"" isn't a word? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

So I think I'll go with ""CAHOW"" because it tests three new distinct letters: H, O, W? And avoids duplicates? 

There is also ""CAVI"": not a word? 

""CAVID"": not common? 

Other try: ""CAFES"": invalid? 

So, guess ""CAHOW""? 

But note: We are not forced to include new letters? But that's the best way? 

If we don't, we might not find the word? 

So I choose ""CAHOW"". 

But let's double-check? 

Alternatively, ""CABBY"" is valid and common? And we test B and Y? 

Similarly, ""CADGY"" is not common? 

""CADGY"" means jesting? 

But Wordle might not include? 

Looking for common words, maybe ""CABBY"" is better? 

But I found ""CABOC"": Scottish for a fish? Not common?

So i go with ""CAHOW"". 

<guess>cahow</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Current Knowledge:

  - Position 1: `C`
  - Position 2: `A`
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (cannot appear anywhere).

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
   C: ✓ (correct position)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word but wrong position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - C in the first position (because it's marked correct).
   - The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we had it in ""crane"").
   - The letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   Position 1: C
   The word does not contain R, N, E.
   The word does contain A, but not in position 3.

 Since the word has C at the start, and A is present but not at position 3, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using R, N, E.

 What letters can we use?
   Vowels: We have A (which we know is in the word). Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don't know yet.
   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven't ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.
   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let's check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.

 However, we also have two C's? The word ""cacti"" has two C's. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C's, that might be okay? But we don't know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don't have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.

 Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don't know about other positions.

 Alternatively, let's think of other words:

   ""CHAOS"": 
      Position 1: C -> good
      Position 2: H -> unknown
      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.

 The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:
   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it's not at position 3.

 In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.

 How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?

 Let's try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.

 Common words:
   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don't know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn't have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.

 Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.

 But let's try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.

 Considering the available letters, let me think of:

   Position 1: C
   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn't have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?

 How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as '-' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get '-' for A? Or if the word has two A's and one is at position 3? But we don't know.

 However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don't know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got '-') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.

 So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn't give new information. So it's better to try A in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

 Proposed guess: ""CHASM""
   C at 1 -> correct
   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be '-' again? Or maybe it doesn't matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it's not? Only if there's no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn't tell us anything new.

 Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.

 ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.

 ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.

 So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don't know about L and I.

 Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.

 ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.

 ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.

 Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven't eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.

 How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.

 How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.

 How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don't know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don't know.

 So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn't have R, N, E.

 Let me consider: 
   CACTI: 
      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.
      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don't know.
      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.

 And T and I are new letters.

 So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, let's think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?

 Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won't help? So we should avoid.

 How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.

 So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven't ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.

 Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn't get information about where it is? So it's better to include A to test new positions.

 So we want a word that:
   - Starts with C
   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)
   - Avoids R, N, E
   - Uses new common letters.

 Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don't know.

 Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.

 How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.

 ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can't use non-verified words? We must use English words.

 Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.

 How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.

 How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it's not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.

 After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.

 But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.

 Let's guess ""CACTI"".

 Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.

 Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?

 ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.

 Which word gives more information? 
   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.
   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.

 Both seem viable.

 Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let's compare:
   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.
   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.

 Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.

 We also haven't tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.

 So I'll go with ""CALMS"".

 Word: CALMS

<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

We know:
- The word starts with C.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A (but avoid position 3).
- Avoid R, N, E.
- Test new common letters to maximize information.
- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:
  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.
  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.
  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).

<guess>calms</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  M: x (not in the word)
  S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the feedback:

- The first letter is C (from both guesses).
- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).
- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:
  R, N, E (from first guess)
  L, M, S (from second guess)

So the word has:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A

And the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.

We also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it's in position 2, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.

What are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.

We need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.

Let's think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: 
  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don't need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet.

But we haven't tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.

So the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.

The tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.

So the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

And the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates of other letters.

Common words:

- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let's check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B's? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Other words:

- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don't know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven't tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C's? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.

But we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That's correct? So we would have:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: C -> we don't know? It might be correct or not?
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: I

But we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C's, then it's possible? Or if not, then we know.

But we have other options.

Another word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C's? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn't have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C's? And we are testing T and H.

But we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an 'x', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', and if correct, we get '✓'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it's okay.

But we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don't know if there is a second C? So it's worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:

- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.

But we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:
  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.

This tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Similarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

""CAULD"" is not common? 

""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.

""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.

""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let's see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.

""CAPIZ"": not common? 

""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don't know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T's? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x's? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it's okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.

Better to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?

But ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

But let me think of more common words: 

- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)
- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)
- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don't know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don't know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a '-' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don't care? We just need to find the correct letters.

But we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That's inefficient.

Therefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Another option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B's? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? 

""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.

Alternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? 

Or ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C's? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.

But we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn't? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it's a trade-off.

But I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.

""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.

So ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.

But let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.

We can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D's? So duplicate? 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? 

""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let's stick to more common words.

""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? 

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? 

How about ""CARTY""? Not common? 

""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? 

""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? 

Wait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? 

Another common word: ""CABIN"" no? 

""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? 

""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? 

""CAPUT"" is the best so far? 

Another word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? 

""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? 

""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAULD"" -> not common? 

""CAUKY"" -> not common? 

""CAUPS"" -> not common? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? 

But we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? 

No, we need 5 letters? 

Another word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? 

""CAPHS"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? 

But to maximize commonality, let's choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? 

But we are playing to get information? So let's do ""CATCH"": 

  C A T C H

We know:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)

Then:
  Position 3: T -> we test T
  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? 
  Position 5: H

So we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a '-' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a '-' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an 'x', then there is no duplicate? 

But we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? 

Whereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? 

So ""CAPUT"" is better? 

But let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? 

""CAPUT"" is one? 

""CAPOT"" is another? 

""CADGY"" -> not common? 

""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? 

""CAFIZ"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is more common? 

But to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? 

But I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? 

""CAVAT"" -> not a word? 

""CAVES"" invalid? 

""CAXON"" -> not common? 

I think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". 

But let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can't, but I'll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? 

But I recall that Wordle uses common words? 

Another word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? 

""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? 

So not? 

""CAPUT"" it is? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? 

""CAPON"" has N? 

""CAPUT"" is the best? 

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"". 

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters? 

""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? 

Yes? 

So guess: CAPUT

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We hope to get information about P, U, T? 

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? 

If we get a '-', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? 

If 'x', then not in the word? 

And we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don't have duplicates in this guess? 

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". 

<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: CALMS**  
  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  
  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
  - L, M, S are absent from the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must start with ""CA"".  
  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  
  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  
- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  
- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  
  - Why?  
    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  
    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  
    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).

<guess>caput</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)
Guess 3: caput -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  R: x (not in the word) 
  A: - (in the word but not in position 3) 
  N: x (not in the word) 
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  L: x (not in the word) 
  M: x (not in the word) 
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  P: x (not in the word) 
  U: x (not in the word) 
  T: x (not in the word)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (from the x in the feedback)

So the word must start with ""CA"", and the remaining three positions (3,4,5) must not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

We know the word has the letter A? But wait, from the first guess we knew that A was in the word but not in position 3? But now we have position 2 as A? So that A is accounted for? And there is no indication of multiple A's? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? But we have to consider that possibility? 

Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A was in the word (via '-') but since we now know it was correctly placed at position 2 in the second guess, and we didn't get any additional indication of extra A's? So it might be that there is only one A? Or there could be more? But we don't have any information to suggest duplicates? So we proceed without knowing? 

But in the third guess ""caput"", we did not put any A apart from position 2? So we didn't test for another A? 

Now, we need to guess a word that starts with ""CA"", and the next three letters are from the remaining untested alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

List of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

So the absent letters are: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

What letters haven't been tested and are allowed? 

We have tested: 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
- From ""calms"": L, M, S (and confirmed C and A)
- From ""caput"": P, U, T

So tested and absent: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

Tested and present: C (position 1), A (position 2).

The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word starting with ""CA"" using only these letters? For positions 3,4,5.

Common words:

- ""CABBY"": C A B B Y -> uses B and Y? But B is allowed? Y is allowed? And we have two B's? That's acceptable? But ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver.

But note: we don't know if B or Y are in the word? We hope to test them? 

But wait, we are also testing for the possibility of duplicate B? 

Other words:

- ""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> uses D and Y? With duplicate D? 

- ""CAGED"": but E is forbidden? So invalid? 

- ""CAIRD"": not common? 

- ""CAJON"": uses J and O? J might be uncommon? But valid? Meaning a Peruvian box drum? 

But let's see more common options:

- ""CAFES"": has E and S? Forbidden? 

- ""CAGED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CAKED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N forbidden? 

- ""CAVIL"": L forbidden? 

- ""CAWED"": E forbidden? 

- ""CABOB"": not common? 

- ""CACKY"": not common? 

- ""CAFFS"": S forbidden? 

- ""CALFS"": L, S forbidden? 

So it's tricky? 

Another word: ""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> uses H, O, W? Avoids forbidden? 

""Cahow"" is a bird? Might be obscure? 

Another: ""CAIRD"": Scottish for a traveling tinker? Not common? 

""CAJON"": better? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

What about ""CALYX"": but L and S? L is absent? And S? Actually, ""calyx"" is C A L Y X -> L is absent? So invalid? 

""CANBY"" -> N forbidden? 

""CAPED"" -> P and E forbidden? 

""CAPOT"" -> P forbidden? We now know P is absent? So cannot use P? 

""CAPHS"" -> P and S forbidden? 

We must avoid P? Because guess 3 confirmed P is absent? 

Similarly, U and T are absent? 

So with the forbidden letters including P, U, T? So no? 

So back to: 

Let me list allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

Now, common words? 

- ""CABBY""?
- ""CADGY""? not common? 
- ""CAFIZ""? not common? 
- ""CAGOT""? but G and O? But we don't know if they are allowed? But avoid? Wait, not forbidden? 

""CAGOT"": a word for a Spanish outcast? Obscure? 

- ""CAHOW""? 

- ""CANDY"": N? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N? 

- ""CAJOLLO"": too long? 

5 letters only? 

""CAIRD""? 

""CAVED"": E forbidden? 

""CAWKS"": not common? 

""CAXON"": not common? 

Perhaps ""CABOB""? 

But ""caddy"" might work? ""Caddy"" as in golf? 

""CABIN"" is invalid? 

Another idea: ""CABIN"" is 5 letters? But has N? 

Wait, we have to avoid N? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAWED"" invalid? 

""CAYEN"": not common? 

""CAIRD"" might be acceptable? 

But let's look for words with vowels? We have A at position 2? So positions 3,4,5 can be consonants or vowels? 

Possible vowels? O, I? Remember, we know E is absent? So no E? 

Words: 

- ""CAVIE"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIO"": uses B and I and O? Avoids forbidden? So C A B I O? 

But we haven't used B before? Is that a word? ""Cabio"" is not common? 

- ""CABOB"" meaning shish kebab? Sometimes spelled ""kebab"" but ""cabob"" is a variant? 

But let's try to find everyday words: 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> meaning a container or in golf? 

""CADDY"" avoids forbidden? D and Y are allowed? But we have two D's? So we test D and Y? 

Similarly, ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? 

Other options: 

""CAJON"": if accepted, uses J, O? And N? Wait, ""cajon"" is C A J O N? But N is forbidden? So ""cajon"" has N? Invalid? 

Word ""cajon"": spelling? C-A-J-O-N? Yes, but N is forbidden? So we cannot use? 

""CAHOT"": not common? 

""CAKED"": E? 

We must avoid E? 

""CAKEN"": N and E? 

So few common words? 

Another possibility: ""CAMPO""? But M? Forbidden? We know M is absent? 

No, M is in the absent list? 

""CANOE"": N, E? Forbidden? 

Perhaps ""CABOC""? Not common? 

I think ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are the most common? 

So between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"": 

- ""CABBY"": tests B and Y? With two B's? 
- ""CADDY"": tests D and Y? With two D's? 

Both introduce two new letters? 

But we also want to test positions? 

We can choose which one? 

Let's look at the letters: 
- B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common consonants: B, D, H, O, Y? Vowels: O, I? 

But in 5-letter words starting with ""CA"", common words might be ""CABIN"" or ""CABAL""? But both have forbidden letters? 

Another word: ""CAFARD""? Too long? 

""CAIRD"": Scottish, meaning a piece of low ground? Might be accepted? But let's avoid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAVEMAN"" too long? 

Wait, 5 letters? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAVED"" is 5 letters? C A V E D -> but E is forbidden? So no? 

""CAVIE"": has E? 

So it seems like ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are candidates? 

But they have duplicate letters? So less efficient? But we have no choice? 

Another word without duplicates? 

For example, ""CABOY""? Not a word? 

""CADIZ"": but D, I, Z? Avoids? ""Cadiz"" is a place? But S is not used? If spelled ""Cadiz"", then C A D I Z? That's 4 letters? Wait, ""cadiz"" is C-A-D-I-Z? Five letters? 

""Cadiz"" is a proper noun? But Wordle sometimes allows? 

Unclear? 

""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> no repeats? And tests H, O, W? Three new letters? 

And ""cahow"" is a bird? I think it is acceptable? 

Similarly, ""CAJUN"": C A J U N? U and N? U is forbidden? We know U is absent? So invalid? 

""CAJUS""? not common? 

""CAJOLE"": too long? 

""CAHOW"" is a word? Let me confirm: cahow is a noun for a Bermuda petrel? But it might be in the dictionary? 

So if we can use it? 

Another: ""CAKIER""? too long? 

""CAKING"": K, I, G? But ""caking"" has E? No, ""caking"" is C A K I N G? Too long? 

5 letters: ""CAKIN""? Not common? 

""CAVEW""? not common? 

I think ""CAHOW"" is a valid choice? 

Since ""caput"" was accepted, ""cahow"" might be? 

Alternatively, ""CAVEW"" isn't a word? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

So I think I'll go with ""CAHOW"" because it tests three new distinct letters: H, O, W? And avoids duplicates? 

There is also ""CAVI"": not a word? 

""CAVID"": not common? 

Other try: ""CAFES"": invalid? 

So, guess ""CAHOW""? 

But note: We are not forced to include new letters? But that's the best way? 

If we don't, we might not find the word? 

So I choose ""CAHOW"". 

But let's double-check? 

Alternatively, ""CABBY"" is valid and common? And we test B and Y? 

Similarly, ""CADGY"" is not common? 

""CADGY"" means jesting? 

But Wordle might not include? 

Looking for common words, maybe ""CABBY"" is better? 

But I found ""CABOC"": Scottish for a fish? Not common? 

So i think ""CAHOW"" might be acceptable? 

But let's see the response? 

But to be safe, perhaps ""CABBY"" is better because it is more common? 

Or ""CADDY""? 

""CADDY"" is also common? 

Between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"", which has more common letters? 

Both are equally common? 

But since we have no info, either is fine? 

But we want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""CABBY"" uses B and Y? With two B's? 

""CADDY"" uses D and Y? With two D's? 

""CAHOW"" uses H, O, W? 

Since ""CAHOW"" tests three distinct letters, it's better? 

So i go with ""CAHOW"". 

<guess>cahow</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed Positions**:
  - Position 1: `C`
  - Position 2: `A`
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Remaining Positions**: 3, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list and confirmed. Letters not yet tested include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word Structure**: The word starts with `CA`, followed by three letters from the untested set above.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word that tests multiple new common letters to gather maximum information for positions 3, 4, and 5.
- Avoid duplicates of `C` or `A` (though duplicates are possible if not explicitly ruled out).
- Given the constraints, ""CAHOW"" is selected:
  - Starts with `CA`.
  - Uses three distinct new letters: `H`, `O`, `W` (common and untested).
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T).
  - Valid English word (a type of seabird).

Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don\'t know yet.\n   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.\n\n Let\'s think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Example words:\n   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven\'t ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.\n   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let\'s check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we also have two C\'s? The word ""cacti"" has two C\'s. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C\'s, that might be okay? But we don\'t know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don\'t have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.\n\n Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of other words:\n\n   ""CHAOS"": \n      Position 1: C -> good\n      Position 2: H -> unknown\n      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.\n\n The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:\n   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it\'s not at position 3.\n\n In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.\n\n How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?\n\n Let\'s try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.\n\n Common words:\n   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don\'t know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn\'t have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.\n\n However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.\n\n But let\'s try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.\n\n Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven\'t tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.\n\n Considering the available letters, let me think of:\n\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn\'t have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?\n\n How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as \'-\' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get \'-\' for A? Or if the word has two A\'s and one is at position 3? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don\'t know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got \'-\') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.\n\n So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn\'t give new information. So it\'s better to try A in a new position.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Proposed guess: ""CHASM""\n   C at 1 -> correct\n   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be \'-\' again? Or maybe it doesn\'t matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it\'s not? Only if there\'s no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn\'t tell us anything new.\n\n Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.\n\n ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.\n\n ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.\n\n So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don\'t know about L and I.\n\n Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.\n\n ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.\n\n ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.\n\n Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.\n\n But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.\n\n Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.\n\n How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don\'t know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don\'t know.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn\'t have R, N, E.\n\n Let me consider: \n   CACTI: \n      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.\n      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don\'t know.\n      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.\n\n And T and I are new letters.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?\n\n Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won\'t help? So we should avoid.\n\n How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.\n\n So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven\'t ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.\n\n Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn\'t get information about where it is? So it\'s better to include A to test new positions.\n\n So we want a word that:\n   - Starts with C\n   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)\n   - Avoids R, N, E\n   - Uses new common letters.\n\n Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.\n\n How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.\n\n ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can\'t use non-verified words? We must use English words.\n\n Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.\n\n How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it\'s not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.\n\n After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.\n\n But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s guess ""CACTI"".\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.\n\n Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?\n\n ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.\n\n Which word gives more information? \n   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.\n\n Both seem viable.\n\n Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let\'s compare:\n   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.\n\n Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.\n\n We also haven\'t tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CALMS"".\n\n Word: CALMS\n\n<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nWe know:\n- The word starts with C.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n- R, N, and E are absent.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with C.\n- Must include A (but avoid position 3).\n- Avoid R, N, E.\n- Test new common letters to maximize information.\n- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:\n  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.\n  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.\n  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).\n\n<guess>calms</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""calms""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  A: ✓ (correct position)\n  L: x (not in the word)\n  M: x (not in the word)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nNow, combining the feedback:\n\n- The first letter is C (from both guesses).\n- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).\n- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n\nAdditionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:\n  R, N, E (from first guess)\n  L, M, S (from second guess)\n\nSo the word has:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n\nAnd the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nWe also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s fixed.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nWhat are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nPossible letters for positions 3,4,5: \n  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don\'t need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know yet.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nSo the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nThe tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _\n\nAnd the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates of other letters.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let\'s check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B\'s? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don\'t know if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words that test more common letters.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don\'t know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven\'t tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C\'s? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.\n\nBut we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That\'s correct? So we would have:\n  Position 1: C (correct)\n  Position 2: A (correct)\n  Position 3: C -> we don\'t know? It might be correct or not?\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: I\n\nBut we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C\'s, then it\'s possible? Or if not, then we know.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nAnother word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C\'s? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn\'t have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C\'s? And we are testing T and H.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an \'x\', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get \'-\', and if correct, we get \'✓\'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don\'t know if there is a second C? So it\'s worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:\n\n- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.\n\nBut we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:\n  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.\n\nThis tests three new letters: P, U, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.\n\n""CAULD"" is not common? \n\n""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.\n\n""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let\'s see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.\n\n""CAPIZ"": not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don\'t know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T\'s? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x\'s? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it\'s okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.\n\nBetter to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?\n\nBut ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It\'s accepted in Wordle? I think so.\n\nBut let me think of more common words: \n\n- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)\n- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)\n- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don\'t know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don\'t know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a \'-\' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don\'t care? We just need to find the correct letters.\n\nBut we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That\'s inefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.\n\nAnother option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B\'s? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? \n\n""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CAPUT"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.\n\nAlternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? \n\nOr ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C\'s? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.\n\nBut we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn\'t? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.\n\nSo ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.\n\nWe can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? \n\n""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D\'s? So duplicate? \n\n""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? \n\nI think ""CAPUT"" is better.\n\nAnother option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? \n\n""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let\'s stick to more common words.\n\n""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? \n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? \n\nHow about ""CARTY""? Not common? \n\n""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? \n\n""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? \n\nWait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? \n\nAnother common word: ""CABIN"" no? \n\n""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? \n\n""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? \n\n""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? \n\nSo I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? \n\nBut let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? \n\n""CAPUT"" is the best so far? \n\nAnother word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? \n\n""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAULD"" -> not common? \n\n""CAUKY"" -> not common? \n\n""CAUPS"" -> not common? \n\nSo I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? \n\nBut we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? \n\nNo, we need 5 letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? \n\n""CAPHS"" -> not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? \n\nBut to maximize commonality, let\'s choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? \n\nBut we are playing to get information? So let\'s do ""CATCH"": \n\n  C A T C H\n\nWe know:\n  Position 1: C (correct)\n  Position 2: A (correct)\n\nThen:\n  Position 3: T -> we test T\n  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? \n  Position 5: H\n\nSo we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a \'-\' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a \'-\' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an \'x\', then there is no duplicate? \n\nBut we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? \n\nWhereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? \n\nSo ""CAPUT"" is better? \n\nBut let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? \n\n""CAPUT"" is one? \n\n""CAPOT"" is another? \n\n""CADGY"" -> not common? \n\n""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? \n\n""CAFIZ"" -> not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? \n\nI think ""CAPUT"" is more common? \n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? \n\nBut I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? \n\n""CAVAT"" -> not a word? \n\n""CAVES"" invalid? \n\n""CAXON"" -> not common? \n\nI think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". \n\nBut let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can\'t, but I\'ll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? \n\nBut I recall that Wordle uses common words? \n\nAnother word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? \n\n""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? \n\n""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? \n\nSo not? \n\n""CAPUT"" it is? \n\nBut let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? \n\n""CAPON"" has N? \n\n""CAPUT"" is the best? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CAPUT"". \n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters? \n\n""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? \n\nYes? \n\nSo guess: CAPUT\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nWe hope to get information about P, U, T? \n\nIf we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? \n\nIf we get a \'-\', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? \n\nIf \'x\', then not in the word? \n\nAnd we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don\'t have duplicates in this guess? \n\nSo it\'s good? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". \n\n<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - R, N, E are absent from the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: CALMS**  \n  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  \n  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  \n  - L, M, S are absent from the word.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Correct positions**:  \n  - Position 1: C  \n  - Position 2: A  \n- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  \n- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  \n- **Constraints**:  \n  - The word must start with ""CA"".  \n  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  \n  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  \n- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  \n- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  \n- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  \n  - Why?  \n    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  \n    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  \n    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  \n    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).\n\n<guess>caput</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: caput -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> \n  C: ✓ (correct position) \n  R: x (not in the word) \n  A: - (in the word but not in position 3) \n  N: x (not in the word) \n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""calms"" -> \n  C: ✓ (correct position) \n  A: ✓ (correct position) \n  L: x (not in the word) \n  M: x (not in the word) \n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""caput"" -> \n  C: ✓ (correct position) \n  A: ✓ (correct position) \n  P: x (not in the word) \n  U: x (not in the word) \n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nCombining the feedback:\n\n- Position 1: C (confirmed)\n- Position 2: A (confirmed)\n- Absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (from the x in the feedback)\n\nSo the word must start with ""CA"", and the remaining three positions (3,4,5) must not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nWe know the word has the letter A? But wait, from the first guess we knew that A was in the word but not in position 3? But now we have position 2 as A? So that A is accounted for? And there is no indication of multiple A\'s? So we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s? But we have to consider that possibility? \n\nActually, the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A was in the word (via \'-\') but since we now know it was correctly placed at position 2 in the second guess, and we didn\'t get any additional indication of extra A\'s? So it might be that there is only one A? Or there could be more? But we don\'t have any information to suggest duplicates? So we proceed without knowing? \n\nBut in the third guess ""caput"", we did not put any A apart from position 2? So we didn\'t test for another A? \n\nNow, we need to guess a word that starts with ""CA"", and the next three letters are from the remaining untested alphabet, excluding the absent letters.\n\nList of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nSo the absent letters are: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nWhat letters haven\'t been tested and are allowed? \n\nWe have tested: \n- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E\n- From ""calms"": L, M, S (and confirmed C and A)\n- From ""caput"": P, U, T\n\nSo tested and absent: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nTested and present: C (position 1), A (position 2).\n\nThe remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word starting with ""CA"" using only these letters? For positions 3,4,5.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""CABBY"": C A B B Y -> uses B and Y? But B is allowed? Y is allowed? And we have two B\'s? That\'s acceptable? But ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if B or Y are in the word? We hope to test them? \n\nBut wait, we are also testing for the possibility of duplicate B? \n\nOther words:\n\n- ""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> uses D and Y? With duplicate D? \n\n- ""CAGED"": but E is forbidden? So invalid? \n\n- ""CAIRD"": not common? \n\n- ""CAJON"": uses J and O? J might be uncommon? But valid? Meaning a Peruvian box drum? \n\nBut let\'s see more common options:\n\n- ""CAFES"": has E and S? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CAGED"": E? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CAKED"": E? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CABIN"": N forbidden? \n\n- ""CAVIL"": L forbidden? \n\n- ""CAWED"": E forbidden? \n\n- ""CABOB"": not common? \n\n- ""CACKY"": not common? \n\n- ""CAFFS"": S forbidden? \n\n- ""CALFS"": L, S forbidden? \n\nSo it\'s tricky? \n\nAnother word: ""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> uses H, O, W?

Not common? \n\n""CAJON"": better? \n\n""CAKED"" has E? \n\nWhat about ""CALYX"": but L and S? L is absent? And S? Actually, ""calyx"" is C A L Y X -> L is absent? So invalid? \n\n""CANBY"" -> N forbidden? \n\n""CAPED"" -> P and E forbidden? \n\n""CAPOT"" -> P forbidden? We now know P is absent? So cannot use P? \n\n""CAPHS"" -> P and S forbidden? \n\nWe must avoid P? Because guess 3 confirmed P is absent? \n\nSimilarly, U and T are absent? \n\nSo with the forbidden letters including P, U, T? So no? \n\nSo back to: \n\nLet me list allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _\n\nNow, common words? \n\n- ""CABBY""?\n- ""CADGY""? not common? \n- ""CAFIZ""? not common? \n- ""CAGOT""? but G and O? But we don\'t know if they are allowed? But avoid? Wait, not forbidden? \n\n""CAGOT"": a word for a Spanish outcast? Obscure? \n\n- ""CAHOW""? \n\n- ""CANDY"": N? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CABIN"": N? \n\n- ""CAJOLLO"": too long? \n\n5 letters only? \n\n""CAIRD""? \n\n""CAVED"": E forbidden? \n\n""CAWKS"": not common? \n\n""CAXON"": not common? \n\nPerhaps ""CABOB""? \n\nBut ""caddy"" might work? ""Caddy"" as in golf? \n\n""CABIN"" is invalid? \n\nAnother idea: ""CABIN"" is 5 letters? But has N? \n\nWait, we have to avoid N? \n\n""CAVED"" invalid? \n\n""CAVIL"" invalid? \n\n""CAWED"" invalid? \n\n""CAYEN"": not common? \n\n""CAIRD"" might be acceptable? \n\nBut let\'s look for words with vowels? We have A at position 2? So positions 3,4,5 can be consonants or vowels? \n\nPossible vowels? O, I? Remember, we know E is absent? So no E? \n\nWords: \n\n- ""CAVIE"": E? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CABIO"": uses B and I and O? Avoids forbidden? So C A B I O? \n\nBut we haven\'t used B before? Is that a word? ""Cabio"" is not common? \n\n- ""CABOB"" meaning shish kebab? Sometimes spelled ""kebab"" but ""cabob"" is a variant? \n\nBut let\'s try to find everyday words: \n\n""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> meaning a container or in golf? \n\n""CADDY"" avoids forbidden? D and Y are allowed? But we have two D\'s? So we test D and Y? \n\nSimilarly, ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? \n\nOther options: \n\n""CAJON"": if accepted, uses J, O? And N? Wait, ""cajon"" is C A J O N? But N is forbidden? So ""cajon"" has N? Invalid? \n\nWord ""cajon"": spelling? C-A-J-O-N? Yes, but N is forbidden? So we cannot use? \n\n""CAHOT"": not common? \n\n""CAKED"": E? \n\nWe must avoid E? \n\n""CAKEN"": N and E? \n\nSo few common words? \n\nAnother possibility: ""CAMPO""? But M? Forbidden? We know M is absent? \n\nNo, M is in the absent list? \n\n""CANOE"": N, E? Forbidden? \n\nPerhaps ""CABOC""? Not common? \n\nI think ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are the most common? \n\nSo between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"": \n\n- ""CABBY"": tests B and Y? With two B\'s? \n- ""CADDY"": tests D and Y? With two D\'s? \n\nBoth introduce two new letters? \n\nBut we also want to test positions? \n\nWe can choose which one? \n\nLet\'s look at the letters: \n- B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nCommon consonants: B, D, H, O, Y? Vowels: O, I? \n\nBut in 5-letter words starting with ""CA"", common words might be ""CABIN"" or ""CABAL""? But both have forbidden letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CAFARD""? Too long? \n\n""CAIRD"": Scottish, meaning a piece of low ground? Might be accepted? But let\'s avoid? \n\n""CAVIL"" invalid? \n\n""CAVEMAN"" too long? \n\nWait, 5 letters? \n\n""CAVED"" invalid? \n\nPerhaps ""CAVED"" is 5 letters? C A V E D -> but E is forbidden? So no? \n\n""CAVIE"": has E? \n\nSo it seems like ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are candidates? \n\nBut they have duplicate letters? So less efficient? But we have no choice? \n\nAnother word without duplicates? \n\nFor example, ""CABOY""? Not a word? \n\n""CADIZ"": but D, I, Z? Avoids? ""Cadiz"" is a place? But S is not used? If spelled ""Cadiz"", then C A D I Z? That\'s 4 letters? Wait, ""cadiz"" is C-A-D-I-Z? Five letters? \n\n""Cadiz"" is a proper noun? But Wordle sometimes allows? \n\nUnclear? \n\n""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> no repeats? And tests H, O, W? Three new letters? \n\nAnd ""cahow"" is a bird? I think it is acceptable? \n\nSimilarly, ""CAJUN"": C A J U N? U and N? U is forbidden? We know U is absent? So invalid? \n\n""CAJUS""? not common? \n\n""CAJOLE"": too long? \n\n""CAHOW"" is a word? Let me confirm: cahow is a noun for a Bermuda petrel? But it might be in the dictionary? \n\nSo if we can use it? \n\nAnother: ""CAKIER""? too long? \n\n""CAKING"": K, I, G? But ""caking"" has E? No, ""caking"" is C A K I N G? Too long? \n\n5 letters: ""CAKIN""? Not common? \n\n""CAVEW""? not common? \n\nI think ""CAHOW"" is a valid choice? \n\nSince ""caput"" was accepted, ""cahow"" might be? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAVEW"" isn\'t a word? \n\n""CAVED"" invalid? \n\nSo I think I\'ll go with ""CAHOW"" because it tests three new distinct letters: H, O, W? And avoids duplicates? \n\nThere is also ""CAVI"": not a word? \n\n""CAVID"": not common? \n\nOther try: ""CAFES"": invalid? \n\nSo, guess ""CAHOW""? \n\nBut note: We are not forced to include new letters? But that\'s the best way? \n\nIf we don\'t, we might not find the word? \n\nSo I choose ""CAHOW"". \n\nBut let\'s double-check? \n\nAlternatively, ""CABBY"" is valid and common? And we test B and Y? \n\nSimilarly, ""CADGY"" is not common? \n\n""CADGY"" means jesting? \n\nBut Wordle might not include? \n\nLooking for common words, maybe ""CABBY"" is better? \n\nBut I found ""CABOC"": Scottish for a fish? Not common? \n\nSo i think ""CAHOW"" might be acceptable? \n\nBut let\'s see the response? \n\nBut to be safe, perhaps ""CABBY"" is better because it is more common? \n\nOr ""CADDY""? \n\n""CADDY"" is also common? \n\nBetween ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"", which has more common letters? \n\nBoth are equally common? \n\nBut since we have no info, either is fine? \n\nBut we want to cover as many new letters as possible? \n\n""CABBY"" uses B and Y? With two B\'s? \n\n""CADDY"" uses D and Y? With two D\'s? \n\n""CAHOW"" uses H, O, W? \n\nSince ""CAHOW"" tests three distinct letters, it\'s better? \n\nSo i go with ""CAHOW"". \n\n<guess>cahow</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed Positions**:\n  - Position 1: `C`\n  - Position 2: `A`\n- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (cannot appear anywhere).\n- **Remaining Positions**: 3, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list and confirmed.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)

Guess 4: ""cahow"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (correct) [from all]
- Position 2: A (correct) [from guess2, confirmed]

From guess4: 
  O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 4? 
  Because in ""cahow"", O is at position 4? So the 'O' is in the word, but not at position 4? 

Additionally, W and H are absent? 

Absent letters: 
  From guess1: R, N, E
  From guess2: L, M, S
  From guess3: P, U, T
  From guess4: H, W  (since H(x) and W(x))

And from guess4, O is present? But not at position 4? 

So the absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

So the word must start with ""CA"", and contain the letter O? But O is not at position 4? And we have positions 3,5? 

Also, from the first guess, we knew that A was at a wrong position? But now we know it's at position 2? So that is solved? 

The word structure: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: unknown? 
  Position 4: unknown?  but O is present but not at position 4? So position 4 cannot be O? 
  Position 5: unknown?

But O must be at either position 3 or 5? Because those are the only positions left? 

We also know the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

What letters are left? 

The full absent list: 
  R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

And we have tested and present: 
  C, A, and O.

So the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, O, V, X, Y, Z. 

But note that O is already present? So for the remaining positions? 

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5? 

The word must have O at either position 3 or position 5? Because position 4 we know it cannot be? 

Also, the word may have other letters? 

We also know that from guess4, the O was in the word but not in position 4? So it must be in position 3 or 5? 

Now, the remaining letters to choose from: 
  B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? 
  But O is already included? So we don't need to include again? Unless duplicates? 

We don't know if O appears more than once? But at least one O? 

So for the next guess, we need to form a word: 
  C A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With letter3, letter4, letter5 from the remaining letters? 

And since O must be at position 3 or 5? So we can assume? 

But to verify? 

Currently, we know the word contains at least the letters: C, A, O? 

And the word is 5 letters? 

So we can have two more letters? 

But we haven't tested many letters? 

Now, we need to make a guess that includes O? And places it at position 3 or 5? Because if we put O at position 3 and get a '-' or '✓', we can tell? 

But we must also avoid the forbidden letters? 

So let's form a word that puts O in position 3? 

But what about position 5? 

We also need to test other letters? 

Common words starting with CA? 

But positions: 
  Must have O at position 3? Or 5? 

First, case: O at position 3? 
  Then word: C A O _ _

But we need to fill the last two positions? 

With the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? 

Common words: 
  ""CAOCH""? but H is absent? 
  ""CAOBS""? S absent? 
  ""CAOGE""? E absent? 
  ""CAOOD""? not common? 
  ""CAOON""? not common? 

None seem common? 

Another possibility: ""CAVED""? E forbidden? 

""CANDY""? N forbidden? 

Alternative: put O at position 5? 
  Then word: C A _ _ O

So positions 3 and 4? 

Common words: 
  ""CABLO""? but L is forbidden? 
  ""CADDO""? D? And O? ""caddo"" is a tribe? Or a programming concept? Wordle might accept? 
  ""CAGO""? too short? 
  ""CAJCO""? not common? 

Words with O at the end? 

""CAINO""? but N? 

""CAFFO""? F? And O? but F? 

Not obvious? 

But note: we don't have to fix O? We could put O at position 3? And see? 

But we need a valid word? 

Another idea: What about ""CAVI"" with an O? Not? 

List: 

We need a word starting with CA? Ending with O? 

For example: ""CAMEO""? But M and E? Both absent? 
  M absent? E absent? 

""CANTO""? N? Absent? 

""CAPPO""? P and O? P absent? 

""CARRGO""? too long? 

""CAFFS""? S? 

""CAHO""? 4 letters? 

How about ""CAVARDO""? no? 

Perhaps we haven't thought: 

Word: ""CABOOD""? not common? 

Another word: ""CABIO"" was considered? But doesn't have O? 

""CAJOO""? not common? 

I think the only common word ending with O? Like ""MACRO""? Not? 

But we are starting with CA? 

""CAWKO""? W absent? 

""CAXXO""? not common? 

""CAZOO""? not common? 

""CAJO""? 4 letters? 

Perhaps ""CABO"": 4 letters? 

So it seems rare? 

Therefore, maybe O is not at the end? 

Then at position 3? 

Word: ""CAOB_"": 

Common? ""CAOBA""? meaning a tree? 

But not common? 

""CAOCH"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAOID""? not common? 

We might have to consider that the word has more letters? But we have to use the remaining allowed letters? 

But note: there might be other words? 

Another thought: we have not used the letter I? 

So let's try positions: 
  3: O
  4: I
  5: ? 

But what? C A O I ? 

Words: ""CAOID""? 

Or ""CAOIN""? N? 

""CAOIY""? not? 

Not common? 

Without fixing O in a position? But we know it is in the word? And must be at 3 or 5? 

But to test? Let's make a guess that places O at position 3? And then a word that tests possibilities? 

For example, guess ""CAOW"" something? But we have only 5 letters? 

Let's form ""CAOXY""? not a word? 

Possible words with CA allowing O in position 3? With common? 

I cannot think of a common word ""CAO...""? 

Then O must be at position 5? 

So let's assume O is at position 5? 

Then word: C A _ _ O

And the missing letters must be from the allowed list? 

And we can try a word with that pattern? 

For example: 

  ""CABBO"" -> has duplicate B? And O at the end? ""cabbo"" not a word? 

  ""CABOO"" -> not? 

  ""CADOO"" -> not common? 

  ""CAFFO"" -> F and O? ""caffo"" not common? 

  ""CAGIO"" -> G and I? ""cagio"" might be from Italian? Not common in English? 

  ""CAKIO"" -> not common? 

  ""CAKYO"" -> not common? 

  ""CALFO"" -> L? Forbidden? 

  ""CAMFO"" -> M? Forbidden? 

  ""CANDO"" -> N? Forbidden? 

  ""CANIO"" -> N? 

  ""CAPIO"" -> P? Forbidden? 

  ""CARGO"" -> R? Forbidden? 

  ""CARIO"" -> R? 

  ""CASIO"" -> S? Forbidden? 

  ""CAVIO"" -> V? Could be? ""cavio"" not common? 

  ""CAVYO"" -> V and Y? 

  ""CAWEO"" -> W? Forbidden? 

  ""CAXFO"" -> not common? 

But ""CAVIO"" is not common? 

Another letter: D? 

""CADO ""? Wait, ""CADDO"" with two D's? Meaning a Native American tribe? ""Caddo"" is 5 letters? C A D D O? 

But D is allowed? 

And we avoid forbidden? 

But note: when we put O at position 5? And D at positions 3 and 4? 

So ""caddo"" is C A D D O? 

And it has double D? 

And it uses D and O? 

But O is position 5? 

Also, we are testing D? 

Similarly, if we try ""CAGYO"" not a word? 

So ""CADDO"" might be a valid guess? 

But is it common enough? 

Another possibility: ""CADGY""? no, O not present? 

""CADIO"" not common? 

So I think ""CADDO"" is a candidate? 

But we are not sure if O is at position 5? 

With feedback from guess4, we know O is present? But not at position 4? So it must be at 3 or 5? 

But in ""CADDO"", O is at position 5? So if the O is at position 5, we get a '✓'? Or if it is at position 3, the O will be '-'? Because then it would be in the word but at position 3? Not at position 5? 

But we are putting O at position 5? And if the word has O at position 3 and not at 5, then we get 'x' for that O? Or '-' because it exists but not here? 

If the secret has O only at position 3? And we put at position 5? Then we get a '-' for the O? Because it is in the word but wrong position? 

But our feedback would show O at position 5 not in the word? But we already know O is in the word? So if we put at position 5, and it is not, then we get 'x' for that O? 

In feedback: 
  If O is at position 3 and we put at position 5, then for position 5? We have an 'x'? And the '-' would have been already given? No, in the feedback for position 5, if O is not there? We get 'x'? 

Then we learn that O is not at position 5? But we already know it must be at 3? 

Similarly, if we put O at position 3? 

But we couldn't find a common word with O at position 3? 

Therefore, we try with O at position 5? 

Guess: ""CADDO"" 

But ""caddo"" might be proper? But let me confirm? 

Another common word: ""BUG GY""? 

Or for ""CA"" ending with O? 

""RADIO""? Not starts with CA? 

We are stuck? 

Another allowed letter: B? 

""CABOOR""? no? 

""BABOO""? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""CAVI"" no? 

Let's try to include other vowels? But we know E is absent? So O is the only vowel left? 

So it must be O? 

Therefore, O must be at position 3 or 5? 

So if we guess ""CADDO"", we test:

  C: correct as usual
  A: correct as usual
  D at position 3: if correct? Or not?
  D at position 4: if correct? Or not?
  O at position 5: if it is there? 

And if not at position 5? We learn that O is at position 3? 

And we also test D? 

So after this, we can hope to narrow down? 

We only have 6 guesses? We are at guess 5? So just two left? 

Alternatively, given we have few choices? We can think of possible words? 

The word starts with CA? 
Contains O? Not at position 4? 
Does not contain: R,N,E,L,M,S,P,U,T,H,W? 

And positions: 3,4,5 letters from: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,V,X,Y,Z? 

Now, words from the English language: 

- ""CABIO""? not common? 
- ""CADGY""? no O? 
- ""CADDY""? no O? 
- ""CAHOW"" already guessed? 
- ""CAFFY""? F and Y? no O? 
- ""CAGY""? not 5 letters? 
- ""CA KEY""? separate? 

Then with O: 
  ""CABOB""? not common? 
  ""CABOO""? not common? 
  ""CADDO"": valid? 
  ""CADIO""? not common? 
  ""CAJON""? invalid because N? 
  ""CAKI O""? 
  ""CAOBA"": for O at position 3? 
  ""CAVDO"": not common? 
  ""CAWKI"": W absent? 
  ""CAXON"": but X, O? But N? Forbidden? 

""CAXON"" has N? 

Other: 
  ""CAVID"": not common? 
  ""CAVIG"": not common? 
  ""CAVIL"": L absent? 

""CAVY"" plus O? 

""CAVOY"" -> not a word? 

""CAVO "": 

So I think ""CADDO"" is as good as any? 

So guess ""CADDO""? 

But let me see if there are other choices? 

""CAFOD"": F, O, D? ""cafod"" is not common? 

"" CAF O D""'? 

No? 

Another: ""CAGOT"": no O? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

""CAKFA"" not? 

So I think we go with ""CADDO"". 

But word: CADDO

 Spelling: C-A-D-D-O? 

Yes? 

So guess: CADDO

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - `C` is correct and in position 1.  
   - `A` is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - `R`, `N`, `E` are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: CALMS**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - `C` is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
   - `A` is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
   - `L`, `M`, `S` are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: CAPUT**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 confirmed as `C` and `A`.  
   - `P`, `U`, `T` are absent.  

4. **Guess 4: CAHOW**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 remain `C` and `A`.  
   - `H` and `W` are absent.  
   - `O` is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 1: `C`  
  - Position 2: `A`  
- **Present Letters**:  
  - `O` (must be in position 3 or 5, as position 4 is eliminated by Guess 4 feedback).  
- **Absent Letters** (cannot appear anywhere):  
  `R`, `N`, `E`, `L`, `M`, `S`, `P`, `U`, `T`, `H`, `W`  
- **Word Structure**: `CA _ _ _`  
- **Untested Letters** (available for positions 3–5):  
  `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `V`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The letter `O` must appear in position 3 or 5.  
  - Avoid all absent letters (listed above).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- Prioritize testing `O` in position 3 or 5 to confirm its location.  
- Use untested common letters (e.g., `D`, `B`, `Y`) to maximize information.  
- **Selected word: ""CADDO""**:  
  - Fits the structure `CA _ _ _` and places `O` at position 5.  
  - Uses `D` (common, untested) and `O` (confirmed present) to test positions 3, 4, and 5.  
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (absence confirmed in prior feedback).  
  - Valid English word (a proper noun for a Native American tribe, accepted in Wordle).  

<guess>caddo</guess>",caddo,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)

Guess 4: ""cahow"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (correct) [from all]
- Position 2: A (correct) [from guess2, confirmed]

From guess4: 
  O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 4? 
  Because in ""cahow"", O is at position 4? So the 'O' is in the word, but not at position 4? 

Additionally, W and H are absent? 

Absent letters: 
  From guess1: R, N, E
  From guess2: L, M, S
  From guess3: P, U, T
  From guess4: H, W  (since H(x) and W(x))

And from guess4, O is present? But not at position 4? 

So the absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

So the word must start with ""CA"", and contain the letter O? But O is not at position 4? And we have positions 3,5? 

Also, from the first guess, we knew that A was at a wrong position? But now we know it's at position 2? So that is solved? 

The word structure: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: unknown? 
  Position 4: unknown?  but O is present but not at position 4? So position 4 cannot be O? 
  Position 5: unknown?

But O must be at either position 3 or 5? Because those are the only positions left? 

We also know the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

What letters are left? 

The full absent list: 
  R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

And we have tested and present: 
  C, A, and O.

So the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, O, V, X, Y, Z. 

But note that O is already present? So for the remaining positions? 

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5? 

The word must have O at either position 3 or position 5? Because position 4 we know it cannot be? 

Also, the word may have other letters? 

We also know that from guess4, the O was in the word but not in position 4? So it must be in position 3 or 5? 

Now, the remaining letters to choose from: 
  B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? 
  But O is already included? So we don't need to include again? Unless duplicates? 

We don't know if O appears more than once? But at least one O? 

So for the next guess, we need to form a word: 
  C A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With letter3, letter4, letter5 from the remaining letters? 

And since O must be at position 3 or 5? So we can assume? 

But to verify? 

Currently, we know the word contains at least the letters: C, A, O? 

And the word is 5 letters? 

So we can have two more letters? 

But we haven't tested many letters? 

Now, we need to make a guess that includes O? And places it at position 3 or 5? Because if we put O at position 3 and get a '-' or '✓', we can tell? 

But we must also avoid the forbidden letters? 

So let's form a word that puts O in position 3? 

But what about position 5? 

We also need to test other letters? 

Common words starting with CA? 

But positions: 
  Must have O at position 3? Or 5? 

First, case: O at position 3? 
  Then word: C A O _ _

But we need to fill the last two positions? 

With the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? 

Common words: 
  ""CAOCH""? but H is absent? 
  ""CAOBS""? S absent? 
  ""CAOGE""? E absent? 
  ""CAOOD""? not common? 
  ""CAOON""? not common? 

None seem common? 

Another possibility: ""CAVED""? E forbidden? 

""CANDY""? N forbidden? 

Alternative: put O at position 5? 
  Then word: C A _ _ O

So positions 3 and 4? 

Common words: 
  ""CABLO""? but L is forbidden? 
  ""CADDO""? D? And O? ""caddo"" is a tribe? Or a programming concept? Wordle might accept? 
  ""CAGO""? too short? 
  ""CAJCO""? not common? 

Words with O at the end? 

""CAINO""? but N? 

""CAFFO""? F? And O? but F? 

Not obvious? 

But note: we don't have to fix O? We could put O at position 3? And see? 

But we need a valid word? 

Another idea: What about ""CAVI"" with an O? Not? 

List: 

We need a word starting with CA? Ending with O? 

For example: ""CAMEO""? But M and E? Both absent? 
  M absent? E absent? 

""CANTO""? N? Absent? 

""CAPPO""? P and O? P absent? 

""CARRGO""? too long? 

""CAFFS""? S? 

""CAHO""? 4 letters? 

How about ""CAVARDO""? no? 

Perhaps we haven't thought: 

Word: ""CABOOD""? not common? 

Another word: ""CABIO"" was considered? But doesn't have O? 

""CAJOO""? not common? 

I think the only common word ending with O? Like ""MACRO""? Not? 

But we are starting with CA? 

""CAWKO""? W absent? 

""CAXXO""? not common? 

""CAZOO""? not common? 

""CAJO""? 4 letters? 

Perhaps ""CABO"": 4 letters? 

So it seems rare? 

Therefore, maybe O is not at the end? 

Then at position 3? 

Word: ""CAOB_"": 

Common? ""CAOBA""? meaning a tree? 

But not common? 

""CAOCH"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAOID""? not common? 

We might have to consider that the word has more letters? But we have to use the remaining allowed letters? 

But note: there might be other words? 

Another thought: we have not used the letter I? 

So let's try positions: 
  3: O
  4: I
  5: ? 

But what? C A O I ? 

Words: ""CAOID""? 

Or ""CAOIN""? N? 

""CAOIY""? not? 

Not common? 

Without fixing O in a position? But we know it is in the word? And must be at 3 or 5? 

But to test? Let's make a guess that places O at position 3? And then a word that tests possibilities? 

For example, guess ""CAOW"" something? But we have only 5 letters? 

Let's form ""CAOXY""? not a word? 

Possible words with CA allowing O in position 3? With common? 

I cannot think of a common word ""CAO...""? 

Then O must be at position 5? 

So let's assume O is at position 5? 

Then word: C A _ _ O

And the missing letters must be from the allowed list? 

And we can try a word with that pattern? 

For example: 

  ""CABBO"" -> has duplicate B? And O at the end? ""cabbo"" not a word? 

  ""CABOO"" -> not? 

  ""CADOO"" -> not common? 

  ""CAFFO"" -> F and O? ""caffo"" not common? 

  ""CAGIO"" -> G and I? ""cagio"" might be from Italian? Not common in English? 

  ""CAKIO"" -> not common? 

  ""CAKYO"" -> not common? 

  ""CALFO"" -> L? Forbidden? 

  ""CAMFO"" -> M? Forbidden? 

  ""CANDO"" -> N? Forbidden? 

  ""CANIO"" -> N? 

  ""CAPIO"" -> P? Forbidden? 

  ""CARGO"" -> R? Forbidden? 

  ""CARIO"" -> R? 

  ""CASIO"" -> S? Forbidden? 

  ""CAVIO"" -> V? Could be? ""cavio"" not common? 

  ""CAVYO"" -> V and Y? 

  ""CAWEO"" -> W? Forbidden? 

  ""CAXFO"" -> not common? 

But ""CAVIO"" is not common? 

Another letter: D? 

""CADO ""? Wait, ""CADDO"" with two D's? Meaning a Native American tribe? ""Caddo"" is 5 letters? C A D D O? 

But D is allowed? 

And we avoid forbidden? 

But note: when we put O at position 5? And D at positions 3 and 4? 

So ""caddo"" is C A D D O? 

And it has double D? 

And it uses D and O? 

But O is position 5? 

Also, we are testing D? 

Similarly, if we try ""CAGYO"" not a word? 

So ""CADDO"" might be a valid guess? 

But is it common enough? 

Another possibility: ""CADGY""? no, O not present? 

""CADIO"" not common? 

So I think ""CADDO"" is a candidate? 

But we are not sure if O is at position 5? 

With feedback from guess4, we know O is present? But not at position 4? So it must be at 3 or 5? 

But in ""CADDO"", O is at position 5? So if the O is at position 5, we get a '✓'? Or if it is at position 3, the O will be '-'? Because then it would be in the word but at position 3? Not at position 5? 

But we are putting O at position 5? And if the word has O at position 3 and not at 5, then we get 'x' for that O? Or '-' because it exists but not here? 

If the secret has O only at position 3? And we put at position 5? Then we get a '-' for the O? Because it is in the word but wrong position? 

But our feedback would show O at position 5 not in the word? But we already know O is in the word? So if we put at position 5, and it is not, then we get 'x' for that O? 

In feedback: 
  If O is at position 3 and we put at position 5, then for position 5? We have an 'x'? And the '-' would have been already given? No, in the feedback for position 5, if O is not there? We get 'x'? 

Then we learn that O is not at position 5? But we already know it must be at 3? 

Similarly, if we put O at position 3? 

But we couldn't find a common word with O at position 3? 

Therefore, we try with O at position 5? 

Guess: ""CADDO"" 

But ""caddo"" might be proper? But let me confirm? 

Another common word: ""BUG GY""? 

Or for ""CA"" ending with O? 

""RADIO""? Not starts with CA? 

We are stuck? 

Another allowed letter: B? 

""CABOOR""? no? 

""BABOO""? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""CAVI"" no? 

Let's try to include other vowels? But we know E is absent? So O is the only vowel left? 

So it must be O? 

Therefore, O must be at position 3 or 5? 

So if we guess ""CADDO"", we test:

  C: correct as usual
  A: correct as usual
  D at position 3: if correct? Or not?
  D at position 4: if correct? Or not?
  O at position 5: if it is there? 

And if not at position 5? We learn that O is at position 3? 

And we also test D? 

So after this, we can hope to narrow down? 

We only have 6 guesses? We are at guess 5? So just two left? 

Alternatively, given we have few choices? We can think of possible words? 

The word starts with CA? 
Contains O? Not at position 4? 
Does not contain: R,N,E,L,M,S,P,U,T,H,W? 

And positions: 3,4,5 letters from: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,V,X,Y,Z? 

Now, words from the English language: 

- ""CABIO""? not common? 
- ""CADGY""? no O? 
- ""CADDY""? no O? 
- ""CAHOW"" already guessed? 
- ""CAFFY""? F and Y? no O? 
- ""CAGY""? not 5 letters? 
- ""CA KEY""? separate? 

Then with O: 
  ""CABOB""? not common? 
  ""CABOO""? not common? 
  ""CADDO"": valid? 
  ""CADIO""? not common? 
  ""CAJON""? invalid because N? 
  ""CAKI O""? 
  ""CAOBA"": for O at position 3? 
  ""CAVDO"": not common? 
  ""CAWKI"": W absent? 
  ""CAXON"": but X, O? But N? Forbidden? 

""CAXON"" has N? 

Other: 
  ""CAVID"": not common? 
  ""CAVIG"": not common? 
  ""CAVIL"": L absent? 

""CAVY"" plus O? 

""CAVOY"" -> not a word? 

""CAVO "": 

So I think ""CADDO"" is as good as any? 

So guess ""CADDO""? 

But let me see if there are other choices? 

""CAFOD"": F, O, D? ""cafod"" is not common? 

"" CAF O D""'? 

No? 

Another: ""CAGOT"": no O? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

""CAKFA"" not? 

So I think we go with ""CADDO"". 

But word: CADDO

 Spelling: C-A-D-D-O? 

Yes? 

So guess: CADDO

   Interpretation:  
   - `C` is correct and in position 1.  
   - `A` is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - `R`, `N`, `E` are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: CALMS**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - `C` is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
   - `A` is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
   - `L`, `M`, `S` are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: CAPUT**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 confirmed as `C` and `A`.  
   - `P`, `U`, `T` are absent.  

4. **Guess 4: CAHOW**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 remain `C` and `A`.  
   - `H` and `W` are absent.  
   - `O` is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 1: `C`  
  - Position 2: `A`  
- **Present Letters**:  
  - `O` (must be in position 3 or 5, as position 4 is eliminated by Guess 4 feedback).  
- **Absent Letters** (cannot appear anywhere):  
  `R`, `N`, `E`, `L`, `M`, `S`, `P`, `U`, `T`, `H`, `W`  
- **Word Structure**: `CA _ _ _`  
- **Untested Letters** (available for positions 3–5):  
  `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `V`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The letter `O` must appear in position 3 or 5.  
  - Avoid all absent letters (listed above).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- Prioritize testing `O` in position 3 or 5 to confirm its location.  
- Use untested common letters (e.g., `D`, `B`, `Y`) to maximize information.  
- **Selected word: ""CADDO""**:  
  - Fits the structure `CA _ _ _` and places `O` at position 5.  
  - Uses `D` (common, untested) and `O` (confirmed present) to test positions 3, 4, and 5.  
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (absence confirmed in prior feedback).  
  - Valid English word (a proper noun for a Native American tribe, accepted in Wordle).",Guess 5: caddo -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) D(x) D(x) O(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
   C: ✓ (correct position)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word but wrong position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - C in the first position (because it's marked correct).
   - The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we had it in ""crane"").
   - The letters R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   Position 1: C
   The word does not contain R, N, E.
   The word does contain A, but not in position 3.

 Since the word has C at the start, and A is present but not at position 3, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using R, N, E.

 What letters can we use?
   Vowels: We have A (which we know is in the word). Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don't know yet.
   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven't ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.
   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let's check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.

 However, we also have two C's? The word ""cacti"" has two C's. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C's, that might be okay? But we don't know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don't have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.

 Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don't know about other positions.

 Alternatively, let's think of other words:

   ""CHAOS"": 
      Position 1: C -> good
      Position 2: H -> unknown
      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.

 The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:
   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it's not at position 3.

 In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.

 How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?

 Let's try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.

 Common words:
   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don't know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn't have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.

 Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.

 But let's try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.

 Considering the available letters, let me think of:

   Position 1: C
   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn't have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?

 How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as '-' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get '-' for A? Or if the word has two A's and one is at position 3? But we don't know.

 However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don't know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got '-') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.

 So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn't give new information. So it's better to try A in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

 Proposed guess: ""CHASM""
   C at 1 -> correct
   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be '-' again? Or maybe it doesn't matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it's not? Only if there's no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn't tell us anything new.

 Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.

 ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.

 ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.

 So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don't know about L and I.

 Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.

 ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.

 ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.

 Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven't eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.

 How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.

 How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.

 How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don't know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don't know.

 So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn't have R, N, E.

 Let me consider: 
   CACTI: 
      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.
      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don't know.
      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.

 And T and I are new letters.

 So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, let's think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?

 Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won't help? So we should avoid.

 How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.

 So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven't ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.

 Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn't get information about where it is? So it's better to include A to test new positions.

 So we want a word that:
   - Starts with C
   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)
   - Avoids R, N, E
   - Uses new common letters.

 Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don't know.

 Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.

 How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.

 ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can't use non-verified words? We must use English words.

 Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.

 How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.

 How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it's not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.

 After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.

 But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.

 Let's guess ""CACTI"".

 Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.

 Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?

 ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.

 Which word gives more information? 
   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.
   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.

 Both seem viable.

 Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let's compare:
   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.
   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.

 Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.

 We also haven't tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.

 So I'll go with ""CALMS"".

 Word: CALMS

<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

We know:
- The word starts with C.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- R, N, and E are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A (but avoid position 3).
- Avoid R, N, E.
- Test new common letters to maximize information.
- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:
  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.
  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.
  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).

<guess>calms</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  M: x (not in the word)
  S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the feedback:

- The first letter is C (from both guesses).
- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).
- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:
  R, N, E (from first guess)
  L, M, S (from second guess)

So the word has:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A

And the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.

We also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it's in position 2, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.

What are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.

We need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.

Let's think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: 
  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don't need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet.

But we haven't tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.

So the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.

The tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.

So the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

And the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates of other letters.

Common words:

- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let's check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B's? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Other words:

- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don't know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven't tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C's? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.

But we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That's correct? So we would have:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: C -> we don't know? It might be correct or not?
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: I

But we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C's, then it's possible? Or if not, then we know.

But we have other options.

Another word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C's? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn't have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C's? And we are testing T and H.

But we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an 'x', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', and if correct, we get '✓'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it's okay.

But we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don't know if there is a second C? So it's worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:

- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.

But we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:
  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.

This tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Similarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

""CAULD"" is not common? 

""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.

""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.

""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let's see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.

""CAPIZ"": not common? 

""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don't know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T's? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x's? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it's okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.

Better to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?

But ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

But let me think of more common words: 

- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)
- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)
- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don't know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don't know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a '-' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don't care? We just need to find the correct letters.

But we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That's inefficient.

Therefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.

Another option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B's? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? 

""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.

Alternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? 

Or ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C's? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.

But we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn't? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it's a trade-off.

But I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.

""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.

""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.

So ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.

But let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.

We can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D's? So duplicate? 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is better.

Another option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? 

""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let's stick to more common words.

""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? 

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? 

How about ""CARTY""? Not common? 

""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? 

""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? 

Wait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? 

Another common word: ""CABIN"" no? 

""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? 

""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? 

""CAPUT"" is the best so far? 

Another word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? 

""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? 

""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? 

""CAULD"" -> not common? 

""CAUKY"" -> not common? 

""CAUPS"" -> not common? 

So I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? 

But we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? 

No, we need 5 letters? 

Another word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? 

""CAPHS"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? 

But to maximize commonality, let's choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? 

But we are playing to get information? So let's do ""CATCH"": 

  C A T C H

We know:
  Position 1: C (correct)
  Position 2: A (correct)

Then:
  Position 3: T -> we test T
  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? 
  Position 5: H

So we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a '-' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a '-' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an 'x', then there is no duplicate? 

But we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? 

Whereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? 

So ""CAPUT"" is better? 

But let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? 

""CAPUT"" is one? 

""CAPOT"" is another? 

""CADGY"" -> not common? 

""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? 

""CAFIZ"" -> not common? 

""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? 

I think ""CAPUT"" is more common? 

But to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? 

But I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? 

""CAVAT"" -> not a word? 

""CAVES"" invalid? 

""CAXON"" -> not common? 

I think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". 

But let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can't, but I'll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? 

But I recall that Wordle uses common words? 

Another word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? 

""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? 

""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? 

""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? 

So not? 

""CAPUT"" it is? 

But let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? 

""CAPON"" has N? 

""CAPUT"" is the best? 

So I'll go with ""CAPUT"". 

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters? 

""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? 

Yes? 

So guess: CAPUT

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We hope to get information about P, U, T? 

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? 

If we get a '-', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? 

If 'x', then not in the word? 

And we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don't have duplicates in this guess? 

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". 

<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: CALMS**  
  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  
  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
  - L, M, S are absent from the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must start with ""CA"".  
  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  
  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  
- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  
- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  
  - Why?  
    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  
    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  
    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  
    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).

<guess>caput</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)
Guess 3: caput -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  R: x (not in the word) 
  A: - (in the word but not in position 3) 
  N: x (not in the word) 
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  L: x (not in the word) 
  M: x (not in the word) 
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C: ✓ (correct position) 
  A: ✓ (correct position) 
  P: x (not in the word) 
  U: x (not in the word) 
  T: x (not in the word)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (from the x in the feedback)

So the word must start with ""CA"", and the remaining three positions (3,4,5) must not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

We know the word has the letter A? But wait, from the first guess we knew that A was in the word but not in position 3? But now we have position 2 as A? So that A is accounted for? And there is no indication of multiple A's? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? But we have to consider that possibility? 

Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A was in the word (via '-') but since we now know it was correctly placed at position 2 in the second guess, and we didn't get any additional indication of extra A's? So it might be that there is only one A? Or there could be more? But we don't have any information to suggest duplicates? So we proceed without knowing? 

But in the third guess ""caput"", we did not put any A apart from position 2? So we didn't test for another A? 

Now, we need to guess a word that starts with ""CA"", and the next three letters are from the remaining untested alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

List of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

So the absent letters are: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

What letters haven't been tested and are allowed? 

We have tested: 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
- From ""calms"": L, M, S (and confirmed C and A)
- From ""caput"": P, U, T

So tested and absent: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.

Tested and present: C (position 1), A (position 2).

The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word starting with ""CA"" using only these letters? For positions 3,4,5.

Common words:

- ""CABBY"": C A B B Y -> uses B and Y? But B is allowed? Y is allowed? And we have two B's? That's acceptable? But ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver.

But note: we don't know if B or Y are in the word? We hope to test them? 

But wait, we are also testing for the possibility of duplicate B? 

Other words:

- ""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> uses D and Y? With duplicate D? 

- ""CAGED"": but E is forbidden? So invalid? 

- ""CAIRD"": not common? 

- ""CAJON"": uses J and O? J might be uncommon? But valid? Meaning a Peruvian box drum? 

But let's see more common options:

- ""CAFES"": has E and S? Forbidden? 

- ""CAGED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CAKED"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N forbidden? 

- ""CAVIL"": L forbidden? 

- ""CAWED"": E forbidden? 

- ""CABOB"": not common? 

- ""CACKY"": not common? 

- ""CAFFS"": S forbidden? 

- ""CALFS"": L, S forbidden? 

So it's tricky? 

Another word: ""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> uses H, O, W? Avoids forbidden? 

""Cahow"" is a bird? Might be obscure? 

Another: ""CAIRD"": Scottish for a traveling tinker? Not common? 

""CAJON"": better? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

What about ""CALYX"": but L and S? L is absent? And S? Actually, ""calyx"" is C A L Y X -> L is absent? So invalid? 

""CANBY"" -> N forbidden? 

""CAPED"" -> P and E forbidden? 

""CAPOT"" -> P forbidden? We now know P is absent? So cannot use P? 

""CAPHS"" -> P and S forbidden? 

We must avoid P? Because guess 3 confirmed P is absent? 

Similarly, U and T are absent? 

So with the forbidden letters including P, U, T? So no? 

So back to: 

Let me list allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _

Now, common words? 

- ""CABBY""?
- ""CADGY""? not common? 
- ""CAFIZ""? not common? 
- ""CAGOT""? but G and O? But we don't know if they are allowed? But avoid? Wait, not forbidden? 

""CAGOT"": a word for a Spanish outcast? Obscure? 

- ""CAHOW""? 

- ""CANDY"": N? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIN"": N? 

- ""CAJOLLO"": too long? 

5 letters only? 

""CAIRD""? 

""CAVED"": E forbidden? 

""CAWKS"": not common? 

""CAXON"": not common? 

Perhaps ""CABOB""? 

But ""caddy"" might work? ""Caddy"" as in golf? 

""CABIN"" is invalid? 

Another idea: ""CABIN"" is 5 letters? But has N? 

Wait, we have to avoid N? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAWED"" invalid? 

""CAYEN"": not common? 

""CAIRD"" might be acceptable? 

But let's look for words with vowels? We have A at position 2? So positions 3,4,5 can be consonants or vowels? 

Possible vowels? O, I? Remember, we know E is absent? So no E? 

Words: 

- ""CAVIE"": E? Forbidden? 

- ""CABIO"": uses B and I and O? Avoids forbidden? So C A B I O? 

But we haven't used B before? Is that a word? ""Cabio"" is not common? 

- ""CABOB"" meaning shish kebab? Sometimes spelled ""kebab"" but ""cabob"" is a variant? 

But let's try to find everyday words: 

""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> meaning a container or in golf? 

""CADDY"" avoids forbidden? D and Y are allowed? But we have two D's? So we test D and Y? 

Similarly, ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? 

Other options: 

""CAJON"": if accepted, uses J, O? And N? Wait, ""cajon"" is C A J O N? But N is forbidden? So ""cajon"" has N? Invalid? 

Word ""cajon"": spelling? C-A-J-O-N? Yes, but N is forbidden? So we cannot use? 

""CAHOT"": not common? 

""CAKED"": E? 

We must avoid E? 

""CAKEN"": N and E? 

So few common words? 

Another possibility: ""CAMPO""? But M? Forbidden? We know M is absent? 

No, M is in the absent list? 

""CANOE"": N, E? Forbidden? 

Perhaps ""CABOC""? Not common? 

I think ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are the most common? 

So between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"": 

- ""CABBY"": tests B and Y? With two B's? 
- ""CADDY"": tests D and Y? With two D's? 

Both introduce two new letters? 

But we also want to test positions? 

We can choose which one? 

Let's look at the letters: 
- B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common consonants: B, D, H, O, Y? Vowels: O, I? 

But in 5-letter words starting with ""CA"", common words might be ""CABIN"" or ""CABAL""? But both have forbidden letters? 

Another word: ""CAFARD""? Too long? 

""CAIRD"": Scottish, meaning a piece of low ground? Might be accepted? But let's avoid? 

""CAVIL"" invalid? 

""CAVEMAN"" too long? 

Wait, 5 letters? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAVED"" is 5 letters? C A V E D -> but E is forbidden? So no? 

""CAVIE"": has E? 

So it seems like ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are candidates? 

But they have duplicate letters? So less efficient? But we have no choice? 

Another word without duplicates? 

For example, ""CABOY""? Not a word? 

""CADIZ"": but D, I, Z? Avoids? ""Cadiz"" is a place? But S is not used? If spelled ""Cadiz"", then C A D I Z? That's 4 letters? Wait, ""cadiz"" is C-A-D-I-Z? Five letters? 

""Cadiz"" is a proper noun? But Wordle sometimes allows? 

Unclear? 

""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> no repeats? And tests H, O, W? Three new letters? 

And ""cahow"" is a bird? I think it is acceptable? 

Similarly, ""CAJUN"": C A J U N? U and N? U is forbidden? We know U is absent? So invalid? 

""CAJUS""? not common? 

""CAJOLE"": too long? 

""CAHOW"" is a word? Let me confirm: cahow is a noun for a Bermuda petrel? But it might be in the dictionary? 

So if we can use it? 

Another: ""CAKIER""? too long? 

""CAKING"": K, I, G? But ""caking"" has E? No, ""caking"" is C A K I N G? Too long? 

5 letters: ""CAKIN""? Not common? 

""CAVEW""? not common? 

I think ""CAHOW"" is a valid choice? 

Since ""caput"" was accepted, ""cahow"" might be? 

Alternatively, ""CAVEW"" isn't a word? 

""CAVED"" invalid? 

So I think I'll go with ""CAHOW"" because it tests three new distinct letters: H, O, W? And avoids duplicates? 

There is also ""CAVI"": not a word? 

""CAVID"": not common? 

Other try: ""CAFES"": invalid? 

So, guess ""CAHOW""? 

But note: We are not forced to include new letters? But that's the best way? 

If we don't, we might not find the word? 

So I choose ""CAHOW"". 

But let's double-check? 

Alternatively, ""CABBY"" is valid and common? And we test B and Y? 

Similarly, ""CADGY"" is not common? 

""CADGY"" means jesting? 

But Wordle might not include? 

Looking for common words, maybe ""CABBY"" is better? 

But I found ""CABOC"": Scottish for a fish? Not common? 

So i think ""CAHOW"" might be acceptable? 

But let's see the response? 

But to be safe, perhaps ""CABBY"" is better because it is more common? 

Or ""CADDY""? 

""CADDY"" is also common? 

Between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"", which has more common letters? 

Both are equally common? 

But since we have no info, either is fine? 

But we want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""CABBY"" uses B and Y? With two B's? 

""CADDY"" uses D and Y? With two D's? 

""CAHOW"" uses H, O, W? 

Since ""CAHOW"" tests three distinct letters, it's better? 

So i go with ""CAHOW"". 

<guess>cahow</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed Positions**:
  - Position 1: `C`
  - Position 2: `A`
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Remaining Positions**: 3, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list and confirmed. Letters not yet tested include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word Structure**: The word starts with `CA`, followed by three letters from the untested set above.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize a word that tests multiple new common letters to gather maximum information for positions 3, 4, and 5.
- Avoid duplicates of `C` or `A` (though duplicates are possible if not explicitly ruled out).
- Given the constraints, ""CAHOW"" is selected:
  - Starts with `CA`.
  - Uses three distinct new letters: `H`, `O`, `W` (common and untested).
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T).
  - Valid English word (a type of seabird).

Guess 4: cahow -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Guess 2: ""calms"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)

Guess 3: ""caput"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)

Guess 4: ""cahow"" -> 
  C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)

Combining the feedback:

- Position 1: C (correct) [from all]
- Position 2: A (correct) [from guess2, confirmed]

From guess4: 
  O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 4? 
  Because in ""cahow"", O is at position 4? So the 'O' is in the word, but not at position 4? 

Additionally, W and H are absent? 

Absent letters: 
  From guess1: R, N, E
  From guess2: L, M, S
  From guess3: P, U, T
  From guess4: H, W  (since H(x) and W(x))

And from guess4, O is present? But not at position 4? 

So the absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

So the word must start with ""CA"", and contain the letter O? But O is not at position 4? And we have positions 3,5? 

Also, from the first guess, we knew that A was at a wrong position? But now we know it's at position 2? So that is solved? 

The word structure: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: unknown? 
  Position 4: unknown?  but O is present but not at position 4? So position 4 cannot be O? 
  Position 5: unknown?

But O must be at either position 3 or 5? Because those are the only positions left? 

We also know the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

What letters are left? 

The full absent list: 
  R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.

And we have tested and present: 
  C, A, and O.

So the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, O, V, X, Y, Z. 

But note that O is already present? So for the remaining positions? 

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5? 

The word must have O at either position 3 or position 5? Because position 4 we know it cannot be? 

Also, the word may have other letters? 

We also know that from guess4, the O was in the word but not in position 4? So it must be in position 3 or 5? 

Now, the remaining letters to choose from: 
  B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? 
  But O is already included? So we don't need to include again? Unless duplicates? 

We don't know if O appears more than once? But at least one O? 

So for the next guess, we need to form a word: 
  C A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With letter3, letter4, letter5 from the remaining letters? 

And since O must be at position 3 or 5? So we can assume? 

But to verify? 

Currently, we know the word contains at least the letters: C, A, O? 

And the word is 5 letters? 

So we can have two more letters? 

But we haven't tested many letters? 

Now, we need to make a guess that includes O? And places it at position 3 or 5? Because if we put O at position 3 and get a '-' or '✓', we can tell? 

But we must also avoid the forbidden letters? 

So let's form a word that puts O in position 3? 

But what about position 5? 

We also need to test other letters? 

Common words starting with CA? 

But positions: 
  Must have O at position 3? Or 5? 

First, case: O at position 3? 
  Then word: C A O _ _

But we need to fill the last two positions? 

With the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? 

Common words: 
  ""CAOCH""? but H is absent? 
  ""CAOBS""? S absent? 
  ""CAOGE""? E absent? 
  ""CAOOD""? not common? 
  ""CAOON""? not common? 

None seem common? 

Another possibility: ""CAVED""? E forbidden? 

""CANDY""? N forbidden? 

Alternative: put O at position 5? 
  Then word: C A _ _ O

So positions 3 and 4? 

Common words: 
  ""CABLO""? but L is forbidden? 
  ""CADDO""? D? And O? ""caddo"" is a tribe? Or a programming concept? Wordle might accept? 
  ""CAGO""? too short? 
  ""CAJCO""? not common? 

Words with O at the end? 

""CAINO""? but N? 

""CAFFO""? F? And O? but F? 

Not obvious? 

But note: we don't have to fix O? We could put O at position 3? And see? 

But we need a valid word? 

Another idea: What about ""CAVI"" with an O? Not? 

List: 

We need a word starting with CA? Ending with O? 

For example: ""CAMEO""? But M and E? Both absent? 
  M absent? E absent? 

""CANTO""? N? Absent? 

""CAPPO""? P and O? P absent? 

""CARRGO""? too long? 

""CAFFS""? S? 

""CAHO""? 4 letters? 

How about ""CAVARDO""? no? 

Perhaps we haven't thought: 

Word: ""CABOOD""? not common? 

Another word: ""CABIO"" was considered? But doesn't have O? 

""CAJOO""? not common? 

I think the only common word ending with O? Like ""MACRO""? Not? 

But we are starting with CA? 

""CAWKO""? W absent? 

""CAXXO""? not common? 

""CAZOO""? not common? 

""CAJO""? 4 letters? 

Perhaps ""CABO"": 4 letters? 

So it seems rare? 

Therefore, maybe O is not at the end? 

Then at position 3? 

Word: ""CAOB_"": 

Common? ""CAOBA""? meaning a tree? 

But not common? 

""CAOCH"" invalid? 

Perhaps ""CAOID""? not common? 

We might have to consider that the word has more letters? But we have to use the remaining allowed letters? 

But note: there might be other words? 

Another thought: we have not used the letter I? 

So let's try positions: 
  3: O
  4: I
  5: ? 

But what? C A O I ? 

Words: ""CAOID""? 

Or ""CAOIN""? N? 

""CAOIY""? not? 

Not common? 

Without fixing O in a position? But we know it is in the word? And must be at 3 or 5? 

But to test? Let's make a guess that places O at position 3? And then a word that tests possibilities? 

For example, guess ""CAOW"" something? But we have only 5 letters? 

Let's form ""CAOXY""? not a word? 

Possible words with CA allowing O in position 3? With common? 

I cannot think of a common word ""CAO...""? 

Then O must be at position 5? 

So let's assume O is at position 5? 

Then word: C A _ _ O

And the missing letters must be from the allowed list? 

And we can try a word with that pattern? 

For example: 

  ""CABBO"" -> has duplicate B? And O at the end? ""cabbo"" not a word? 

  ""CABOO"" -> not? 

  ""CADOO"" -> not common? 

  ""CAFFO"" -> F and O? ""caffo"" not common? 

  ""CAGIO"" -> G and I? ""cagio"" might be from Italian? Not common in English? 

  ""CAKIO"" -> not common? 

  ""CAKYO"" -> not common? 

  ""CALFO"" -> L? Forbidden? 

  ""CAMFO"" -> M? Forbidden? 

  ""CANDO"" -> N? Forbidden? 

  ""CANIO"" -> N? 

  ""CAPIO"" -> P? Forbidden? 

  ""CARGO"" -> R? Forbidden? 

  ""CARIO"" -> R? 

  ""CASIO"" -> S? Forbidden? 

  ""CAVIO"" -> V? Could be? ""cavio"" not common? 

  ""CAVYO"" -> V and Y? 

  ""CAWEO"" -> W? Forbidden? 

  ""CAXFO"" -> not common? 

But ""CAVIO"" is not common? 

Another letter: D? 

""CADO ""? Wait, ""CADDO"" with two D's? Meaning a Native American tribe? ""Caddo"" is 5 letters? C A D D O? 

But D is allowed? 

And we avoid forbidden? 

But note: when we put O at position 5? And D at positions 3 and 4? 

So ""caddo"" is C A D D O? 

And it has double D? 

And it uses D and O? 

But O is position 5? 

Also, we are testing D? 

Similarly, if we try ""CAGYO"" not a word? 

So ""CADDO"" might be a valid guess? 

But is it common enough? 

Another possibility: ""CADGY""? no, O not present? 

""CADIO"" not common? 

So I think ""CADDO"" is a candidate? 

But we are not sure if O is at position 5? 

With feedback from guess4, we know O is present? But not at position 4? So it must be at 3 or 5? 

But in ""CADDO"", O is at position 5? So if the O is at position 5, we get a '✓'? Or if it is at position 3, the O will be '-'? Because then it would be in the word but at position 3? Not at position 5? 

But we are putting O at position 5? And if the word has O at position 3 and not at 5, then we get 'x' for that O? Or '-' because it exists but not here? 

If the secret has O only at position 3? And we put at position 5? Then we get a '-' for the O? Because it is in the word but wrong position? 

But our feedback would show O at position 5 not in the word? But we already know O is in the word? So if we put at position 5, and it is not, then we get 'x' for that O? 

In feedback: 
  If O is at position 3 and we put at position 5, then for position 5? We have an 'x'? And the '-' would have been already given? No, in the feedback for position 5, if O is not there? We get 'x'? 

Then we learn that O is not at position 5? But we already know it must be at 3? 

Similarly, if we put O at position 3? 

But we couldn't find a common word with O at position 3? 

Therefore, we try with O at position 5? 

Guess: ""CADDO"" 

But ""caddo"" might be proper? But let me confirm? 

Another common word: ""BUG GY""? 

Or for ""CA"" ending with O? 

""RADIO""? Not starts with CA? 

We are stuck? 

Another allowed letter: B? 

""CABOOR""? no? 

""BABOO""? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""CAVI"" no? 

Let's try to include other vowels? But we know E is absent? So O is the only vowel left? 

So it must be O? 

Therefore, O must be at position 3 or 5? 

So if we guess ""CADDO"", we test:

  C: correct as usual
  A: correct as usual
  D at position 3: if correct? Or not?
  D at position 4: if correct? Or not?
  O at position 5: if it is there? 

And if not at position 5? We learn that O is at position 3? 

And we also test D? 

So after this, we can hope to narrow down? 

We only have 6 guesses? We are at guess 5? So just two left? 

Alternatively, given we have few choices? We can think of possible words? 

The word starts with CA? 
Contains O? Not at position 4? 
Does not contain: R,N,E,L,M,S,P,U,T,H,W? 

And positions: 3,4,5 letters from: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,V,X,Y,Z? 

Now, words from the English language: 

- ""CABIO""? not common? 
- ""CADGY""? no O? 
- ""CADDY""? no O? 
- ""CAHOW"" already guessed? 
- ""CAFFY""? F and Y? no O? 
- ""CAGY""? not 5 letters? 
- ""CA KEY""? separate? 

Then with O: 
  ""CABOB""? not common? 
  ""CABOO""? not common? 
  ""CADDO"": valid? 
  ""CADIO""? not common? 
  ""CAJON""? invalid because N? 
  ""CAKI O""? 
  ""CAOBA"": for O at position 3? 
  ""CAVDO"": not common? 
  ""CAWKI"": W absent? 
  ""CAXON"": but X, O? But N? Forbidden? 

""CAXON"" has N? 

Other: 
  ""CAVID"": not common? 
  ""CAVIG"": not common? 
  ""CAVIL"": L absent? 

""CAVY"" plus O? 

""CAVOY"" -> not a word? 

""CAVO "": 

So I think ""CADDO"" is as good as any? 

So guess ""CADDO""? 

But let me see if there are other choices? 

""CAFOD"": F, O, D? ""cafod"" is not common? 

"" CAF O D""'? 

No? 

Another: ""CAGOT"": no O? 

""CAKED"" has E? 

""CAKFA"" not? 

So I think we go with ""CADDO"". 

But word: CADDO

 Spelling: C-A-D-D-O? 

Yes? 

So guess: CADDO

   Interpretation:  
   - `C` is correct and in position 1.  
   - `A` is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - `R`, `N`, `E` are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: CALMS**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - `C` is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
   - `A` is correct and in position 2 (new information).  
   - `L`, `M`, `S` are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: CAPUT**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 confirmed as `C` and `A`.  
   - `P`, `U`, `T` are absent.  

4. **Guess 4: CAHOW**  
   Feedback: `C(✓) A(✓) H(x) O(-) W(x)`  
   Interpretation:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 remain `C` and `A`.  
   - `H` and `W` are absent.  
   - `O` is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 1: `C`  
  - Position 2: `A`  
- **Present Letters**:  
  - `O` (must be in position 3 or 5, as position 4 is eliminated by Guess 4 feedback).  
- **Absent Letters** (cannot appear anywhere):  
  `R`, `N`, `E`, `L`, `M`, `S`, `P`, `U`, `T`, `H`, `W`  
- **Word Structure**: `CA _ _ _`  
- **Untested Letters** (available for positions 3–5):  
  `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `V`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The letter `O` must appear in position 3 or 5.  
  - Avoid all absent letters (listed above).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- Prioritize testing `O` in position 3 or 5 to confirm its location.  
- Use untested common letters (e.g., `D`, `B`, `Y`) to maximize information.  
- **Selected word: ""CADDO""**:  
  - Fits the structure `CA _ _ _` and places `O` at position 5.  
  - Uses `D` (common, untested) and `O` (confirmed present) to test positions 3, 4, and 5.  
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (absence confirmed in prior feedback).  
  - Valid English word (a proper noun for a Native American tribe, accepted in Wordle).

Other vowels might be possible: O, U, I? But we don\'t know yet.\n   Consonants: We have C fixed at start, and we know R, N, E are out.\n\n Let\'s think of common 5-letter words starting with C that contain the letter A (but not in position 3) and without R, N, E.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 3: cannot be A, so we can try putting A in other positions: position 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Example words:\n   ""CABIN"" -> but contains N (which is forbidden) and also we haven\'t ruled out B and I. But wait, we cannot use N -> invalid.\n   ""CACTI"" -> has A at position 2? Let\'s check: C A C T I -> position 2 is A. However, note that we have feedback that A is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed. But does it contain any forbidden letter? It has T and I. No R, N, E. So ""cacti"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we also have two C\'s? The word ""cacti"" has two C\'s. Our feedback for the first C was a check, meaning that there is a C at position 1. If the word has two C\'s, that might be okay? But we don\'t know yet. The feedback for the second C in ""crane"" was not given because we don\'t have a C elsewhere? In our guess ""crane"", we had only one C.\n\n Let me recall: the secret word is known to have a C at position 1. If the word ""cacti"" is the secret, then it has a C at position 1 and also at position 3? But our feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n We must avoid positions that are already eliminated? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of other words:\n\n   ""CHAOS"": \n      Position 1: C -> good\n      Position 2: H -> unknown\n      Position 3: A -> but wait, in our feedback the A was marked as present but not in the third position? So we cannot put A at position 3. Therefore, ""CHAOS"" would have A at position 3 -> not allowed in the secret? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say that A cannot be at position 3? Wait, let me clarify.\n\n The feedback for guess ""crane"" (positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) said:\n   Position 3: A was marked as in the word but wrong position? Actually, no: the symbol is ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. So indeed, the secret word has the letter A, but not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Actually, we are free to put any letter at any position, but the feedback will tell us. However, we know the word does have an A and it\'s not at position 3.\n\n In our next guess, if we put A at a new position, we can get more information.\n\n How about a word that has A in position 2? Or position 4? Or position 5?\n\n Let\'s try to list some words without R, N, E and with a known C at the start and an A somewhere else.\n\n Common words:\n   ""CAMPY"" -> has M, P, Y and A at position 2? But we don\'t know if M, P, Y are present? And we have to avoid E? But this word doesn\'t have E -> valid? But it has A at position 2.\n\n However, we must avoid letters we know are not present: R, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, ""CABAL"" -> has A at position 2 and 4? Also has B, L. But note: it has A at two places? And it has B and L.\n\n But let\'s try to get a word that uses more common letters to eliminate possibilities.\n\n Another idea: use a word that has A and other vowels? We haven\'t tested O, U, I? But we know the word must contain A.\n\n Considering the available letters, let me think of:\n\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 2: try a vowel? But we know the word doesn\'t have E, so try O, I, U? Or a consonant?\n\n How about ""COAST""? -> but it has O, S, T. However, note that we cannot use R (which we avoid) and N and E. But wait, ""coast"" has A at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? No, we can put A at any position? Actually, we are not forbidden to put A at position 3? But we know the word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Or at best wrong position? Actually, the feedback would mark it as \'-\' only if the word has an A elsewhere? Wait, no: if we put A at position 3 and the word does have an A but not in position 3, then we get \'-\' for A? Or if the word has two A\'s and one is at position 3? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we know the word does have one A? Actually, we don\'t know if it has more? But from the feedback, we had only one A and it was at position 3 (and got \'-\') meaning the word has an A but not at position 3.\n\n So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be incorrect? But we can do that? However, that doesn\'t give new information. So it\'s better to try A in a new position.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Proposed guess: ""CHASM""\n   C at 1 -> correct\n   Then letters: H, A (at position 3? Wait, we are putting A at position 3? But we want to avoid position 3? Because we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, we expect the feedback to be \'-\' again? Or maybe it doesn\'t matter? Actually, we should avoid placing A in a position we know it\'s not? Only if there\'s no alternative? But ""CHASM"" has A at position 3 -> same as before? So that doesn\'t tell us anything new.\n\n Let me try ""CABIN"": contains N -> forbidden.\n\n ""CAGED"": contains E -> forbidden.\n\n ""CALIF"": contains L, I, F -> but we can try? However, note that the word must not have R, N, E -> valid? And A is at position 2.\n\n So ""CALIF"" is a candidate? But we don\'t know about L and I.\n\n Another common word: ""CANDY"" -> has N -> forbidden.\n\n ""CANOE"" -> has N and E -> forbidden.\n\n ""CAPUT"" -> C, A at position 2, P, U, T -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.\n\n Another: ""CAULK"" -> has U, L, K -> avoids R,N,E -> valid.\n\n But note: we need to maximize information. We also want to test new common consonants.\n\n Since we have fixed the first letter as C and know that A is in the word (but not at position 3), we can try to put A at position 2 and then use other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated: like L, T, S, O, etc.\n\n How about ""CANDY""? -> invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? -> contains E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CACTI"" again? It has C at the start, A at position 2, and then C at position 3? We don\'t know about the second C? The secret word has at least one C (at position 1). But it might have another? We don\'t know.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is acceptable? It doesn\'t have R, N, E.\n\n Let me consider: \n   CACTI: \n      Pos1: C -> will be correct? Because we know the first letter is C.\n      Pos2: A -> we want to see if A is at position 2? The secret word has an A somewhere but not at position 3? So if we put it at position 2, it might be correct or just present? We don\'t know.\n      Pos3: C -> this C: if the secret word has a C at position 3, it would be correct? Or if it has a C elsewhere? We only know the secret word has C at position 1. It might have more than one C? So we are testing for that.\n\n And T and I are new letters.\n\n So ""CACTI"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of a word that places A at position 4 or 5?\n\n Example: ""CLAMP"" -> A at position 3? Again position 3? But we already know A is not at position 3? So putting it at position 3 again won\'t help? So we should avoid.\n\n How about ""CIVIC""? -> but A is missing? We know the word must contain A? So we have to include A.\n\n So we must have A in our guess? Yes, because we haven\'t ruled out other vowels? But we know the word has an A? So we must include A? Actually, no? We are not forced to include known letters? But it would be wise to do so to get more information.\n\n Therefore, any new guess must include the letter A? We know A is present? So we must include A? Or not? Actually, we can exclude A? But then we wouldn\'t get information about where it is? So it\'s better to include A to test new positions.\n\n So we want a word that:\n   - Starts with C\n   - Contains A (so we can test a new position for A)\n   - Avoids R, N, E\n   - Uses new common letters.\n\n Let me consider: ""CAMPY""? -> it has M, P, Y? But we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""CAPUT"" -> A at position 2? Then P, U, T.\n\n How about ""CARET""? -> has R -> forbidden? And E -> forbidden? So not allowed.\n\n ""CAULD""? -> not a common word? And it has U, L, D? Avoids R,N,E? But we can\'t use non-verified words? We must use English words.\n\n Another common word: ""CARTY""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CAUSE""? -> but it has E? Wait, ""CAUSE"": C A U S E -> has E -> forbidden.\n\n How about ""CHAOS"" again? C H A O S -> A at position 3 -> we want to avoid position 3? But we can still try? But if we put A at position 3 we know it\'s not going to be correct? So we are wasting the position? So let me avoid.\n\n After some thought, I choose ""CACTI"" because it seems to be valid and contains new letters.\n\n But note: ""cacti"" is a plant and a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s guess ""CACTI"".\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""CHAIS""? Not a common word? Or ""CHASM""? But ""CHASM"": A at position 3? Avoid.\n\n Another valid word: ""CALKS"" -> but not very common? Or ""CALMS""? A at position 2 -> good? And avoids forbidden letters?\n\n ""CALMS"": C A L M S -> avoids R, N, E? Yes. And A at position 2? So we can test A at position 2.\n\n Which word gives more information? \n   ""CACTI"": tests a second C at position 3, and T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": tests A at position 2, and L, M, S.\n\n Both seem viable.\n\n Given we have only 5 letters and we want to maximize the number of new letters, let\'s compare:\n   ""CACTI"": letters C (already known), A (known), C (again), T, I -> essentially two new letters: T and I? But C is repeated? So we test for duplicate C? And T and I.\n   ""CALMS"": letters C, A, L, M, S -> tests L, M, S which are common.\n\n Actually, ""CALMS"" introduces three new letters (L, M, S) and avoids duplication? So it might be better.\n\n We also haven\'t tried L, M, S? So we can get more feedback.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CALMS"".\n\n Word: CALMS\n\n<guess>calms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nWe know:\n- The word starts with C.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n- R, N, and E are absent.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with C.\n- Must include A (but avoid position 3).\n- Avoid R, N, E.\n- Test new common letters to maximize information.\n- Good candidate: ""CALMS"", as it:\n  - Places A in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Introduces new common letters L, M, S.\n  - Uses distinct letters except C (already confirmed) to cover more ground.\n  - Avoids invalid letters (R, N, E).\n\n<guess>calms</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""calms""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  A: ✓ (correct position)\n  L: x (not in the word)\n  M: x (not in the word)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nNow, combining the feedback:\n\n- The first letter is C (from both guesses).\n- The second letter is A (from the second guess, which was correct).\n- From the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3, but now we know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n\nAdditionally, we know the following letters are not in the word:\n  R, N, E (from first guess)\n  L, M, S (from second guess)\n\nSo the word has:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n\nAnd the word does not contain: R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nWe also know that the word must contain the letter A, but we now know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s fixed.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", and does not contain R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nWhat are the remaining positions? Positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits the known information and tests new letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words starting with ""CA"" that avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nPossible letters for positions 3,4,5: \n  We can use any letter except: R, N, E, L, M, S, and also we know the first two are C and A, so we don\'t need to avoid C and A? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know yet.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nSo the tested and absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S.\n\nThe tested and present letters: C (position 1), A (position 2).\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that starts with ""CA"" and uses only the untested letters? Not necessarily, but we should avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _\n\nAnd the remaining three letters must be from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we have only one C and one A so far? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates of other letters.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""CABIN"": but contains B and I? But also N -> N is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CABBY"": contains B and Y? But also B repeated? And avoids forbidden? Let\'s check: no R,N,E,L,M,S? But it has B and Y. However, ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver. But note: we have two B\'s? The word is C A B B Y -> so positions: 3:B, 4:B, 5:Y. But we don\'t know if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B. However, we must avoid N, E, R, L, M, S -> so B is allowed. But wait, the word has two B\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicate so far? So we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words that test more common letters.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""CACHE"": but E is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CACTI"": we considered earlier? But now we know position 2 is A, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I -> but we have a C at position 3? We know the first letter is C, but we don\'t know if there is another C? However, we have already tested C at position 1 and it was correct. But we haven\'t tested C at other positions? So we can test for duplicate C? But note: in ""CACTI"", the first C is fixed, and the third letter is C. But we also have the forbidden letter issue? ""CACTI"" has T and I, which are allowed? And avoids R,N,E,L,M,S? Yes. But wait, we have two C\'s? So we are testing if there is a C at position 3? And also testing T and I.\n\nBut we already know position 2 is A, so in ""CACTI"", the second letter is A? That\'s correct? So we would have:\n  Position 1: C (correct)\n  Position 2: A (correct)\n  Position 3: C -> we don\'t know? It might be correct or not?\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: I\n\nBut we are trying to get information about the remaining positions? So testing C at position 3 might be useful? But we already have a C at position 1? So if the word has two C\'s, then it\'s possible? Or if not, then we know.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nAnother word: ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> but we have two C\'s? And T and H. But note: we have to avoid S? ""catch"" doesn\'t have S? But it has T, C, H. However, we have two C\'s? And we are testing T and H.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid using the same letter multiple times? Because if we use a letter that is not in the word, we get an \'x\', and if it is in the word but wrong position, we get \'-\', and if correct, we get \'✓\'. But with duplicates, it might be tricky? But Wordle handles duplicates? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut we want to maximize new letters? So using a word with duplicate C might not be efficient? Because we are using a letter we already know? But we don\'t know if there is a second C? So it\'s worth testing? But we have many other letters to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters? For example:\n\n- ""CAPUT"": C A P U T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And tests P, U, T.\n\nBut we know position 2 is A? So ""CAPUT"" would be:\n  C (correct), A (correct), P, U, T.\n\nThis tests three new letters: P, U, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.\n\n""CAULD"" is not common? \n\n""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> but L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid.\n\n""CAWED"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""CAHOW"": not common? And has H, O, W? But avoids forbidden? Let\'s see: C A H O W -> no R,N,E,L,M,S? So valid? But ""cahow"" is a bird? Might be too obscure.\n\n""CAPIZ"": not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": C A P O T -> tests P, O, T. Valid? Yes, avoids forbidden.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""CATTY"": C A T T Y -> has T repeated? But we don\'t know if T is in the word? So we can test T? But we are using two T\'s? That might not be efficient? Because if T is not in the word, we get two x\'s? But if it is, we get at least one non-x? So it\'s okay? But we are using two positions for the same letter? So we get less information.\n\nBetter to use distinct letters? So ""CAPUT"" or ""CAPOT"" or ""CAPIZ""?\n\nBut ""CAPUT"" is a valid English word? Meaning a head or a division? It\'s accepted in Wordle? I think so.\n\nBut let me think of more common words: \n\n- ""CABIN"" -> invalid (N)\n- ""CABLE"" -> invalid (E and L? L is forbidden? Yes, L is absent so we cannot use L? And E is absent? So invalid)\n- ""CACAO"" -> C A C A O -> duplicate C and duplicate A? We know A is in the word? But we don\'t know if there is a second A? And we know C is at position 1? So we are testing C at position 3? And A at position 4? But we already know A is at position 2? So if we put A at position 4, it might be present? But we don\'t know? However, we are using duplicate A? And duplicate C? So we are testing two positions with known letters? That might not be efficient? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing positions 3 and 4 with C and A? But we already know the word has at least one C and one A? So if we get a \'-\' for the second A, that means there is a second A? But we don\'t care? We just need to find the correct letters.\n\nBut we have only three positions to fill? And we are testing two of them with known letters? So we only test one new letter? That\'s inefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think ""CAPUT"" is a good choice: it tests three new letters: P, U, T.\n\nAnother option: ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? But with two B\'s? So we test two new letters? But with a duplicate? So less efficient? \n\n""CAPUT"" has distinct new letters: P, U, T.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CAPUT"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""Caput"" is a Latin word used in English, meaning a head or a chapter. It is accepted in Wordle? I believe so.\n\nAlternatively, to be more common, what about ""CATTY""? But duplicate T? \n\nOr ""CATCH"": C A T C H -> duplicate C? And tests T and H? But we have two C\'s? So we are testing position 3 with T and position 4 with C? And position 5 with H? So we test T, C, H? But we already know C? So we are testing for a second C? And T and H.\n\nBut we have many letters to test? So testing for a second C might not be the best? Because if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate? But if not, we know there isn\'t? But we are using a position that could test a new letter? So it\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think for now, we should avoid duplicates to maximize new letters? So ""CAPUT"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""CARGO"" -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CANTO"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAFES"" -> E and S? Both forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAVIL"" -> L forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAPON"" -> N forbidden? Invalid.\n\n""CAPED"" -> E and D? E forbidden? Invalid.\n\nSo ""CAPUT"" seems a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let me check: we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? And we are testing P, U, T.\n\nWe can also consider ""CABOB"" -> not common? \n\n""CADDY"": has D and Y? But avoids forbidden? And tests D and Y? But with two D\'s? So duplicate? \n\n""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> positions 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y? So we test D and Y? But with duplicate D? So we get less information? \n\nI think ""CAPUT"" is better.\n\nAnother option: ""CABIN"" is invalid? \n\n""CAJON"": has J and O? But avoids forbidden? But ""cajon"" is a musical instrument? Might be accepted? But let\'s stick to more common words.\n\n""CAPUT"" is in the Wordle dictionary? I think it is? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAPOT"" is a word? Meaning in card games? \n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a more common word: ""CATCH"" is common? But has duplicate C? \n\nHow about ""CARTY""? Not common? \n\n""CAVES"" -> E and S? Forbidden? \n\n""CAULK"" -> but L and K? L is forbidden? We know L is not in the word? So invalid? \n\nWait, we know L is absent? So we cannot use L? \n\nAnother common word: ""CABIN"" no? \n\n""CAPER"" -> has R and E? Forbidden? \n\n""CASTE"" -> has E? Forbidden? \n\n""CANAL"" -> has N and L? Forbidden? \n\nSo I think ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? \n\nBut let me think of ""CABIN"" without N? Not possible? \n\n""CAPUT"" is the best so far? \n\nAnother word: ""CABAL"" -> but L? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVED"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVES"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVIE"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAVIL"" -> L? Forbidden? \n\n""CAWED"" -> E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAULD"" -> not common? \n\n""CAUKY"" -> not common? \n\n""CAUPS"" -> not common? \n\nSo I think ""CAPUT"" is a valid choice? \n\nBut we have ""CAPTION""? Too long? \n\nNo, we need 5 letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CAPIZ"" -> a type of oyster? Might be too obscure? \n\n""CAPHS"" -> not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": I think ""capot"" is a valid word? \n\nBut to maximize commonality, let\'s choose ""CATCH""? Even though it has duplicate C? \n\nBut we are playing to get information? So let\'s do ""CATCH"": \n\n  C A T C H\n\nWe know:\n  Position 1: C (correct)\n  Position 2: A (correct)\n\nThen:\n  Position 3: T -> we test T\n  Position 4: C -> we test if there is a C at position 4? \n  Position 5: H\n\nSo we test T, C, H? But we already know C is in the word? So if we get a ✓ for the second C, then we know there is a duplicate C? And if we get a \'-\' for the second C, then we know there is a C elsewhere? But we already have C at position 1? So if we get a \'-\' for the second C, that would mean there is a third C? Or if we get an \'x\', then there is no duplicate? \n\nBut we are testing three new letters? Actually, T and H are new? And C is known? So we are testing two new letters? And one known letter? \n\nWhereas ""CAPUT"" tests three new letters? \n\nSo ""CAPUT"" is better? \n\nBut let me see if there is a word with three new distinct letters? \n\n""CAPUT"" is one? \n\n""CAPOT"" is another? \n\n""CADGY"" -> not common? \n\n""CADGY"" means cheerful? But not common? \n\n""CAFIZ"" -> not common? \n\n""CAPOT"": meaning in piquet, to win all the tricks? \n\nI think ""CAPUT"" is more common? \n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a word that is definitely common: ""CATCH"" is common? \n\nBut I found another: ""CABIN"" is not? \n\n""CAVAT"" -> not a word? \n\n""CAVES"" invalid? \n\n""CAXON"" -> not common? \n\nI think we have to go with ""CAPUT"" or ""CATCH"". \n\nBut let me check the Wordle dictionary? I can\'t, but I\'ll assume ""CAPUT"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAPOT"" is also acceptable? \n\nBut I recall that Wordle uses common words? \n\nAnother word: ""CABOB"" -> not common? \n\n""CAKED"" -> has E? No, ""caked"" is C A K E D -> has E? Forbidden? \n\n""CAKED"" has E? Yes, so invalid? \n\n""CAKEY"" -> has E? No, ""cakey"" is C A K E Y -> has E? Forbidden? \n\nSo not? \n\n""CAPUT"" it is? \n\nBut let me think of ""CABIN"" without the N? Not possible? \n\n""CAPON"" has N? \n\n""CAPUT"" is the best? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CAPUT"". \n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters? \n\n""CAPUT"": C, A, P, U, T -> no R, N, E, L, M, S? Correct? \n\nYes? \n\nSo guess: CAPUT\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nWe hope to get information about P, U, T? \n\nIf we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position? \n\nIf we get a \'-\', then the letter is in the word but wrong position? \n\nIf \'x\', then not in the word? \n\nAnd we also get information about duplicate letters? But we don\'t have duplicates in this guess? \n\nSo it\'s good? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""CAPUT"". \n\n<guess>caput</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - R, N, E are absent from the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: CALMS**  \n  Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed again).  \n  - A is correct and in position 2 (new information).  \n  - L, M, S are absent from the word.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Correct positions**:  \n  - Position 1: C  \n  - Position 2: A  \n- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, L, M, S (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- **Word structure**: `C A _ _ _`  \n- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters).  \n- **Constraints**:  \n  - The word must start with ""CA"".  \n  - Avoid R, N, E, L, M, S.  \n  - Test new letters to maximize information for positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Prioritize a word starting with ""CA"" using untested common letters (e.g., T, P, H, D, B, O).  \n- Avoid letters already ruled out (R, N, E, L, M, S).  \n- Test multiple new letters at once to gather more feedback.  \n- **Selected word: ""CAPUT""**  \n  - Why?  \n    - Starts with ""CA"" (fits known positions).  \n    - Uses new common letters: P, U, T (tests positions 3, 4, 5).  \n    - Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E, L, M, S).  \n    - Valid English word (meaning: a head or a division, e.g., in anatomy or law).\n\n<guess>caput</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: calms -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: caput -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) P(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> \n  C: ✓ (correct position) \n  R: x (not in the word) \n  A: - (in the word but not in position 3) \n  N: x (not in the word) \n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""calms"" -> \n  C: ✓ (correct position) \n  A: ✓ (correct position) \n  L: x (not in the word) \n  M: x (not in the word) \n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""caput"" -> \n  C: ✓ (correct position) \n  A: ✓ (correct position) \n  P: x (not in the word) \n  U: x (not in the word) \n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nCombining the feedback:\n\n- Position 1: C (confirmed)\n- Position 2: A (confirmed)\n- Absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T (from the x in the feedback)\n\nSo the word must start with ""CA"", and the remaining three positions (3,4,5) must not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nWe know the word has the letter A? But wait, from the first guess we knew that A was in the word but not in position 3? But now we have position 2 as A? So that A is accounted for? And there is no indication of multiple A\'s? So we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s? But we have to consider that possibility? \n\nActually, the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A was in the word (via \'-\') but since we now know it was correctly placed at position 2 in the second guess, and we didn\'t get any additional indication of extra A\'s? So it might be that there is only one A? Or there could be more? But we don\'t have any information to suggest duplicates? So we proceed without knowing? \n\nBut in the third guess ""caput"", we did not put any A apart from position 2? So we didn\'t test for another A? \n\nNow, we need to guess a word that starts with ""CA"", and the next three letters are from the remaining untested alphabet, excluding the absent letters.\n\nList of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nSo the absent letters are: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nWhat letters haven\'t been tested and are allowed? \n\nWe have tested: \n- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E\n- From ""calms"": L, M, S (and confirmed C and A)\n- From ""caput"": P, U, T\n\nSo tested and absent: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T.\n\nTested and present: C (position 1), A (position 2).\n\nThe remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word starting with ""CA"" using only these letters? For positions 3,4,5.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""CABBY"": C A B B Y -> uses B and Y? But B is allowed? Y is allowed? And we have two B\'s? That\'s acceptable? But ""cabby"" is a word? Yes, meaning a taxi driver.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if B or Y are in the word? We hope to test them? \n\nBut wait, we are also testing for the possibility of duplicate B? \n\nOther words:\n\n- ""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> uses D and Y? With duplicate D? \n\n- ""CAGED"": but E is forbidden? So invalid? \n\n- ""CAIRD"": not common? \n\n- ""CAJON"": uses J and O? J might be uncommon? But valid? Meaning a Peruvian box drum? \n\nBut let\'s see more common options:\n\n- ""CAFES"": has E and S? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CAGED"": E? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CAKED"": E? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CABIN"": N forbidden? \n\n- ""CAVIL"": L forbidden? \n\n- ""CAWED"": E forbidden? \n\n- ""CABOB"": not common? \n\n- ""CACKY"": not common? \n\n- ""CAFFS"": S forbidden? \n\n- ""CALFS"": L, S forbidden? \n\nSo it\'s tricky? \n\nAnother word: ""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> uses H, O, W? Avoids forbidden? \n\n""Cahow"" is a bird? Might be obscure? \n\nAnother: ""CAIRD"": Scottish for a traveling tinker? Not common? \n\n""CAJON"": better? \n\n""CAKED"" has E? \n\nWhat about ""CALYX"": but L and S? L is absent? And S? Actually, ""calyx"" is C A L Y X -> L is absent? So invalid? \n\n""CANBY"" -> N forbidden? \n\n""CAPED"" -> P and E forbidden? \n\n""CAPOT"" -> P forbidden? We now know P is absent? So cannot use P? \n\n""CAPHS"" -> P and S forbidden? \n\nWe must avoid P? Because guess 3 confirmed P is absent? \n\nSimilarly, U and T are absent? \n\nSo with the forbidden letters including P, U, T? So no? \n\nSo back to: \n\nLet me list allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must be of the form: C A _ _ _\n\nNow, common words? \n\n- ""CABBY""?\n- ""CADGY""? not common? \n- ""CAFIZ""? not common? \n- ""CAGOT""? but G and O? But we don\'t know if they are allowed? But avoid? Wait, not forbidden? \n\n""CAGOT"": a word for a Spanish outcast? Obscure? \n\n- ""CAHOW""? \n\n- ""CANDY"": N? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CABIN"": N? \n\n- ""CAJOLLO"": too long? \n\n5 letters only? \n\n""CAIRD""? \n\n""CAVED"": E forbidden? \n\n""CAWKS"": not common? \n\n""CAXON"": not common? \n\nPerhaps ""CABOB""? \n\nBut ""caddy"" might work? ""Caddy"" as in golf? \n\n""CABIN"" is invalid? \n\nAnother idea: ""CABIN"" is 5 letters? But has N? \n\nWait, we have to avoid N? \n\n""CAVED"" invalid? \n\n""CAVIL"" invalid? \n\n""CAWED"" invalid? \n\n""CAYEN"": not common? \n\n""CAIRD"" might be acceptable? \n\nBut let\'s look for words with vowels? We have A at position 2? So positions 3,4,5 can be consonants or vowels? \n\nPossible vowels? O, I? Remember, we know E is absent? So no E? \n\nWords: \n\n- ""CAVIE"": E? Forbidden? \n\n- ""CABIO"": uses B and I and O? Avoids forbidden? So C A B I O? \n\nBut we haven\'t used B before? Is that a word? ""Cabio"" is not common? \n\n- ""CABOB"" meaning shish kebab? Sometimes spelled ""kebab"" but ""cabob"" is a variant? \n\nBut let\'s try to find everyday words: \n\n""CADDY"": C A D D Y -> meaning a container or in golf? \n\n""CADDY"" avoids forbidden? D and Y are allowed? But we have two D\'s? So we test D and Y? \n\nSimilarly, ""CABBY"" tests B and Y? \n\nOther options: \n\n""CAJON"": if accepted, uses J, O? And N? Wait, ""cajon"" is C A J O N? But N is forbidden? So ""cajon"" has N? Invalid? \n\nWord ""cajon"": spelling? C-A-J-O-N? Yes, but N is forbidden? So we cannot use? \n\n""CAHOT"": not common? \n\n""CAKED"": E? \n\nWe must avoid E? \n\n""CAKEN"": N and E? \n\nSo few common words? \n\nAnother possibility: ""CAMPO""? But M? Forbidden? We know M is absent? \n\nNo, M is in the absent list? \n\n""CANOE"": N, E? Forbidden? \n\nPerhaps ""CABOC""? Not common? \n\nI think ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are the most common? \n\nSo between ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"": \n\n- ""CABBY"": tests B and Y? With two B\'s? \n- ""CADDY"": tests D and Y? With two D\'s? \n\nBoth introduce two new letters? \n\nBut we also want to test positions? \n\nWe can choose which one? \n\nLet\'s look at the letters: \n- B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nCommon consonants: B, D, H, O, Y? Vowels: O, I? \n\nBut in 5-letter words starting with ""CA"", common words might be ""CABIN"" or ""CABAL""? But both have forbidden letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CAFARD""? Too long? \n\n""CAIRD"": Scottish, meaning a piece of low ground? Might be accepted? But let\'s avoid? \n\n""CAVIL"" invalid? \n\n""CAVEMAN"" too long? \n\nWait, 5 letters? \n\n""CAVED"" invalid? \n\nPerhaps ""CAVED"" is 5 letters? C A V E D -> but E is forbidden? So no? \n\n""CAVIE"": has E? \n\nSo it seems like ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"" are candidates? \n\nBut they have duplicate letters? So less efficient? But we have no choice? \n\nAnother word without duplicates? \n\nFor example, ""CABOY""? Not a word? \n\n""CADIZ"": but D, I, Z? Avoids? ""Cadiz"" is a place? But S is not used? If spelled ""Cadiz"", then C A D I Z? That\'s 4 letters? Wait, ""cadiz"" is C-A-D-I-Z? Five letters? \n\n""Cadiz"" is a proper noun? But Wordle sometimes allows? \n\nUnclear? \n\n""CAHOW"": C A H O W -> no repeats? And tests H, O, W? Three new letters? \n\nAnd ""cahow"" is a bird? I think it is acceptable? \n\nSimilarly, ""CAJUN"": C A J U N? U and N? U is forbidden? We know U is absent? So invalid? \n\n""CAJUS""? not common? \n\n""CAJOLE"": too long? \n\n""CAHOW"" is a word? Let me confirm: cahow is a noun for a Bermuda petrel? But it might be in the dictionary? \n\nSo if we can use it? \n\nAnother: ""CAKIER""? too long? \n\n""CAKING"": K, I, G? But ""caking"" has E? No, ""caking"" is C A K I N G? Too long? \n\n5 letters: ""CAKIN""? Not common? \n\n""CAVEW""? not common? \n\nI think ""CAHOW"" is a valid choice? \n\nSince ""caput"" was accepted, ""cahow"" might be? \n\nAlternatively, ""CAVEW"" isn\'t a word? \n\n""CAVED"" invalid? \n\nSo I think I\'ll go with ""CAHOW"" because it tests three new distinct letters: H, O, W? And avoids duplicates? \n\nThere is also ""CAVI"": not a word? \n\n""CAVID"": not common? \n\nOther try: ""CAFES"": invalid? \n\nSo, guess ""CAHOW""? \n\nBut note: We are not forced to include new letters? But that\'s the best way? \n\nIf we don\'t, we might not find the word? \n\nSo I choose ""CAHOW"". \n\nBut let\'s double-check? \n\nAlternatively, ""CABBY"" is valid and common? And we test B and Y? \n\nSimilarly, ""CADGY"" is not common? \n\n""CADGY"" means jesting? \n\nBut Wordle might not include? \n\nLooking for common words, maybe ""CABBY"" is better? \n\nBut I found ""CABOC"": Scottish for a fish? Not common? \n\nSo i think ""CAHOW"" might be acceptable? \n\nBut let\'s see the response? \n\nBut to be safe, perhaps ""CABBY"" is better because it is more common? \n\nOr ""CADDY""? \n\n""CADDY"" is also common? \n\nBetween ""CABBY"" and ""CADDY"", which has more common letters? \n\nBoth are equally common? \n\nBut since we have no info, either is fine? \n\nBut we want to cover as many new letters as possible? \n\n""CABBY"" uses B and Y?

So the \'O\' is in the word, but not at position 4? \n\nAdditionally, W and H are absent? \n\nAbsent letters: \n  From guess1: R, N, E\n  From guess2: L, M, S\n  From guess3: P, U, T\n  From guess4: H, W  (since H(x) and W(x))\n\nAnd from guess4, O is present? But not at position 4? \n\nSo the absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W.\n\nSo the word must start with ""CA"", and contain the letter O? But O is not at position 4? And we have positions 3,5? \n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew that A was at a wrong position? But now we know it\'s at position 2? So that is solved? \n\nThe word structure: \n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: unknown? \n  Position 4: unknown?  but O is present but not at position 4? So position 4 cannot be O? \n  Position 5: unknown?\n\nBut O must be at either position 3 or 5?

So for the remaining positions? \n\nWe need to fill positions 3, 4, 5? \n\nThe word must have O at either position 3 or position 5? Because position 4 we know it cannot be? \n\nAlso, the word may have other letters? \n\nWe also know that from guess4, the O was in the word but not in position 4? So it must be in position 3 or 5? \n\nNow, the remaining letters to choose from: \n  B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? \n  But O is already included? So we don\'t need to include again? Unless duplicates? \n\nWe don\'t know if O appears more than once? But at least one O? \n\nSo for the next guess, we need to form a word: \n  C A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith letter3, letter4, letter5 from the remaining letters? \n\nAnd since O must be at position 3 or 5? So we can assume? \n\nBut to verify? \n\nCurrently, we know the word contains at least the letters: C, A, O? \n\nAnd the word is 5 letters? \n\nSo we can have two more letters? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters? \n\nNow, we need to make a guess that includes O? And places it at position 3 or 5? Because if we put O at position 3 and get a \'-\' or \'✓\', we can tell? \n\nBut we must also avoid the forbidden letters? \n\nSo let\'s form a word that puts O in position 3? \n\nBut what about position 5? \n\nWe also need to test other letters? \n\nCommon words starting with CA? \n\nBut positions: \n  Must have O at position 3? Or 5? \n\nFirst, case: O at position 3? \n  Then word: C A O _ _\n\nBut we need to fill the last two positions? \n\nWith the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z? \n\nCommon words: \n  ""CAOCH""? but H is absent? \n  ""CAOBS""?

Not? \n\nList: \n\nWe need a word starting with CA? Ending with O? \n\nFor example: ""CAMEO""? But M and E? Both absent? \n  M absent? E absent? \n\n""CANTO""? N? Absent? \n\n""CAPPO""? P and O?

""CAOBA""? meaning a tree? \n\nBut not common? \n\n""CAOCH"" invalid? \n\nPerhaps ""CAOID""? not common? \n\nWe might have to consider that the word has more letters? But we have to use the remaining allowed letters? \n\nBut note: there might be other words? \n\nAnother thought: we have not used the letter I? \n\nSo let\'s try positions: \n  3: O\n  4: I\n  5: ? \n\nBut what? C A O I ? \n\nWords: ""CAOID""? \n\nOr ""CAOIN""? N? \n\n""CAOIY""? not? \n\nNot common? \n\nWithout fixing O in a position? But we know it is in the word? And must be at 3 or 5? \n\nBut to test? Let\'s make a guess that places O at position 3? And then a word that tests possibilities? \n\nFor example, guess ""CAOW"" something? But we have only 5 letters? \n\nLet\'s form ""CAOXY""? not a word? \n\nPossible words with CA allowing O in position 3? With common? \n\nI cannot think of a common word ""CAO...""? \n\nThen O must be at position 5? \n\nSo let\'s assume O is at position 5? \n\nThen word: C A _ _ O\n\nAnd the missing letters must be from the allowed list? \n\nAnd we can try a word with that pattern? \n\nFor example: \n\n  ""CABBO"" -> has duplicate B? And O at the end? ""cabbo"" not a word? \n\n  ""CABOO"" -> not? \n\n  ""CADOO"" -> not common? \n\n  ""CAFFO"" -> F and O? ""caffo"" not common? \n\n  ""CAGIO"" -> G and I?

""Caddo"" is 5 letters? C A D D O? \n\nBut D is allowed? \n\nAnd we avoid forbidden? \n\nBut note: when we put O at position 5? And D at positions 3 and 4? \n\nSo ""caddo"" is C A D D O? \n\nAnd it has double D? \n\nAnd it uses D and O? \n\nBut O is position 5? \n\nAlso, we are testing D? \n\nSimilarly, if we try ""CAGYO"" not a word? \n\nSo ""CADDO"" might be a valid guess? \n\nBut is it common enough? \n\nAnother possibility: ""CADGY""? no, O not present? \n\n""CADIO"" not common? \n\nSo I think ""CADDO"" is a candidate? \n\nBut we are not sure if O is at position 5? \n\nWith feedback from guess4, we know O is present? But not at position 4? So it must be at 3 or 5? \n\nBut in ""CADDO"", O is at position 5? So if the O is at position 5, we get a \'✓\'? Or if it is at position 3, the O will be \'-\'? Because then it would be in the word but at position 3? Not at position 5? \n\nBut we are putting O at position 5? And if the word has O at position 3 and not at 5, then we get \'x\' for that O? Or \'-\' because it exists but not here? \n\nIf the secret has O only at position 3? And we put at position 5? Then we get a \'-\' for the O? Because it is in the word but wrong position? \n\nBut our feedback would show O at position 5 not in the word? But we already know O is in the word? So if we put at position 5, and it is not, then we get \'x\' for that O? \n\nIn feedback: \n  If O is at position 3 and we put at position 5, then for position 5? We have an \'x\'? And the \'-\' would have been already given? No, in the feedback for position 5, if O is not there? We get \'x\'? \n\nThen we learn that O is not at position 5? But we already know it must be at 3? \n\nSimilarly, if we put O at position 3? \n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word with O at position 3? \n\nTherefore, we try with O at position 5? \n\nGuess: ""CADDO"" \n\nBut ""caddo"" might be proper? But let me confirm? \n\nAnother common word: ""BUG GY""? \n\nOr for ""CA"" ending with O? \n\n""RADIO""? Not starts with CA? \n\nWe are stuck? \n\nAnother allowed letter: B? \n\n""CABOOR""? no? \n\n""BABOO""? \n\nNot? \n\nPerhaps ""CAVI"" no? \n\nLet\'s try to include other vowels? But we know E is absent? So O is the only vowel left? \n\nSo it must be O? \n\nTherefore, O must be at position 3 or 5? \n\nSo if we guess ""CADDO"", we test:\n\n  C: correct as usual\n  A: correct as usual\n  D at position 3: if correct? Or not?\n  D at position 4: if correct? Or not?\n  O at position 5: if it is there? \n\nAnd if not at position 5? We learn that O is at position 3? \n\nAnd we also test D? \n\nSo after this, we can hope to narrow down? \n\nWe only have 6 guesses? We are at guess 5? So just two left? \n\nAlternatively, given we have few choices? We can think of possible words? \n\nThe word starts with CA? \nContains O? Not at position 4? \nDoes not contain: R,N,E,L,M,S,P,U,T,H,W? \n\nAnd positions: 3,4,5 letters from: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,V,X,Y,Z? \n\nNow, words from the English language: \n\n- ""CABIO""? not common? \n- ""CADGY""? no O? \n- ""CADDY""? no O? \n- ""CAHOW"" already guessed? \n- ""CAFFY""?

We have the feedback from the fifth guess: ""caddo""
Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) D(x) D(x) O(✓)

This tells us:
- C is correct at position 1 (as before).
- A is correct at position 2 (as before).
- The first D (position 3) is not in the word (x).
- The second D (position 4) is not in the word (x).
- O is correct at position 5 (✓).

So now we know:
- The word is: C A _ _ O
- The letter O is at position 5.
- D is not in the word at all (since both D's are marked absent, meaning there are no D's in the word).

Additionally, from previous feedback, we know that O is present and not at position 4 (from guess 4), which is consistent because now we know it's at position 5.

We also have the list of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W, and now D.

The word must be of the form: C A ? ? O

The two middle positions (3 and 4) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and are not D.

The remaining letters that are not absent and not used (but we have tested C, A, O, and the absent ones) are: B, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z.

We also know from guess 1 that A was in the word but not at position 3 (which is now position 3 is open, but we have A at position 2, so that is consistent).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", ends with ""O"", and the third and fourth letters are from {B, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z}, and the word does not contain any absent letters.

Common words that end with ""O"" and start with ""CA"" are limited. Let's list some possibilities:

- ""CABO"": too short? No, we need 5 letters. ""Cabo"" is 4 letters.

- ""CACAO"": This is 5 letters: C A C A O. But note:
  - Position 1: C (correct)
  - Position 2: A (correct)
  - Position 3: C (we don't know yet)
  - Position 4: A (but we already have A at position 2? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't ruled out duplicate A or C)
  - Position 5: O (correct)

But we have to check if it uses any absent letters? It uses C and A again. The absent letters are R,N,E,L,M,S,P,U,T,H,W,D. So C and A are allowed? But we already have them.

However, in ""cacao"", we have two C's and two A's. We know the first C is correct and the first A is correct. The second C at position 3 and second A at position 4? We don't know.

But note: we have not tested a second C or second A? So it's possible.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""CAMPO""? But M is absent? Forbidden.

""CANTO""? N absent? Forbidden.

""CAPPO""? P absent? Forbidden.

""CARBO""? R absent? Forbidden.

""CASCO""? S absent? Forbidden.

""CAVEO""? V? But ""caveo"" is not a common word? And E? We don't have E? ""caveo"" would be C A V E O? But E is absent? So invalid.

""CAJKO""? Not a word.

""CAFIO""? Not common.

""CAKIO""? Not common.

""CAVIO""? Not common.

""CAZO""? 4 letters.

So ""CACAO"" seems to be a common word? Meaning the bean used to make chocolate.

So let's consider ""CACAO"".

In ""CACAO"", the letters are: C, A, C, A, O.

We know:
- Position 1: C (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 5: O (correct)

Now, for position 3: C? We don't know? But we have a C at position 1? So if the word has a second C? We don't know.

Similarly, position 4: A? We have an A at position 2? So if there is a second A?

But in the feedback for the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? But now we have A at position 2? So that A is accounted for? But if there is a second A? It might be at position 4? 

But we have no feedback about duplicate letters? So it's possible.

Moreover, we have not tested C at position 3? So we don't know.

But note: in the fifth guess ""caddo"", we had D at positions 3 and 4? And they were both absent? So no D.

Now, for ""cacao"", we are testing C at position 3 and A at position 4.

If we guess ""CACAO"", we might get:

- Position 3: if the secret word has C at position 3? Then ✓? Or if not, but C is in the word? Then '-'? Or if C is not in the word? Then 'x'? But we know there is at least one C at position 1? So if we put C at position 3 and it's not correct, it might be marked as '-' if there is a second C? Or 'x' if there is no second C.

Similarly for A at position 4.

But we are at the sixth guess? We have only one more guess? So we need to be careful.

Alternatively, are there other words?

What about ""CABIO""? But no O? And not 5 letters? ""CABIO"" is 5 letters? C A B I O? But we need to end with O? It ends with O? But position 5 is O? So ""CABIO"" would be C A B I O.

But we haven't tested B and I? And it avoids absent letters? 

Similarly, ""CAGIO""? C A G I O? 

But ""cagio"" is not common? 

""CABIO"" might be a surname? Not common.

Another word: ""CAJUN""? But U and N? U is absent? N is absent? Forbidden.

""CAVIE""? E absent.

""CAVY""? 4 letters.

So ""CACAO"" is the most common word that fits.

But let me confirm: the word ""cacao"" is valid in Wordle? Yes.

So I think we should guess ""CACAO"".

But note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities? 

For example, ""CAKEO""? But E? Forbidden.

""CAKEY""? But no O? And not ending with O? 

""CAKEO"" has E? 

So no.

""CAVEO"" has E? 

So I think ""CACAO"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""CACAO"".

  - Position 5: `O`  
- **Absent Letters** (cannot appear anywhere):  
  `R`, `N`, `E`, `L`, `M`, `S`, `P`, `U`, `T`, `H`, `W`, `D`  
- **Word Structure**: `C A _ _ O`  
- **Remaining Letters** (available for positions 3 and 4):  
  `B`, `F`, `G`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `V`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must start with `CA` and end with `O`.  
  - Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters from the remaining set above.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The only common English word fitting the structure `C A _ _ O` and avoiding all absent letters is **""CACAO""** (a bean used to make chocolate).  
  - **Why ""CACAO""?**  
    - `C` at position 1: Correct (known).  
    - `A` at position 2: Correct (known).  
    - `C` at position 3: Tests for a potential second `C` (not ruled out).  
    - `A` at position 4: Tests for a potential second `A` (not ruled out).  
    - `O` at position 5: Correct (known).  
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (absent list confirmed).  
  - Maximizes information: Tests positions 3 and 4 with plausible letters.  

<guess>cacao</guess>",cacao,"We have the feedback from the fifth guess: ""caddo""
Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) D(x) D(x) O(✓)

This tells us:
- C is correct at position 1 (as before).
- A is correct at position 2 (as before).
- The first D (position 3) is not in the word (x).
- The second D (position 4) is not in the word (x).
- O is correct at position 5 (✓).

So now we know:
- The word is: C A _ _ O
- The letter O is at position 5.
- D is not in the word at all (since both D's are marked absent, meaning there are no D's in the word).

Additionally, from previous feedback, we know that O is present and not at position 4 (from guess 4), which is consistent because now we know it's at position 5.

We also have the list of absent letters: R, N, E, L, M, S, P, U, T, H, W, and now D.

The word must be of the form: C A ? ? O

The two middle positions (3 and 4) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and are not D.

The remaining letters that are not absent and not used (but we have tested C, A, O, and the absent ones) are: B, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z.

We also know from guess 1 that A was in the word but not at position 3 (which is now position 3 is open, but we have A at position 2, so that is consistent).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CA"", ends with ""O"", and the third and fourth letters are from {B, F, G, I, J, K, V, X, Y, Z}, and the word does not contain any absent letters.

Common words that end with ""O"" and start with ""CA"" are limited. Let's list some possibilities:

- ""CABO"": too short? No, we need 5 letters. ""Cabo"" is 4 letters.

- ""CACAO"": This is 5 letters: C A C A O. But note:
  - Position 1: C (correct)
  - Position 2: A (correct)
  - Position 3: C (we don't know yet)
  - Position 4: A (but we already have A at position 2? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't ruled out duplicate A or C)
  - Position 5: O (correct)

But we have to check if it uses any absent letters? It uses C and A again. The absent letters are R,N,E,L,M,S,P,U,T,H,W,D. So C and A are allowed? But we already have them.

However, in ""cacao"", we have two C's and two A's. We know the first C is correct and the first A is correct. The second C at position 3 and second A at position 4? We don't know.

But note: we have not tested a second C or second A? So it's possible.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""CAMPO""? But M is absent? Forbidden.

""CANTO""? N absent? Forbidden.

""CAPPO""? P absent? Forbidden.

""CARBO""? R absent? Forbidden.

""CASCO""? S absent? Forbidden.

""CAVEO""? V? But ""caveo"" is not a common word? And E? We don't have E? ""caveo"" would be C A V E O? But E is absent? So invalid.

""CAJKO""? Not a word.

""CAFIO""? Not common.

""CAKIO""? Not common.

""CAVIO""? Not common.

""CAZO""? 4 letters.

So ""CACAO"" seems to be a common word? Meaning the bean used to make chocolate.

So let's consider ""CACAO"".

In ""CACAO"", the letters are: C, A, C, A, O.

We know:
- Position 1: C (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 5: O (correct)

Now, for position 3: C? We don't know? But we have a C at position 1? So if the word has a second C? We don't know.

Similarly, position 4: A? We have an A at position 2? So if there is a second A?

But in the feedback for the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? But now we have A at position 2? So that A is accounted for? But if there is a second A? It might be at position 4? 

But we have no feedback about duplicate letters? So it's possible.

Moreover, we have not tested C at position 3? So we don't know.

But note: in the fifth guess ""caddo"", we had D at positions 3 and 4? And they were both absent? So no D.

Now, for ""cacao"", we are testing C at position 3 and A at position 4.

If we guess ""CACAO"", we might get:

- Position 3: if the secret word has C at position 3? Then ✓? Or if not, but C is in the word? Then '-'? Or if C is not in the word? Then 'x'? But we know there is at least one C at position 1? So if we put C at position 3 and it's not correct, it might be marked as '-' if there is a second C? Or 'x' if there is no second C.

Similarly for A at position 4.

But we are at the sixth guess? We have only one more guess? So we need to be careful.

Alternatively, are there other words?

What about ""CABIO""? But no O? And not 5 letters? ""CABIO"" is 5 letters? C A B I O? But we need to end with O? It ends with O? But position 5 is O? So ""CABIO"" would be C A B I O.

But we haven't tested B and I? And it avoids absent letters? 

Similarly, ""CAGIO""? C A G I O? 

But ""cagio"" is not common? 

""CABIO"" might be a surname? Not common.

Another word: ""CAJUN""? But U and N? U is absent? N is absent? Forbidden.

""CAVIE""? E absent.

""CAVY""? 4 letters.

So ""CACAO"" is the most common word that fits.

But let me confirm: the word ""cacao"" is valid in Wordle? Yes.

So I think we should guess ""CACAO"".

But note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities? 

For example, ""CAKEO""? But E? Forbidden.

""CAKEY""? But no O? And not ending with O? 

""CAKEO"" has E? 

So no.

""CAVEO"" has E? 

So I think ""CACAO"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""CACAO"".
