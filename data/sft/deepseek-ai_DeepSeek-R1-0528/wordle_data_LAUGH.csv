We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are on the second guess since the first guess ""crane"" got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation of feedback for ""crane"":
 - C is not in the secret word at all (x)
 - R is not in the secret word at all (x)
 - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Therefore, we know:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3, and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since A is present, we must include A in our next guess. But note: we cannot use C, R, N, E.

 We are trying to form a 5-letter word that includes A (and not in the third position) and avoids C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters, and we only have one confirmed letter: A (somewhere else).

 For the next guess, we should try to test other common letters and also place A in a different position.

 What are common letters? We can try vowels: A is already present, so maybe other vowels? But note: the feedback didn't show any other vowel in the first word? Actually, we don't know.

 Available letters: except C, R, N, E, and we must avoid those.

 We can consider a word that has A and other common consonants like T, L, S, P, M, etc.

 However, note that the letter A was in position 3 in the first guess, so in the next word, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and do not contain C, R, N, E and have A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Also, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that might work:

 Option: ""TASKS"" - but that has S and K? And double S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually the rules don't forbid it, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 However, we must avoid C, R, N, E. So let's check: T, A, S, K, S? But note: we can use S because it's not forbidden yet.

 But wait: we don't know about T, S, K. Let's see:

 Another option: ""PASTA"" - contains A twice? Actually, it has A at position 2 and 5? And letters: P, A, S, T, A.

 But note: we have A twice? The feedback might be tricky? Also, in the secret word, how many A's? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PLAIT"" - but that has L and T? And I? Also, A at position 3? Wait, we must avoid position 3 for A? Because previous feedback: A was in position 3 and marked wrong position? So we can try placing A in other positions.

 But note: the feedback says A is in the wrong position, meaning it exists somewhere else. So for the next guess, we must put A in a different position.

 In ""PASTA"": 
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5.
 The A at position 2 and 5 are new positions? Also we have A twice? It's okay because the secret word might have duplicate A? We don't know.

 However, we are testing multiple new letters: P, S, T, and also A at positions 2 and 5? But the feedback might only tell us about one A? Actually, the feedback will show multiple marks if there are multiple? 

 But note: the feedback format doesn't specify that it marks each occurrence? Actually, it says ""each letter in your guess"", so each occurrence will be marked.

 So if the secret word has two A's, both A's in PASTA might get marked accordingly? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, it's better to avoid duplicates for now? To get clearer feedback? Because if we use two A's, and the word has one A, then only one A will be marked? And the other will be missed? Or marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each letter independently.

 But let me recall the rules: 
   - If a letter in the guess is in the word and in the correct position: ✓.
   - If a letter is in the word but not in the correct position: -.
   - If the letter is not in the word: x.

 Also, note: if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, then only the ones that match will get feedback? Actually, the rules don't specify that? In Wordle, the feedback works by comparing frequency? Actually, we have to assume that the feedback marks each letter independently? But let's think:

 Example: Secret: BRISK, Guess: SHEEP. The feedback would be: S (if S is present) ... but wait, let's imagine.

 Actually, the standard Wordle feedback algorithm: 
   First, mark the exact matches (position and letter). Then, for the rest, for a letter that is in the word but not matched, we mark one occurrence per each in the secret that hasn't been matched? So duplicates matter.

 Therefore, we might avoid duplicates at this stage? Because we have limited information.

 Let me think of words without duplicate letters and without C,R,N,E and with A? And A not in position 3.

 Word: ""PLAIT"" - has A at position 3? Avoid position 3: so we must avoid putting A at 3? Therefore, ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at 3.

 Word: ""PALMS"" - P, A (at position 2), L, M, S? That avoids position for A: 2? So far, we haven't tried position 2? Also, letters: P,A,L,M,S? All are new.

 But note: we are testing L, M, S? and P? That's good.

 Another option: ""SALTY"" - has A at position 2, S at 1, L at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Also avoids C,R,N,E? T and Y are new.

 However, note: we don't know if Y is allowed? It might be in the word? Also, common letters.

 Let me also consider: ""MANGO"" - avoids C,R,N,E? But N is forbidden? Because we had N in first guess and it was marked absent? So we must avoid N? So ""MANGO"" is invalid because it has N? Wait: M,A,N,G,O? N is forbidden? So no.

 Word: ""PAINT"" - N is forbidden? So no.

 Word: ""PAILS"" - P,A,I,L,S? A at position 2? So that's okay? And avoids forbidden letters? Also, new letters.

 But wait: we are avoiding E? PAILS: P, A, I, L, S -> yes, no E? Correct? Yes.

 Similarly, words like ""AUDIO"", but that has U and O? Okay? But U and O might be less common? Alternatively, ""MAVIN"" -> has V? and N is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""ABOUT""? But O, U? Also B? But we don't know about B? But note: in ""crane"", we had A and now we need to test new letters? Also, ""ABOUT"" has O, U, B? And A? But A is at position 2? Also, let's write: A at position 2? Actually: A is at position 1? Wait:

 ""ABOUT"": A (pos1), B (pos2), O (pos3), U (pos4), T (pos5)

 But in our feedback, A is marked as present but in wrong position? The secret word has A, but not at position 3? Now we don't know about position 1? Maybe?

 Also, we can test B, O, U, T? And we know A? So we can try.

 However, we are not sure? 

 Other words: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden? Because we got C absent? So no.

 ""PASTA"": We considered earlier? But has duplicate A? Actually: P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? So if the secret word has one A, then the feedback will mark one of the A's as present? and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark:
   The first A: at position 2? If the secret word has A at say position 1, then that would be '-' (wrong position) and then the last A: also marked based on the secret? But the secret has only one A: then the second A will be marked as 'x'? So it's okay? But we lose one space? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So maybe ""PLASM"" is not common? How about ""PAKSA""? Not English? 

 I think ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? And we can use it? Or ""PIZZA"" has duplicate Z? But we don't know? Also, Z is low frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SALSA"" has duplicate S and A? Not good? 

 So let's pick a word without duplicates? Like ""SALET"" (which is a word? Yes in some dictionaries). SALET: S, A, L, E, T? But E is forbidden? Because in crane, E was absent? So E is forbidden? We cannot use E.

 So we must avoid E. 

 Then, what about ""TAMPS"" - T, A, M, P, S? No duplicates? And A at position 2? And avoids E? Letters: T, A, M, P, S? All allowed? Because we haven't ruled them out? 

 Actually, ""TAMPS"" is a word? It means: to press something down? But it's a bit obscure? 

 Or ""PALMS""? We had that? 

 Another option: ""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y? But D? and Y? 

 Or ""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y? Has A at position 2? Letters: H,A,S,T,Y? H is new? 

 But note: we don't know about H? 

 Alternatively, let's stick to common words? 

 I think ""SALAD"" has duplicate A? So avoid? 

 I found: ""STAID"" - S, T, A, I, D? But has A at position 3? We need to avoid position 3? So no? Because if we put A at position 3, and the secret word doesn't have A there? But we know that position 3 is wrong? So avoid? Actually, we can try putting A at position 3? But we know it is not correct? So we must avoid? The feedback told us A is in the word but not at position 3? So putting A at position 3 again would be a waste? Because we know it will not be correct? 

 Therefore, avoid position 3? 

 So words with A at positions: 1,2,4,5? 

 Then: ""MATHS"" - M, A, T, H, S? -> A at position 2? Okay? 

 But we haven't tested M? T? H? S? That's good? But is MATHS common? Yes.

 Another: ""PATHY"" - not common? 

 Or ""FATAL"" -> duplicate A? Avoid? 

 Then, ""SPAWN"" - S, P, A, W, N? But N is forbidden? Because we tried N and it was absent? So forbidden? 

 So ""SPAWN"" invalid? 

 How about ""FATLY""? Not common? 

 Maybe ""TALKS""? -> T, A, L, K, S? A at position 2? Avoids bad letters? 

 ""TALKS"" is a word? Yes: talk in third person? Or noun? Like sales talks? 

 So TALKS: T, A, L, K, S? 

 Also avoids C,R,N,E? So we can try? 

 Similarly, ""WALKS""? W is less common? 

 So let's choose ""TALKS"". 

 But note: we might want to test more vowels? So far, we only know A is present? Are there other vowels? Maybe try a word with O? U? I? 

 But in TALKS: we have A again? And also testing T, L, K, S? And A? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word with another vowel? Like O? 

 Words with O? And A? And avoid bad letters? 

 For example: ""ABOVE"" -> E is bad? Forbidden? 

 ""ABOUT"" we considered? But O and U? and A at position 1? 

 In ""ABOUT"": A at position 1? We don't know about position 1? So it might be correct? Or not? 

 Also, we can test U? 

 Maybe ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S? No A? But we must include A because it is present? 

 Wait, remember: we must include A? Because we know the secret word has A? 

 Therefore, our next guess must include A? 

 So words without A are invalid? 

 Therefore, ""TALKS"" is acceptable: includes A? 

 Similarly, ""ABOUT"" includes A? 

 Which one is better? 

 ""TALKS"" has letters: T, A, L, K, S? 

 ""ABOUT"" has letters: A, B, O, U, T? 

 Which set of letters is more common? 

 In terms of frequency: 
   T is very common? 
   A is common? 
   L, K, S: common? 
   B, O, U: common? 

 But note: in ""ABOUT"", we are testing O (a vowel) and U? Which might be worth? 

 Also, we know that E is not in the word? So vowels? Only A? Or others? 

 We might want to know about other vowels? 

 So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is better? Because it has O and U? 

 But wait: in the secret word, we know A is present? And we don't know about other vowels? So testing O and U? 

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses A at position 1? 

 Previously in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And it was wrong? Now we put A at position 1? 

 That's good? 

 So I'm leaning toward ""ABOUT"". 

 However, note: we also know that R is absent? So no R? But ABOUT doesn't have R? So okay? 

 Also, C, E, N are absent? 

 So let's choose ""ABOUT""? 

 But wait: we are going to test: A at position 1? 

 Let's write:

 Guess: A B O U T

 What if the secret word has A? But not at position 1? Then we'll get A marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, since A is present, even if at position 1? If the secret word has A at position 1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? 

 But note: we know A is not at position 3? Because in ""crane"", position 3? Marked wrong? But positions 1,2,4,5? 

 So ABOUT puts A in position 1? So it might be correct? Or might not? Either way, we'll get feedback? 

 After thinking: 

 Another word is ""ADOBE"" - O and B? But E is forbidden? So no? 

 ""ABOVE"" forbidden? E? 

 ""ADIEU"" - has D, I, E? But E forbidden? 

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a reasonable choice? 

 But also ""WAQFS""? Not English? 

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for the next guess? 

 However, what about ""LASTS""? duplicate S? And has A at position 2? But duplicate? 

 Given the constraints, I'll pick ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, we could pick ""STAMP""? Without E? But note: we avoid R? And avoid E? But STAMP has S,T,A,M,P? A at position 3? We must avoid position 3? 

 Therefore, avoid? Position 3 for A? 

 So STAMP: A is at position 3? So we shouldn't use? 

 Then, let's choose ""ABOUT"" definitely? 

 So next guess: ABOUT

<guess>about</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word (marked with ✗).
- A is present but in the wrong position (marked with -).

Key deductions for the next guess:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. We must exclude C, R, N, E entirely from the new guess.
3. The new guess should include A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its location.
4. Prioritize testing common letters not yet evaluated (e.g., B, O, U, T) for efficiency.
5. Avoid letter repetition to prevent ambiguous feedback.

Selected word: **ABOUT**
- A is placed in position 1 (new position to test).
- Tests new letters: B, O, U, T (common consonants/vowels).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and avoids duplication.

<guess>about</guess>",about,"We are on the second guess since the first guess ""crane"" got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 But wait: we don't know about T, S, K. Let's see:

 But note: we have A twice? The feedback might be tricky? Also, in the secret word, how many A's? We don't know.

 Similarly, words like ""AUDIO"", but that has U and O? Okay? But U and O might be less common? Alternatively, ""MAVIN"" -> has V? and N is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""ABOUT""? But O, U? Also B? But we don't know about B? But note: in ""crane"", we had A and now we need to test new letters? Also, ""ABOUT"" has O, U, B? And A? But A is at position 2? Also, let's write: A at position 2? Actually: A is at position 1? Wait:

 ""ABOUT"": A (pos1), B (pos2), O (pos3), U (pos4), T (pos5)

 But in our feedback, A is marked as present but in wrong position? The secret word has A, but not at position 3? Now we don't know about position 1? Maybe?

 Also, we can test B, O, U, T? And we know A? So we can try.

 However, we are not sure? 

 Other words: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden? Because we got C absent? So no.

 ""PASTA"": We considered earlier? But has duplicate A? Actually: P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? So if the secret word has one A, then the feedback will mark one of the A's as present? and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark:
   The first A: at position 2? If the secret word has A at say position 1, then that would be '-' (wrong position) and then the last A: also marked based on the secret? But the secret has only one A: then the second A will be marked as 'x'? So it's okay? But we lose one space? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So maybe ""PLASM"" is not common? How about ""PAKSA""? Not English? 

 I think ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? And we can use it? Or ""PIZZA"" has duplicate Z? But we don't know? Also, Z is low frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SALSA"" has duplicate S and A? Not good? 

 So let's pick a word without duplicates? Like ""SALET"" (which is a word? Yes in some dictionaries). SALET: S, A, L, E, T? But E is forbidden? Because in crane, E was absent? So E is forbidden? We cannot use E.

 So we must avoid E. 

 Then, what about ""TAMPS"" - T, A, M, P, S? No duplicates? And A at position 2? And avoids E? Letters: T, A, M, P, S? All allowed? Because we haven't ruled them out? 

 Actually, ""TAMPS"" is a word? It means: to press something down? But it's a bit obscure? 

 Or ""PALMS""? We had that? 

 Another option: ""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y? But D? and Y? 

 Or ""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y? Has A at position 2? Letters: H,A,S,T,Y? H is new? 

 But note: we don't know about H? 

 Alternatively, let's stick to common words? 

 I think ""SALAD"" has duplicate A? So avoid? 

 I found: ""STAID"" - S, T, A, I, D? But has A at position 3? We need to avoid position 3? So no? Because if we put A at position 3, and the secret word doesn't have A there? But we know that position 3 is wrong? So avoid? Actually, we can try putting A at position 3? But we know it is not correct? So we must avoid? The feedback told us A is in the word but not at position 3? So putting A at position 3 again would be a waste? Because we know it will not be correct? 

 Therefore, avoid position 3? 

 So words with A at positions: 1,2,4,5? 

 Then: ""MATHS"" - M, A, T, H, S? -> A at position 2? Okay? 

 But we haven't tested M? T? H? S? That's good? But is MATHS common? Yes.

 Another: ""PATHY"" - not common? 

 Or ""FATAL"" -> duplicate A? Avoid? 

 Then, ""SPAWN"" - S, P, A, W, N? But N is forbidden? Because we tried N and it was absent? So forbidden? 

 So ""SPAWN"" invalid? 

 How about ""FATLY""? Not common? 

 Maybe ""TALKS""? -> T, A, L, K, S? A at position 2? Avoids bad letters? 

 ""TALKS"" is a word? Yes: talk in third person? Or noun? Like sales talks? 

 So TALKS: T, A, L, K, S? 

 Also avoids C,R,N,E? So we can try? 

 Similarly, ""WALKS""? W is less common? 

 So let's choose ""TALKS"". 

 But note: we might want to test more vowels? So far, we only know A is present? Are there other vowels? Maybe try a word with O? U? I? 

 But in TALKS: we have A again? And also testing T, L, K, S? And A? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word with another vowel? Like O? 

 Words with O? And A? And avoid bad letters? 

 For example: ""ABOVE"" -> E is bad? Forbidden? 

 ""ABOUT"" we considered? But O and U? and A at position 1? 

 In ""ABOUT"": A at position 1? We don't know about position 1? So it might be correct? Or not? 

 Also, we can test U? 

 Maybe ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S? No A? But we must include A because it is present? 

 Wait, remember: we must include A? Because we know the secret word has A? 

 Therefore, our next guess must include A? 

 So words without A are invalid? 

 Therefore, ""TALKS"" is acceptable: includes A? 

 Similarly, ""ABOUT"" includes A? 

 Which one is better? 

 ""TALKS"" has letters: T, A, L, K, S? 

 ""ABOUT"" has letters: A, B, O, U, T? 

 Which set of letters is more common? 

 In terms of frequency: 
   T is very common? 
   A is common? 
   L, K, S: common? 
   B, O, U: common? 

 But note: in ""ABOUT"", we are testing O (a vowel) and U? Which might be worth? 

 Also, we know that E is not in the word? So vowels? Only A? Or others? 

 We might want to know about other vowels? 

 So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is better? Because it has O and U? 

 But wait: in the secret word, we know A is present? And we don't know about other vowels? So testing O and U? 

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses A at position 1? 

 Previously in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And it was wrong? Now we put A at position 1? 

 That's good? 

 So I'm leaning toward ""ABOUT"". 

 However, note: we also know that R is absent? So no R? But ABOUT doesn't have R? So okay? 

 Also, C, E, N are absent? 

 So let's choose ""ABOUT""? 

 But wait: we are going to test: A at position 1? 

 Let's write:

 Guess: A B O U T

 What if the secret word has A? But not at position 1? Then we'll get A marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, since A is present, even if at position 1? If the secret word has A at position 1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? 

 But note: we know A is not at position 3? Because in ""crane"", position 3? Marked wrong? But positions 1,2,4,5? 

 So ABOUT puts A in position 1? So it might be correct? Or might not? Either way, we'll get feedback? 

 After thinking: 

 Another word is ""ADOBE"" - O and B? But E is forbidden? So no? 

 ""ABOVE"" forbidden? E? 

 ""ADIEU"" - has D, I, E? But E forbidden? 

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a reasonable choice? 

 But also ""WAQFS""? Not English? 

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for the next guess? 

 However, what about ""LASTS""? duplicate S? And has A at position 2? But duplicate? 

 Given the constraints, I'll pick ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, we could pick ""STAMP""? Without E? But note: we avoid R? And avoid E? But STAMP has S,T,A,M,P? A at position 3? We must avoid position 3? 

 Therefore, avoid? Position 3 for A? 

 So STAMP: A is at position 3? So we shouldn't use? 

 Then, let's choose ""ABOUT"" definitely? 

 So next guess: ABOUT

<guess>about</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word (marked with ✗).
- A is present but in the wrong position (marked with -).

Key deductions for the next guess:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. We must exclude C, R, N, E entirely from the new guess.
3. The new guess should include A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its location.
4. Prioritize testing common letters not yet evaluated (e.g., B, O, U, T) for efficiency.
5. Avoid letter repetition to prevent ambiguous feedback.

Selected word: **ABOUT**
- A is placed in position 1 (new position to test).
- Tests new letters: B, O, U, T (common consonants/vowels).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and avoids duplication.",Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,LAUGH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess since the first guess ""crane"" got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation of feedback for ""crane"":
 - C is not in the secret word at all (x)
 - R is not in the secret word at all (x)
 - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Therefore, we know:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3, and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since A is present, we must include A in our next guess. But note: we cannot use C, R, N, E.

 We are trying to form a 5-letter word that includes A (and not in the third position) and avoids C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters, and we only have one confirmed letter: A (somewhere else).

 For the next guess, we should try to test other common letters and also place A in a different position.

 What are common letters? We can try vowels: A is already present, so maybe other vowels? But note: the feedback didn't show any other vowel in the first word? Actually, we don't know.

 Available letters: except C, R, N, E, and we must avoid those.

 We can consider a word that has A and other common consonants like T, L, S, P, M, etc.

 However, note that the letter A was in position 3 in the first guess, so in the next word, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and do not contain C, R, N, E and have A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Also, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that might work:

 Option: ""TASKS"" - but that has S and K? And double S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually the rules don't forbid it, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 However, we must avoid C, R, N, E. So let's check: T, A, S, K, S? But note: we can use S because it's not forbidden yet.

 But wait: we don't know about T, S, K. Let's see:

 Another option: ""PASTA"" - contains A twice? Actually, it has A at position 2 and 5? And letters: P, A, S, T, A.

 But note: we have A twice? The feedback might be tricky? Also, in the secret word, how many A's? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PLAIT"" - but that has L and T? And I? Also, A at position 3? Wait, we must avoid position 3 for A? Because previous feedback: A was in position 3 and marked wrong position? So we can try placing A in other positions.

 But note: the feedback says A is in the wrong position, meaning it exists somewhere else. So for the next guess, we must put A in a different position.

 In ""PASTA"": 
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5.
 The A at position 2 and 5 are new positions? Also we have A twice? It's okay because the secret word might have duplicate A? We don't know.

 However, we are testing multiple new letters: P, S, T, and also A at positions 2 and 5? But the feedback might only tell us about one A? Actually, the feedback will show multiple marks if there are multiple? 

 But note: the feedback format doesn't specify that it marks each occurrence? Actually, it says ""each letter in your guess"", so each occurrence will be marked.

 So if the secret word has two A's, both A's in PASTA might get marked accordingly? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, it's better to avoid duplicates for now? To get clearer feedback? Because if we use two A's, and the word has one A, then only one A will be marked? And the other will be missed? Or marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each letter independently.

 But let me recall the rules: 
   - If a letter in the guess is in the word and in the correct position: ✓.
   - If a letter is in the word but not in the correct position: -.
   - If the letter is not in the word: x.

 Also, note: if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, then only the ones that match will get feedback? Actually, the rules don't specify that? In Wordle, the feedback works by comparing frequency? Actually, we have to assume that the feedback marks each letter independently? But let's think:

 Example: Secret: BRISK, Guess: SHEEP. The feedback would be: S (if S is present) ... but wait, let's imagine.

 Actually, the standard Wordle feedback algorithm: 
   First, mark the exact matches (position and letter). Then, for the rest, for a letter that is in the word but not matched, we mark one occurrence per each in the secret that hasn't been matched? So duplicates matter.

 Therefore, we might avoid duplicates at this stage? Because we have limited information.

 Let me think of words without duplicate letters and without C,R,N,E and with A? And A not in position 3.

 Word: ""PLAIT"" - has A at position 3? Avoid position 3: so we must avoid putting A at 3? Therefore, ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at 3.

 Word: ""PALMS"" - P, A (at position 2), L, M, S? That avoids position for A: 2? So far, we haven't tried position 2? Also, letters: P,A,L,M,S? All are new.

 But note: we are testing L, M, S? and P? That's good.

 Another option: ""SALTY"" - has A at position 2, S at 1, L at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Also avoids C,R,N,E? T and Y are new.

 However, note: we don't know if Y is allowed? It might be in the word? Also, common letters.

 Let me also consider: ""MANGO"" - avoids C,R,N,E? But N is forbidden? Because we had N in first guess and it was marked absent? So we must avoid N? So ""MANGO"" is invalid because it has N? Wait: M,A,N,G,O? N is forbidden? So no.

 Word: ""PAINT"" - N is forbidden? So no.

 Word: ""PAILS"" - P,A,I,L,S? A at position 2? So that's okay? And avoids forbidden letters? Also, new letters.

 But wait: we are avoiding E? PAILS: P, A, I, L, S -> yes, no E? Correct? Yes.

 Similarly, words like ""AUDIO"", but that has U and O? Okay? But U and O might be less common? Alternatively, ""MAVIN"" -> has V? and N is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""ABOUT""? But O, U? Also B? But we don't know about B? But note: in ""crane"", we had A and now we need to test new letters? Also, ""ABOUT"" has O, U, B? And A? But A is at position 2? Also, let's write: A at position 2? Actually: A is at position 1? Wait:

 ""ABOUT"": A (pos1), B (pos2), O (pos3), U (pos4), T (pos5)

 But in our feedback, A is marked as present but in wrong position? The secret word has A, but not at position 3? Now we don't know about position 1? Maybe?

 Also, we can test B, O, U, T? And we know A? So we can try.

 However, we are not sure? 

 Other words: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden? Because we got C absent? So no.

 ""PASTA"": We considered earlier? But has duplicate A? Actually: P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? So if the secret word has one A, then the feedback will mark one of the A's as present? and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark:
   The first A: at position 2? If the secret word has A at say position 1, then that would be '-' (wrong position) and then the last A: also marked based on the secret? But the secret has only one A: then the second A will be marked as 'x'? So it's okay? But we lose one space? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So maybe ""PLASM"" is not common? How about ""PAKSA""? Not English? 

 I think ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? And we can use it? Or ""PIZZA"" has duplicate Z? But we don't know? Also, Z is low frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SALSA"" has duplicate S and A? Not good? 

 So let's pick a word without duplicates? Like ""SALET"" (which is a word? Yes in some dictionaries). SALET: S, A, L, E, T? But E is forbidden? Because in crane, E was absent? So E is forbidden? We cannot use E.

 So we must avoid E. 

 Then, what about ""TAMPS"" - T, A, M, P, S? No duplicates? And A at position 2? And avoids E? Letters: T, A, M, P, S? All allowed? Because we haven't ruled them out? 

 Actually, ""TAMPS"" is a word? It means: to press something down? But it's a bit obscure? 

 Or ""PALMS""? We had that? 

 Another option: ""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y? But D? and Y? 

 Or ""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y? Has A at position 2? Letters: H,A,S,T,Y? H is new? 

 But note: we don't know about H? 

 Alternatively, let's stick to common words? 

 I think ""SALAD"" has duplicate A? So avoid? 

 I found: ""STAID"" - S, T, A, I, D? But has A at position 3? We need to avoid position 3? So no? Because if we put A at position 3, and the secret word doesn't have A there? But we know that position 3 is wrong? So avoid? Actually, we can try putting A at position 3? But we know it is not correct? So we must avoid? The feedback told us A is in the word but not at position 3? So putting A at position 3 again would be a waste? Because we know it will not be correct? 

 Therefore, avoid position 3? 

 So words with A at positions: 1,2,4,5? 

 Then: ""MATHS"" - M, A, T, H, S? -> A at position 2? Okay? 

 But we haven't tested M? T? H? S? That's good? But is MATHS common? Yes.

 Another: ""PATHY"" - not common? 

 Or ""FATAL"" -> duplicate A? Avoid? 

 Then, ""SPAWN"" - S, P, A, W, N? But N is forbidden? Because we tried N and it was absent? So forbidden? 

 So ""SPAWN"" invalid? 

 How about ""FATLY""? Not common? 

 Maybe ""TALKS""? -> T, A, L, K, S? A at position 2? Avoids bad letters? 

 ""TALKS"" is a word? Yes: talk in third person? Or noun? Like sales talks? 

 So TALKS: T, A, L, K, S? 

 Also avoids C,R,N,E? So we can try? 

 Similarly, ""WALKS""? W is less common? 

 So let's choose ""TALKS"". 

 But note: we might want to test more vowels? So far, we only know A is present? Are there other vowels? Maybe try a word with O? U? I? 

 But in TALKS: we have A again? And also testing T, L, K, S? And A? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word with another vowel? Like O? 

 Words with O? And A? And avoid bad letters? 

 For example: ""ABOVE"" -> E is bad? Forbidden? 

 ""ABOUT"" we considered? But O and U? and A at position 1? 

 In ""ABOUT"": A at position 1? We don't know about position 1? So it might be correct? Or not? 

 Also, we can test U? 

 Maybe ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S? No A? But we must include A because it is present? 

 Wait, remember: we must include A? Because we know the secret word has A? 

 Therefore, our next guess must include A? 

 So words without A are invalid? 

 Therefore, ""TALKS"" is acceptable: includes A? 

 Similarly, ""ABOUT"" includes A? 

 Which one is better? 

 ""TALKS"" has letters: T, A, L, K, S? 

 ""ABOUT"" has letters: A, B, O, U, T? 

 Which set of letters is more common? 

 In terms of frequency: 
   T is very common? 
   A is common? 
   L, K, S: common? 
   B, O, U: common? 

 But note: in ""ABOUT"", we are testing O (a vowel) and U? Which might be worth? 

 Also, we know that E is not in the word? So vowels? Only A? Or others? 

 We might want to know about other vowels? 

 So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is better? Because it has O and U? 

 But wait: in the secret word, we know A is present? And we don't know about other vowels? So testing O and U? 

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses A at position 1? 

 Previously in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And it was wrong? Now we put A at position 1? 

 That's good? 

 So I'm leaning toward ""ABOUT"". 

 However, note: we also know that R is absent? So no R? But ABOUT doesn't have R? So okay? 

 Also, C, E, N are absent? 

 So let's choose ""ABOUT""? 

 But wait: we are going to test: A at position 1? 

 Let's write:

 Guess: A B O U T

 What if the secret word has A? But not at position 1? Then we'll get A marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, since A is present, even if at position 1? If the secret word has A at position 1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? 

 But note: we know A is not at position 3? Because in ""crane"", position 3? Marked wrong? But positions 1,2,4,5? 

 So ABOUT puts A in position 1? So it might be correct? Or might not? Either way, we'll get feedback? 

 After thinking: 

 Another word is ""ADOBE"" - O and B? But E is forbidden? So no? 

 ""ABOVE"" forbidden? E? 

 ""ADIEU"" - has D, I, E? But E forbidden? 

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a reasonable choice? 

 But also ""WAQFS""? Not English? 

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for the next guess? 

 However, what about ""LASTS""? duplicate S? And has A at position 2? But duplicate? 

 Given the constraints, I'll pick ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, we could pick ""STAMP""? Without E? But note: we avoid R? And avoid E? But STAMP has S,T,A,M,P? A at position 3? We must avoid position 3? 

 Therefore, avoid? Position 3 for A? 

 So STAMP: A is at position 3? So we shouldn't use? 

 Then, let's choose ""ABOUT"" definitely? 

 So next guess: ABOUT

<guess>about</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word (marked with ✗).
- A is present but in the wrong position (marked with -).

Key deductions for the next guess:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. We must exclude C, R, N, E entirely from the new guess.

4. Prioritize testing common letters not yet evaluated (e.g., B, O, U, T) for efficiency.
5. Avoid letter repetition to prevent ambiguous feedback.

Selected word: **ABOUT**
- A is placed in position 1 (new position to test).
- Tests new letters: B, O, U, T (common consonants/vowels).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and avoids duplication.

The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\n Since A is present, we must include A in our next guess. But note: we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\n We are trying to form a 5-letter word that includes A (and not in the third position) and avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters, and we only have one confirmed letter: A (somewhere else).\n\n For the next guess, we should try to test other common letters and also place A in a different position.\n\n What are common letters? We can try vowels: A is already present, so maybe other vowels? But note: the feedback didn\'t show any other vowel in the first word? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Available letters: except C, R, N, E, and we must avoid those.\n\n We can consider a word that has A and other common consonants like T, L, S, P, M, etc.\n\n However, note that the letter A was in position 3 in the first guess, so in the next word, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have A and do not contain C, R, N, E and have A in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Let me list some words that might work:\n\n Option: ""TASKS"" - but that has S and K? And double S? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Actually the rules don\'t forbid it, but the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n However, we must avoid C, R, N, E. So let\'s check: T, A, S, K, S? But note: we can use S because it\'s not forbidden yet.\n\n But wait: we don\'t know about T, S, K. Let\'s see:\n\n Another option: ""PASTA"" - contains A twice? Actually, it has A at position 2 and 5? And letters: P, A, S, T, A.\n\n But note: we have A twice? The feedback might be tricky? Also, in the secret word, how many A\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""PLAIT"" - but that has L and T? And I? Also, A at position 3? Wait, we must avoid position 3 for A? Because previous feedback: A was in position 3 and marked wrong position? So we can try placing A in other positions.\n\n But note: the feedback says A is in the wrong position, meaning it exists somewhere else. So for the next guess, we must put A in a different position.\n\n In ""PASTA"": \n   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5.\n The A at position 2 and 5 are new positions? Also we have A twice? It\'s okay because the secret word might have duplicate A? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing multiple new letters: P, S, T, and also A at positions 2 and 5? But the feedback might only tell us about one A? Actually, the feedback will show multiple marks if there are multiple? \n\n But note: the feedback format doesn\'t specify that it marks each occurrence? Actually, it says ""each letter in your guess"", so each occurrence will be marked.\n\n So if the secret word has two A\'s, both A\'s in PASTA might get marked accordingly? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now? To get clearer feedback? Because if we use two A\'s, and the word has one A, then only one A will be marked? And the other will be missed? Or marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each letter independently.\n\n But let me recall the rules: \n   - If a letter in the guess is in the word and in the correct position: ✓.\n   - If a letter is in the word but not in the correct position: -.\n   - If the letter is not in the word: x.\n\n Also, note: if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, then only the ones that match will get feedback? Actually, the rules don\'t specify that? In Wordle, the feedback works by comparing frequency? Actually, we have to assume that the feedback marks each letter independently? But let\'s think:\n\n Example: Secret: BRISK, Guess: SHEEP. The feedback would be: S (if S is present) ... but wait, let\'s imagine.\n\n Actually, the standard Wordle feedback algorithm: \n   First, mark the exact matches (position and letter). Then, for the rest, for a letter that is in the word but not matched, we mark one occurrence per each in the secret that hasn\'t been matched? So duplicates matter.\n\n Therefore, we might avoid duplicates at this stage? Because we have limited information.\n\n Let me think of words without duplicate letters and without C,R,N,E and with A? And A not in position 3.\n\n Word: ""PLAIT"" - has A at position 3? Avoid position 3: so we must avoid putting A at 3? Therefore, ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at 3.\n\n Word: ""PALMS"" - P, A (at position 2), L, M, S? That avoids position for A: 2? So far, we haven\'t tried position 2? Also, letters: P,A,L,M,S? All are new.\n\n But note: we are testing L, M, S? and P? That\'s good.\n\n Another option: ""SALTY"" - has A at position 2, S at 1, L at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Also avoids C,R,N,E? T and Y are new.\n\n However, note: we don\'t know if Y is allowed? It might be in the word? Also, common letters.\n\n Let me also consider: ""MANGO"" - avoids C,R,N,E? But N is forbidden? Because we had N in first guess and it was marked absent? So we must avoid N? So ""MANGO"" is invalid because it has N? Wait: M,A,N,G,O? N is forbidden? So no.\n\n Word: ""PAINT"" - N is forbidden? So no.\n\n Word: ""PAILS"" - P,A,I,L,S? A at position 2? So that\'s okay? And avoids forbidden letters? Also, new letters.\n\n But wait: we are avoiding E? PAILS: P, A, I, L, S -> yes, no E? Correct? Yes.\n\n Similarly, words like ""AUDIO"", but that has U and O? Okay? But U and O might be less common? Alternatively, ""MAVIN"" -> has V? and N is forbidden? So no.\n\n How about ""ABOUT""? But O, U? Also B? But we don\'t know about B? But note: in ""crane"", we had A and now we need to test new letters? Also, ""ABOUT"" has O, U, B? And A? But A is at position 2? Also, let\'s write: A at position 2? Actually: A is at position 1? Wait:\n\n ""ABOUT"": A (pos1), B (pos2), O (pos3), U (pos4), T (pos5)\n\n But in our feedback, A is marked as present but in wrong position? The secret word has A, but not at position 3? Now we don\'t know about position 1? Maybe?\n\n Also, we can test B, O, U, T? And we know A? So we can try.\n\n However, we are not sure? \n\n Other words: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden? Because we got C absent? So no.\n\n ""PASTA"": We considered earlier? But has duplicate A? Actually: P, A, S, T, A -> two A\'s? So if the secret word has one A, then the feedback will mark one of the A\'s as present? and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark:\n   The first A: at position 2? If the secret word has A at say position 1, then that would be \'-\' (wrong position) and then the last A: also marked based on the secret? But the secret has only one A: then the second A will be marked as \'x\'? So it\'s okay? But we lose one space? \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So maybe ""PLASM"" is not common? How about ""PAKSA""? Not English? \n\n I think ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? And we can use it? Or ""PIZZA"" has duplicate Z? But we don\'t know? Also, Z is low frequency.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALSA"" has duplicate S and A? Not good? \n\n So let\'s pick a word without duplicates? Like ""SALET"" (which is a word? Yes in some dictionaries). SALET: S, A, L, E, T? But E is forbidden? Because in crane, E was absent? So E is forbidden? We cannot use E.\n\n So we must avoid E. \n\n Then, what about ""TAMPS"" - T, A, M, P, S? No duplicates? And A at position 2? And avoids E? Letters: T, A, M, P, S? All allowed? Because we haven\'t ruled them out? \n\n Actually, ""TAMPS"" is a word? It means: to press something down? But it\'s a bit obscure? \n\n Or ""PALMS""? We had that? \n\n Another option: ""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y? But D? and Y? \n\n Or ""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y? Has A at position 2? Letters: H,A,S,T,Y? H is new? \n\n But note: we don\'t know about H? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s stick to common words? \n\n I think ""SALAD"" has duplicate A? So avoid? \n\n I found: ""STAID"" - S, T, A, I, D? But has A at position 3? We need to avoid position 3? So no? Because if we put A at position 3, and the secret word doesn\'t have A there? But we know that position 3 is wrong? So avoid? Actually, we can try putting A at position 3? But we know it is not correct? So we must avoid? The feedback told us A is in the word but not at position 3? So putting A at position 3 again would be a waste? Because we know it will not be correct? \n\n Therefore, avoid position 3? \n\n So words with A at positions: 1,2,4,5? \n\n Then: ""MATHS"" - M, A, T, H, S? -> A at position 2? Okay? \n\n But we haven\'t tested M? T? H? S? That\'s good? But is MATHS common? Yes.\n\n Another: ""PATHY"" - not common? \n\n Or ""FATAL"" -> duplicate A? Avoid? \n\n Then, ""SPAWN"" - S, P, A, W, N? But N is forbidden? Because we tried N and it was absent? So forbidden? \n\n So ""SPAWN"" invalid? \n\n How about ""FATLY""? Not common? \n\n Maybe ""TALKS""? -> T, A, L, K, S? A at position 2? Avoids bad letters? \n\n ""TALKS"" is a word? Yes: talk in third person? Or noun? Like sales talks? \n\n So TALKS: T, A, L, K, S? \n\n Also avoids C,R,N,E? So we can try? \n\n Similarly, ""WALKS""? W is less common? \n\n So let\'s choose ""TALKS"". \n\n But note: we might want to test more vowels? So far, we only know A is present? Are there other vowels? Maybe try a word with O? U? I? \n\n But in TALKS: we have A again? And also testing T, L, K, S? And A? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with another vowel? Like O? \n\n Words with O? And A? And avoid bad letters? \n\n For example: ""ABOVE"" -> E is bad? Forbidden? \n\n ""ABOUT"" we considered? But O and U? and A at position 1? \n\n In ""ABOUT"": A at position 1? We don\'t know about position 1? So it might be correct? Or not? \n\n Also, we can test U? \n\n Maybe ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S? No A? But we must include A because it is present? \n\n Wait, remember: we must include A? Because we know the secret word has A? \n\n Therefore, our next guess must include A? \n\n So words without A are invalid? \n\n Therefore, ""TALKS"" is acceptable: includes A? \n\n Similarly, ""ABOUT"" includes A? \n\n Which one is better? \n\n ""TALKS"" has letters: T, A, L, K, S? \n\n ""ABOUT"" has letters: A, B, O, U, T? \n\n Which set of letters is more common? \n\n In terms of frequency: \n   T is very common? \n   A is common? \n   L, K, S: common? \n   B, O, U: common? \n\n But note: in ""ABOUT"", we are testing O (a vowel) and U? Which might be worth? \n\n Also, we know that E is not in the word? So vowels? Only A? Or others? \n\n We might want to know about other vowels? \n\n So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is better? Because it has O and U? \n\n But wait: in the secret word, we know A is present? And we don\'t know about other vowels? So testing O and U? \n\n Also, ""ABOUT"" uses A at position 1? \n\n Previously in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And it was wrong? Now we put A at position 1? \n\n That\'s good? \n\n So I\'m leaning toward ""ABOUT"". \n\n However, note: we also know that R is absent? So no R? But ABOUT doesn\'t have R? So okay? \n\n Also, C, E, N are absent? \n\n So let\'s choose ""ABOUT""? \n\n But wait: we are going to test: A at position 1? \n\n Let\'s write:\n\n Guess: A B O U T\n\n What if the secret word has A? But not at position 1? Then we\'ll get A marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, since A is present, even if at position 1? If the secret word has A at position 1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if it\'s elsewhere? Then \'-\'? \n\n But note: we know A is not at position 3? Because in ""crane"", position 3? Marked wrong? But positions 1,2,4,5? \n\n So ABOUT puts A in position 1? So it might be correct? Or might not? Either way, we\'ll get feedback? \n\n After thinking: \n\n Another word is ""ADOBE"" - O and B? But E is forbidden? So no? \n\n ""ABOVE"" forbidden? E? \n\n ""ADIEU"" - has D, I, E? But E forbidden? \n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems a reasonable choice? \n\n But also ""WAQFS""? Not English? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" for the next guess? \n\n However, what about ""LASTS""? duplicate S? And has A at position 2? But duplicate? \n\n Given the constraints, I\'ll pick ""ABOUT"".\n\n Alternatively, we could pick ""STAMP""? Without E? But note: we avoid R? And avoid E? But STAMP has S,T,A,M,P? A at position 3? We must avoid position 3? \n\n Therefore, avoid? Position 3 for A? \n\n So STAMP: A is at position 3? So we shouldn\'t use? \n\n Then, let\'s choose ""ABOUT"" definitely? \n\n So next guess: ABOUT\n\n<guess>about</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word (marked with ✗).\n- A is present but in the wrong position (marked with -).\n\nKey deductions for the next guess:\n1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.\n2. We must exclude C, R, N, E entirely from the new guess.\n3. The new guess should include A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its location.\n4. Prioritize testing common letters not yet evaluated (e.g., B, O, U, T) for efficiency.\n5. Avoid letter repetition to prevent ambiguous feedback.\n\nSelected word: **ABOUT**\n- A is placed in position 1 (new position to test).\n- Tests new letters: B, O, U, T (common consonants/vowels).\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and avoids duplication.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""about"" -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
- B, O, T are absent from the secret word.
- U is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T
Present letters: A and U (but not in the positions we tried)

Specifically for A:
- Not in position 3 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 1 (from ""about"")

For U:
- Not in position 4 (from ""about"")

We also know the secret word must contain A and U, and they are in positions other than 1, 3, and 4? Actually, we don't know about position 2 and 5 for A, and for U, we only know it's not in position 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But note: we have tried position 1 for A and it was wrong, so A is not in 1. Also, we know A is not in 3. So A must be in position 2 or 5? Similarly, U is not in 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But we have to consider that the word has 5 letters.

Now, the secret word has A and U, and we have 5 positions. We need to form a word that includes A and U, and avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T.

Also, we have to test new letters to find the exact positions.

Let's list the available positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
For U: positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

But note: if A is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2? Because one position can't have two letters? So if A is in 2, then U must be in 1,3, or 5? Similarly, if A is in 5, then U can be in 1,2,3.

We also need to include other letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T

So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize information.

We know the word must have A and U, so we can think of words that contain both.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in position 2, U in position 1? But U in position 1: e.g., ""U_ A _ _ _""

But we have to fill the rest. For example, ""USUAL"" -> but U is at 1 and 4? But we have U at 4? But we know U is not at 4? So ""USUAL"" has U at 1 and 4? But we know U is not at 4? So that would be invalid? Also, we have A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? So ""USUAL"" is invalid.

Option: ""AUDIO"" -> but O is absent? Forbidden? And A at 1? But we know A is not at 1? So no.

We need A at 2 or 5.

Let's try A at 2: then the word is _ A _ _ _

And U must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,5? But position 1: if U is at 1, then ""U A _ _ _""

We need to fill the last three positions with letters not forbidden and including U? But U is already at 1? So the other positions? We need to have the U that is present? But we have one U? Or could there be more? We don't know.

But we know U is present, so at least one U. In this case, if we put U at 1, then we have U at 1, which is a new position? But we don't know if it's correct? We are testing.

Similarly, if A is at 5: then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First, with A at 2 and U at 1: words like ""UAPAS""? Not English. ""UAKIS""? No. ""UALAS""? No. ""UDALS""? Not common. ""UGALI"" - U G A L I? But G, L, I are allowed? And U at 1, A at 3? But A at 3 is forbidden? We know A is not at 3? So we cannot have A at 3? So ""UGALI"" has A at 3? Invalid.

So if A is at 2, then U at 1: what words? ""UNAUS"" - but N is forbidden? And U at 1 and 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.

Perhaps U at 3? For a word with A at 2: _ A U _ _

Like ""SAULT"" - S A U L T? But T is forbidden? T is absent? So no.

""MAULS"" - M A U L S? M, A, U, L, S? All allowed? And A at 2, U at 3? 

But we know U is present? And we are putting U at 3? It might be correct? Or not? But we don't know? Also, A at 2? We don't know if that's correct? 

Similarly, ""GAUZE"" - E is forbidden? No.

""FAUNA"" - N is forbidden? No.

""HAULM"" - H A U L M? But M? And L? 

""HAULM"" is a word? It means a part of a plant? But uncommon? 

But let's consider: we have to avoid forbidden letters? So ""HAULM"" has H,A,U,L,M? All allowed? 

But we have A at 2 and U at 3? 

Now, what about A at 5? Then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.

For example, ""SULFA"" - S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? But F? 

""SULFA"" is a word? Sulfa drugs? 

But we have U at 2? And A at 5? 

Also, S, U, L, F, A? All allowed? 

Similarly, ""PUDSA"" - not a word? 

""QUADS"" - Q U A D S? But A at 3? We know A is not at 3? So invalid? 

""JUMAR"" - R forbidden? 

""GUAVA"" - duplicate A? And V? But we don't know? Also, A at 3? Forbidden? 

So not.

Another word: ""SUDRA"" - R forbidden? 

Perhaps ""LAUDA"" - L A U D A? Duplicate A? And D? But A at 1? We know A is not at 1? In ""LAUDA"": A at 2 and 5? But we are considering A at 5? So if we put A at 5, then in ""LAUDA"", A is at 2 and 5? But we know A is not at 1? But position 2 is not tested? 

But we have U at 3? 

But ""LAUDA"" has duplicate A? 

To avoid duplicates, we might prefer words without duplicates? 

But let's list possible words without duplicates? 

With A at 2 and U at 3: 
- ""MAULS"" as above? M A U L S
- ""PAULS"" - P A U L S? But P is allowed? 
- ""WAULS"" - W A U L S? 

But ""WAULS"" is a word? To wail like a cat? 

Similarly, ""GAUMS"" - G A U M S? 

But we don't know if these are common? 

With A at 5 and U at 1: 
- ""USNEA"" - U S N E A? But N and E forbidden? No.
- ""USQUA"" - not common? 

With A at 5 and U at 2: 
- ""SULFA"" as above? S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? 
- ""DUCAL"" - D U C A L? C forbidden? No.

With A at 5 and U at 3: 
- ""PULKA"" - P U L K A? U at 2? A at 5? Actually, P U L K A: U at 2? 
- ""TUFAS"" - T forbidden? 
- ""KUDUS"" - K U D U S? Duplicate U? 
- ""HUSHA"" - H U S H A? Duplicate H? 

Not great.

Perhaps we should consider U at 5? But we haven't tried U at 5? 

In the case of A at 2, U at 5: _ A _ _ U

Words: ""GADJU"" - G A D J U? J? 
""PALAU"" - P A L A U? Duplicate A? 
""MANUU"" - not? 

""SAVYU"" - not English? 

Hard.

Alternatively, A at 5 and U at 1: ""U _ _ _ A""

Words: ""USUAL"" -> but U at 1 and 4? U at 4 is forbidden? And A at 5? But U at 4 is not allowed? 
""URAEI"" - R and E forbidden? 
""UGLIA"" - U G L I A? A at 5? But I? 

""UGLIA"" is not common? 

After consideration, let's go with ""MAULS"" or ""SULFA"". 

But ""SULFA"" has U at 2 and A at 5? 

We can also test new letters? 

In ""MAULS"": M, A, U, L, S? 
In ""SULFA"": S, U, L, F, A? 

Both test L? 

But we need to know the position of A and U? 

We know A is not at 1 or 3, so in ""MAULS"", A is at 2? If we get feedback that A is correct at 2, then we know? Or if not? 

Similarly, U is at 3 in ""MAULS""? 

In ""SULFA"", A is at 5? U at 2? 

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have other letters? 

Another idea: we can try to put A in position 5 and U in position 3? But we need a word? 

For example, ""LUDIC"" - C forbidden? 
""FUSTY"" - F U S T Y? T forbidden? 

Not working.

Perhaps ""DAUBs"" but D A U B S? B is forbidden? 

B is absent? So no.

Let's list all possible words that contain A and U, no forbidden letters, and A not in 1 or 3, U not in 4.

Forbidden letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T

Available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words with A and U:

- A at 2, U at 1: hard, as above.
- A at 2, U at 3: MAULS, PAULS, WAULS, GAUMS, HAULM, JAUKS (J?), QAIDS (Q?), etc.
- A at 2, U at 5: PAGUS? Not common.
- A at 5, U at 1: USUAL (invalid because U at 4 and A at 3? No, USUAL is U S U A L? No, U at 1, S at 2, U at 3? Duplicate U? And A at 4? But A at 4 is not forbidden? We only know A not at 1 or 3? But in USUAL, A is at 4? Which is new? But U is at 1 and 3? And we have U at 3? But we don't know about U at 3? But the word has duplicate U? And we know U is present, but we don't know if it's multiple? Also, U at 4 is not in this word? USUAL: positions: 1:U, 2:S, 3:U, 4:A, 5:L? But U at 3? And A at 4? But we know U is not at 4? But here U is at 1 and 3? So U at 4 is not present? So it's okay? But the feedback for U: if we put U at 1 and 3, and the secret word has only one U, then one of them might be marked absent? 

But let's avoid duplicates for clarity? 

So back to ""MAULS"": M A U L S

- A at position 2
- U at position 3

If we guess ""MAULS"", possible feedback:
- If A is in position 2, it will be marked correct? Or if not, then wrong position? But we know A is in the word, so if not at 2, then it must be at 5? Because only 2 or 5 are possible? 

Similarly, U at 3: if U is in position 3, correct? Otherwise, wrong position? 

Also, we test M, L, S? 

Another word: ""SULFA"": S U L F A

- U at position 2
- A at position 5

Similarly, we test S, L, F.

Which one to choose? 

We might want to test a vowel? We know A and U are present, but are there other vowels? Like I? 

In ""MAULS"", we have no other vowels? In ""SULFA"", also no? 

But we can try to include I? 

For example, with A at 2 and U at 3, is there a word with I? Like ""QAIDS"" - Q and I? But Q is rare? 

""GUIDs"" but G U I D S? A not present? 

We must have A and U.

""QUAIS"" - Q U A I S? A at 3? Forbidden? 

""LAIUS"" - L A I U S? A at 2, U at 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.

So perhaps ""MAULS"" is acceptable.

But let's check if ""MAULS"" is a valid word? It is the plural of maul, meaning to handle roughly? Or a type of weapon? But in Wordle, it might be accepted.

Similarly, ""PAULS"" is a proper name? Might not be accepted? 

""WAULS"" is valid? 

To be safe, let's choose ""HAULM"" or ""MAULS"". I think ""MAULS"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""GAUZE"" has E? Forbidden.

I think ""MAULS"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: ""AULAS"" - A at 1? But A not at 1? So invalid.

Or ""JUMPS"" - no A? 

So I'll go with ""MAULS"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

Guess: M A U L S

If the secret word has A at 2, then we get A correct? If not, then A must be at 5, and we'll get A marked as absent or wrong position? But since we know A is in the word, if it's not at 2, then it should be marked as '-' for wrong position? But in the guess, A is at 2, so if the secret has A at 5, then in this guess, A at 2 should be marked as '-' (wrong position) because it's present but not here.

Similarly for U at 3: if U is at 3, then correct? If not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know U is present, so it would be '-' if not at 3.

Also, we get feedback on M, L, S.

So it's good.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A at 5? Like ""SULFA"", but ""SULFA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SNAFU"" - but S N A F U? N forbidden? No.

""FJORD"" - no A? 

I think ""MAULS"" is fine.

So next guess: MAULS

But let's write it as <guess>mauls</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(✗), R(✗), A(-), N(✗), E(✗)  
  - **A** is present but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""about""** → A(-), B(✗), O(✗), U(-), T(✗)  
  - **A** is present but not in position 1 (since it was marked wrong position).  
  - **U** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **B, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T (cannot appear in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - **A**: Must be in the word but not in positions 1 or 3. Only positions 2 or 5 are possible.  
   - **U**: Must be in the word but not in position 4. Positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 are possible.  
3. **Constraints**:  
   - A and U cannot share the same position.  
   - The word must include at least these two letters.  
4. **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (since B, C, E, N, O, R, T are ruled out).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test positions for A and U**: Since A can only be in position 2 or 5, and U can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4), we need a word that:  
  - Includes both A and U.  
  - Places A in position 2 or 5 to test its location.  
  - Places U in a new position (not 4) to test its location.  
  - Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, M).  
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters** to prevent ambiguous feedback.  
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters** like S, L, M to uncover more of the word.  

### Selected Guess: ""MAULS""
- **Word breakdown**: M (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **A in position 2** (if correct, we lock it; if wrong, A must be in position 5).  
  - Tests **U in position 3** (new position, not tested before).  
  - Uses new common letters: **M, L, S** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).  
  - Avoids absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Valid English word (plural of ""maul,"" meaning to handle roughly).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If A is in position 2, feedback will show ✓ for A.  
- If U is in position 3, feedback will show ✓ for U.  
- Feedback for M, L, S will reveal if they are present and in the correct positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and U while testing three new letters.

<guess>mauls</guess>",mauls,"We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""about"" -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
- B, O, T are absent from the secret word.
- U is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T
Present letters: A and U (but not in the positions we tried)

Specifically for A:
- Not in position 3 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 1 (from ""about"")

For U:
- Not in position 4 (from ""about"")

We also know the secret word must contain A and U, and they are in positions other than 1, 3, and 4? Actually, we don't know about position 2 and 5 for A, and for U, we only know it's not in position 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But note: we have tried position 1 for A and it was wrong, so A is not in 1. Also, we know A is not in 3. So A must be in position 2 or 5? Similarly, U is not in 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But we have to consider that the word has 5 letters.

Now, the secret word has A and U, and we have 5 positions. We need to form a word that includes A and U, and avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T.

Also, we have to test new letters to find the exact positions.

Let's list the available positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
For U: positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

But note: if A is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2? Because one position can't have two letters? So if A is in 2, then U must be in 1,3, or 5? Similarly, if A is in 5, then U can be in 1,2,3.

We also need to include other letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T

So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize information.

We know the word must have A and U, so we can think of words that contain both.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in position 2, U in position 1? But U in position 1: e.g., ""U_ A _ _ _""

But we have to fill the rest. For example, ""USUAL"" -> but U is at 1 and 4? But we have U at 4? But we know U is not at 4? So ""USUAL"" has U at 1 and 4? But we know U is not at 4? So that would be invalid? Also, we have A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? So ""USUAL"" is invalid.

Option: ""AUDIO"" -> but O is absent? Forbidden? And A at 1? But we know A is not at 1? So no.

We need A at 2 or 5.

Let's try A at 2: then the word is _ A _ _ _

And U must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,5? But position 1: if U is at 1, then ""U A _ _ _""

We need to fill the last three positions with letters not forbidden and including U? But U is already at 1? So the other positions? We need to have the U that is present? But we have one U? Or could there be more? We don't know.

But we know U is present, so at least one U. In this case, if we put U at 1, then we have U at 1, which is a new position? But we don't know if it's correct? We are testing.

Similarly, if A is at 5: then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First, with A at 2 and U at 1: words like ""UAPAS""? Not English. ""UAKIS""? No. ""UALAS""? No. ""UDALS""? Not common. ""UGALI"" - U G A L I? But G, L, I are allowed? And U at 1, A at 3? But A at 3 is forbidden? We know A is not at 3? So we cannot have A at 3? So ""UGALI"" has A at 3? Invalid.

So if A is at 2, then U at 1: what words? ""UNAUS"" - but N is forbidden? And U at 1 and 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.

Perhaps U at 3? For a word with A at 2: _ A U _ _

Like ""SAULT"" - S A U L T? But T is forbidden? T is absent? So no.

""MAULS"" - M A U L S? M, A, U, L, S? All allowed? And A at 2, U at 3? 

But we know U is present? And we are putting U at 3? It might be correct? Or not? But we don't know? Also, A at 2? We don't know if that's correct? 

Similarly, ""GAUZE"" - E is forbidden? No.

""FAUNA"" - N is forbidden? No.

""HAULM"" - H A U L M? But M? And L? 

""HAULM"" is a word? It means a part of a plant? But uncommon? 

But let's consider: we have to avoid forbidden letters? So ""HAULM"" has H,A,U,L,M? All allowed? 

But we have A at 2 and U at 3? 

Now, what about A at 5? Then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.

For example, ""SULFA"" - S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? But F? 

""SULFA"" is a word? Sulfa drugs? 

But we have U at 2? And A at 5? 

Also, S, U, L, F, A? All allowed? 

Similarly, ""PUDSA"" - not a word? 

""QUADS"" - Q U A D S? But A at 3? We know A is not at 3? So invalid? 

""JUMAR"" - R forbidden? 

""GUAVA"" - duplicate A? And V? But we don't know? Also, A at 3? Forbidden? 

So not.

Another word: ""SUDRA"" - R forbidden? 

Perhaps ""LAUDA"" - L A U D A? Duplicate A? And D? But A at 1? We know A is not at 1? In ""LAUDA"": A at 2 and 5? But we are considering A at 5? So if we put A at 5, then in ""LAUDA"", A is at 2 and 5? But we know A is not at 1? But position 2 is not tested? 

But we have U at 3? 

But ""LAUDA"" has duplicate A? 

To avoid duplicates, we might prefer words without duplicates? 

But let's list possible words without duplicates? 

With A at 2 and U at 3: 
- ""MAULS"" as above? M A U L S
- ""PAULS"" - P A U L S? But P is allowed? 
- ""WAULS"" - W A U L S? 

But ""WAULS"" is a word? To wail like a cat? 

Similarly, ""GAUMS"" - G A U M S? 

But we don't know if these are common? 

With A at 5 and U at 1: 
- ""USNEA"" - U S N E A? But N and E forbidden? No.
- ""USQUA"" - not common? 

With A at 5 and U at 2: 
- ""SULFA"" as above? S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? 
- ""DUCAL"" - D U C A L? C forbidden? No.

With A at 5 and U at 3: 
- ""PULKA"" - P U L K A? U at 2? A at 5? Actually, P U L K A: U at 2? 
- ""TUFAS"" - T forbidden? 
- ""KUDUS"" - K U D U S? Duplicate U? 
- ""HUSHA"" - H U S H A? Duplicate H? 

Not great.

Perhaps we should consider U at 5? But we haven't tried U at 5? 

In the case of A at 2, U at 5: _ A _ _ U

Words: ""GADJU"" - G A D J U? J? 
""PALAU"" - P A L A U? Duplicate A? 
""MANUU"" - not? 

""SAVYU"" - not English? 

Hard.

Alternatively, A at 5 and U at 1: ""U _ _ _ A""

Words: ""USUAL"" -> but U at 1 and 4? U at 4 is forbidden? And A at 5? But U at 4 is not allowed? 
""URAEI"" - R and E forbidden? 
""UGLIA"" - U G L I A? A at 5? But I? 

""UGLIA"" is not common? 

After consideration, let's go with ""MAULS"" or ""SULFA"". 

But ""SULFA"" has U at 2 and A at 5? 

We can also test new letters? 

In ""MAULS"": M, A, U, L, S? 
In ""SULFA"": S, U, L, F, A? 

Both test L? 

But we need to know the position of A and U? 

We know A is not at 1 or 3, so in ""MAULS"", A is at 2? If we get feedback that A is correct at 2, then we know? Or if not? 

Similarly, U is at 3 in ""MAULS""? 

In ""SULFA"", A is at 5? U at 2? 

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have other letters? 

Another idea: we can try to put A in position 5 and U in position 3? But we need a word? 

For example, ""LUDIC"" - C forbidden? 
""FUSTY"" - F U S T Y? T forbidden? 

Not working.

Perhaps ""DAUBs"" but D A U B S? B is forbidden? 

B is absent? So no.

Let's list all possible words that contain A and U, no forbidden letters, and A not in 1 or 3, U not in 4.

Forbidden letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T

Available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words with A and U:

- A at 2, U at 1: hard, as above.
- A at 2, U at 3: MAULS, PAULS, WAULS, GAUMS, HAULM, JAUKS (J?), QAIDS (Q?), etc.
- A at 2, U at 5: PAGUS? Not common.
- A at 5, U at 1: USUAL (invalid because U at 4 and A at 3? No, USUAL is U S U A L? No, U at 1, S at 2, U at 3? Duplicate U? And A at 4? But A at 4 is not forbidden? We only know A not at 1 or 3? But in USUAL, A is at 4? Which is new? But U is at 1 and 3? And we have U at 3? But we don't know about U at 3? But the word has duplicate U? And we know U is present, but we don't know if it's multiple? Also, U at 4 is not in this word? USUAL: positions: 1:U, 2:S, 3:U, 4:A, 5:L? But U at 3? And A at 4? But we know U is not at 4? But here U is at 1 and 3? So U at 4 is not present? So it's okay? But the feedback for U: if we put U at 1 and 3, and the secret word has only one U, then one of them might be marked absent? 

But let's avoid duplicates for clarity? 

So back to ""MAULS"": M A U L S

- A at position 2
- U at position 3

If we guess ""MAULS"", possible feedback:
- If A is in position 2, it will be marked correct? Or if not, then wrong position? But we know A is in the word, so if not at 2, then it must be at 5? Because only 2 or 5 are possible? 

Similarly, U at 3: if U is in position 3, correct? Otherwise, wrong position? 

Also, we test M, L, S? 

Another word: ""SULFA"": S U L F A

- U at position 2
- A at position 5

Similarly, we test S, L, F.

Which one to choose? 

We might want to test a vowel? We know A and U are present, but are there other vowels? Like I? 

In ""MAULS"", we have no other vowels? In ""SULFA"", also no? 

But we can try to include I? 

For example, with A at 2 and U at 3, is there a word with I? Like ""QAIDS"" - Q and I? But Q is rare? 

""GUIDs"" but G U I D S? A not present? 

We must have A and U.

""QUAIS"" - Q U A I S? A at 3? Forbidden? 

""LAIUS"" - L A I U S? A at 2, U at 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.

So perhaps ""MAULS"" is acceptable.

But let's check if ""MAULS"" is a valid word? It is the plural of maul, meaning to handle roughly? Or a type of weapon? But in Wordle, it might be accepted.

Similarly, ""PAULS"" is a proper name? Might not be accepted? 

""WAULS"" is valid? 

To be safe, let's choose ""HAULM"" or ""MAULS"". I think ""MAULS"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""GAUZE"" has E? Forbidden.

I think ""MAULS"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: ""AULAS"" - A at 1? But A not at 1? So invalid.

Or ""JUMPS"" - no A? 

So I'll go with ""MAULS"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

Guess: M A U L S

If the secret word has A at 2, then we get A correct? If not, then A must be at 5, and we'll get A marked as absent or wrong position? But since we know A is in the word, if it's not at 2, then it should be marked as '-' for wrong position? But in the guess, A is at 2, so if the secret has A at 5, then in this guess, A at 2 should be marked as '-' (wrong position) because it's present but not here.

Similarly for U at 3: if U is at 3, then correct? If not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know U is present, so it would be '-' if not at 3.

Also, we get feedback on M, L, S.

So it's good.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A at 5? Like ""SULFA"", but ""SULFA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SNAFU"" - but S N A F U? N forbidden? No.

""FJORD"" - no A? 

I think ""MAULS"" is fine.

So next guess: MAULS

But let's write it as <guess>mauls</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(✗), R(✗), A(-), N(✗), E(✗)  
  - **A** is present but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""about""** → A(-), B(✗), O(✗), U(-), T(✗)  
  - **A** is present but not in position 1 (since it was marked wrong position).  
  - **U** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **B, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T (cannot appear in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - **A**: Must be in the word but not in positions 1 or 3. Only positions 2 or 5 are possible.  
   - **U**: Must be in the word but not in position 4. Positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 are possible.  
3. **Constraints**:  
   - A and U cannot share the same position.  
   - The word must include at least these two letters.  
4. **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (since B, C, E, N, O, R, T are ruled out).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test positions for A and U**: Since A can only be in position 2 or 5, and U can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4), we need a word that:  
  - Includes both A and U.  
  - Places A in position 2 or 5 to test its location.  
  - Places U in a new position (not 4) to test its location.  
  - Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, M).  
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters** to prevent ambiguous feedback.  
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters** like S, L, M to uncover more of the word.  

### Selected Guess: ""MAULS""
- **Word breakdown**: M (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **A in position 2** (if correct, we lock it; if wrong, A must be in position 5).  
  - Tests **U in position 3** (new position, not tested before).  
  - Uses new common letters: **M, L, S** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).  
  - Avoids absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Valid English word (plural of ""maul,"" meaning to handle roughly).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If A is in position 2, feedback will show ✓ for A.  
- If U is in position 3, feedback will show ✓ for U.  
- Feedback for M, L, S will reveal if they are present and in the correct positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and U while testing three new letters.",Guess 3: mauls -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) U(✓) L(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,LAUGH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess since the first guess ""crane"" got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation of feedback for ""crane"":
 - C is not in the secret word at all (x)
 - R is not in the secret word at all (x)
 - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Therefore, we know:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3, and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since A is present, we must include A in our next guess. But note: we cannot use C, R, N, E.

 We are trying to form a 5-letter word that includes A (and not in the third position) and avoids C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters, and we only have one confirmed letter: A (somewhere else).

 For the next guess, we should try to test other common letters and also place A in a different position.

 What are common letters? We can try vowels: A is already present, so maybe other vowels? But note: the feedback didn't show any other vowel in the first word? Actually, we don't know.

 Available letters: except C, R, N, E, and we must avoid those.

 We can consider a word that has A and other common consonants like T, L, S, P, M, etc.

 However, note that the letter A was in position 3 in the first guess, so in the next word, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and do not contain C, R, N, E and have A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Also, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that might work:

 Option: ""TASKS"" - but that has S and K? And double S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually the rules don't forbid it, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 However, we must avoid C, R, N, E. So let's check: T, A, S, K, S? But note: we can use S because it's not forbidden yet.

 But wait: we don't know about T, S, K. Let's see:

 Another option: ""PASTA"" - contains A twice? Actually, it has A at position 2 and 5? And letters: P, A, S, T, A.

 But note: we have A twice? The feedback might be tricky? Also, in the secret word, how many A's? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PLAIT"" - but that has L and T? And I? Also, A at position 3? Wait, we must avoid position 3 for A? Because previous feedback: A was in position 3 and marked wrong position? So we can try placing A in other positions.

 But note: the feedback says A is in the wrong position, meaning it exists somewhere else. So for the next guess, we must put A in a different position.

 In ""PASTA"": 
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5.
 The A at position 2 and 5 are new positions? Also we have A twice? It's okay because the secret word might have duplicate A? We don't know.

 However, we are testing multiple new letters: P, S, T, and also A at positions 2 and 5? But the feedback might only tell us about one A? Actually, the feedback will show multiple marks if there are multiple? 

 But note: the feedback format doesn't specify that it marks each occurrence? Actually, it says ""each letter in your guess"", so each occurrence will be marked.

 So if the secret word has two A's, both A's in PASTA might get marked accordingly? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, it's better to avoid duplicates for now? To get clearer feedback? Because if we use two A's, and the word has one A, then only one A will be marked? And the other will be missed? Or marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each letter independently.

 But let me recall the rules: 
   - If a letter in the guess is in the word and in the correct position: ✓.
   - If a letter is in the word but not in the correct position: -.
   - If the letter is not in the word: x.

 Also, note: if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, then only the ones that match will get feedback? Actually, the rules don't specify that? In Wordle, the feedback works by comparing frequency? Actually, we have to assume that the feedback marks each letter independently? But let's think:

 Example: Secret: BRISK, Guess: SHEEP. The feedback would be: S (if S is present) ... but wait, let's imagine.

 Actually, the standard Wordle feedback algorithm: 
   First, mark the exact matches (position and letter). Then, for the rest, for a letter that is in the word but not matched, we mark one occurrence per each in the secret that hasn't been matched? So duplicates matter.

 Therefore, we might avoid duplicates at this stage? Because we have limited information.

 Let me think of words without duplicate letters and without C,R,N,E and with A? And A not in position 3.

 Word: ""PLAIT"" - has A at position 3? Avoid position 3: so we must avoid putting A at 3? Therefore, ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at 3.

 Word: ""PALMS"" - P, A (at position 2), L, M, S? That avoids position for A: 2? So far, we haven't tried position 2? Also, letters: P,A,L,M,S? All are new.

 But note: we are testing L, M, S? and P? That's good.

 Another option: ""SALTY"" - has A at position 2, S at 1, L at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Also avoids C,R,N,E? T and Y are new.

 However, note: we don't know if Y is allowed? It might be in the word? Also, common letters.

 Let me also consider: ""MANGO"" - avoids C,R,N,E? But N is forbidden? Because we had N in first guess and it was marked absent? So we must avoid N? So ""MANGO"" is invalid because it has N? Wait: M,A,N,G,O? N is forbidden? So no.

 Word: ""PAINT"" - N is forbidden? So no.

 Word: ""PAILS"" - P,A,I,L,S? A at position 2? So that's okay? And avoids forbidden letters? Also, new letters.

 But wait: we are avoiding E? PAILS: P, A, I, L, S -> yes, no E? Correct? Yes.

 Similarly, words like ""AUDIO"", but that has U and O? Okay? But U and O might be less common? Alternatively, ""MAVIN"" -> has V? and N is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""ABOUT""? But O, U? Also B? But we don't know about B? But note: in ""crane"", we had A and now we need to test new letters? Also, ""ABOUT"" has O, U, B? And A? But A is at position 2? Also, let's write: A at position 2? Actually: A is at position 1? Wait:

 ""ABOUT"": A (pos1), B (pos2), O (pos3), U (pos4), T (pos5)

 But in our feedback, A is marked as present but in wrong position? The secret word has A, but not at position 3? Now we don't know about position 1? Maybe?

 Also, we can test B, O, U, T? And we know A? So we can try.

 However, we are not sure? 

 Other words: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden? Because we got C absent? So no.

 ""PASTA"": We considered earlier? But has duplicate A? Actually: P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? So if the secret word has one A, then the feedback will mark one of the A's as present? and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark:
   The first A: at position 2? If the secret word has A at say position 1, then that would be '-' (wrong position) and then the last A: also marked based on the secret? But the secret has only one A: then the second A will be marked as 'x'? So it's okay? But we lose one space? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So maybe ""PLASM"" is not common? How about ""PAKSA""? Not English? 

 I think ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? And we can use it? Or ""PIZZA"" has duplicate Z? But we don't know? Also, Z is low frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SALSA"" has duplicate S and A? Not good? 

 So let's pick a word without duplicates? Like ""SALET"" (which is a word? Yes in some dictionaries). SALET: S, A, L, E, T? But E is forbidden? Because in crane, E was absent? So E is forbidden? We cannot use E.

 So we must avoid E. 

 Then, what about ""TAMPS"" - T, A, M, P, S? No duplicates? And A at position 2? And avoids E? Letters: T, A, M, P, S? All allowed? Because we haven't ruled them out? 

 Actually, ""TAMPS"" is a word? It means: to press something down? But it's a bit obscure? 

 Or ""PALMS""? We had that? 

 Another option: ""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y? But D? and Y? 

 Or ""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y? Has A at position 2? Letters: H,A,S,T,Y? H is new? 

 But note: we don't know about H? 

 Alternatively, let's stick to common words? 

 I think ""SALAD"" has duplicate A? So avoid? 

 I found: ""STAID"" - S, T, A, I, D? But has A at position 3? We need to avoid position 3? So no? Because if we put A at position 3, and the secret word doesn't have A there? But we know that position 3 is wrong? So avoid? Actually, we can try putting A at position 3? But we know it is not correct? So we must avoid? The feedback told us A is in the word but not at position 3? So putting A at position 3 again would be a waste? Because we know it will not be correct? 

 Therefore, avoid position 3? 

 So words with A at positions: 1,2,4,5? 

 Then: ""MATHS"" - M, A, T, H, S? -> A at position 2? Okay? 

 But we haven't tested M? T? H? S? That's good? But is MATHS common? Yes.

 Another: ""PATHY"" - not common? 

 Or ""FATAL"" -> duplicate A? Avoid? 

 Then, ""SPAWN"" - S, P, A, W, N? But N is forbidden? Because we tried N and it was absent? So forbidden? 

 So ""SPAWN"" invalid? 

 How about ""FATLY""? Not common? 

 Maybe ""TALKS""? -> T, A, L, K, S? A at position 2? Avoids bad letters? 

 ""TALKS"" is a word? Yes: talk in third person? Or noun? Like sales talks? 

 So TALKS: T, A, L, K, S? 

 Also avoids C,R,N,E? So we can try? 

 Similarly, ""WALKS""? W is less common? 

 So let's choose ""TALKS"". 

 But note: we might want to test more vowels? So far, we only know A is present? Are there other vowels? Maybe try a word with O? U? I? 

 But in TALKS: we have A again? And also testing T, L, K, S? And A? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word with another vowel? Like O? 

 Words with O? And A? And avoid bad letters? 

 For example: ""ABOVE"" -> E is bad? Forbidden? 

 ""ABOUT"" we considered? But O and U? and A at position 1? 

 In ""ABOUT"": A at position 1? We don't know about position 1? So it might be correct? Or not? 

 Also, we can test U? 

 Maybe ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S? No A? But we must include A because it is present? 

 Wait, remember: we must include A? Because we know the secret word has A? 

 Therefore, our next guess must include A? 

 So words without A are invalid? 

 Therefore, ""TALKS"" is acceptable: includes A? 

 Similarly, ""ABOUT"" includes A? 

 Which one is better? 

 ""TALKS"" has letters: T, A, L, K, S? 

 ""ABOUT"" has letters: A, B, O, U, T? 

 Which set of letters is more common? 

 In terms of frequency: 
   T is very common? 
   A is common? 
   L, K, S: common? 
   B, O, U: common? 

 But note: in ""ABOUT"", we are testing O (a vowel) and U? Which might be worth? 

 Also, we know that E is not in the word? So vowels? Only A? Or others? 

 We might want to know about other vowels? 

 So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is better? Because it has O and U? 

 But wait: in the secret word, we know A is present? And we don't know about other vowels? So testing O and U? 

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses A at position 1? 

 Previously in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And it was wrong? Now we put A at position 1? 

 That's good? 

 So I'm leaning toward ""ABOUT"". 

 However, note: we also know that R is absent? So no R? But ABOUT doesn't have R? So okay? 

 Also, C, E, N are absent? 

 So let's choose ""ABOUT""? 

 But wait: we are going to test: A at position 1? 

 Let's write:

 Guess: A B O U T

 What if the secret word has A? But not at position 1? Then we'll get A marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, since A is present, even if at position 1? If the secret word has A at position 1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? 

 But note: we know A is not at position 3? Because in ""crane"", position 3? Marked wrong? But positions 1,2,4,5? 

 So ABOUT puts A in position 1? So it might be correct? Or might not? Either way, we'll get feedback? 

 After thinking: 

 Another word is ""ADOBE"" - O and B? But E is forbidden? So no? 

 ""ABOVE"" forbidden? E? 

 ""ADIEU"" - has D, I, E? But E forbidden? 

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a reasonable choice? 

 But also ""WAQFS""? Not English? 

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for the next guess? 

 However, what about ""LASTS""? duplicate S? And has A at position 2? But duplicate? 

 Given the constraints, I'll pick ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, we could pick ""STAMP""? Without E? But note: we avoid R? And avoid E? But STAMP has S,T,A,M,P? A at position 3? We must avoid position 3? 

 Therefore, avoid? Position 3 for A? 

 So STAMP: A is at position 3? So we shouldn't use? 

 Then, let's choose ""ABOUT"" definitely? 

 So next guess: ABOUT

<guess>about</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word (marked with ✗).
- A is present but in the wrong position (marked with -).

Key deductions for the next guess:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. We must exclude C, R, N, E entirely from the new guess.
3. The new guess should include A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its location.
4. Prioritize testing common letters not yet evaluated (e.g., B, O, U, T) for efficiency.
5. Avoid letter repetition to prevent ambiguous feedback.

Selected word: **ABOUT**
- A is placed in position 1 (new position to test).
- Tests new letters: B, O, U, T (common consonants/vowels).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and avoids duplication.

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""about"" -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
- B, O, T are absent from the secret word.
- U is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T
Present letters: A and U (but not in the positions we tried)

Specifically for A:
- Not in position 3 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 1 (from ""about"")

For U:
- Not in position 4 (from ""about"")

We also know the secret word must contain A and U, and they are in positions other than 1, 3, and 4? Actually, we don't know about position 2 and 5 for A, and for U, we only know it's not in position 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But note: we have tried position 1 for A and it was wrong, so A is not in 1. Also, we know A is not in 3. So A must be in position 2 or 5? Similarly, U is not in 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But we have to consider that the word has 5 letters.

Now, the secret word has A and U, and we have 5 positions. We need to form a word that includes A and U, and avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T.

Also, we have to test new letters to find the exact positions.

Let's list the available positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
For U: positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

But note: if A is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2? Because one position can't have two letters? So if A is in 2, then U must be in 1,3, or 5? Similarly, if A is in 5, then U can be in 1,2,3.

We also need to include other letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T

So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize information.

We know the word must have A and U, so we can think of words that contain both.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in position 2, U in position 1? But U in position 1: e.g., ""U_ A _ _ _""

But we have to fill the rest. For example, ""USUAL"" -> but U is at 1 and 4? But we have U at 4? But we know U is not at 4? So ""USUAL"" has U at 1 and 4? But we know U is not at 4? So that would be invalid? Also, we have A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? So ""USUAL"" is invalid.

Option: ""AUDIO"" -> but O is absent? Forbidden? And A at 1? But we know A is not at 1? So no.

We need A at 2 or 5.

Let's try A at 2: then the word is _ A _ _ _

And U must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,5? But position 1: if U is at 1, then ""U A _ _ _""

We need to fill the last three positions with letters not forbidden and including U? But U is already at 1? So the other positions? We need to have the U that is present? But we have one U? Or could there be more? We don't know.

But we know U is present, so at least one U. In this case, if we put U at 1, then we have U at 1, which is a new position? But we don't know if it's correct? We are testing.

Similarly, if A is at 5: then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First, with A at 2 and U at 1: words like ""UAPAS""? Not English. ""UAKIS""? No. ""UALAS""? No. ""UDALS""? Not common. ""UGALI"" - U G A L I? But G, L, I are allowed? And U at 1, A at 3? But A at 3 is forbidden? We know A is not at 3? So we cannot have A at 3? So ""UGALI"" has A at 3? Invalid.

So if A is at 2, then U at 1: what words? ""UNAUS"" - but N is forbidden? And U at 1 and 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.

Perhaps U at 3? For a word with A at 2: _ A U _ _

Like ""SAULT"" - S A U L T? But T is forbidden? T is absent? So no.

""MAULS"" - M A U L S? M, A, U, L, S? All allowed? And A at 2, U at 3? 

But we know U is present? And we are putting U at 3? It might be correct? Or not? But we don't know? Also, A at 2? We don't know if that's correct? 

Similarly, ""GAUZE"" - E is forbidden? No.

""FAUNA"" - N is forbidden? No.

""HAULM"" - H A U L M? But M? And L? 

""HAULM"" is a word? It means a part of a plant? But uncommon? 

But let's consider: we have to avoid forbidden letters? So ""HAULM"" has H,A,U,L,M? All allowed? 

But we have A at 2 and U at 3? 

Now, what about A at 5? Then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.

For example, ""SULFA"" - S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? But F? 

""SULFA"" is a word? Sulfa drugs? 

But we have U at 2? And A at 5? 

Also, S, U, L, F, A? All allowed? 

Similarly, ""PUDSA"" - not a word? 

""QUADS"" - Q U A D S? But A at 3? We know A is not at 3? So invalid? 

""JUMAR"" - R forbidden? 

""GUAVA"" - duplicate A? And V? But we don't know? Also, A at 3? Forbidden? 

So not.

Another word: ""SUDRA"" - R forbidden? 

Perhaps ""LAUDA"" - L A U D A? Duplicate A? And D? But A at 1? We know A is not at 1? In ""LAUDA"": A at 2 and 5? But we are considering A at 5? So if we put A at 5, then in ""LAUDA"", A is at 2 and 5? But we know A is not at 1? But position 2 is not tested? 

But we have U at 3? 

But ""LAUDA"" has duplicate A? 

To avoid duplicates, we might prefer words without duplicates? 

But let's list possible words without duplicates? 

With A at 2 and U at 3: 
- ""MAULS"" as above? M A U L S
- ""PAULS"" - P A U L S? But P is allowed? 
- ""WAULS"" - W A U L S? 

But ""WAULS"" is a word? To wail like a cat? 

Similarly, ""GAUMS"" - G A U M S? 

But we don't know if these are common? 

With A at 5 and U at 1: 
- ""USNEA"" - U S N E A? But N and E forbidden? No.
- ""USQUA"" - not common? 

With A at 5 and U at 2: 
- ""SULFA"" as above? S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? 
- ""DUCAL"" - D U C A L? C forbidden? No.

With A at 5 and U at 3: 
- ""PULKA"" - P U L K A? U at 2? A at 5? Actually, P U L K A: U at 2? 
- ""TUFAS"" - T forbidden? 
- ""KUDUS"" - K U D U S? Duplicate U? 
- ""HUSHA"" - H U S H A? Duplicate H? 

Not great.

Perhaps we should consider U at 5? But we haven't tried U at 5? 

In the case of A at 2, U at 5: _ A _ _ U

Words: ""GADJU"" - G A D J U? J? 
""PALAU"" - P A L A U? Duplicate A? 
""MANUU"" - not? 

""SAVYU"" - not English? 

Hard.

Alternatively, A at 5 and U at 1: ""U _ _ _ A""

Words: ""USUAL"" -> but U at 1 and 4? U at 4 is forbidden? And A at 5? But U at 4 is not allowed? 
""URAEI"" - R and E forbidden? 
""UGLIA"" - U G L I A? A at 5? But I? 

""UGLIA"" is not common? 

After consideration, let's go with ""MAULS"" or ""SULFA"". 

But ""SULFA"" has U at 2 and A at 5? 

We can also test new letters? 

In ""MAULS"": M, A, U, L, S? 
In ""SULFA"": S, U, L, F, A? 

Both test L? 

But we need to know the position of A and U? 

We know A is not at 1 or 3, so in ""MAULS"", A is at 2? If we get feedback that A is correct at 2, then we know? Or if not? 

Similarly, U is at 3 in ""MAULS""? 

In ""SULFA"", A is at 5? U at 2? 

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have other letters? 

Another idea: we can try to put A in position 5 and U in position 3? But we need a word? 

For example, ""LUDIC"" - C forbidden? 
""FUSTY"" - F U S T Y? T forbidden? 

Not working.

Perhaps ""DAUBs"" but D A U B S? B is forbidden? 

B is absent? So no.

Let's list all possible words that contain A and U, no forbidden letters, and A not in 1 or 3, U not in 4.

Forbidden letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T

Available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words with A and U:

- A at 2, U at 1: hard, as above.
- A at 2, U at 3: MAULS, PAULS, WAULS, GAUMS, HAULM, JAUKS (J?), QAIDS (Q?), etc.
- A at 2, U at 5: PAGUS? Not common.
- A at 5, U at 1: USUAL (invalid because U at 4 and A at 3? No, USUAL is U S U A L? No, U at 1, S at 2, U at 3? Duplicate U? And A at 4? But A at 4 is not forbidden? We only know A not at 1 or 3? But in USUAL, A is at 4? Which is new? But U is at 1 and 3? And we have U at 3? But we don't know about U at 3? But the word has duplicate U? And we know U is present, but we don't know if it's multiple? Also, U at 4 is not in this word? USUAL: positions: 1:U, 2:S, 3:U, 4:A, 5:L? But U at 3? And A at 4? But we know U is not at 4? But here U is at 1 and 3? So U at 4 is not present? So it's okay? But the feedback for U: if we put U at 1 and 3, and the secret word has only one U, then one of them might be marked absent? 

But let's avoid duplicates for clarity? 

So back to ""MAULS"": M A U L S

- A at position 2
- U at position 3

If we guess ""MAULS"", possible feedback:
- If A is in position 2, it will be marked correct? Or if not, then wrong position? But we know A is in the word, so if not at 2, then it must be at 5? Because only 2 or 5 are possible? 

Similarly, U at 3: if U is in position 3, correct? Otherwise, wrong position? 

Also, we test M, L, S? 

Another word: ""SULFA"": S U L F A

- U at position 2
- A at position 5

Similarly, we test S, L, F.

Which one to choose? 

We might want to test a vowel? We know A and U are present, but are there other vowels? Like I? 

In ""MAULS"", we have no other vowels? In ""SULFA"", also no? 

But we can try to include I? 

For example, with A at 2 and U at 3, is there a word with I? Like ""QAIDS"" - Q and I? But Q is rare? 

""GUIDs"" but G U I D S? A not present? 

We must have A and U.

""QUAIS"" - Q U A I S? A at 3? Forbidden? 

""LAIUS"" - L A I U S? A at 2, U at 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.

So perhaps ""MAULS"" is acceptable.

But let's check if ""MAULS"" is a valid word? It is the plural of maul, meaning to handle roughly? Or a type of weapon? But in Wordle, it might be accepted.

Similarly, ""PAULS"" is a proper name? Might not be accepted? 

""WAULS"" is valid? 

To be safe, let's choose ""HAULM"" or ""MAULS"". I think ""MAULS"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""GAUZE"" has E? Forbidden.

I think ""MAULS"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: ""AULAS"" - A at 1? But A not at 1? So invalid.

Or ""JUMPS"" - no A? 

So I'll go with ""MAULS"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

Guess: M A U L S

If the secret word has A at 2, then we get A correct? If not, then A must be at 5, and we'll get A marked as absent or wrong position? But since we know A is in the word, if it's not at 2, then it should be marked as '-' for wrong position? But in the guess, A is at 2, so if the secret has A at 5, then in this guess, A at 2 should be marked as '-' (wrong position) because it's present but not here.

Similarly for U at 3: if U is at 3, then correct? If not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know U is present, so it would be '-' if not at 3.

Also, we get feedback on M, L, S.

So it's good.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A at 5? Like ""SULFA"", but ""SULFA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SNAFU"" - but S N A F U? N forbidden? No.

""FJORD"" - no A? 

I think ""MAULS"" is fine.

So next guess: MAULS

But let's write it as <guess>mauls</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(✗), R(✗), A(-), N(✗), E(✗)  
  - **A** is present but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""about""** → A(-), B(✗), O(✗), U(-), T(✗)  
  - **A** is present but not in position 1 (since it was marked wrong position).  
  - **U** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **B, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T (cannot appear in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - **A**: Must be in the word but not in positions 1 or 3. Only positions 2 or 5 are possible.  
   - **U**: Must be in the word but not in position 4. Positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 are possible.  
3. **Constraints**:  
   - A and U cannot share the same position.  
   - The word must include at least these two letters.  
4. **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (since B, C, E, N, O, R, T are ruled out).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test positions for A and U**: Since A can only be in position 2 or 5, and U can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4), we need a word that:  
  - Includes both A and U.  
  - Places A in position 2 or 5 to test its location.  
  - Places U in a new position (not 4) to test its location.  
  - Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, M).  
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters** to prevent ambiguous feedback.  
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters** like S, L, M to uncover more of the word.  

### Selected Guess: ""MAULS""
- **Word breakdown**: M (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **A in position 2** (if correct, we lock it; if wrong, A must be in position 5).  
  - Tests **U in position 3** (new position, not tested before).  
  - Uses new common letters: **M, L, S** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).  
  - Avoids absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Valid English word (plural of ""maul,"" meaning to handle roughly).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If A is in position 2, feedback will show ✓ for A.  
- If U is in position 3, feedback will show ✓ for U.  
- Feedback for M, L, S will reveal if they are present and in the correct positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and U while testing three new letters.

The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3, and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\n Since A is present, we must include A in our next guess. But note: we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\n We are trying to form a 5-letter word that includes A (and not in the third position) and avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters, and we only have one confirmed letter: A (somewhere else).\n\n For the next guess, we should try to test other common letters and also place A in a different position.\n\n What are common letters? We can try vowels: A is already present, so maybe other vowels? But note: the feedback didn\'t show any other vowel in the first word? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Available letters: except C, R, N, E, and we must avoid those.\n\n We can consider a word that has A and other common consonants like T, L, S, P, M, etc.\n\n However, note that the letter A was in position 3 in the first guess, so in the next word, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have A and do not contain C, R, N, E and have A in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Let me list some words that might work:\n\n Option: ""TASKS"" - but that has S and K? And double S? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Actually the rules don\'t forbid it, but the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n However, we must avoid C, R, N, E. So let\'s check: T, A, S, K, S? But note: we can use S because it\'s not forbidden yet.\n\n But wait: we don\'t know about T, S, K. Let\'s see:\n\n Another option: ""PASTA"" - contains A twice? Actually, it has A at position 2 and 5? And letters: P, A, S, T, A.\n\n But note: we have A twice? The feedback might be tricky? Also, in the secret word, how many A\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""PLAIT"" - but that has L and T? And I? Also, A at position 3? Wait, we must avoid position 3 for A? Because previous feedback: A was in position 3 and marked wrong position? So we can try placing A in other positions.\n\n But note: the feedback says A is in the wrong position, meaning it exists somewhere else. So for the next guess, we must put A in a different position.\n\n In ""PASTA"": \n   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5.\n The A at position 2 and 5 are new positions? Also we have A twice? It\'s okay because the secret word might have duplicate A? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing multiple new letters: P, S, T, and also A at positions 2 and 5? But the feedback might only tell us about one A? Actually, the feedback will show multiple marks if there are multiple? \n\n But note: the feedback format doesn\'t specify that it marks each occurrence? Actually, it says ""each letter in your guess"", so each occurrence will be marked.\n\n So if the secret word has two A\'s, both A\'s in PASTA might get marked accordingly? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now? To get clearer feedback? Because if we use two A\'s, and the word has one A, then only one A will be marked? And the other will be missed? Or marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each letter independently.\n\n But let me recall the rules: \n   - If a letter in the guess is in the word and in the correct position: ✓.\n   - If a letter is in the word but not in the correct position: -.\n   - If the letter is not in the word: x.\n\n Also, note: if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, then only the ones that match will get feedback? Actually, the rules don\'t specify that? In Wordle, the feedback works by comparing frequency? Actually, we have to assume that the feedback marks each letter independently? But let\'s think:\n\n Example: Secret: BRISK, Guess: SHEEP. The feedback would be: S (if S is present) ... but wait, let\'s imagine.\n\n Actually, the standard Wordle feedback algorithm: \n   First, mark the exact matches (position and letter). Then, for the rest, for a letter that is in the word but not matched, we mark one occurrence per each in the secret that hasn\'t been matched? So duplicates matter.\n\n Therefore, we might avoid duplicates at this stage? Because we have limited information.\n\n Let me think of words without duplicate letters and without C,R,N,E and with A? And A not in position 3.\n\n Word: ""PLAIT"" - has A at position 3? Avoid position 3: so we must avoid putting A at 3? Therefore, ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at 3.\n\n Word: ""PALMS"" - P, A (at position 2), L, M, S? That avoids position for A: 2? So far, we haven\'t tried position 2? Also, letters: P,A,L,M,S? All are new.\n\n But note: we are testing L, M, S? and P? That\'s good.\n\n Another option: ""SALTY"" - has A at position 2, S at 1, L at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Also avoids C,R,N,E? T and Y are new.\n\n However, note: we don\'t know if Y is allowed? It might be in the word? Also, common letters.\n\n Let me also consider: ""MANGO"" - avoids C,R,N,E? But N is forbidden? Because we had N in first guess and it was marked absent? So we must avoid N? So ""MANGO"" is invalid because it has N? Wait: M,A,N,G,O? N is forbidden? So no.\n\n Word: ""PAINT"" - N is forbidden? So no.\n\n Word: ""PAILS"" - P,A,I,L,S? A at position 2? So that\'s okay? And avoids forbidden letters? Also, new letters.\n\n But wait: we are avoiding E? PAILS: P, A, I, L, S -> yes, no E? Correct? Yes.\n\n Similarly, words like ""AUDIO"", but that has U and O? Okay? But U and O might be less common? Alternatively, ""MAVIN"" -> has V? and N is forbidden? So no.\n\n How about ""ABOUT""? But O, U? Also B? But we don\'t know about B? But note: in ""crane"", we had A and now we need to test new letters? Also, ""ABOUT"" has O, U, B? And A? But A is at position 2? Also, let\'s write: A at position 2? Actually: A is at position 1? Wait:\n\n ""ABOUT"": A (pos1), B (pos2), O (pos3), U (pos4), T (pos5)\n\n But in our feedback, A is marked as present but in wrong position? The secret word has A, but not at position 3? Now we don\'t know about position 1? Maybe?\n\n Also, we can test B, O, U, T? And we know A? So we can try.\n\n However, we are not sure? \n\n Other words: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden? Because we got C absent? So no.\n\n ""PASTA"": We considered earlier? But has duplicate A? Actually: P, A, S, T, A -> two A\'s? So if the secret word has one A, then the feedback will mark one of the A\'s as present? and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark:\n   The first A: at position 2? If the secret word has A at say position 1, then that would be \'-\' (wrong position) and then the last A: also marked based on the secret? But the secret has only one A: then the second A will be marked as \'x\'? So it\'s okay? But we lose one space? \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So maybe ""PLASM"" is not common? How about ""PAKSA""? Not English? \n\n I think ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? And we can use it? Or ""PIZZA"" has duplicate Z? But we don\'t know? Also, Z is low frequency.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALSA"" has duplicate S and A? Not good? \n\n So let\'s pick a word without duplicates? Like ""SALET"" (which is a word? Yes in some dictionaries). SALET: S, A, L, E, T? But E is forbidden? Because in crane, E was absent? So E is forbidden? We cannot use E.\n\n So we must avoid E. \n\n Then, what about ""TAMPS"" - T, A, M, P, S? No duplicates? And A at position 2? And avoids E? Letters: T, A, M, P, S? All allowed? Because we haven\'t ruled them out? \n\n Actually, ""TAMPS"" is a word? It means: to press something down? But it\'s a bit obscure? \n\n Or ""PALMS""? We had that? \n\n Another option: ""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y? But D? and Y? \n\n Or ""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y? Has A at position 2? Letters: H,A,S,T,Y? H is new? \n\n But note: we don\'t know about H? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s stick to common words? \n\n I think ""SALAD"" has duplicate A? So avoid? \n\n I found: ""STAID"" - S, T, A, I, D? But has A at position 3? We need to avoid position 3? So no? Because if we put A at position 3, and the secret word doesn\'t have A there? But we know that position 3 is wrong? So avoid? Actually, we can try putting A at position 3? But we know it is not correct? So we must avoid? The feedback told us A is in the word but not at position 3? So putting A at position 3 again would be a waste? Because we know it will not be correct? \n\n Therefore, avoid position 3? \n\n So words with A at positions: 1,2,4,5? \n\n Then: ""MATHS"" - M, A, T, H, S? -> A at position 2? Okay? \n\n But we haven\'t tested M? T? H? S? That\'s good? But is MATHS common? Yes.\n\n Another: ""PATHY"" - not common? \n\n Or ""FATAL"" -> duplicate A? Avoid? \n\n Then, ""SPAWN"" - S, P, A, W, N? But N is forbidden? Because we tried N and it was absent? So forbidden? \n\n So ""SPAWN"" invalid? \n\n How about ""FATLY""? Not common? \n\n Maybe ""TALKS""? -> T, A, L, K, S? A at position 2? Avoids bad letters? \n\n ""TALKS"" is a word? Yes: talk in third person? Or noun? Like sales talks? \n\n So TALKS: T, A, L, K, S? \n\n Also avoids C,R,N,E? So we can try? \n\n Similarly, ""WALKS""? W is less common? \n\n So let\'s choose ""TALKS"". \n\n But note: we might want to test more vowels? So far, we only know A is present? Are there other vowels? Maybe try a word with O? U? I? \n\n But in TALKS: we have A again? And also testing T, L, K, S? And A? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with another vowel? Like O? \n\n Words with O? And A? And avoid bad letters? \n\n For example: ""ABOVE"" -> E is bad? Forbidden? \n\n ""ABOUT"" we considered? But O and U? and A at position 1? \n\n In ""ABOUT"": A at position 1? We don\'t know about position 1? So it might be correct? Or not? \n\n Also, we can test U? \n\n Maybe ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S? No A? But we must include A because it is present? \n\n Wait, remember: we must include A? Because we know the secret word has A? \n\n Therefore, our next guess must include A? \n\n So words without A are invalid? \n\n Therefore, ""TALKS"" is acceptable: includes A? \n\n Similarly, ""ABOUT"" includes A? \n\n Which one is better? \n\n ""TALKS"" has letters: T, A, L, K, S? \n\n ""ABOUT"" has letters: A, B, O, U, T? \n\n Which set of letters is more common? \n\n In terms of frequency: \n   T is very common? \n   A is common? \n   L, K, S: common? \n   B, O, U: common? \n\n But note: in ""ABOUT"", we are testing O (a vowel) and U? Which might be worth? \n\n Also, we know that E is not in the word? So vowels? Only A? Or others? \n\n We might want to know about other vowels? \n\n So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is better? Because it has O and U? \n\n But wait: in the secret word, we know A is present? And we don\'t know about other vowels? So testing O and U? \n\n Also, ""ABOUT"" uses A at position 1? \n\n Previously in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And it was wrong? Now we put A at position 1? \n\n That\'s good? \n\n So I\'m leaning toward ""ABOUT"". \n\n However, note: we also know that R is absent? So no R? But ABOUT doesn\'t have R? So okay? \n\n Also, C, E, N are absent? \n\n So let\'s choose ""ABOUT""? \n\n But wait: we are going to test: A at position 1? \n\n Let\'s write:\n\n Guess: A B O U T\n\n What if the secret word has A? But not at position 1? Then we\'ll get A marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, since A is present, even if at position 1? If the secret word has A at position 1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if it\'s elsewhere? Then \'-\'? \n\n But note: we know A is not at position 3? Because in ""crane"", position 3? Marked wrong? But positions 1,2,4,5? \n\n So ABOUT puts A in position 1? So it might be correct? Or might not? Either way, we\'ll get feedback? \n\n After thinking: \n\n Another word is ""ADOBE"" - O and B? But E is forbidden? So no? \n\n ""ABOVE"" forbidden? E? \n\n ""ADIEU"" - has D, I, E? But E forbidden? \n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems a reasonable choice? \n\n But also ""WAQFS""? Not English? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" for the next guess? \n\n However, what about ""LASTS""? duplicate S? And has A at position 2? But duplicate? \n\n Given the constraints, I\'ll pick ""ABOUT"".\n\n Alternatively, we could pick ""STAMP""? Without E? But note: we avoid R? And avoid E? But STAMP has S,T,A,M,P? A at position 3? We must avoid position 3? \n\n Therefore, avoid? Position 3 for A? \n\n So STAMP: A is at position 3? So we shouldn\'t use? \n\n Then, let\'s choose ""ABOUT"" definitely? \n\n So next guess: ABOUT\n\n<guess>about</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word (marked with ✗).\n- A is present but in the wrong position (marked with -).\n\nKey deductions for the next guess:\n1. The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.\n2. We must exclude C, R, N, E entirely from the new guess.\n3. The new guess should include A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its location.\n4. Prioritize testing common letters not yet evaluated (e.g., B, O, U, T) for efficiency.\n5. Avoid letter repetition to prevent ambiguous feedback.\n\nSelected word: **ABOUT**\n- A is placed in position 1 (new position to test).\n- Tests new letters: B, O, U, T (common consonants/vowels).\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and avoids duplication.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the third guess.

Actually, we don\'t know about position 2 and 5 for A, and for U, we only know it\'s not in position 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But note: we have tried position 1 for A and it was wrong, so A is not in 1. Also, we know A is not in 3. So A must be in position 2 or 5? Similarly, U is not in 4, so it could be in 1,2,3,5? But we have to consider that the word has 5 letters.\n\nNow, the secret word has A and U, and we have 5 positions. We need to form a word that includes A and U, and avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T.\n\nAlso, we have to test new letters to find the exact positions.\n\nLet\'s list the available positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).\nFor U: positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\nBut note: if A is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2? Because one position can\'t have two letters? So if A is in 2, then U must be in 1,3, or 5? Similarly, if A is in 5, then U can be in 1,2,3.\n\nWe also need to include other letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T\n\nSo available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe should try to use common letters to maximize information.\n\nWe know the word must have A and U, so we can think of words that contain both.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 2, U in position 1? But U in position 1: e.g., ""U_ A _ _ _""\n\nBut we have to fill the rest. For example, ""USUAL"" -> but U is at 1 and 4? But we have U at 4? But we know U is not at 4? So ""USUAL"" has U at 1 and 4? But we know U is not at 4? So that would be invalid? Also, we have A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? So ""USUAL"" is invalid.\n\nOption: ""AUDIO"" -> but O is absent? Forbidden? And A at 1? But we know A is not at 1? So no.\n\nWe need A at 2 or 5.\n\nLet\'s try A at 2: then the word is _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd U must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,5? But position 1: if U is at 1, then ""U A _ _ _""\n\nWe need to fill the last three positions with letters not forbidden and including U? But U is already at 1? So the other positions? We need to have the U that is present? But we have one U? Or could there be more? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we know U is present, so at least one U. In this case, if we put U at 1, then we have U at 1, which is a new position? But we don\'t know if it\'s correct? We are testing.\n\nSimilarly, if A is at 5: then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.\n\nNow, let\'s think of actual words.\n\nFirst, with A at 2 and U at 1: words like ""UAPAS""? Not English. ""UAKIS""? No. ""UALAS""? No. ""UDALS""? Not common. ""UGALI"" - U G A L I? But G, L, I are allowed? And U at 1, A at 3? But A at 3 is forbidden? We know A is not at 3? So we cannot have A at 3? So ""UGALI"" has A at 3? Invalid.\n\nSo if A is at 2, then U at 1: what words? ""UNAUS"" - but N is forbidden? And U at 1 and 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.\n\nPerhaps U at 3? For a word with A at 2: _ A U _ _\n\nLike ""SAULT"" - S A U L T? But T is forbidden? T is absent? So no.\n\n""MAULS"" - M A U L S? M, A, U, L, S? All allowed? And A at 2, U at 3? \n\nBut we know U is present? And we are putting U at 3? It might be correct? Or not? But we don\'t know? Also, A at 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n\nSimilarly, ""GAUZE"" - E is forbidden? No.\n\n""FAUNA"" - N is forbidden? No.\n\n""HAULM"" - H A U L M? But M? And L? \n\n""HAULM"" is a word? It means a part of a plant? But uncommon? \n\nBut let\'s consider: we have to avoid forbidden letters? So ""HAULM"" has H,A,U,L,M? All allowed? \n\nBut we have A at 2 and U at 3? \n\nNow, what about A at 5? Then the word is _ _ _ _ A, and U can be at 1,2,3.\n\nFor example, ""SULFA"" - S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? But F? \n\n""SULFA"" is a word? Sulfa drugs? \n\nBut we have U at 2? And A at 5? \n\nAlso, S, U, L, F, A? All allowed? \n\nSimilarly, ""PUDSA"" - not a word? \n\n""QUADS"" - Q U A D S? But A at 3? We know A is not at 3? So invalid? \n\n""JUMAR"" - R forbidden? \n\n""GUAVA"" - duplicate A? And V? But we don\'t know? Also, A at 3? Forbidden? \n\nSo not.\n\nAnother word: ""SUDRA"" - R forbidden? \n\nPerhaps ""LAUDA"" - L A U D A? Duplicate A? And D? But A at 1? We know A is not at 1? In ""LAUDA"": A at 2 and 5? But we are considering A at 5? So if we put A at 5, then in ""LAUDA"", A is at 2 and 5? But we know A is not at 1? But position 2 is not tested? \n\nBut we have U at 3? \n\nBut ""LAUDA"" has duplicate A? \n\nTo avoid duplicates, we might prefer words without duplicates? \n\nBut let\'s list possible words without duplicates? \n\nWith A at 2 and U at 3: \n- ""MAULS"" as above? M A U L S\n- ""PAULS"" - P A U L S? But P is allowed? \n- ""WAULS"" - W A U L S? \n\nBut ""WAULS"" is a word? To wail like a cat? \n\nSimilarly, ""GAUMS"" - G A U M S? \n\nBut we don\'t know if these are common? \n\nWith A at 5 and U at 1: \n- ""USNEA"" - U S N E A? But N and E forbidden? No.\n- ""USQUA"" - not common? \n\nWith A at 5 and U at 2: \n- ""SULFA"" as above? S U L F A? U at 2? A at 5? \n- ""DUCAL"" - D U C A L? C forbidden?

Duplicate H? \n\nNot great.\n\nPerhaps we should consider U at 5? But we haven\'t tried U at 5? \n\nIn the case of A at 2, U at 5: _ A _ _ U\n\nWords: ""GADJU"" - G A D J U? J? \n""PALAU"" - P A L A U? Duplicate A? \n""MANUU"" - not? \n\n""SAVYU"" - not English? \n\nHard.\n\nAlternatively, A at 5 and U at 1: ""U _ _ _ A""\n\nWords: ""USUAL"" -> but U at 1 and 4? U at 4 is forbidden? And A at 5? But U at 4 is not allowed? \n""URAEI"" - R and E forbidden? \n""UGLIA"" - U G L I A? A at 5? But I? \n\n""UGLIA"" is not common? \n\nAfter consideration, let\'s go with ""MAULS"" or ""SULFA"". \n\nBut ""SULFA"" has U at 2 and A at 5? \n\nWe can also test new letters? \n\nIn ""MAULS"": M, A, U, L, S? \nIn ""SULFA"": S, U, L, F, A? \n\nBoth test L? \n\nBut we need to know the position of A and U? \n\nWe know A is not at 1 or 3, so in ""MAULS"", A is at 2? If we get feedback that A is correct at 2, then we know? Or if not? \n\nSimilarly, U is at 3 in ""MAULS""? \n\nIn ""SULFA"", A is at 5? U at 2? \n\nBut we also have to consider that the secret word might have other letters? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to put A in position 5 and U in position 3? But we need a word? \n\nFor example, ""LUDIC"" - C forbidden? \n""FUSTY"" - F U S T Y? T forbidden? \n\nNot working.\n\nPerhaps ""DAUBs"" but D A U B S? B is forbidden? \n\nB is absent? So no.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that contain A and U, no forbidden letters, and A not in 1 or 3, U not in 4.\n\nForbidden letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T\n\nAvailable: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWords with A and U:\n\n- A at 2, U at 1: hard, as above.\n- A at 2, U at 3: MAULS, PAULS, WAULS, GAUMS, HAULM, JAUKS (J?), QAIDS (Q?), etc.\n- A at 2, U at 5: PAGUS? Not common.\n- A at 5, U at 1: USUAL (invalid because U at 4 and A at 3? No, USUAL is U S U A L? No, U at 1, S at 2, U at 3? Duplicate U? And A at 4? But A at 4 is not forbidden? We only know A not at 1 or 3? But in USUAL, A is at 4? Which is new? But U is at 1 and 3? And we have U at 3? But we don\'t know about U at 3? But the word has duplicate U? And we know U is present, but we don\'t know if it\'s multiple? Also, U at 4 is not in this word? USUAL: positions: 1:U, 2:S, 3:U, 4:A, 5:L? But U at 3? And A at 4? But we know U is not at 4? But here U is at 1 and 3? So U at 4 is not present? So it\'s okay? But the feedback for U: if we put U at 1 and 3, and the secret word has only one U, then one of them might be marked absent? \n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for clarity? \n\nSo back to ""MAULS"": M A U L S\n\n- A at position 2\n- U at position 3\n\nIf we guess ""MAULS"", possible feedback:\n- If A is in position 2, it will be marked correct? Or if not, then wrong position? But we know A is in the word, so if not at 2, then it must be at 5? Because only 2 or 5 are possible? \n\nSimilarly, U at 3: if U is in position 3, correct? Otherwise, wrong position? \n\nAlso, we test M, L, S? \n\nAnother word: ""SULFA"": S U L F A\n\n- U at position 2\n- A at position 5\n\nSimilarly, we test S, L, F.\n\nWhich one to choose? \n\nWe might want to test a vowel? We know A and U are present, but are there other vowels? Like I? \n\nIn ""MAULS"", we have no other vowels? In ""SULFA"", also no? \n\nBut we can try to include I? \n\nFor example, with A at 2 and U at 3, is there a word with I? Like ""QAIDS"" - Q and I? But Q is rare? \n\n""GUIDs"" but G U I D S? A not present? \n\nWe must have A and U.\n\n""QUAIS"" - Q U A I S? A at 3? Forbidden? \n\n""LAIUS"" - L A I U S? A at 2, U at 4? But U at 4 is forbidden? We know U is not at 4? So no.\n\nSo perhaps ""MAULS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check if ""MAULS"" is a valid word? It is the plural of maul, meaning to handle roughly? Or a type of weapon? But in Wordle, it might be accepted.\n\nSimilarly, ""PAULS"" is a proper name? Might not be accepted? \n\n""WAULS"" is valid? \n\nTo be safe, let\'s choose ""HAULM"" or ""MAULS"". I think ""MAULS"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""GAUZE"" has E? Forbidden.\n\nI think ""MAULS"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut we have another option: ""AULAS"" - A at 1? But A not at 1? So invalid.\n\nOr ""JUMPS"" - no A? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""MAULS"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nGuess: M A U L S\n\nIf the secret word has A at 2, then we get A correct? If not, then A must be at 5, and we\'ll get A marked as absent or wrong position? But since we know A is in the word, if it\'s not at 2, then it should be marked as \'-\' for wrong position? But in the guess, A is at 2, so if the secret has A at 5, then in this guess, A at 2 should be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) because it\'s present but not here.\n\nSimilarly for U at 3: if U is at 3, then correct? If not, then \'-\' or \'x\'? But we know U is present, so it would be \'-\' if not at 3.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on M, L, S.\n\nSo it\'s good.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that has A at 5? Like ""SULFA"", but ""SULFA"" might be less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""SNAFU"" - but S N A F U? N forbidden? No.\n\n""FJORD"" - no A? \n\nI think ""MAULS"" is fine.\n\nSo next guess: MAULS\n\nBut let\'s write it as <guess>mauls</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(✗), R(✗), A(-), N(✗), E(✗)  \n  - **A** is present but not in position 3.  \n  - **C, R, N, E** are absent from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""about""** → A(-), B(✗), O(✗), U(-), T(✗)  \n  - **A** is present but not in position 1 (since it was marked wrong position).  \n  - **U** is present but not in position 4.  \n  - **B, O, T** are absent.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed absent letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T (cannot appear in the word).  \n2. **Confirmed present letters**:  \n   - **A**: Must be in the word but not in positions 1 or 3. Only positions 2 or 5 are possible.  \n   - **U**: Must be in the word but not in position 4. Positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 are possible.  \n3. **Constraints**:  \n   - A and U cannot share the same position.  \n   - The word must include at least these two letters.  \n4. **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (since B, C, E, N, O, R, T are ruled out).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test positions for A and U**: Since A can only be in position 2 or 5, and U can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4), we need a word that:  \n  - Includes both A and U.  \n  - Places A in position 2 or 5 to test its location.  \n  - Places U in a new position (not 4) to test its location.  \n  - Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, M).  \n- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters** to prevent ambiguous feedback.  \n- **Prioritize high-frequency letters** like S, L, M to uncover more of the word.  \n\n### Selected Guess: ""MAULS""\n- **Word breakdown**: M (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5).  \n- **Why this word?**  \n  - Tests **A in position 2** (if correct, we lock it; if wrong, A must be in position 5).  \n  - Tests **U in position 3** (new position, not tested before).  \n  - Uses new common letters: **M, L, S** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).  \n  - Avoids absent letters and duplicates.  \n  - Valid English word (plural of ""maul,"" meaning to handle roughly).  \n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n- If A is in position 2, feedback will show ✓ for A.  \n- If U is in position 3, feedback will show ✓ for U.  \n- Feedback for M, L, S will reveal if they are present and in the correct positions.  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and U while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>mauls</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: mauls -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) U(✓) L(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ""about"" -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ""mauls"" -> Feedback: M(x) A(✓) U(✓) L(-) S(x)

Combining the feedback:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T, M, S (from S(x) in guess 3)
But note: L is marked as '-', meaning L is present but not in position 4. Also, A is confirmed in position 2 (✓), and U in position 3 (✓).

So the secret word has:
- A in position 2
- U in position 3
- L is present, but not in position 4

Also, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, T, M, S

Additionally, from guess 1, A was not in position 3 (already known, now confirmed position 2). From guess 2, A not in 1 (consistent) and U not in 4 (so U must be in 3, now confirmed).

Now, L is present but not in position 4. So L must be in position 1 or 5? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
- Position 2: A ✓
- Position 3: U ✓
- So position 1, 4, and 5 are open? But L is not in 4, as per the feedback? So L could be in position 1 or 5? Or possibly in positions that are not occupied? But only position 4 is forbidden for L? Actually, it could be in 1 or 5? Since position 2 and 3 are taken.

The word structure: 
  Pos1: ? 
  Pos2: A (known)
  Pos3: U (known)
  Pos4: ? (cannot be L? Because L(-) in position 4? And cannot be any absent letter)
  Pos5: ?

And we know L is in the word? So either position 1 or 5? Or if the word has duplicate L, it could be elsewhere? But we don't know? So we must consider? But for now, we know L is present? So at least one L? And not in position 4? So in position 1 or 5.

Also, note: from guess 3: S is absent? So no S? And M is absent? So no M.

Now, the secret word must contain L? And we have positions: 1,4,5 to fill? But position 4 cannot be L? So we have to fill position 1, 4, and 5? With letters that are not absent? And include L? Because L must be present? So one of position 1 or 5 must be L? Or if L is elsewhere? But we don't have other positions? Unless duplicate? But let's not assume duplicates? 

Actually, positions: 1,4,5 are unknown? And we must place L in one of these? Either 1 or 5? Because position 2 and 3 are taken? And position 4 cannot be L? So only choices: position 1 or 5? For L? 

So exactly: either L in position 1 or L in position 5? 

Thus? The secret word is either:
  Option A: L A U _ _
Or 
  Option B: _ A U _ L

But note? The blank must be filled? And we have one more blank? Actually? Three positions: 1,4,5? But if L is in position 1, then we have positions 4 and 5 to fill? Similarly? If L is in position 5, then we have positions 1 and 4 to fill? 

Also? We must include L? So the remaining letter? Or letters? 

But we have to form a word? That has letters not in the absent set? 

Absent letters: B,C,E,N,O,T,M,S

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But also? We need two or three more letters? Depending on the option? 

First? Let's consider Option A: word starting with L: L A U _ _

Then? The last two positions? We need two letters? And one of them? Must be? We already have L? So the other letter? Can be any? But they must form a word? Also? We don't have any other constraints? So possible words: 

? L A U X Y? For example? 

Common words: 
- ""LAUDE"" -> but E is absent? Forbidden? 
- ""LAUGH"" -> L A U G H? Yes? G and H? Both available? 
- ""LAUFS"" -> S is absent? Forbidden? 
- ""LAUQA""? Not a word? 

Others: ""LAUND"" -> N forbidden? 
""LAUSE"" -> E? 
""LAUVE"" -> E? 

So ""LAUGH"" is a word? L A U G H? With G and H? 

Similarly? ""LAUAN"" -> N forbidden? 
""LAUIA"" -> I? And not common? 

Option B: _ A U _ L? So the first letter and the fourth letter? 

For example? ""DAUL"" -> but what? Five letters? So X _ A U _ L? Actually? Position 1: ? and position 4: ?? 

So ""HAULD"" -> H A U L D? But L at 4? But we saw that L(-) in position 4? Meaning? In guess 3? We put L at position 4? And got '-'? Meaning L is present but not at 4? Therefore? We cannot put L at position 4? So in the secret word? Position 4 cannot be L? 

Therefore? For Option B? If we put L at position 5? Then positions 1 and 4 must be filled? And they cannot be L? And cannot be absent letters? 

Possible words: 
- ""HAULY"" -> H A U L Y? But L at 4? Which we know is not allowed? Because L is not at 4? So we cannot have L at position 4? Therefore? We must place L at position 5? And the word structure: _ A U ? L? Where ? is position 4? Which must not be L? 

So ""HAULY"" actually: H at 1, A at 2, U at 3, L at 4? But that has L at 4? Which is forbidden? So invalid? 

Instead? We need a word like: _ A U ? L? Where the fourth position is a letter not L? 

For example: 
- ""GAULP"" -> G A U L P? But L at position 4? Forbidden? 
- In ""GAULP""? The L is at position 4? Because: G-1, A-2, U-3, L-4, P-5? But L is at 4? Which we know is wrong position? So secret word cannot have L at 4? 

But we are putting L at position 5? In the word? As the fifth letter? 

For a word like: P A U D L? But that's not a word? 

Actual words: 
- ""CAULK"" -> C forbidden? 
- ""FAULT"" -> T forbidden? 
- ""MAULY"" -> M forbidden? 
- ""VAULT"" -> T forbidden? 

Not working? 

Perhaps ""GAUL"" is not five letters? 

Another word: ""PAULS"" -> P A U L S? But S forbidden? 

Or ""JAULD"" -> J A U L D? And L at 4? Again? 

We need position 4 to be not L? But the word must end with L? For Option B? 

For example: ""BAJUL"" - not common? 

But let's list? Known words ending with L? And for position 4? Not L? So the fourth letter must be different? 

For instance? ""HAVUL""? Not English? 

Perhaps Option B is less likely? Because we don't have common words? 

Recap? For Option A: word like ""LAUGH"" (L A U G H) is possible? 

Also? Another word: ""LAUFS""? S forbidden? 

""LAVES"" -> E? 

So ""LAUGH"" seems a good candidate? 

Now? What other possible words are there for Option A? 

Another: ""LAUIA""? Not? 

""LAUCH""? CH? Not a letter? 

We are only using single letters? 

Another: ""LAUAN""? N? 

So perhaps ""LAUGH"" is the most common? 

But note? We have to guess a word? And it could be Option A or Option B? 

But we have not ruled out Option B? 

For Option B? Words beginning with H? And ending with L? Like ""H A U ? L""? 

What fourth letter? 

""HAFEL""? Check: but not English? 
""HAIKL""? Not? 
""HAKUL""? Not? 
""HAWIL""? Not? 

Perhaps ""WAUIL""? Not? 

How about ""GAUDY""? But Y? And no L? But we need L in the word? So the word must contain L? 

For Option B: the word structure is: [letter1] A U [letter4] L? So position 5 is L? 

And letter1 and letter4 must be? From available letters? 

For example: 
- ""DAUHL""? Not? 
- ""FAUGL""? Not? 
- ""GAUIL""? Not? 
- ""HAULM""? But we know M is absent? Not in this guess? M is absent? So M cannot be used? 

""HAULM"" was considered earlier? But M is absent? So no? 

Therefore? Option B might not have many common words? 

So likely? The word is ""LAUGH""? 

But also? We must confirm? The feedback from guess 3: we have L present? But in position 4? Marked as wrong position? So L is present but not at 4? In the secret word? If it is ""LAUGH""? Then L is at position 1? And what about the remaining letters? ""LAUGH"" has L,A,U,G,H? 

L at 1? A at 2? U at 3? G at 4? H at 5? 

Now? Feedback from guess 3: ""mauls"" -> M? Absent? A correct? U correct? L at position 4? But in ""LAUGH""? The L is only at 1? So at position 4? In ""mauls""? We put L? At position 4? But in the secret word? Position 4 is G? So L is present (in position 1)? But not at position 4? So the feedback for L would be? '-'? Meaning wrong position? Which matches? Also? S was at position 5? But secret word has H at 5? So absent? Which matches? 

Therefore? ""LAUGH"" satisfies the feedback? 

But is it the only possibility? For example? Could have been ""LAUDE"" with E? But E is absent? No? 

Or ""LAUQS""? Not word? 

So ""LAUGH"" seems possible? 

But? We must make sure? Could there be duplicates? For instance? If the word had two L's? But in ""LAUGH""? There is one L? Which is fine? 

We might guess ""LAUGH""? But let's see if there are other words? 

For Option A? Like ""LAUHI""? Not? 

Perhaps ""JAUPS""? J A U P S? But S forbidden? 

So likely? ""LAUGH"" is a strong candidate? 

But? We are to guess? And we have not confirmed? So we can guess ""LAUGH"" to test? 

Alternatively? We can make a guess that confirms? But since we have limited tries? 

Another word? For Option B? Something like ""HAJUL""? Not common? 

So I think ""LAUGH"" is a good guess? 

But? Before? We note that in guess 3? We have L marked as present? But in position 4? Which would not be inconsistent? 

Similarly? Let's check with the second guess? ""about"": had A at 1? Which was marked? So A should be not at 1? And in ""LAUGH""? A at 2? Correct? So okay? 

Also? U at 4? In ""about""? Was marked as present but not at 4? But in ""LAUGH""? U at 3? So not at 4? And present? So okay? 

Therefore? Our next guess should be ""LAUGH""? 

So?

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - Absent: C, R, N, E  
  - Present, wrong position: A  
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: 
  - Absent: B, O, T  
  - Present, wrong position: A (not position 1), U (not position 4)  
- **Guess 3 (""mauls"")**: 
  - Absent: M, S  
  - Correct position: A (position 2), U (position 3)  
  - Present, wrong position: L (not position 4)  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: 
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed ✓)  
   - Position 3: **U** (confirmed ✓)  
   - **L** is present but **not in position 4** (must be in position 1 or 5).  
2. **Absent letters**: B, C, E, N, O, T, M, S (ruled out).  
3. **Available positions**: Positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown. Position 4 cannot be L (since L is marked absent in position 4).  
4. **Possible word patterns**:  
   - **Option A**: L at position 1 → `L A U _ _`  
   - **Option B**: L at position 5 → `_ A U _ L`  
5. **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, Y, Z (must form valid 5-letter word with A, U, L).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test ""Option A""** (`L A U _ _`), as it yields common words like **""LAUGH""** (G and H fit available letters).  
  - If correct, L at 1 gives us 3 known positions (1:L, 2:A, 3:U).  
  - If incorrect, we revert to Option B and prioritize L at position 5.  
- **""LAUGH"" is optimal**:  
  - Tests L in position 1.  
  - Uses high-frequency letters G and H (not yet tested).  
  - Consistent with feedback (e.g., L cannot be in position 4; secret has A at 2, U at 3).  
- **Validation**:  
  - ""LAUGH"": L(1), A(2), U(3), G(4), H(5).  
  - Avoids absent letters: G/H allowed.  
  - Confirms L position definitively.  

<guess>laugh</guess>",laugh,"We are on the fourth guess. We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ""about"" -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ""mauls"" -> Feedback: M(x) A(✓) U(✓) L(-) S(x)

Combining the feedback:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, T, M, S (from S(x) in guess 3)
But note: L is marked as '-', meaning L is present but not in position 4. Also, A is confirmed in position 2 (✓), and U in position 3 (✓).

So the secret word has:
- A in position 2
- U in position 3
- L is present, but not in position 4

Also, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, T, M, S

Additionally, from guess 1, A was not in position 3 (already known, now confirmed position 2). From guess 2, A not in 1 (consistent) and U not in 4 (so U must be in 3, now confirmed).

Now, L is present but not in position 4. So L must be in position 1 or 5? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
- Position 2: A ✓
- Position 3: U ✓
- So position 1, 4, and 5 are open? But L is not in 4, as per the feedback? So L could be in position 1 or 5? Or possibly in positions that are not occupied? But only position 4 is forbidden for L? Actually, it could be in 1 or 5? Since position 2 and 3 are taken.

The word structure: 
  Pos1: ? 
  Pos2: A (known)
  Pos3: U (known)
  Pos4: ? (cannot be L? Because L(-) in position 4? And cannot be any absent letter)
  Pos5: ?

And we know L is in the word? So either position 1 or 5? Or if the word has duplicate L, it could be elsewhere? But we don't know? So we must consider? But for now, we know L is present? So at least one L? And not in position 4? So in position 1 or 5.

Also, note: from guess 3: S is absent? So no S? And M is absent? So no M.

Now, the secret word must contain L? And we have positions: 1,4,5 to fill? But position 4 cannot be L? So we have to fill position 1, 4, and 5? With letters that are not absent? And include L? Because L must be present? So one of position 1 or 5 must be L? Or if L is elsewhere? But we don't have other positions? Unless duplicate? But let's not assume duplicates? 

Actually, positions: 1,4,5 are unknown? And we must place L in one of these? Either 1 or 5? Because position 2 and 3 are taken? And position 4 cannot be L? So only choices: position 1 or 5? For L? 

So exactly: either L in position 1 or L in position 5? 

Thus? The secret word is either:
  Option A: L A U _ _
Or 
  Option B: _ A U _ L

But note? The blank must be filled? And we have one more blank? Actually? Three positions: 1,4,5? But if L is in position 1, then we have positions 4 and 5 to fill? Similarly? If L is in position 5, then we have positions 1 and 4 to fill? 

Also? We must include L? So the remaining letter? Or letters? 

But we have to form a word? That has letters not in the absent set? 

Absent letters: B,C,E,N,O,T,M,S

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But also? We need two or three more letters? Depending on the option?

- ""LAUQA""? Not a word? 

Others: ""LAUND"" -> N forbidden? 
""LAUSE"" -> E? 
""LAUVE"" -> E? 

So ""LAUGH"" is a word? L A U G H? With G and H? 

Similarly? ""LAUAN"" -> N forbidden? 
""LAUIA"" -> I? And not common? 

Option B: _ A U _ L? So the first letter and the fourth letter? 

For example? ""DAUL"" -> but what? Five letters? So X _ A U _ L? Actually? Position 1: ? and position 4: ?? 

So ""HAULD"" -> H A U L D? But L at 4? But we saw that L(-) in position 4? Meaning? In guess 3? We put L at position 4? And got '-'? Meaning L is present but not at 4? Therefore? We cannot put L at position 4? So in the secret word? Position 4 cannot be L? 

Therefore? For Option B? If we put L at position 5? Then positions 1 and 4 must be filled? And they cannot be L? And cannot be absent letters? 

Possible words: 
- ""HAULY"" -> H A U L Y? But L at 4? Which we know is not allowed? Because L is not at 4? So we cannot have L at position 4? Therefore? We must place L at position 5? And the word structure: _ A U ? L? Where ? is position 4? Which must not be L? 

So ""HAULY"" actually: H at 1, A at 2, U at 3, L at 4? But that has L at 4? Which is forbidden? So invalid? 

Instead? We need a word like: _ A U ? L? Where the fourth position is a letter not L? 

For example: 
- ""GAULP"" -> G A U L P? But L at position 4? Forbidden? 
- In ""GAULP""? The L is at position 4? Because: G-1, A-2, U-3, L-4, P-5? But L is at 4? Which we know is wrong position? So secret word cannot have L at 4? 

But we are putting L at position 5? In the word? As the fifth letter? 

For a word like: P A U D L? But that's not a word? 

Actual words: 
- ""CAULK"" -> C forbidden? 
- ""FAULT"" -> T forbidden? 
- ""MAULY"" -> M forbidden? 
- ""VAULT"" -> T forbidden? 

Not working? 

Perhaps ""GAUL"" is not five letters? 

Another word: ""PAULS"" -> P A U L S? But S forbidden? 

Or ""JAULD"" -> J A U L D? And L at 4? Again? 

We need position 4 to be not L? But the word must end with L? For Option B? 

For example: ""BAJUL"" - not common? 

But let's list? Known words ending with L? And for position 4? Not L? So the fourth letter must be different? 

For instance? ""HAVUL""? Not English? 

Perhaps Option B is less likely? Because we don't have common words? 

Recap? For Option A: word like ""LAUGH"" (L A U G H) is possible? 

Also? Another word: ""LAUFS""? S forbidden? 

""LAVES"" -> E? 

So ""LAUGH"" seems a good candidate? 

Now? What other possible words are there for Option A? 

Another: ""LAUIA""? Not? 

""LAUCH""? CH? Not a letter? 

We are only using single letters? 

Another: ""LAUAN""? N? 

So perhaps ""LAUGH"" is the most common? 

But note? We have to guess a word? And it could be Option A or Option B? 

But we have not ruled out Option B? 

For Option B? Words beginning with H? And ending with L? Like ""H A U ? L""? 

What fourth letter? 

""HAFEL""? Check: but not English? 
""HAIKL""? Not? 
""HAKUL""? Not? 
""HAWIL""? Not? 

Perhaps ""WAUIL""? Not? 

How about ""GAUDY""? But Y? And no L? But we need L in the word? So the word must contain L? 

For Option B: the word structure is: [letter1] A U [letter4] L? So position 5 is L? 

And letter1 and letter4 must be? From available letters? 

For example: 
- ""DAUHL""? Not? 
- ""FAUGL""? Not? 
- ""GAUIL""? Not? 
- ""HAULM""? But we know M is absent? Not in this guess? M is absent? So M cannot be used? 

""HAULM"" was considered earlier? But M is absent? So no? 

Therefore? Option B might not have many common words? 

So likely? The word is ""LAUGH""? 

But also? We must confirm? The feedback from guess 3: we have L present? But in position 4? Marked as wrong position? So L is present but not at 4? In the secret word? If it is ""LAUGH""? Then L is at position 1? And what about the remaining letters? ""LAUGH"" has L,A,U,G,H? 

L at 1? A at 2? U at 3? G at 4? H at 5? 

Now? Feedback from guess 3: ""mauls"" -> M? Absent? A correct? U correct? L at position 4? But in ""LAUGH""? The L is only at 1? So at position 4? In ""mauls""? We put L? At position 4? But in the secret word? Position 4 is G? So L is present (in position 1)? But not at position 4? So the feedback for L would be? '-'? Meaning wrong position? Which matches? Also? S was at position 5? But secret word has H at 5? So absent? Which matches? 

Therefore? ""LAUGH"" satisfies the feedback? 

But is it the only possibility? For example? Could have been ""LAUDE"" with E? But E is absent? No? 

Or ""LAUQS""? Not word? 

So ""LAUGH"" seems possible? 

But? We must make sure? Could there be duplicates? For instance? If the word had two L's? But in ""LAUGH""? There is one L? Which is fine? 

We might guess ""LAUGH""? But let's see if there are other words? 

For Option A? Like ""LAUHI""? Not? 

Perhaps ""JAUPS""? J A U P S? But S forbidden? 

So likely? ""LAUGH"" is a strong candidate? 

But? We are to guess? And we have not confirmed? So we can guess ""LAUGH"" to test? 

Alternatively? We can make a guess that confirms? But since we have limited tries? 

Another word? For Option B? Something like ""HAJUL""? Not common? 

So I think ""LAUGH"" is a good guess? 

But? Before? We note that in guess 3? We have L marked as present? But in position 4? Which would not be inconsistent? 

Similarly? Let's check with the second guess? ""about"": had A at 1? Which was marked? So A should be not at 1? And in ""LAUGH""? A at 2? Correct? So okay? 

Also? U at 4? In ""about""? Was marked as present but not at 4? But in ""LAUGH""? U at 3? So not at 4? And present? So okay? 

Therefore? Our next guess should be ""LAUGH""? 

So? 

<guess>laugh</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - Absent: C, R, N, E  
  - Present, wrong position: A  
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: 
  - Absent: B, O, T  
  - Present, wrong position: A (not position 1), U (not position 4)  
- **Guess 3 (""mauls"")**: 
  - Absent: M, S  
  - Correct position: A (position 2), U (position 3)  
  - Present, wrong position: L (not position 4)  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: 
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed ✓)  
   - Position 3: **U** (confirmed ✓)  
   - **L** is present but **not in position 4** (must be in position 1 or 5).  
2. **Absent letters**: B, C, E, N, O, T, M, S (ruled out).  
3. **Available positions**: Positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown. Position 4 cannot be L (since L is marked absent in position 4).  
4. **Possible word patterns**:  
   - **Option A**: L at position 1 → `L A U _ _`  
   - **Option B**: L at position 5 → `_ A U _ L`  
5. **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, Y, Z (must form valid 5-letter word with A, U, L).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test ""Option A""** (`L A U _ _`), as it yields common words like **""LAUGH""** (G and H fit available letters).  
  - If correct, L at 1 gives us 3 known positions (1:L, 2:A, 3:U).  
  - If incorrect, we revert to Option B and prioritize L at position 5.  
- **""LAUGH"" is optimal**:  
  - Tests L in position 1.  
  - Uses high-frequency letters G and H (not yet tested).  
  - Consistent with feedback (e.g., L cannot be in position 4; secret has A at 2, U at 3).  
- **Validation**:  
  - ""LAUGH"": L(1), A(2), U(3), G(4), H(5).  
  - Avoids absent letters: G/H allowed.  
  - Confirms L position definitively.",Guess 4: laugh -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
