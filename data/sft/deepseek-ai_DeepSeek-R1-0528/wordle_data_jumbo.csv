We are making the first guess. Since the game is Wordle, we want to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word often includes letters like R, A, S, E, or T. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize information.

 One of the popular starting words is ""CRATE"". However, let's consider the letter distribution in English and choose a word that covers common letters.

 Another option is ""ROAST"", but let me think: we want a word that has five distinct letters and covers vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common choice. It includes S, L, A, T, E. But note that the feedback uses symbols: 
    ✓ for correct letter in correct position,
    - for letter in the word but wrong position,
    x for letter not in the word.

 Since we are just starting, any common starting word should be fine.

 I think I'll go with ""STARE"". This word includes:
   S - common consonant
   T - common consonant
   A - vowel
   R - common consonant
   E - vowel

 Also, note that Wordle words typically avoid plurals (ending with S) but ""STARE"" is a valid word and doesn't end with a common plural pattern arbitrarily.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". But I'll stick with ""STARE"" because it's also a standard first guess.

 However, let me check: ""SLATE"" and ""STARE"" are both good. But in ""STARE"", we have two vowels (A and E) and three consonants. 

 Since the secret word can be any 5-letter word, starting with a word having common letters is more likely to yield useful feedback.

 I will choose ""STARE"".
</think>
I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since this is the initial attempt with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word:
- Uses common letters to increase hit probability
- Includes vowels (especially A and E) and frequent consonants
- Avoids repeating letters to cover more potential characters

After considering common strategies and English letter frequency, a strong starting word is **STARE**. It contains:
- S, T: High-frequency consonants
- A, E: Essential vowels
- R: Another common consonant
All letters are distinct, covering five frequent characters. This choice helps gather varied feedback about letter positions and existence efficiently.

I'll start with ""STARE"".

We are making the second guess. The feedback from the first guess is that all letters in ""stare"" are incorrect: S, T, A, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: S, T, A, R, E.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

The letters avoided are: S, T, A, R, E. That means we should use consonants and vowels from the remaining set.

Common vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: we have a lot but let's think of frequent ones: N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Given that, we should pick a word that uses other common letters. Since we have 6 tries, we can try to maximize the coverage.

A good candidate might be: ""CLOUD""

But let's check the letters: C, L, O, U, D. All distinct and none of these are in the avoided list. Also, it has two vowels (O and U) and three consonants.

Another candidate: ""PINCH"" - P, I, N, C, H. But note H is less common.

Alternatively, ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D.

But we should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Another idea: ""OILED"" - O, I, L, E. Wait, E is already out! We cannot use E. So avoid any word containing E.

Similarly, S, T, A, R, E are all out. So we must avoid these.

Let me list some words without S, T, A, R, E:

- Using O, I, U as vowels and other consonants.

Possible words:
- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but E is out! So invalid.
- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. But Q is less common and the word has Q which might be risky.
- ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E is out.

Avoid E.

Another: ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D. H is a bit less common but possible.

Or ""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M - but might be too obscure.

We need a common word. ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T - but T is out! T is in the avoided list.

Avoided letters: S, T, A, R, E. So T is also out.

Therefore, ""might"" is invalid because of T.

Similarly, ""wound"": W, O, U, N, D. None of these are avoided. W is somewhat common.

But let's look for the most common letters remaining.

After removing S, T, A, R, E, the top letters by frequency in English might be O, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

So let's try: ""NOULD""? Not a word.

""Could"" has C, O, U, L, D - but L is in. Wait, ""could"" is 5 letters? No, ""could"" is 5: C-O-U-L-D.

But we already used S, T, A, R, E. None of C,O,U,L,D are in that set. So it is a valid word.

But ""could"" uses the letters C,O,U,L,D.

Similarly, ""would"" is W,O,U,L,D - and W is allowed.

But ""could"" is more common? Actually, both are common.

Another word: ""BUILD"" - B,U,I,L,D. Also valid.

We might want to include a vowel and some common consonants.

But note, we also have to consider that the secret word might not have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle words don't have repeated letters usually? Wait, they can have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle official answers are usually without repeated letters? But in the rules, it doesn't specify, but typically the answers are distinct letters.

In the example, BRISK has no repeated letters. So it's safer to assume no repeated letters.

Thus, we will pick a word with distinct letters.

Options:
- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
- ""WOULD"": W, O, U, L, D

But notice that ""D"" appears in all. We could try ""OUNCE"" - O,U,N,C,E - wait E is out? ""OUNCE"" has E? No: O-U-N-C-E? That ends with E. So invalid.

We can choose ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L - but H might not be common.

Another: ""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D - valid and avoids the forbidden letters.

I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate. It uses P, O, U, N, D. All distinct and common.

Similarly, ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", etc., but F is also common? Actually, we want to test new letters.

But let me think: ""CLOUD"" might be better because it has a C which is common.

In terms of frequency: N is very common, L is common, O is common, U common, D common.

""ONION"" has repeated O? Not distinct letters.

""MINIM"" has repeated M and I? Not good.

So, I think ""CLOUD"" or ""POUND"". I'll go with ""CLOUD"" because it includes C and L, which are very common consonants.

So the next guess: ""cloud""

Therefore, my second guess is ""cloud"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- ""stare"" had all letters marked as ""x"", meaning the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E.
- Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Avoiding the letters S, T, A, R, E
2. Using high-frequency English letters not yet tested (e.g., C, L, O, U, D)
3. Selecting a common 5-letter word with distinct letters to maximize information gain
4. Including vowels from the remaining set (O, U) since I, Y, and other consonants can serve as vowels if needed

A strong candidate is **""cloud""**:
- **C**: Common consonant not yet tested
- **L**: High-frequency consonant not yet tested
- **O**: Remaining common vowel
- **U**: Remaining common vowel
- **D**: Common consonant not yet tested
This word avoids all forbidden letters, covers new frequent characters, and should provide useful positional feedback.

Another: ""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D - valid and avoids the forbidden letters.

I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate. It uses P, O, U, N, D. All distinct and common.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since the game is Wordle, we want to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word often includes letters like R, A, S, E, or T. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize information.

 One of the popular starting words is ""CRATE"". However, let's consider the letter distribution in English and choose a word that covers common letters.

 Another option is ""ROAST"", but let me think: we want a word that has five distinct letters and covers vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common choice. It includes S, L, A, T, E. But note that the feedback uses symbols: 
    ✓ for correct letter in correct position,
    - for letter in the word but wrong position,
    x for letter not in the word.

 Since we are just starting, any common starting word should be fine.

 I think I'll go with ""STARE"". This word includes:

   T - common consonant
   A - vowel
   R - common consonant
   E - vowel

 Also, note that Wordle words typically avoid plurals (ending with S) but ""STARE"" is a valid word and doesn't end with a common plural pattern arbitrarily.

 However, let me check: ""SLATE"" and ""STARE"" are both good. But in ""STARE"", we have two vowels (A and E) and three consonants. 

 Since the secret word can be any 5-letter word, starting with a word having common letters is more likely to yield useful feedback.

All letters are distinct, covering five frequent characters. This choice helps gather varied feedback about letter positions and existence efficiently.

I'll start with ""STARE"".

<guess>stare</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the second guess. The feedback from the first guess is that all letters in ""stare"" are incorrect: S, T, A, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: S, T, A, R, E.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

The letters avoided are: S, T, A, R, E. That means we should use consonants and vowels from the remaining set.

Common vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: we have a lot but let's think of frequent ones: N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Given that, we should pick a word that uses other common letters. Since we have 6 tries, we can try to maximize the coverage.

A good candidate might be: ""CLOUD""

But let's check the letters: C, L, O, U, D. All distinct and none of these are in the avoided list. Also, it has two vowels (O and U) and three consonants.

Another candidate: ""PINCH"" - P, I, N, C, H. But note H is less common.

Alternatively, ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D.

But we should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Another idea: ""OILED"" - O, I, L, E. Wait, E is already out! We cannot use E. So avoid any word containing E.

Similarly, S, T, A, R, E are all out. So we must avoid these.

Let me list some words without S, T, A, R, E:

- Using O, I, U as vowels and other consonants.

Possible words:
- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but E is out! So invalid.
- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. But Q is less common and the word has Q which might be risky.
- ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E is out.

Avoid E.

Another: ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D. H is a bit less common but possible.

Or ""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M - but might be too obscure.

We need a common word. ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T - but T is out! T is in the avoided list.

Avoided letters: S, T, A, R, E. So T is also out.

Therefore, ""might"" is invalid because of T.

Similarly, ""wound"": W, O, U, N, D. None of these are avoided. W is somewhat common.

But let's look for the most common letters remaining.

After removing S, T, A, R, E, the top letters by frequency in English might be O, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

So let's try: ""NOULD""? Not a word.

""Could"" has C, O, U, L, D - but L is in. Wait, ""could"" is 5 letters? No, ""could"" is 5: C-O-U-L-D.

But we already used S, T, A, R, E. None of C,O,U,L,D are in that set. So it is a valid word.

But ""could"" uses the letters C,O,U,L,D.

Similarly, ""would"" is W,O,U,L,D - and W is allowed.

But ""could"" is more common? Actually, both are common.

Another word: ""BUILD"" - B,U,I,L,D. Also valid.

We might want to include a vowel and some common consonants.

But note, we also have to consider that the secret word might not have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle words don't have repeated letters usually? Wait, they can have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle official answers are usually without repeated letters? But in the rules, it doesn't specify, but typically the answers are distinct letters.

In the example, BRISK has no repeated letters. So it's safer to assume no repeated letters.

Thus, we will pick a word with distinct letters.

Options:
- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
- ""WOULD"": W, O, U, L, D

But notice that ""D"" appears in all. We could try ""OUNCE"" - O,U,N,C,E - wait E is out? ""OUNCE"" has E? No: O-U-N-C-E? That ends with E. So invalid.

We can choose ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L - but H might not be common.

Another: ""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D - valid and avoids the forbidden letters.

I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate. It uses P, O, U, N, D. All distinct and common.

Similarly, ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", etc., but F is also common? Actually, we want to test new letters.

But let me think: ""CLOUD"" might be better because it has a C which is common.

In terms of frequency: N is very common, L is common, O is common, U common, D common.

""ONION"" has repeated O? Not distinct letters.

""MINIM"" has repeated M and I? Not good.

So, I think ""CLOUD"" or ""POUND"". I'll go with ""CLOUD"" because it includes C and L, which are very common consonants.

So the next guess: ""cloud""

Therefore, my second guess is ""cloud"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- ""stare"" had all letters marked as ""x"", meaning the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E.
- Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Avoiding the letters S, T, A, R, E
2. Using high-frequency English letters not yet tested (e.g., C, L, O, U, D)
3. Selecting a common 5-letter word with distinct letters to maximize information gain
4. Including vowels from the remaining set (O, U) since I, Y, and other consonants can serve as vowels if needed

A strong candidate is **""cloud""**:
- **C**: Common consonant not yet tested
- **L**: High-frequency consonant not yet tested
- **O**: Remaining common vowel
- **U**: Remaining common vowel
- **D**: Common consonant not yet tested
This word avoids all forbidden letters, covers new frequent characters, and should provide useful positional feedback.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""stare"" -> all letters incorrect: S, T, A, R, E are not in the secret word at all.
2. ""cloud"" -> C(x) L(x) D(x) are not in the word, but O(-) and U(-) mean that O and U are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed.

From ""cloud"":
- O is in the word but not in the second position (since feedback for O was ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- U is in the word but not in the fourth position.

Also, since we know C, L, D are not in the word, that means the secret word contains O and U, and possibly other letters we haven't guessed yet.

We have eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D (8 letters). So we must avoid these.

The secret word has O and U, and we know they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively (from ""cloud"").

Now, for our third guess, we need to:
- Include O and U (since they are in the word).
- Avoid S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.
- Place O and U in positions that are not 2 and 4, respectively.
- We have 6 tries, so we can test other common letters.

Available letters: All except S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also, note that O and U are already in the word.

We need to form a 5-letter word containing O and U, with three more letters from the available set.

We should also try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Possible words: We need words that have O and U, and 3 other letters not eliminated.

We know O is not in position 2, U is not in position 4.

For example:
- If we put O in position 1, then U could be elsewhere, but not position 4.
- Similarly, U can be in positions 1,2,3,5, but not 4.

Let's think of common words with O and U.

Examples:
- ""ouija"" - but that has J and A? A is eliminated. Also, ""ouija"" is not common and has different letter count? ""ouija"" is 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A. But A is eliminated, so invalid.
- ""bough"" : B-O-U-G-H. Letters: B, O, U, G, H. None of these are eliminated? Check: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D are eliminated, so B, G, H are new. So possible.
- ""cough"" : C is eliminated, so no.
- ""dough"": D is eliminated. No.
- ""fough"": not a word? Perhaps ""fought"" is 6 letters.
- ""gourd"": G-O-U-R-D. But R and D are eliminated. So invalid.
- ""mouth"": M-O-U-T-H. But T is eliminated. No.
- ""pound"": P-O-U-N-D. But D is eliminated. No.
- ""wound"": W-O-U-N-D. D eliminated. No.
- ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Letters: Y, O, U, N, G. None eliminated? Y isn't eliminated? So yes, Y is still available. So ""young"" is a possibility.
- ""boule"": E eliminated. No.
- ""buoy"": 4 letters.
- ""fount"": T eliminated? F-O-U-N-T has T eliminated. No.
- ""found"": D eliminated. No.
- ""hound"": D eliminated. No.
- ""mound"": D eliminated. No.
- ""joust"": J-O-U-S-T. S and T eliminated. No.
- ""house"": S and E eliminated. No.
- ""mousy"": S eliminated. No.

Another: ""group"": G-R-O-U-P. R is eliminated. No.

""bunch"": B-U-N-C-H. C eliminated. No.

""bunch"" has C, eliminated.

""louse"": S and E? L-O-U-S-E has S and E eliminated. No.

""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated. No.

So words like ""bough"" and ""young"" are candidates.

Let me list:
- ""bough"": B-O-U-G-H. Positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), H(5)
But from feedback, we know that O is not in position 2? Because in ""cloud"", O was in position 2 and it was marked wrong position (""-""), meaning that in that word, position 2 is not where O belongs. But it doesn't mean O cannot be in position 2 in another guess? Actually, the feedback is about the secret word: O is in the word, but not in position 2 of the secret word.

Similarly, U is not in position 4 of the secret word.

So in our new guess, if we place O in position 2, it would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, position 4 for U is wrong.

Therefore, in ""bough"", if we put O in position 2, that would be incorrect (since O is not in position 2 in secret) and U in position 3.

But actually, we can place O and U anywhere except positions 2 and 4 respectively? Not exactly: the feedback only told us about positions 2 and 4 in that particular guess. But the secret word has O in some position, not 2, and U in some position, not 4.

For our next guess, we need to place O and U in positions different from 2 and 4, but also consider that they could be in other positions.

In ""bough"":
- Position 2 is O: but we know that O is not in position 2 of the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we would expect it to be incorrect. So we should avoid putting O in position 2.
Similarly, U should not be in position 4.

In ""bough"", O is in position 2, which we know is not the position for O in the secret word. So if we guess ""bough"", the O in position 2 would get a ""-"" again? Actually, if O is correctly in the word but not in position 2, it would still get a ""-"". But we already know O is in the word, so that doesn't give us new info about position. However, it would be a wasted opportunity to test a new position.

Moreover, position 4 is G, not U. So U is in position 3, which is acceptable.

But since O in position 2 is wrong, we want to move it to a different position to find the right one.

So for our guess, we should try to place O in a different position and U in a different position.

Similarly for U: don't put it in position 4.

So let's consider other positions for O: 1,3,4,5 and U:1,2,3,5.

Also, we need to form a word.

Possible words:

- If O is in first position: e.g., O_ _ _ _
Then we need to place U somewhere. Word: OUNCE? But E is eliminated. 
OUBIT? Not common. 
OUPHE? Not a word.

Better: ""ought"": O-U-G-H-T. But T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated, so no.

Ouzel: O-U-Z-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.

Not easy.

- O in third position: _ _ O _ _
U can be in positions: 1,2,4,5.

Word example: ""prove""? P-R-O-V-E. R and E eliminated. No.
""grown"": G-R-O-W-N. R eliminated. No.

""blown"": B-L-O-W-N. L eliminated? L is eliminated from ""cloud"" feedback? In guess2, L was marked ""x"", so L is not in the word, so we cannot use L. Similarly, L is eliminated.

Since L is eliminated, we avoid L.

Similarly, ""known"": K-N-O-W-N. K,N,O,W,N? N repeated? ""known"" has two N's? Let's check: K-N-O-W-N? That's only 4 distinct letters: K,N,O,W? But it has two N's? Actually, ""known"" is K-N-O-W-N, so positions: K(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). But duplicate N? Wordle allows duplicate letters? In the rules, it doesn't say no duplicates, but typically secrets don't have duplicates. So to be safe, we should avoid words with duplicate letters.

But in this case, ""known"" has duplicate N? Yes, N is in position 2 and 5. So better to avoid duplicates?

Similarly, feedback symbols: in example, BRISK has distinct letters.

So I assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore each letter appears once.

So our guesses should also have distinct letters to maximize info.

So ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Distinct letters: Y, O, U, N, G? Yes. And positions: Y(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), G(5)

But O is in position 2: and we know from ""cloud"" that O is not in position 2. So if we put O in position 2 again, we would get a ""-"" for O meaning it's not in position 2, but we already know that. So it doesn't help.

Moreover, U is in position 3, which is fine.

But since O in position 2 is wrong, we should choose a word where O is in a different position.

Similarly, for U, we have only known not to put it in position 4.

So let's avoid putting O in position 2.

Another word: ""bunko""? But K and O, but meaning? B-U-N-K-O. Letters B,U,N,K,O. Positions: B(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), O(5)

Here, O is in position 5, which is new. U is in position 2, which has not been tested for U.

Also, we haven't tested B, N, K.

From feedback, U is not in position 4, but here U is in position 2, which is fine.

Similarly, O is in position 5, not position 2.

So ""bunko"" is a valid English word meaning a type of swindle? It might be obscure.

Common words: ""you'd""? Not 5 letters. ""youth""? T is eliminated, and has H? Y-O-U-T-H: T and H? T eliminated, so no.

""mourn"": M-O-U-R-N. But R is eliminated. No.

""proud"": P-R-O-U-D. R and D eliminated. No.

""ghoul"": G-H-O-U-L. But L is eliminated. No.

""vowel"": V-O-W-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.

Input: we have O and U to include, and avoid S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D.

""budgy""? Not a word.

""fungo"": F-U-N-G-O. This is a sports term? Maybe too obscure.

""quoin"": Q-U-O-I-N. But Q and I? I hasn't been tested. Letters: Q,U,O,I,N. Avoided? S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D are avoided; Q,I,N are new. So possible.

""quoit"": But T eliminated.

""quota"": T and A? A eliminated.

Not good.

Another idea: ""bogus"": B-O-G-U-S. But S eliminated? Yes, S is out.

""focus"": C and S eliminated.

""mucus"": S eliminated.

""juicy"": J-U-I-C-Y. But C eliminated? C is eliminated, so no.

Back to ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G. But O in position 2 is undesirable because it must be wrong.

We need to change O's position.

Let's try O in position 1: but words like ""ouchy""? O-U-C-H-Y. C eliminated? O-U-C-H-Y has C, which is eliminated.

""odium"": O-D-I-U-M. D eliminated? D is out, yes.

Position O in 4: but then U in 1,3, etc.

I think ""bunko"" is acceptable. Or ""gunky""? G-U-N-K-Y. O not included.

We must include both O and U.

Options:
- ""conus"": C eliminated and S eliminated.
- ""forum"": F-O-R-U-M. R eliminated.

- ""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated.
- ""wough"": not a word.

Perhaps ""bougie"": 6 letters.

Maybe I missed ""goumi""? Not common.

Another one: ""bovid"": B-O-V-I-D. D eliminated? D is eliminated.

So difficult.

""pinup"": P-I-N-U-P. Duplicate P, and no O.

We need O and U.

Only ""bunko"" and ""young"" come to mind, but ""young"" puts O in position 2 which is known wrong.

What about ""known"" with duplicate N? Not ideal.

""bowig"": not a word.

Or ""buoya"": not a word.

Perhaps ""boulle"": B-O-U-L-L-E. L and E eliminated, and duplicate L.

No.

Another common word: ""mount"": M-O-U-N-T. T eliminated.

""count"": C and T eliminated.

""doubt"": D and T eliminated.

""gouty"": G-O-U-T-Y. T eliminated.

So it seems our best bets are ""bunko"" or ""young"", even though with ""young"" O is in position 2.

But maybe we can choose to use ""bogus"" if S wasn't eliminated, but it is.

Wait, let's think: ""quoit"" is Q,U,O,I,T but T eliminated.

""quick"": Q-U-I-C-K. C eliminated.

I think ""bunko"" is the word to  use, even if uncommon. Or another word like ""compo"" but that has C.

At this point, perhaps ""unbox"": U-N-B-O-X. Letters U,N,B,O,X? Positions: U(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5)

Here, U is in position 1, O in position 4.

U in position 1 is good because we don't know about position 1 for U. We only know U is not in position 4? From ""cloud"", U was in position 4 marked ""-"" so not in 4, but we can place U in 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, O can be in 1,3,4,5 (not 2).

In ""unbox"":
- U is in position 1, which is new.
- O is in position 4. Have we tested O in position 4? Not yet.

Also, no duplicate letters.

Letters used: U, N, B, O, X. None of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D. U and O are in, N, B, X are new.

B is common, N is common, X is less common. But acceptable.

Also, ""unbox"" is a valid English word meaning to remove from a box.

So this might work.

Another word: ""boxun""? Not a word.

Or ""bonux""? Not a word.

So ""unbox"" seems good.

But X is a bit uncommon, so it might not be efficient.

What about ""vying"": V-Y-I-N-G. But no O and U? Only Y and I as vowels? But we must include O and U because they are in the word.

The secret word contains O and U, so our guess must contain O and U to get positional feedback.

So we cannot omit them.

Therefore, ""unbox"" is a valid choice.

Another word: ""bouzy"": B-O-U-Z-Y. Or ""bogey"" has E?

""bouge"" not 5 letters.

I think ""unbox"" is my best shot.

We could go with ""bunko"" but ""unbox"" uses more common letters except X.

But let's see the frequency: N and B are very common, X is rare.

An alternative: ""jambu""? Not common.

So I'll go with ""unbox"".

Therefore, guess: ""unbox""

But let's confirm feedback expectations:

If we guess ""unbox"" and secret word has O and U: 
- U in position 1: could be correct or not.
- O in position 4: could be correct or not.

We also test N, B, X.

Position 2 and 3 are N and B.

So we can get information.

Another word: ""bumpy""? B-U-M-P-Y. But no O.

We need O.

I don't see a better word.

So let's go with ""unbox"".

<guess>unbox</guess> 

In the response format.

But first, thought process.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: stare** → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x) reveals that the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E. These letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x) provides crucial insights:
  - C, L, and D are not in the secret word.
  - O is present but not in position 2 (since it received ""-"").
  - U is present but not in position 4 (since it received ""-"").

Combined, the eliminated letters are: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D. The secret word must contain O and U, and they cannot be in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- **Include O and U**: Both must be in the guess since they are confirmed in the secret word, but placed in new positions to test for correctness:
  - O can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 2 is invalid; position 4 is untested but possible).
  - U can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 is invalid).
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Do not use S, T, A, R, E, C, L, or D.
- **Maximize information gain**: Prioritize using high-frequency remaining letters like B, N, G, M, P, K, or Y to cover new ground. Choose a word with distinct letters for clarity.
- **Word selection**: Search for valid 5-letter English words containing O and U, avoiding bad positions and eliminated letters. After evaluating options:
  - ""young"": Puts O in position 2 (known to be wrong), wasting positional data; avoid.
  - ""bough"": Puts O in position 2 (invalid), and U in position 3; suboptimal.
  - ""unbox"": Emerges as the best candidate—uses U in position 1 (new position), O in position 4 (untested position), and introduces new common letters (N, B, X). It avoids all eliminated characters and fits the constraints.

**Final choice**: ""unbox"" tests U in position 1, O in position 4, and adds N, B, X to gain more feedback on letter presence and positions.

<guess>unbox</guess>",unbox,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""stare"" -> all letters incorrect: S, T, A, R, E are not in the secret word at all.
2. ""cloud"" -> C(x) L(x) D(x) are not in the word, but O(-) and U(-) mean that O and U are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed.

From ""cloud"":
- O is in the word but not in the second position (since feedback for O was ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- U is in the word but not in the fourth position.

Also, since we know C, L, D are not in the word, that means the secret word contains O and U, and possibly other letters we haven't guessed yet.

We have eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D (8 letters). So we must avoid these.

The secret word has O and U, and we know they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively (from ""cloud"").

Now, for our third guess, we need to:
- Include O and U (since they are in the word).
- Avoid S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.
- Place O and U in positions that are not 2 and 4, respectively.
- We have 6 tries, so we can test other common letters.

Available letters: All except S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also, note that O and U are already in the word.

We need to form a 5-letter word containing O and U, with three more letters from the available set.

We should also try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Possible words: We need words that have O and U, and 3 other letters not eliminated.

We know O is not in position 2, U is not in position 4.

For example:
- If we put O in position 1, then U could be elsewhere, but not position 4.
- Similarly, U can be in positions 1,2,3,5, but not 4.

Let's think of common words with O and U.

Examples:
- ""ouija"" - but that has J and A? A is eliminated. Also, ""ouija"" is not common and has different letter count? ""ouija"" is 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A. But A is eliminated, so invalid.
- ""bough"" : B-O-U-G-H. Letters: B, O, U, G, H. None of these are eliminated? Check: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D are eliminated, so B, G, H are new. So possible.
- ""cough"" : C is eliminated, so no.
- ""dough"": D is eliminated. No.
- ""fough"": not a word? Perhaps ""fought"" is 6 letters.
- ""gourd"": G-O-U-R-D. But R and D are eliminated. So invalid.
- ""mouth"": M-O-U-T-H. But T is eliminated. No.
- ""pound"": P-O-U-N-D. But D is eliminated. No.
- ""wound"": W-O-U-N-D. D eliminated. No.
- ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Letters: Y, O, U, N, G. None eliminated? Y isn't eliminated? So yes, Y is still available. So ""young"" is a possibility.
- ""boule"": E eliminated. No.
- ""buoy"": 4 letters.
- ""fount"": T eliminated? F-O-U-N-T has T eliminated. No.
- ""found"": D eliminated. No.
- ""hound"": D eliminated. No.
- ""mound"": D eliminated. No.
- ""joust"": J-O-U-S-T. S and T eliminated. No.
- ""house"": S and E eliminated. No.
- ""mousy"": S eliminated. No.

Another: ""group"": G-R-O-U-P. R is eliminated. No.

""bunch"": B-U-N-C-H. C eliminated. No.

""bunch"" has C, eliminated.

""louse"": S and E? L-O-U-S-E has S and E eliminated. No.

""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated. No.

So words like ""bough"" and ""young"" are candidates.

Let me list:
- ""bough"": B-O-U-G-H. Positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), H(5)
But from feedback, we know that O is not in position 2? Because in ""cloud"", O was in position 2 and it was marked wrong position (""-""), meaning that in that word, position 2 is not where O belongs. But it doesn't mean O cannot be in position 2 in another guess? Actually, the feedback is about the secret word: O is in the word, but not in position 2 of the secret word.

Similarly, U is not in position 4 of the secret word.

So in our new guess, if we place O in position 2, it would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, position 4 for U is wrong.

Therefore, in ""bough"", if we put O in position 2, that would be incorrect (since O is not in position 2 in secret) and U in position 3.

But actually, we can place O and U anywhere except positions 2 and 4 respectively? Not exactly: the feedback only told us about positions 2 and 4 in that particular guess. But the secret word has O in some position, not 2, and U in some position, not 4.

For our next guess, we need to place O and U in positions different from 2 and 4, but also consider that they could be in other positions.

In ""bough"":
- Position 2 is O: but we know that O is not in position 2 of the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we would expect it to be incorrect. So we should avoid putting O in position 2.
Similarly, U should not be in position 4.

In ""bough"", O is in position 2, which we know is not the position for O in the secret word. So if we guess ""bough"", the O in position 2 would get a ""-"" again? Actually, if O is correctly in the word but not in position 2, it would still get a ""-"". But we already know O is in the word, so that doesn't give us new info about position. However, it would be a wasted opportunity to test a new position.

Moreover, position 4 is G, not U. So U is in position 3, which is acceptable.

But since O in position 2 is wrong, we want to move it to a different position to find the right one.

So for our guess, we should try to place O in a different position and U in a different position.

Similarly for U: don't put it in position 4.

So let's consider other positions for O: 1,3,4,5 and U:1,2,3,5.

Also, we need to form a word.

Possible words:

- If O is in first position: e.g., O_ _ _ _
Then we need to place U somewhere. Word: OUNCE? But E is eliminated. 
OUBIT? Not common. 
OUPHE? Not a word.

Better: ""ought"": O-U-G-H-T. But T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated, so no.

Ouzel: O-U-Z-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.

Not easy.

- O in third position: _ _ O _ _
U can be in positions: 1,2,4,5.

Word example: ""prove""? P-R-O-V-E. R and E eliminated. No.
""grown"": G-R-O-W-N. R eliminated. No.

""blown"": B-L-O-W-N. L eliminated? L is eliminated from ""cloud"" feedback? In guess2, L was marked ""x"", so L is not in the word, so we cannot use L. Similarly, L is eliminated.

Since L is eliminated, we avoid L.

Similarly, ""known"": K-N-O-W-N. K,N,O,W,N? N repeated? ""known"" has two N's? Let's check: K-N-O-W-N? That's only 4 distinct letters: K,N,O,W? But it has two N's? Actually, ""known"" is K-N-O-W-N, so positions: K(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). But duplicate N? Wordle allows duplicate letters? In the rules, it doesn't say no duplicates, but typically secrets don't have duplicates. So to be safe, we should avoid words with duplicate letters.

But in this case, ""known"" has duplicate N? Yes, N is in position 2 and 5. So better to avoid duplicates?

Similarly, feedback symbols: in example, BRISK has distinct letters.

So I assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore each letter appears once.

So our guesses should also have distinct letters to maximize info.

So ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Distinct letters: Y, O, U, N, G? Yes. And positions: Y(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), G(5)

But O is in position 2: and we know from ""cloud"" that O is not in position 2. So if we put O in position 2 again, we would get a ""-"" for O meaning it's not in position 2, but we already know that. So it doesn't help.

Moreover, U is in position 3, which is fine.

But since O in position 2 is wrong, we should choose a word where O is in a different position.

Similarly, for U, we have only known not to put it in position 4.

So let's avoid putting O in position 2.

Another word: ""bunko""? But K and O, but meaning? B-U-N-K-O. Letters B,U,N,K,O. Positions: B(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), O(5)

Here, O is in position 5, which is new. U is in position 2, which has not been tested for U.

Also, we haven't tested B, N, K.

From feedback, U is not in position 4, but here U is in position 2, which is fine.

Similarly, O is in position 5, not position 2.

So ""bunko"" is a valid English word meaning a type of swindle? It might be obscure.

Common words: ""you'd""? Not 5 letters. ""youth""? T is eliminated, and has H? Y-O-U-T-H: T and H? T eliminated, so no.

""mourn"": M-O-U-R-N. But R is eliminated. No.

""proud"": P-R-O-U-D. R and D eliminated. No.

""ghoul"": G-H-O-U-L. But L is eliminated. No.

""vowel"": V-O-W-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.

Input: we have O and U to include, and avoid S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D.

""budgy""? Not a word.

""fungo"": F-U-N-G-O. This is a sports term? Maybe too obscure.

""quoin"": Q-U-O-I-N. But Q and I? I hasn't been tested. Letters: Q,U,O,I,N. Avoided? S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D are avoided; Q,I,N are new. So possible.

""quoit"": But T eliminated.

""quota"": T and A? A eliminated.

Not good.

Another idea: ""bogus"": B-O-G-U-S. But S eliminated? Yes, S is out.

""focus"": C and S eliminated.

""mucus"": S eliminated.

""juicy"": J-U-I-C-Y. But C eliminated? C is eliminated, so no.

Back to ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G. But O in position 2 is undesirable because it must be wrong.

We need to change O's position.

Let's try O in position 1: but words like ""ouchy""? O-U-C-H-Y. C eliminated? O-U-C-H-Y has C, which is eliminated.

""odium"": O-D-I-U-M. D eliminated? D is out, yes.

Position O in 4: but then U in 1,3, etc.

I think ""bunko"" is acceptable. Or ""gunky""? G-U-N-K-Y. O not included.

We must include both O and U.

Options:
- ""conus"": C eliminated and S eliminated.
- ""forum"": F-O-R-U-M. R eliminated.
- ""humor"": H-U-M-O-R. R eliminated.
- ""junco"": J-U-N-C-O. C eliminated.
- ""kudos"": K-U-D-O-S. D and S eliminated.
- ""mufti"": M-U-F-T-I. T eliminated.
- ""music"": M-U-S-I-C. S and C eliminated.
- ""ninth"": N-I-N-T-H. T and duplicate N? ""ninth"" has two N's? Positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5). Duplicate N, and T eliminated. Not good.
- ""oulti"": not a word.
- ""pious"": P-I-O-U-S. S eliminated.
- ""sound"": S and D eliminated.
- ""torus"": T eliminated and S.
- ""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated.
- ""wough"": not a word.

Perhaps ""bougie"": 6 letters.

Maybe I missed ""goumi""? Not common.

Another one: ""bovid"": B-O-V-I-D. D eliminated? D is eliminated.

So difficult.

""pinup"": P-I-N-U-P. Duplicate P, and no O.

We need O and U.

Only ""bunko"" and ""young"" come to mind, but ""young"" puts O in position 2 which is known wrong.

What about ""known"" with duplicate N? Not ideal.

""bowig"": not a word.

Or ""buoya"": not a word.

Perhaps ""boulle"": B-O-U-L-L-E. L and E eliminated, and duplicate L.

No.

Another common word: ""mount"": M-O-U-N-T. T eliminated.

""count"": C and T eliminated.

""doubt"": D and T eliminated.

""gouty"": G-O-U-T-Y. T eliminated.

So it seems our best bets are ""bunko"" or ""young"", even though with ""young"" O is in position 2.

But maybe we can choose to use ""bogus"" if S wasn't eliminated, but it is.

Wait, let's think: ""quoit"" is Q,U,O,I,T but T eliminated.

""quick"": Q-U-I-C-K. C eliminated.

I think ""bunko"" is the word to  use, even if uncommon. Or another word like ""compo"" but that has C.

At this point, perhaps ""unbox"": U-N-B-O-X. Letters U,N,B,O,X? Positions: U(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5)

Here, U is in position 1, O in position 4.

U in position 1 is good because we don't know about position 1 for U. We only know U is not in position 4? From ""cloud"", U was in position 4 marked ""-"" so not in 4, but we can place U in 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, O can be in 1,3,4,5 (not 2).

In ""unbox"":
- U is in position 1, which is new.
- O is in position 4. Have we tested O in position 4? Not yet.

Also, no duplicate letters.

Letters used: U, N, B, O, X. None of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D. U and O are in, N, B, X are new.

B is common, N is common, X is less common. But acceptable.

Also, ""unbox"" is a valid English word meaning to remove from a box.

So this might work.

Another word: ""boxun""? Not a word.

Or ""bonux""? Not a word.

So ""unbox"" seems good.

But X is a bit uncommon, so it might not be efficient.

What about ""vying"": V-Y-I-N-G. But no O and U? Only Y and I as vowels? But we must include O and U because they are in the word.

The secret word contains O and U, so our guess must contain O and U to get positional feedback.

So we cannot omit them.

Therefore, ""unbox"" is a valid choice.

Another word: ""bouzy"": B-O-U-Z-Y. Or ""bogey"" has E?

""bouge"" not 5 letters.

I think ""unbox"" is my best shot.

We could go with ""bunko"" but ""unbox"" uses more common letters except X.

But let's see the frequency: N and B are very common, X is rare.

An alternative: ""jambu""? Not common.

So I'll go with ""unbox"".

Therefore, guess: ""unbox""

But let's confirm feedback expectations:

If we guess ""unbox"" and secret word has O and U: 
- U in position 1: could be correct or not.
- O in position 4: could be correct or not.

We also test N, B, X.

Position 2 and 3 are N and B.

So we can get information.

Another word: ""bumpy""? B-U-M-P-Y. But no O.

We need O.

I don't see a better word.

So let's go with ""unbox"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since the game is Wordle, we want to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word often includes letters like R, A, S, E, or T. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize information.

 One of the popular starting words is ""CRATE"". However, let's consider the letter distribution in English and choose a word that covers common letters.

 Another option is ""ROAST"", but let me think: we want a word that has five distinct letters and covers vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common choice. It includes S, L, A, T, E. But note that the feedback uses symbols: 
    ✓ for correct letter in correct position,
    - for letter in the word but wrong position,
    x for letter not in the word.

 Since we are just starting, any common starting word should be fine.

 I think I'll go with ""STARE"". This word includes:
   S - common consonant
   T - common consonant
   A - vowel
   R - common consonant
   E - vowel

 Also, note that Wordle words typically avoid plurals (ending with S) but ""STARE"" is a valid word and doesn't end with a common plural pattern arbitrarily.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". But I'll stick with ""STARE"" because it's also a standard first guess.

 However, let me check: ""SLATE"" and ""STARE"" are both good. But in ""STARE"", we have two vowels (A and E) and three consonants. 

 Since the secret word can be any 5-letter word, starting with a word having common letters is more likely to yield useful feedback.

 I will choose ""STARE"".I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since this is the initial attempt with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word:
- Uses common letters to increase hit probability
- Includes vowels (especially A and E) and frequent consonants
- Avoids repeating letters to cover more potential characters

After considering common strategies and English letter frequency, a strong starting word is **STARE**. It contains:
- S, T: High-frequency consonants
- A, E: Essential vowels
- R: Another common consonant
All letters are distinct, covering five frequent characters. This choice helps gather varied feedback about letter positions and existence efficiently.

I'll start with ""STARE"".

<guess>stare</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the second guess. The feedback from the first guess is that all letters in ""stare"" are incorrect: S, T, A, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: S, T, A, R, E.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

The letters avoided are: S, T, A, R, E. That means we should use consonants and vowels from the remaining set.

Common vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: we have a lot but let's think of frequent ones: N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Given that, we should pick a word that uses other common letters. Since we have 6 tries, we can try to maximize the coverage.

A good candidate might be: ""CLOUD""

But let's check the letters: C, L, O, U, D. All distinct and none of these are in the avoided list. Also, it has two vowels (O and U) and three consonants.

Another candidate: ""PINCH"" - P, I, N, C, H. But note H is less common.

Alternatively, ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D.

But we should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Another idea: ""OILED"" - O, I, L, E. Wait, E is already out! We cannot use E. So avoid any word containing E.

Similarly, S, T, A, R, E are all out. So we must avoid these.

Let me list some words without S, T, A, R, E:

- Using O, I, U as vowels and other consonants.

Possible words:
- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but E is out! So invalid.
- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. But Q is less common and the word has Q which might be risky.
- ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E is out.

Avoid E.

Another: ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D. H is a bit less common but possible.

Or ""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M - but might be too obscure.

We need a common word. ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T - but T is out! T is in the avoided list.

Avoided letters: S, T, A, R, E. So T is also out.

Therefore, ""might"" is invalid because of T.

Similarly, ""wound"": W, O, U, N, D. None of these are avoided. W is somewhat common.

But let's look for the most common letters remaining.

After removing S, T, A, R, E, the top letters by frequency in English might be O, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

So let's try: ""NOULD""? Not a word.

""Could"" has C, O, U, L, D - but L is in. Wait, ""could"" is 5 letters? No, ""could"" is 5: C-O-U-L-D.

But we already used S, T, A, R, E. None of C,O,U,L,D are in that set. So it is a valid word.

But ""could"" uses the letters C,O,U,L,D.

Similarly, ""would"" is W,O,U,L,D - and W is allowed.

But ""could"" is more common? Actually, both are common.

Another word: ""BUILD"" - B,U,I,L,D. Also valid.

We might want to include a vowel and some common consonants.

But note, we also have to consider that the secret word might not have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle words don't have repeated letters usually? Wait, they can have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle official answers are usually without repeated letters? But in the rules, it doesn't specify, but typically the answers are distinct letters.

In the example, BRISK has no repeated letters. So it's safer to assume no repeated letters.

Thus, we will pick a word with distinct letters.

Options:
- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
- ""WOULD"": W, O, U, L, D

But notice that ""D"" appears in all. We could try ""OUNCE"" - O,U,N,C,E - wait E is out? ""OUNCE"" has E? No: O-U-N-C-E? That ends with E. So invalid.

We can choose ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L - but H might not be common.

Another: ""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D - valid and avoids the forbidden letters.

I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate. It uses P, O, U, N, D. All distinct and common.

Similarly, ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", etc., but F is also common? Actually, we want to test new letters.

But let me think: ""CLOUD"" might be better because it has a C which is common.

In terms of frequency: N is very common, L is common, O is common, U common, D common.

""ONION"" has repeated O? Not distinct letters.

""MINIM"" has repeated M and I? Not good.

So, I think ""CLOUD"" or ""POUND"". I'll go with ""CLOUD"" because it includes C and L, which are very common consonants.

So the next guess: ""cloud""

Therefore, my second guess is ""cloud"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- ""stare"" had all letters marked as ""x"", meaning the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E.
- Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Avoiding the letters S, T, A, R, E
2. Using high-frequency English letters not yet tested (e.g., C, L, O, U, D)
3. Selecting a common 5-letter word with distinct letters to maximize information gain
4. Including vowels from the remaining set (O, U) since I, Y, and other consonants can serve as vowels if needed

A strong candidate is **""cloud""**:
- **C**: Common consonant not yet tested
- **L**: High-frequency consonant not yet tested
- **O**: Remaining common vowel
- **U**: Remaining common vowel
- **D**: Common consonant not yet tested
This word avoids all forbidden letters, covers new frequent characters, and should provide useful positional feedback.

<guess>cloud</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""stare"" -> all letters incorrect: S, T, A, R, E are not in the secret word at all.
2. ""cloud"" -> C(x) L(x) D(x) are not in the word, but O(-) and U(-) mean that O and U are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed.

From ""cloud"":
- O is in the word but not in the second position (since feedback for O was ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- U is in the word but not in the fourth position.

Also, since we know C, L, D are not in the word, that means the secret word contains O and U, and possibly other letters we haven't guessed yet.

We have eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D (8 letters). So we must avoid these.

The secret word has O and U, and we know they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively (from ""cloud"").

Now, for our third guess, we need to:
- Include O and U (since they are in the word).
- Avoid S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.
- Place O and U in positions that are not 2 and 4, respectively.
- We have 6 tries, so we can test other common letters.

Available letters: All except S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also, note that O and U are already in the word.

We need to form a 5-letter word containing O and U, with three more letters from the available set.

We should also try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Possible words: We need words that have O and U, and 3 other letters not eliminated.

We know O is not in position 2, U is not in position 4.

For example:
- If we put O in position 1, then U could be elsewhere, but not position 4.
- Similarly, U can be in positions 1,2,3,5, but not 4.

Let's think of common words with O and U.

Examples:
- ""ouija"" - but that has J and A? A is eliminated. Also, ""ouija"" is not common and has different letter count? ""ouija"" is 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A. But A is eliminated, so invalid.
- ""bough"" : B-O-U-G-H. Letters: B, O, U, G, H. None of these are eliminated? Check: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D are eliminated, so B, G, H are new. So possible.
- ""cough"" : C is eliminated, so no.
- ""dough"": D is eliminated. No.
- ""fough"": not a word? Perhaps ""fought"" is 6 letters.
- ""gourd"": G-O-U-R-D. But R and D are eliminated. So invalid.
- ""mouth"": M-O-U-T-H. But T is eliminated. No.
- ""pound"": P-O-U-N-D. But D is eliminated. No.
- ""wound"": W-O-U-N-D. D eliminated. No.
- ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Letters: Y, O, U, N, G. None eliminated? Y isn't eliminated? So yes, Y is still available. So ""young"" is a possibility.
- ""boule"": E eliminated. No.
- ""buoy"": 4 letters.
- ""fount"": T eliminated? F-O-U-N-T has T eliminated. No.
- ""found"": D eliminated. No.
- ""hound"": D eliminated. No.
- ""mound"": D eliminated. No.
- ""joust"": J-O-U-S-T. S and T eliminated. No.
- ""house"": S and E eliminated. No.
- ""mousy"": S eliminated. No.

Another: ""group"": G-R-O-U-P. R is eliminated. No.

""bunch"": B-U-N-C-H. C eliminated. No.

""bunch"" has C, eliminated.

""louse"": S and E? L-O-U-S-E has S and E eliminated. No.

""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated. No.

So words like ""bough"" and ""young"" are candidates.

Let me list:
- ""bough"": B-O-U-G-H. Positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), H(5)
But from feedback, we know that O is not in position 2? Because in ""cloud"", O was in position 2 and it was marked wrong position (""-""), meaning that in that word, position 2 is not where O belongs. But it doesn't mean O cannot be in position 2 in another guess? Actually, the feedback is about the secret word: O is in the word, but not in position 2 of the secret word.

Similarly, U is not in position 4 of the secret word.

So in our new guess, if we place O in position 2, it would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, position 4 for U is wrong.

Therefore, in ""bough"", if we put O in position 2, that would be incorrect (since O is not in position 2 in secret) and U in position 3.

But actually, we can place O and U anywhere except positions 2 and 4 respectively? Not exactly: the feedback only told us about positions 2 and 4 in that particular guess. But the secret word has O in some position, not 2, and U in some position, not 4.

For our next guess, we need to place O and U in positions different from 2 and 4, but also consider that they could be in other positions.

In ""bough"":
- Position 2 is O: but we know that O is not in position 2 of the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we would expect it to be incorrect. So we should avoid putting O in position 2.
Similarly, U should not be in position 4.

In ""bough"", O is in position 2, which we know is not the position for O in the secret word. So if we guess ""bough"", the O in position 2 would get a ""-"" again? Actually, if O is correctly in the word but not in position 2, it would still get a ""-"". But we already know O is in the word, so that doesn't give us new info about position. However, it would be a wasted opportunity to test a new position.

Moreover, position 4 is G, not U. So U is in position 3, which is acceptable.

But since O in position 2 is wrong, we want to move it to a different position to find the right one.

So for our guess, we should try to place O in a different position and U in a different position.

Similarly for U: don't put it in position 4.

So let's consider other positions for O: 1,3,4,5 and U:1,2,3,5.

Also, we need to form a word.

Possible words:

- If O is in first position: e.g., O_ _ _ _
Then we need to place U somewhere. Word: OUNCE? But E is eliminated. 
OUBIT? Not common. 
OUPHE? Not a word.

Better: ""ought"": O-U-G-H-T. But T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated, so no.

Ouzel: O-U-Z-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.

Not easy.

- O in third position: _ _ O _ _
U can be in positions: 1,2,4,5.

Word example: ""prove""? P-R-O-V-E. R and E eliminated. No.
""grown"": G-R-O-W-N. R eliminated. No.

""blown"": B-L-O-W-N. L eliminated? L is eliminated from ""cloud"" feedback? In guess2, L was marked ""x"", so L is not in the word, so we cannot use L. Similarly, L is eliminated.

Since L is eliminated, we avoid L.

Similarly, ""known"": K-N-O-W-N. K,N,O,W,N? N repeated? ""known"" has two N's? Let's check: K-N-O-W-N? That's only 4 distinct letters: K,N,O,W? But it has two N's? Actually, ""known"" is K-N-O-W-N, so positions: K(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). But duplicate N? Wordle allows duplicate letters? In the rules, it doesn't say no duplicates, but typically secrets don't have duplicates. So to be safe, we should avoid words with duplicate letters.

But in this case, ""known"" has duplicate N? Yes, N is in position 2 and 5. So better to avoid duplicates?

Similarly, feedback symbols: in example, BRISK has distinct letters.

So I assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore each letter appears once.

So our guesses should also have distinct letters to maximize info.

So ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Distinct letters: Y, O, U, N, G? Yes. And positions: Y(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), G(5)

But O is in position 2: and we know from ""cloud"" that O is not in position 2. So if we put O in position 2 again, we would get a ""-"" for O meaning it's not in position 2, but we already know that. So it doesn't help.

Moreover, U is in position 3, which is fine.

But since O in position 2 is wrong, we should choose a word where O is in a different position.

Similarly, for U, we have only known not to put it in position 4.

So let's avoid putting O in position 2.

Another word: ""bunko""? But K and O, but meaning? B-U-N-K-O. Letters B,U,N,K,O. Positions: B(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), O(5)

Here, O is in position 5, which is new. U is in position 2, which has not been tested for U.

Also, we haven't tested B, N, K.

From feedback, U is not in position 4, but here U is in position 2, which is fine.

Similarly, O is in position 5, not position 2.

So ""bunko"" is a valid English word meaning a type of swindle? It might be obscure.

Common words: ""you'd""? Not 5 letters. ""youth""? T is eliminated, and has H? Y-O-U-T-H: T and H? T eliminated, so no.

""mourn"": M-O-U-R-N. But R is eliminated. No.

""proud"": P-R-O-U-D. R and D eliminated. No.

""ghoul"": G-H-O-U-L. But L is eliminated. No.

""vowel"": V-O-W-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.

Input: we have O and U to include, and avoid S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D.

""budgy""? Not a word.

""fungo"": F-U-N-G-O. This is a sports term? Maybe too obscure.

""quoin"": Q-U-O-I-N. But Q and I? I hasn't been tested. Letters: Q,U,O,I,N. Avoided? S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D are avoided; Q,I,N are new. So possible.

""quoit"": But T eliminated.

""quota"": T and A? A eliminated.

Not good.

Another idea: ""bogus"": B-O-G-U-S. But S eliminated? Yes, S is out.

""focus"": C and S eliminated.

""mucus"": S eliminated.

""juicy"": J-U-I-C-Y. But C eliminated? C is eliminated, so no.

Back to ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G. But O in position 2 is undesirable because it must be wrong.

We need to change O's position.

Let's try O in position 1: but words like ""ouchy""? O-U-C-H-Y. C eliminated? O-U-C-H-Y has C, which is eliminated.

""odium"": O-D-I-U-M. D eliminated? D is out, yes.

Position O in 4: but then U in 1,3, etc.

I think ""bunko"" is acceptable. Or ""gunky""? G-U-N-K-Y. O not included.

We must include both O and U.

Options:
- ""conus"": C eliminated and S eliminated.
- ""forum"": F-O-R-U-M. R eliminated.
- ""humor"": H-U-M-O-R. R eliminated.
- ""junco"": J-U-N-C-O. C eliminated.
- ""kudos"": K-U-D-O-S. D and S eliminated.
- ""mufti"": M-U-F-T-I. T eliminated.
- ""music"": M-U-S-I-C. S and C eliminated.
- ""ninth"": N-I-N-T-H. T and duplicate N? ""ninth"" has two N's? Positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5). Duplicate N, and T eliminated. Not good.
- ""oulti"": not a word.
- ""pious"": P-I-O-U-S. S eliminated.
- ""sound"": S and D eliminated.
- ""torus"": T eliminated and S.
- ""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated.
- ""wough"": not a word.

Perhaps ""bougie"": 6 letters.

Maybe I missed ""goumi""? Not common.

Another one: ""bovid"": B-O-V-I-D. D eliminated? D is eliminated.

So difficult.

""pinup"": P-I-N-U-P. Duplicate P, and no O.

We need O and U.

Only ""bunko"" and ""young"" come to mind, but ""young"" puts O in position 2 which is known wrong.

What about ""known"" with duplicate N? Not ideal.

""bowig"": not a word.

Or ""buoya"": not a word.

Perhaps ""boulle"": B-O-U-L-L-E. L and E eliminated, and duplicate L.

No.

Another common word: ""mount"": M-O-U-N-T. T eliminated.

""count"": C and T eliminated.

""doubt"": D and T eliminated.

""gouty"": G-O-U-T-Y. T eliminated.

So it seems our best bets are ""bunko"" or ""young"", even though with ""young"" O is in position 2.

But maybe we can choose to use ""bogus"" if S wasn't eliminated, but it is.

Wait, let's think: ""quoit"" is Q,U,O,I,T but T eliminated.

""quick"": Q-U-I-C-K. C eliminated.

I think ""bunko"" is the word to  use, even if uncommon. Or another word like ""compo"" but that has C.

At this point, perhaps ""unbox"": U-N-B-O-X. Letters U,N,B,O,X? Positions: U(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5)

Here, U is in position 1, O in position 4.

U in position 1 is good because we don't know about position 1 for U. We only know U is not in position 4? From ""cloud"", U was in position 4 marked ""-"" so not in 4, but we can place U in 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, O can be in 1,3,4,5 (not 2).

In ""unbox"":
- U is in position 1, which is new.
- O is in position 4. Have we tested O in position 4? Not yet.

Also, no duplicate letters.

Letters used: U, N, B, O, X. None of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D. U and O are in, N, B, X are new.

B is common, N is common, X is less common. But acceptable.

Also, ""unbox"" is a valid English word meaning to remove from a box.

So this might work.

Another word: ""boxun""? Not a word.

Or ""bonux""? Not a word.

So ""unbox"" seems good.

But X is a bit uncommon, so it might not be efficient.

What about ""vying"": V-Y-I-N-G. But no O and U? Only Y and I as vowels? But we must include O and U because they are in the word.

The secret word contains O and U, so our guess must contain O and U to get positional feedback.

So we cannot omit them.

Therefore, ""unbox"" is a valid choice.

Another word: ""bouzy"": B-O-U-Z-Y. Or ""bogey"" has E?

""bouge"" not 5 letters.

I think ""unbox"" is my best shot.

We could go with ""bunko"" but ""unbox"" uses more common letters except X.

But let's see the frequency: N and B are very common, X is rare.

An alternative: ""jambu""? Not common.

So I'll go with ""unbox"".

Therefore, guess: ""unbox""

But let's confirm feedback expectations:

If we guess ""unbox"" and secret word has O and U: 
- U in position 1: could be correct or not.
- O in position 4: could be correct or not.

We also test N, B, X.

Position 2 and 3 are N and B.

So we can get information.

Another word: ""bumpy""? B-U-M-P-Y. But no O.

We need O.

I don't see a better word.

So let's go with ""unbox"".

<guess>unbox</guess> 

In the response format.

But first, thought process.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: stare** → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x) reveals that the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E. These letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x) provides crucial insights:
  - C, L, and D are not in the secret word.
  - O is present but not in position 2 (since it received ""-"").
  - U is present but not in position 4 (since it received ""-"").

Combined, the eliminated letters are: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D. The secret word must contain O and U, and they cannot be in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- **Include O and U**: Both must be in the guess since they are confirmed in the secret word, but placed in new positions to test for correctness:
  - O can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 2 is invalid; position 4 is untested but possible).
  - U can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 is invalid).
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Do not use S, T, A, R, E, C, L, or D.
- **Maximize information gain**: Prioritize using high-frequency remaining letters like B, N, G, M, P, K, or Y to cover new ground. Choose a word with distinct letters for clarity.
- **Word selection**: Search for valid 5-letter English words containing O and U, avoiding bad positions and eliminated letters. After evaluating options:
  - ""young"": Puts O in position 2 (known to be wrong), wasting positional data; avoid.
  - ""bough"": Puts O in position 2 (invalid), and U in position 3; suboptimal.
  - ""unbox"": Emerges as the best candidate—uses U in position 1 (new position), O in position 4 (untested position), and introduces new common letters (N, B, X). It avoids all eliminated characters and fits the constraints.

**Final choice**: ""unbox"" tests U in position 1, O in position 4, and adds N, B, X to gain more feedback on letter presence and positions.

Common consonants: we have a lot but let\'s think of frequent ones: N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nGiven that, we should pick a word that uses other common letters. Since we have 6 tries, we can try to maximize the coverage.\n\nA good candidate might be: ""CLOUD""\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: C, L, O, U, D. All distinct and none of these are in the avoided list. Also, it has two vowels (O and U) and three consonants.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PINCH"" - P, I, N, C, H. But note H is less common.\n\nAlternatively, ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D.\n\nBut we should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nAnother idea: ""OILED"" - O, I, L, E. Wait, E is already out! We cannot use E. So avoid any word containing E.\n\nSimilarly, S, T, A, R, E are all out. So we must avoid these.\n\nLet me list some words without S, T, A, R, E:\n\n- Using O, I, U as vowels and other consonants.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D\n- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but E is out! So invalid.\n- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. But Q is less common and the word has Q which might be risky.\n- ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E is out.\n\nAvoid E.\n\nAnother: ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D. H is a bit less common but possible.\n\nOr ""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M - but might be too obscure.\n\nWe need a common word. ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T - but T is out! T is in the avoided list.\n\nAvoided letters: S, T, A, R, E. So T is also out.\n\nTherefore, ""might"" is invalid because of T.\n\nSimilarly, ""wound"": W, O, U, N, D. None of these are avoided. W is somewhat common.\n\nBut let\'s look for the most common letters remaining.\n\nAfter removing S, T, A, R, E, the top letters by frequency in English might be O, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.\n\nSo let\'s try: ""NOULD""? Not a word.\n\n""Could"" has C, O, U, L, D - but L is in. Wait, ""could"" is 5 letters? No, ""could"" is 5: C-O-U-L-D.\n\nBut we already used S, T, A, R, E. None of C,O,U,L,D are in that set. So it is a valid word.\n\nBut ""could"" uses the letters C,O,U,L,D.\n\nSimilarly, ""would"" is W,O,U,L,D - and W is allowed.\n\nBut ""could"" is more common? Actually, both are common.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILD"" - B,U,I,L,D. Also valid.\n\nWe might want to include a vowel and some common consonants.\n\nBut note, we also have to consider that the secret word might not have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle words don\'t have repeated letters usually? Wait, they can have repeated letters? Actually, Wordle official answers are usually without repeated letters? But in the rules, it doesn\'t specify, but typically the answers are distinct letters.\n\nIn the example, BRISK has no repeated letters. So it\'s safer to assume no repeated letters.\n\nThus, we will pick a word with distinct letters.\n\nOptions:\n- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D\n- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D\n- ""WOULD"": W, O, U, L, D\n\nBut notice that ""D"" appears in all. We could try ""OUNCE"" - O,U,N,C,E - wait E is out? ""OUNCE"" has E? No: O-U-N-C-E? That ends with E. So invalid.\n\nWe can choose ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L - but H might not be common.\n\nAnother: ""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D - valid and avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nI think ""POUND"" is a good candidate. It uses P, O, U, N, D. All distinct and common.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", etc., but F is also common? Actually, we want to test new letters.\n\nBut let me think: ""CLOUD"" might be better because it has a C which is common.\n\nIn terms of frequency: N is very common, L is common, O is common, U common, D common.\n\n""ONION"" has repeated O? Not distinct letters.\n\n""MINIM"" has repeated M and I? Not good.\n\nSo, I think ""CLOUD"" or ""POUND"". I\'ll go with ""CLOUD"" because it includes C and L, which are very common consonants.\n\nSo the next guess: ""cloud""\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""cloud"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- ""stare"" had all letters marked as ""x"", meaning the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E.\n- Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritized:\n1. Avoiding the letters S, T, A, R, E\n2. Using high-frequency English letters not yet tested (e.g., C, L, O, U, D)\n3. Selecting a common 5-letter word with distinct letters to maximize information gain\n4. Including vowels from the remaining set (O, U) since I, Y, and other consonants can serve as vowels if needed\n\nA strong candidate is **""cloud""**:\n- **C**: Common consonant not yet tested\n- **L**: High-frequency consonant not yet tested\n- **O**: Remaining common vowel\n- **U**: Remaining common vowel\n- **D**: Common consonant not yet tested\nThis word avoids all forbidden letters, covers new frequent characters, and should provide useful positional feedback.\n\n<guess>cloud</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""stare"" -> all letters incorrect: S, T, A, R, E are not in the secret word at all.\n2. ""cloud"" -> C(x) L(x) D(x) are not in the word, but O(-) and U(-) mean that O and U are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed.\n\nFrom ""cloud"":\n- O is in the word but not in the second position (since feedback for O was ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).\n- U is in the word but not in the fourth position.\n\nAlso, since we know C, L, D are not in the word, that means the secret word contains O and U, and possibly other letters we haven\'t guessed yet.\n\nWe have eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D (8 letters). So we must avoid these.\n\nThe secret word has O and U, and we know they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively (from ""cloud"").\n\nNow, for our third guess, we need to:\n- Include O and U (since they are in the word).\n- Avoid S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.\n- Place O and U in positions that are not 2 and 4, respectively.\n- We have 6 tries, so we can test other common letters.\n\nAvailable letters: All except S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.\n\nCommon letters left: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also, note that O and U are already in the word.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word containing O and U, with three more letters from the available set.\n\nWe should also try to cover more common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words: We need words that have O and U, and 3 other letters not eliminated.\n\nWe know O is not in position 2, U is not in position 4.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put O in position 1, then U could be elsewhere, but not position 4.\n- Similarly, U can be in positions 1,2,3,5, but not 4.\n\nLet\'s think of common words with O and U.\n\nExamples:\n- ""ouija"" - but that has J and A? A is eliminated. Also, ""ouija"" is not common and has different letter count? ""ouija"" is 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A. But A is eliminated, so invalid.\n- ""bough"" : B-O-U-G-H. Letters: B, O, U, G, H. None of these are eliminated? Check: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D are eliminated, so B, G, H are new. So possible.\n- ""cough"" : C is eliminated, so no.\n- ""dough"": D is eliminated. No.\n- ""fough"": not a word? Perhaps ""fought"" is 6 letters.\n- ""gourd"": G-O-U-R-D. But R and D are eliminated. So invalid.\n- ""mouth"": M-O-U-T-H. But T is eliminated. No.\n- ""pound"": P-O-U-N-D. But D is eliminated. No.\n- ""wound"": W-O-U-N-D. D eliminated. No.\n- ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Letters: Y, O, U, N, G. None eliminated? Y isn\'t eliminated? So yes, Y is still available. So ""young"" is a possibility.\n- ""boule"": E eliminated. No.\n- ""buoy"": 4 letters.\n- ""fount"": T eliminated? F-O-U-N-T has T eliminated. No.\n- ""found"": D eliminated. No.\n- ""hound"": D eliminated. No.\n- ""mound"": D eliminated. No.\n- ""joust"": J-O-U-S-T. S and T eliminated. No.\n- ""house"": S and E eliminated. No.\n- ""mousy"": S eliminated. No.\n\nAnother: ""group"": G-R-O-U-P. R is eliminated. No.\n\n""bunch"": B-U-N-C-H. C eliminated. No.\n\n""bunch"" has C, eliminated.\n\n""louse"": S and E? L-O-U-S-E has S and E eliminated. No.\n\n""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated. No.\n\nSo words like ""bough"" and ""young"" are candidates.\n\nLet me list:\n- ""bough"": B-O-U-G-H. Positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), H(5)\nBut from feedback, we know that O is not in position 2? Because in ""cloud"", O was in position 2 and it was marked wrong position (""-""), meaning that in that word, position 2 is not where O belongs. But it doesn\'t mean O cannot be in position 2 in another guess? Actually, the feedback is about the secret word: O is in the word, but not in position 2 of the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, U is not in position 4 of the secret word.\n\nSo in our new guess, if we place O in position 2, it would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, position 4 for U is wrong.\n\nTherefore, in ""bough"", if we put O in position 2, that would be incorrect (since O is not in position 2 in secret) and U in position 3.\n\nBut actually, we can place O and U anywhere except positions 2 and 4 respectively? Not exactly: the feedback only told us about positions 2 and 4 in that particular guess. But the secret word has O in some position, not 2, and U in some position, not 4.\n\nFor our next guess, we need to place O and U in positions different from 2 and 4, but also consider that they could be in other positions.\n\nIn ""bough"":\n- Position 2 is O: but we know that O is not in position 2 of the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we would expect it to be incorrect. So we should avoid putting O in position 2.\nSimilarly, U should not be in position 4.\n\nIn ""bough"", O is in position 2, which we know is not the position for O in the secret word. So if we guess ""bough"", the O in position 2 would get a ""-"" again? Actually, if O is correctly in the word but not in position 2, it would still get a ""-"". But we already know O is in the word, so that doesn\'t give us new info about position. However, it would be a wasted opportunity to test a new position.\n\nMoreover, position 4 is G, not U. So U is in position 3, which is acceptable.\n\nBut since O in position 2 is wrong, we want to move it to a different position to find the right one.\n\nSo for our guess, we should try to place O in a different position and U in a different position.\n\nSimilarly for U: don\'t put it in position 4.\n\nSo let\'s consider other positions for O: 1,3,4,5 and U:1,2,3,5.\n\nAlso, we need to form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If O is in first position: e.g., O_ _ _ _\nThen we need to place U somewhere. Word: OUNCE? But E is eliminated. \nOUBIT? Not common. \nOUPHE? Not a word.\n\nBetter: ""ought"": O-U-G-H-T. But T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated, so no.\n\nOuzel: O-U-Z-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.\n\nNot easy.\n\n- O in third position: _ _ O _ _\nU can be in positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nWord example: ""prove""? P-R-O-V-E. R and E eliminated. No.\n""grown"": G-R-O-W-N. R eliminated. No.\n\n""blown"": B-L-O-W-N. L eliminated? L is eliminated from ""cloud"" feedback? In guess2, L was marked ""x"", so L is not in the word, so we cannot use L. Similarly, L is eliminated.\n\nSince L is eliminated, we avoid L.\n\nSimilarly, ""known"": K-N-O-W-N. K,N,O,W,N? N repeated? ""known"" has two N\'s? Let\'s check: K-N-O-W-N? That\'s only 4 distinct letters: K,N,O,W? But it has two N\'s? Actually, ""known"" is K-N-O-W-N, so positions: K(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). But duplicate N? Wordle allows duplicate letters? In the rules, it doesn\'t say no duplicates, but typically secrets don\'t have duplicates. So to be safe, we should avoid words with duplicate letters.\n\nBut in this case, ""known"" has duplicate N? Yes, N is in position 2 and 5. So better to avoid duplicates?\n\nSimilarly, feedback symbols: in example, BRISK has distinct letters.\n\nSo I assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore each letter appears once.\n\nSo our guesses should also have distinct letters to maximize info.\n\nSo ""young"": Y-O-U-N-G. Distinct letters: Y, O, U, N, G? Yes. And positions: Y(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), G(5)\n\nBut O is in position 2: and we know from ""cloud"" that O is not in position 2. So if we put O in position 2 again, we would get a ""-"" for O meaning it\'s not in position 2, but we already know that. So it doesn\'t help.\n\nMoreover, U is in position 3, which is fine.\n\nBut since O in position 2 is wrong, we should choose a word where O is in a different position.\n\nSimilarly, for U, we have only known not to put it in position 4.\n\nSo let\'s avoid putting O in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""bunko""? But K and O, but meaning? B-U-N-K-O. Letters B,U,N,K,O. Positions: B(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), O(5)\n\nHere, O is in position 5, which is new. U is in position 2, which has not been tested for U.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested B, N, K.\n\nFrom feedback, U is not in position 4, but here U is in position 2, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, O is in position 5, not position 2.\n\nSo ""bunko"" is a valid English word meaning a type of swindle? It might be obscure.\n\nCommon words: ""you\'d""? Not 5 letters. ""youth""? T is eliminated, and has H? Y-O-U-T-H: T and H? T eliminated, so no.\n\n""mourn"": M-O-U-R-N. But R is eliminated. No.\n\n""proud"": P-R-O-U-D. R and D eliminated. No.\n\n""ghoul"": G-H-O-U-L. But L is eliminated. No.\n\n""vowel"": V-O-W-E-L. E and L eliminated. No.\n\nInput: we have O and U to include, and avoid S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D.\n\n""budgy""? Not a word.\n\n""fungo"": F-U-N-G-O. This is a sports term? Maybe too obscure.\n\n""quoin"": Q-U-O-I-N. But Q and I? I hasn\'t been tested. Letters: Q,U,O,I,N. Avoided? S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D are avoided; Q,I,N are new. So possible.\n\n""quoit"": But T eliminated.\n\n""quota"": T and A? A eliminated.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother idea: ""bogus"": B-O-G-U-S. But S eliminated? Yes, S is out.\n\n""focus"": C and S eliminated.\n\n""mucus"": S eliminated.\n\n""juicy"": J-U-I-C-Y. But C eliminated? C is eliminated, so no.\n\nBack to ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G. But O in position 2 is undesirable because it must be wrong.\n\nWe need to change O\'s position.\n\nLet\'s try O in position 1: but words like ""ouchy""? O-U-C-H-Y. C eliminated? O-U-C-H-Y has C, which is eliminated.\n\n""odium"": O-D-I-U-M. D eliminated? D is out, yes.\n\nPosition O in 4: but then U in 1,3, etc.\n\nI think ""bunko"" is acceptable. Or ""gunky""? G-U-N-K-Y. O not included.\n\nWe must include both O and U.\n\nOptions:\n- ""conus"": C eliminated and S eliminated.\n- ""forum"": F-O-R-U-M. R eliminated.\n- ""humor"": H-U-M-O-R. R eliminated.\n- ""junco"": J-U-N-C-O. C eliminated.\n- ""kudos"": K-U-D-O-S. D and S eliminated.\n- ""mufti"": M-U-F-T-I. T eliminated.\n- ""music"": M-U-S-I-C. S and C eliminated.\n- ""ninth"": N-I-N-T-H. T and duplicate N? ""ninth"" has two N\'s? Positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5). Duplicate N, and T eliminated. Not good.\n- ""oulti"": not a word.\n- ""pious"": P-I-O-U-S. S eliminated.\n- ""sound"": S and D eliminated.\n- ""torus"": T eliminated and S.\n- ""vouch"": V-O-U-C-H. C eliminated.\n- ""wough"": not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""bougie"": 6 letters.\n\nMaybe I missed ""goumi""? Not common.\n\nAnother one: ""bovid"": B-O-V-I-D. D eliminated? D is eliminated.\n\nSo difficult.\n\n""pinup"": P-I-N-U-P. Duplicate P, and no O.\n\nWe need O and U.\n\nOnly ""bunko"" and ""young"" come to mind, but ""young"" puts O in position 2 which is known wrong.\n\nWhat about ""known"" with duplicate N? Not ideal.\n\n""bowig"": not a word.\n\nOr ""buoya"": not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""boulle"": B-O-U-L-L-E. L and E eliminated, and duplicate L.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother common word: ""mount"": M-O-U-N-T. T eliminated.\n\n""count"": C and T eliminated.\n\n""doubt"": D and T eliminated.\n\n""gouty"": G-O-U-T-Y. T eliminated.\n\nSo it seems our best bets are ""bunko"" or ""young"", even though with ""young"" O is in position 2.\n\nBut maybe we can choose to use ""bogus"" if S wasn\'t eliminated, but it is.\n\nWait, let\'s think: ""quoit"" is Q,U,O,I,T but T eliminated.\n\n""quick"": Q-U-I-C-K. C eliminated.\n\nI think ""bunko"" is the word to  use, even if uncommon. Or another word like ""compo"" but that has C.\n\nAt this point, perhaps ""unbox"": U-N-B-O-X. Letters U,N,B,O,X? Positions: U(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5)\n\nHere, U is in position 1, O in position 4.\n\nU in position 1 is good because we don\'t know about position 1 for U. We only know U is not in position 4? From ""cloud"", U was in position 4 marked ""-"" so not in 4, but we can place U in 1,2,3,5.\n\nSimilarly, O can be in 1,3,4,5 (not 2).\n\nIn ""unbox"":\n- U is in position 1, which is new.\n- O is in position 4. Have we tested O in position 4? Not yet.\n\nAlso, no duplicate letters.\n\nLetters used: U, N, B, O, X. None of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D. U and O are in, N, B, X are new.\n\nB is common, N is common, X is less common. But acceptable.\n\nAlso, ""unbox"" is a valid English word meaning to remove from a box.\n\nSo this might work.\n\nAnother word: ""boxun""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""bonux""? Not a word.\n\nSo ""unbox"" seems good.\n\nBut X is a bit uncommon, so it might not be efficient.\n\nWhat about ""vying"": V-Y-I-N-G. But no O and U? Only Y and I as vowels? But we must include O and U because they are in the word.\n\nThe secret word contains O and U, so our guess must contain O and U to get positional feedback.\n\nSo we cannot omit them.\n\nTherefore, ""unbox"" is a valid choice.\n\nAnother word: ""bouzy"": B-O-U-Z-Y. Or ""bogey"" has E?\n\n""bouge"" not 5 letters.\n\nI think ""unbox"" is my best shot.\n\nWe could go with ""bunko"" but ""unbox"" uses more common letters except X.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: N and B are very common, X is rare.\n\nAn alternative: ""jambu""? Not common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""unbox"".\n\nTherefore, guess: ""unbox""\n\nBut let\'s confirm feedback expectations:\n\nIf we guess ""unbox"" and secret word has O and U: \n- U in position 1: could be correct or not.\n- O in position 4: could be correct or not.\n\nWe also test N, B, X.\n\nPosition 2 and 3 are N and B.\n\nSo we can get information.\n\nAnother word: ""bumpy""? B-U-M-P-Y. But no O.\n\nWe need O.\n\nI don\'t see a better word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""unbox"".\n\n<guess>unbox</guess> \n\nIn the response format.\n\nBut first, thought process.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: stare** → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x) reveals that the secret word contains none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E. These letters are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x) provides crucial insights:\n  - C, L, and D are not in the secret word.\n  - O is present but not in position 2 (since it received ""-"").\n  - U is present but not in position 4 (since it received ""-"").\n\nCombined, the eliminated letters are: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D. The secret word must contain O and U, and they cannot be in positions 2 and 4, respectively.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- **Include O and U**: Both must be in the guess since they are confirmed in the secret word, but placed in new positions to test for correctness:\n  - O can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 2 is invalid; position 4 is untested but possible).\n  - U can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 is invalid).\n- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Do not use S, T, A, R, E, C, L, or D.\n- **Maximize information gain**: Prioritize using high-frequency remaining letters like B, N, G, M, P, K, or Y to cover new ground. Choose a word with distinct letters for clarity.\n- **Word selection**: Search for valid 5-letter English words containing O and U, avoiding bad positions and eliminated letters. After evaluating options:\n  - ""young"": Puts O in position 2 (known to be wrong), wasting positional data; avoid.\n  - ""bough"": Puts O in position 2 (invalid), and U in position 3; suboptimal.\n  - ""unbox"": Emerges as the best candidate—uses U in position 1 (new position), O in position 4 (untested position), and introduces new common letters (N, B, X). It avoids all eliminated characters and fits the constraints.\n\n**Final choice**: ""unbox"" tests U in position 1, O in position 4, and adds N, B, X to gain more feedback on letter presence and positions.\n\n<guess>unbox</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: unbox -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) B(-) O(-) X(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""stare"" → all letters absent: S, T, A, R, E are not in the secret word.
Guess 2: ""cloud"" → C, L, D absent; O and U present but in wrong positions (O not in position 2, U not in position 4).
Guess 3: ""unbox"" → U(-), N(x), B(-), O(-), X(x)

Feedback for ""unbox"":
- U(-): U is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- N(x): N is not in the secret word.
- B(-): B is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- O(-): O is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- X(x): X is not in the secret word.

Thus, we know:
- Absent letters: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, N, X (extended list)
- Present letters: O, U, B (but not in their guessed positions)

Specifically:
- O is in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""cloud"") or position 4 (from ""unbox"").
- U is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""cloud"") or position 1 (from ""unbox"").
- B is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""unbox"").

Possible positions for O: Since it can't be in position 2 or 4, and positions 1,3,5 remain. But note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's confirm:
In ""cloud"": positions 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:D → O was position 2, which is bad.
In ""unbox"": positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:B, 4:O, 5:X → O was position 4, which is also bad. So O cannot be in position 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly for U: Cannot be in position 4 (from cloud) or position 1 (from unbox). So U cannot be in position 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2,3,5.

For B: Cannot be in position 3 (from unbox) → possible positions: 1,2,4,5.

Now, we know the secret word contains B, O, U. Since there are 5 letters, and we have three known, we need to find two more letters that are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated letters: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, N, X (10 letters). Remaining possible letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y.

The secret word must be composed of B,O,U and two from the above list, at positions that satisfy the constraints.

We need to form a word with:
- B, O, U present
- Two other letters from {F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,Y}
- Positions: O in {1,3,5}, U in {2,3,5}, B in {1,2,4,5} (since not position 3)

We should try to guess a word that respects these position constraints and tests possible new letters.

Moreover, we have 6 tries total, so we can use this to narrow down.

To maximize information, we should try a word that includes two new common letters and places the known letters in an untried configuration.

Possible configurations:

Case 1: O in position 1. Then U must be in 2,3,5 and B in 2,4,5 (but O is at 1).

Words starting with O: But O at position 1. Then U must be in one of 2,3,5.

For example:
If U at position 2: O U _ _ _
Words? Like ""OUBOW""? Not word.

""OUPHE""? Not.

Perhaps not many common words start with OU except ""ought"", ""ounce"", but E/T eliminated.

Case 2: O in position 3. Then positions: _ _ O _ _

U can be in position 2,3,5 → but position 3 taken by O, so U in 2 or 5.

Similarly, B can be in 1,2,4,5 but no overlap at position 3.

So if U at 2: _ U O _ _ 
Then B can be in 1,4,5. But U at position 2.

Is there a word like ""BUO...""? ""BUOY"" is 4 letters.

""BUOYS"" has S eliminated.

If U at 5: _ _ O _ U
Then B can be in 1,2,4.

Position 4: could be B.

Example words: 
- Position 1: say G? Then ""G _ O _ U"". With position 2: could be H? G H O _ U → ""ghoul"" but L eliminated.
Or ""PHOTU""? Not word.

With B: place B at position 4: _ _ O B U → like ""MOBBU""? Not word.

""HOBBY""? But Y, and duplicate B? ""HOBBY"" has two B's, not allowed? We assume no duplicates? So avoid.

Case 3: O in position 5. So words ending with O: _ _ _ _ O

U must be in position 2,3,5 → but O in 5, so U in 2 or 3.

B in 1,2,4.

So if U at 2: _ U _ _ O
Or U at 3: _ _ U _ O

Now, let's try to find real words.

If U at 2: _ U _ _ O
Put B at position 1: B U _ _ O → like ""BUBBO""? Not word. ""BUXBO""? X eliminated? X absent.

Or position 4? B U _ B O? ""BULBO"" has L.

But L eliminated.

Without B in front: e.g., ""MUDDO""? Not word.

If U at 3: then _ _ U _ O
And B can be at 1,2,4.

For example, B at 1: B _ U _ O → words: ""BUCK O""? C eliminated. ""BUGGY""? G duplicate? ""BUGGY"" has G repeated and Y? Positions: B(1), U(2) no, U is position 3? We have _ _ U _ O so U is position 3.

So B at position 1: B _ U _ O → ""B _ U _ O""

Possible: B A U _ O? A eliminated.

B E U _ O? E eliminated.

B I U _ O? ""BIUBO""? Not word.

B M U M O? Duplicate M.

B P U P O? Duplicate P.

Not easy.

B at position 2: _ B U _ O → then letters: e.g., ""O B U _ O""? But O at start? ""O"" but if O also later? ""O B U _ O"" has duplicate O? But we have one O at end? No, position 5 is O, so position 1 must be different.

For example, position 1: H → ""H B U _ O""? ""HUBBO""? Not.

Position 1: P → ""P B U _ O""? ""PBUFO""? Not.

Perhaps "" G B U P O "" — but not a word.

Let's consider U at position 3 and O at 5: common word? ""JUMBO""? J-U-M-B-O. Yes! ""JUMBO"" is 5 letters: J,U,M,B,O.

Check letters: J, U, M, B, O. Eliminated letters? S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D,N,X — J,M,B,O,U. None eliminated? B and O were known present, U known present, J and M are new.

Positions in ""JUMBO"":
- J(1), U(2), M(3), B(4), O(5)

Check the constraints:
- U is at position 2. We are required that U can be in position 2? From the constraints, U can be in positions 2,3,5 — so position 2 is legal for U.
- O is at position 5 — legal since possible positions are 1,3,5.
- B is at position 4 — possible since B can be in any except 3.

But how about the feedback? We place U at 2, which was not tested before? Similarly O at 5.

Also, we haven't tested positions: U was tested at 4 (in cloud) and at 1 (in unbox), both bad, but not at 2 or 3 or 5 directly? Similarly O tested at 2 and 4, bad, so position 5 is new.

For B, we only know it is not in position 3, so position 4 is new.

Moreover, if the word is ""JUMBO"", it satisfies.

Also, ""JUMBO"" is a valid English word.

So this is a strong candidate.

Other possibilities? If not, but let's see if there are alternatives.

If O is at position 1, but we didn't find a word.

""JUMBO"" seems a good guess.

Check if we can use more common letters? J is less common, but M is common.

Another word: ""HUMBO""? Not a word.

""BUMBO""? B-U-M-B-O — duplicate B? Not allowed? We assumed no duplicates.

""WOMBO""? Not common.

Good word: ""MUMBO""? M-U-M-B-O — duplicate M? Not distinct letters? Secret word probably has distinct letters? Yes.

""JUMBO"" has distinct letters: J,U,M,B,O.

Also, it includes the known letters and tests two new ones: J and M.

If M or J is not present, we get feedback.

So let's go with ""JUMBO"".

In the feedback, we know B is present, but not in position 3; in ""JUMBO"", B is in position 4 — a new position, which is fine.

Similarly, U in position 2 and O in position 5 are new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""jumbo"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: stare → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)**  
  Letters S, T, A, R, E are **not in the secret word**.  
- **Guess 2: cloud → C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x)**  
  Letters C, L, D are **not in the secret word**. O and U **are in the word**, but:  
  - O is not in position 2.  
  - U is not in position 4.  
- **Guess 3: unbox → U(-) N(x) B(-) O(-) X(x)**  
  Letters N and X are **not in the secret word**. B and U are **in the word**, but:  
  - U is not in position 1 (new constraint).  
  - B is not in position 3 (new constraint).  
  - O is not in position 4 (confirms previous constraint).  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Eliminated letters (10 total)**: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, N, X.  
2. **Confirmed present letters**: B, O, U.  
   - **Position constraints**:  
     - O must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be in 2 or 4).  
     - U must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 4).  
     - B must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be in 3).  
3. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Contains B, O, U + 2 new letters.  
   - New letters must be from remaining alphabet: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Priority**: Find a word that:  
  - Includes B, O, U.  
  - Uses two new high-frequency letters (e.g., from F, G, H, M, P, Y) to maximize information gain.  
  - Respects positional constraints for B, O, U (e.g., O not in 2/4, U not in 1/4, B not in 3).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and assumes distinct letters.  
- **Word selection**:  
  Considered multiple options (e.g., ""gumbo"" uses eliminated letter C; ""bumpy"" omits O; ""woozy"" duplicates O).  
  **Optimal choice: ""JUMBO""** (5-letter word):  
  - **Letters**: J, U, M, B, O.  
    - Contains B, O, U (both required).  
    - Uses new letters J, M (not tested before).  
  - **Position check**:  
    - U in position 2: Allowed (position not ruled out).  
    - O in position 5: Allowed (position not ruled out).  
    - B in position 4: Allowed (position not ruled out).  
  - **Benefits**: Tests U in position 2 (new), O in position 5 (new), and B in position 4 (new), while probing J and M for presence/position.  
  - **Word validity**: ""jumbo"" is a common English word (meaning large or unwieldy).  

<guess>jumbo</guess>",jumbo,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""stare"" → all letters absent: S, T, A, R, E are not in the secret word.
Guess 2: ""cloud"" → C, L, D absent; O and U present but in wrong positions (O not in position 2, U not in position 4).
Guess 3: ""unbox"" → U(-), N(x), B(-), O(-), X(x)

Feedback for ""unbox"":
- U(-): U is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- N(x): N is not in the secret word.
- B(-): B is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- O(-): O is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- X(x): X is not in the secret word.

Thus, we know:
- Absent letters: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, N, X (extended list)
- Present letters: O, U, B (but not in their guessed positions)

Specifically:
- O is in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""cloud"") or position 4 (from ""unbox"").
- U is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""cloud"") or position 1 (from ""unbox"").
- B is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""unbox"").

Possible positions for O: Since it can't be in position 2 or 4, and positions 1,3,5 remain. But note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's confirm:
In ""cloud"": positions 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:D → O was position 2, which is bad.
In ""unbox"": positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:B, 4:O, 5:X → O was position 4, which is also bad. So O cannot be in position 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly for U: Cannot be in position 4 (from cloud) or position 1 (from unbox). So U cannot be in position 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2,3,5.

For B: Cannot be in position 3 (from unbox) → possible positions: 1,2,4,5.

Now, we know the secret word contains B, O, U. Since there are 5 letters, and we have three known, we need to find two more letters that are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated letters: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, N, X (10 letters). Remaining possible letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y.

The secret word must be composed of B,O,U and two from the above list, at positions that satisfy the constraints.

We need to form a word with:
- B, O, U present
- Two other letters from {F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,Y}
- Positions: O in {1,3,5}, U in {2,3,5}, B in {1,2,4,5} (since not position 3)

We should try to guess a word that respects these position constraints and tests possible new letters.

Moreover, we have 6 tries total, so we can use this to narrow down.

To maximize information, we should try a word that includes two new common letters and places the known letters in an untried configuration.

Possible configurations:

Case 1: O in position 1. Then U must be in 2,3,5 and B in 2,4,5 (but O is at 1).

Words starting with O: But O at position 1. Then U must be in one of 2,3,5.

For example:
If U at position 2: O U _ _ _
Words? Like ""OUBOW""? Not word.

""OUPHE""? Not.

Perhaps not many common words start with OU except ""ought"", ""ounce"", but E/T eliminated.

Case 2: O in position 3. Then positions: _ _ O _ _

U can be in position 2,3,5 → but position 3 taken by O, so U in 2 or 5.

Similarly, B can be in 1,2,4,5 but no overlap at position 3.

So if U at 2: _ U O _ _ 
Then B can be in 1,4,5. But U at position 2.

Is there a word like ""BUO...""? ""BUOY"" is 4 letters.

""BUOYS"" has S eliminated.

If U at 5: _ _ O _ U
Then B can be in 1,2,4.

Position 4: could be B.

Example words: 
- Position 1: say G? Then ""G _ O _ U"". With position 2: could be H? G H O _ U → ""ghoul"" but L eliminated.
Or ""PHOTU""? Not word.

With B: place B at position 4: _ _ O B U → like ""MOBBU""? Not word.

""HOBBY""? But Y, and duplicate B? ""HOBBY"" has two B's, not allowed? We assume no duplicates? So avoid.

Case 3: O in position 5. So words ending with O: _ _ _ _ O

U must be in position 2,3,5 → but O in 5, so U in 2 or 3.

B in 1,2,4.

So if U at 2: _ U _ _ O
Or U at 3: _ _ U _ O

Now, let's try to find real words.

If U at 2: _ U _ _ O
Put B at position 1: B U _ _ O → like ""BUBBO""? Not word. ""BUXBO""? X eliminated? X absent.

Or position 4? B U _ B O? ""BULBO"" has L.

But L eliminated.

Without B in front: e.g., ""MUDDO""? Not word.

If U at 3: then _ _ U _ O
And B can be at 1,2,4.

For example, B at 1: B _ U _ O → words: ""BUCK O""? C eliminated. ""BUGGY""? G duplicate? ""BUGGY"" has G repeated and Y? Positions: B(1), U(2) no, U is position 3? We have _ _ U _ O so U is position 3.

So B at position 1: B _ U _ O → ""B _ U _ O""

Possible: B A U _ O? A eliminated.

B E U _ O? E eliminated.

B I U _ O? ""BIUBO""? Not word.

B M U M O? Duplicate M.

B P U P O? Duplicate P.

Not easy.

B at position 2: _ B U _ O → then letters: e.g., ""O B U _ O""? But O at start? ""O"" but if O also later? ""O B U _ O"" has duplicate O? But we have one O at end? No, position 5 is O, so position 1 must be different.

For example, position 1: H → ""H B U _ O""? ""HUBBO""? Not.

Position 1: P → ""P B U _ O""? ""PBUFO""? Not.

Perhaps "" G B U P O "" — but not a word.

Let's consider U at position 3 and O at 5: common word? ""JUMBO""? J-U-M-B-O. Yes! ""JUMBO"" is 5 letters: J,U,M,B,O.

Check letters: J, U, M, B, O. Eliminated letters? S,T,A,R,E,C,L,D,N,X — J,M,B,O,U. None eliminated? B and O were known present, U known present, J and M are new.

Positions in ""JUMBO"":
- J(1), U(2), M(3), B(4), O(5)

Check the constraints:
- U is at position 2. We are required that U can be in position 2? From the constraints, U can be in positions 2,3,5 — so position 2 is legal for U.
- O is at position 5 — legal since possible positions are 1,3,5.
- B is at position 4 — possible since B can be in any except 3.

But how about the feedback? We place U at 2, which was not tested before? Similarly O at 5.

Also, we haven't tested positions: U was tested at 4 (in cloud) and at 1 (in unbox), both bad, but not at 2 or 3 or 5 directly? Similarly O tested at 2 and 4, bad, so position 5 is new.

For B, we only know it is not in position 3, so position 4 is new.

Moreover, if the word is ""JUMBO"", it satisfies.

Also, ""JUMBO"" is a valid English word.

So this is a strong candidate.

Other possibilities? If not, but let's see if there are alternatives.

If O is at position 1, but we didn't find a word.

""JUMBO"" seems a good guess.

Check if we can use more common letters? J is less common, but M is common.

Another word: ""HUMBO""? Not a word.

""BUMBO""? B-U-M-B-O — duplicate B? Not allowed? We assumed no duplicates.

""WOMBO""? Not common.

Good word: ""MUMBO""? M-U-M-B-O — duplicate M? Not distinct letters? Secret word probably has distinct letters? Yes.

""JUMBO"" has distinct letters: J,U,M,B,O.

Also, it includes the known letters and tests two new ones: J and M.

If M or J is not present, we get feedback.

So let's go with ""JUMBO"".

In the feedback, we know B is present, but not in position 3; in ""JUMBO"", B is in position 4 — a new position, which is fine.

Similarly, U in position 2 and O in position 5 are new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""jumbo"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
