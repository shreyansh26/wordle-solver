We are making our first guess. There's no previous feedback, so we want a starting word that covers common letters and positions.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include a good mix of vowels and consonants. 
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common. 

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.
</think>
To make an effective first guess in Wordle, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means using:

- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoiding repeated or rare letters

After evaluating options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ROAST"", I selected **CRANE** because:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) + common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers frequent letters: E (appears in ~46% of words), A (~43%), R (~38%)
- No repeated letters
- Tests multiple positions with high-frequency letters

This starting word balances vowel/consonant coverage and positions likely to yield useful feedback.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We know:
- The word is 5 letters, ending with E: _ _ _ _ E
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Common letters to try: We can try to include other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.)

We also note that the first four letters of the secret word do not include E (because if E were in an earlier position, it would have been marked as present but in the wrong position, but in our first guess, only the last E was correct). However, it's possible that there is another E? But the feedback only showed one E and it was correct. But note: the feedback for the first guess only marked the last E as correct. The other letters were absent. So the word has exactly one E? Not necessarily: it could have more, but in the first guess, we only had one E and it was in the correct position. The other positions were marked as absent for the letters we guessed, but if the word had an E in another position, then in our guess ""crane"", the E was only in the last position, so we wouldn't have tested E elsewhere. Therefore, we don't know if there are other E's.

But note: the feedback for the other positions (first four) were marked as x for the letters we guessed (C, R, A, N) but not for E. So if the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have an E in the last position (which is correct) and the secret word might have an E in an earlier position. However, in our guess, we didn't put E in any earlier position, so we wouldn't get feedback about an E in an earlier position. Therefore, we must consider that there might be another E.

But the feedback for the first four letters was x, meaning that the secret word does not have C, R, A, or N in those positions. It doesn't tell us about E in those positions because we didn't guess E there.

So we have to consider that the secret word might have E in an earlier position? Actually, no: because we only have one E in our guess, and it was in the correct position. If the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then in the feedback, the E in the last position would be correct (✓) and the earlier positions (where we have C, R, A, N) would be x, which they are. But we don't have any information about whether there is an E in an earlier position because we didn't guess an E there. So we must account for the possibility of multiple E's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid putting E in an earlier position in our next guess? Or we can try to test for it? Since we have 5 more guesses, we can try to get more information.

But note: we are only on the second guess. We can design a guess that tests for other common letters and also checks for E in other positions? However, we know the last letter is E, so we can only test for E in positions 1-4 by putting E in one of those positions.

But if we put E in an earlier position, then if the secret word has an E there, we get a '-' (if it's present but not in the correct position) or a '✓' (if it is in the correct position). However, we already know that the last position is E, so if we put E in an earlier position and it is present, then we know there are at least two E's.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to save a guess? But that might be risky because we don't know if there are multiple E's.

Given that we have 5 guesses left, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat E and then if we get no E in the feedback, we can assume there is only one E (at the end). But if we use a word without E in the other positions, we won't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in an earlier position to test? But note: we cannot put E in the last position again? Actually, we can, because the last position is fixed as E. So we must have the last letter as E. Therefore, if we put E in an earlier position, then we are testing for multiple E's.

But we are forced to have the last letter as E. So our next guess must end with E.

We can choose a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position? For example, a word like ""SPEED"" but that has two E's? But we don't know if the word has E in the first four positions.

But note: we are limited by the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

Let me think of common words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.

Some ideas:
- Words ending with E: many options.

We want to test other common vowels and consonants.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that includes S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Also, we want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: ""SLATE"" -> but contains A? A is absent, so we cannot use A. We know A is absent.

So we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Therefore, we cannot use A.

Option 2: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E. Ends with E, and doesn't contain C, R, A, N.

Option 3: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E. Also good.

Option 4: ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E.

Option 5: ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

We also note that we are testing for the possibility of E in other positions? Actually, in these words, we are not putting E in an earlier position. They all have E only at the end.

But if we want to test for E in other positions, we could choose a word that has E in an earlier position, such as ""SPEED"" (but that has two E's: one at the end and one in position 3). However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and we know the last E is correct. If we use ""SPEED"", then the first E (if present in the secret word in an earlier position) would be marked.

But note: ""SPEED"" has two E's. The last E is fixed and will be correct. The E in position 3: if the secret word has an E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for that E? But wait, the secret word ends with E, so if it has an E in position 3, then we would get:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S? 
- Position 2: P -> ?
- Position 3: E -> if the secret word has E in position 3, then it would be ✓ because it's the correct letter and position.
- Position 4: E -> but the secret word has the last letter as E, so position 4 is not E? The secret word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So if we put E in position 4, then if the secret word has E in position 4, it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere? But we already have E in position 5.

But note: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E in position 3 and 4 would be incorrect. Specifically, if we guess ""SPEED"", then:
- Position 5: E is correct (✓)
- Position 3: E would be marked as absent (x) if there is no other E? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word, it's 'x'. But if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 and 4 are not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one E, which is at the end. So the E in position 3 and 4 are not present? Then they would be marked as 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, then one of them is at the end, and the other could be in position 3 or 4? Then we would get a '-' for the E in the position where it is present but not at the end? For example, if the secret word is ""SPEED"", then we get all correct. But if the secret word is ""STEED"", then for ""SPEED"": 
- S: if in position 1? 
- P: not in STEED? 
- E: in position 3: STEED has E in position 3? STEED: S, T, E, E, D -> wait, no: STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:D? But we know the secret word ends with E, so it must be ...E at the end. So STEED ends with D? No, STEED ends with D? Actually, STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position. Example: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E. But we cannot use E in position 1 because we don't know if it's present? And we are avoiding C, R, A, N.

But ""ELITE"" has E at the beginning and the end. So if we use ""ELITE"", then:
- Position 1: E -> if the secret word has E at position 1, then ✓. Otherwise, if E is only at the end, then we get '-' for position 1? Because the E is present but in the wrong position? But wait, if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E at position 1 is not present? So it would be 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, one at the end and one at the beginning, then we get ✓ for both? Or if one at the end and one elsewhere, then we get a '-' for the E in position 1 if it is present but not at position 1.

This is getting complicated. Since we are only on the second guess, it might be better to avoid using E again in an earlier position and instead test other vowels and consonants. Then, if we don't find the word, we can test for multiple E's later.

So I will choose a word that ends with E and does not contain E in the first four positions, and avoids C, R, A, N.

We can try to cover common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words: 
- ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> tests P, O, I, S (and E at the end, which we know is correct). 
- ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S.
- ""GUISE"": G, U, I, S, E -> tests G, U, I, S.
- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> tests T, H, Y, M.

Which one is best? We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words: E (we already know one), S, T, L, I, O, etc.

We haven't tested S, T, L, I, O, etc.

""POISE"" has S and I and O. ""MOUSE"" has S, O, U. ""THYME"" has T, H, Y, M.

I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it includes S (very common), O, and I (vowels). Also, P is common.

Alternatively, ""SLIME"" but we cannot use L? We can use L, but ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we don't know about L. However, we must avoid A, which is absent. ""SLIME"" does not contain A, C, R, N. So it's valid.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""POISE"" is a solid choice because it tests three new vowels (O, I) and a common consonant (S, P).

So I'll go with ""POISE"".

But note: we are not testing T, which is very common. Maybe we can choose a word with T? Such as ""TOISE""? Not a word. Or ""QUITE""? But Q is less common. ""TIMES""? But ends with S, not E. We need to end with E.

""TIMES"" ends with S, not E. We need a word ending with E.

""THOSE"" -> but contains O and S and T, but also H. However, ""THOSE"" ends with E and has T, H, O, S. But we must avoid A? It doesn't have A. But we don't know about O, S, T, H.

But ""THOSE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" -> ends with E, has S, T, O, L, E. But we are avoiding? It doesn't have C, R, A, N. So it's okay.

But note: we are testing E again? In ""STOLE"", we have E at the end (which we know) and no other E. So we are testing S, T, O, L.

""STOLE"" is a good word because it tests S, T, O, L, which are very common.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

I think ""STOLE"" is a better choice because it tests more common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).

But wait: we are on the second guess, and we want to maximize information. The letters S, T, L are among the most common.

So I choose ""STOLE"".

But we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" has none of these.

Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the first four letters are not C, R, A, N. So we are safe.

So the next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: 
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5 (which we know is correct)

We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

If we get:
- S: ✓ or - or x
- T: similarly
- O: similarly
- L: similarly

And E is fixed as ✓.

This will give us good information.

So I'll go with ""STOLE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E correct and in position 5), the secret word must:
- End with ""E"" (since E is confirmed in position 5).
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, and N (as they are absent).
- Potentially include other common vowels (like I, O, U) or consonants (like S, T, L, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.

For the second guess, I chose **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with ""E"", respecting the confirmed position.
- It avoids the absent letters (C, R, A, N).
- It tests new high-frequency letters: S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), and L (position 4), which are among the most common in English words.
- This combination covers multiple common consonants and a vowel, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>stole</guess>",stole,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We know:
- The word is 5 letters, ending with E: _ _ _ _ E
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N

Common letters to try: We can try to include other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.)

So if the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have an E in the last position (which is correct) and the secret word might have an E in an earlier position. However, in our guess, we didn't put E in any earlier position, so we wouldn't get feedback about an E in an earlier position. Therefore, we must consider that there might be another E.

Option 3: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E. Also good.

Option 4: ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E.

Option 5: ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

We also note that we are testing for the possibility of E in other positions? Actually, in these words, we are not putting E in an earlier position. They all have E only at the end.

But if we want to test for E in other positions, we could choose a word that has E in an earlier position, such as ""SPEED"" (but that has two E's: one at the end and one in position 3). However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and we know the last E is correct. If we use ""SPEED"", then the first E (if present in the secret word in an earlier position) would be marked.

But note: ""SPEED"" has two E's. The last E is fixed and will be correct. The E in position 3: if the secret word has an E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for that E? But wait, the secret word ends with E, so if it has an E in position 3, then we would get:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S? 
- Position 2: P -> ?
- Position 3: E -> if the secret word has E in position 3, then it would be ✓ because it's the correct letter and position.
- Position 4: E -> but the secret word has the last letter as E, so position 4 is not E? The secret word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So if we put E in position 4, then if the secret word has E in position 4, it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere? But we already have E in position 5.

But note: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E in position 3 and 4 would be incorrect. Specifically, if we guess ""SPEED"", then:
- Position 5: E is correct (✓)
- Position 3: E would be marked as absent (x) if there is no other E? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word, it's 'x'. But if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 and 4 are not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one E, which is at the end. So the E in position 3 and 4 are not present? Then they would be marked as 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, then one of them is at the end, and the other could be in position 3 or 4? Then we would get a '-' for the E in the position where it is present but not at the end? For example, if the secret word is ""SPEED"", then we get all correct. But if the secret word is ""STEED"", then for ""SPEED"": 
- S: if in position 1? 
- P: not in STEED? 
- E: in position 3: STEED has E in position 3? STEED: S, T, E, E, D -> wait, no: STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:D? But we know the secret word ends with E, so it must be ...E at the end. So STEED ends with D? No, STEED ends with D? Actually, STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position. Example: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E. But we cannot use E in position 1 because we don't know if it's present? And we are avoiding C, R, A, N.

But ""ELITE"" has E at the beginning and the end. So if we use ""ELITE"", then:
- Position 1: E -> if the secret word has E at position 1, then ✓. Otherwise, if E is only at the end, then we get '-' for position 1? Because the E is present but in the wrong position? But wait, if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E at position 1 is not present? So it would be 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, one at the end and one at the beginning, then we get ✓ for both? Or if one at the end and one elsewhere, then we get a '-' for the E in position 1 if it is present but not at position 1.

This is getting complicated. Since we are only on the second guess, it might be better to avoid using E again in an earlier position and instead test other vowels and consonants. Then, if we don't find the word, we can test for multiple E's later.

So I will choose a word that ends with E and does not contain E in the first four positions, and avoids C, R, A, N.

We can try to cover common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words: 
- ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> tests P, O, I, S (and E at the end, which we know is correct). 
- ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S.
- ""GUISE"": G, U, I, S, E -> tests G, U, I, S.
- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> tests T, H, Y, M.

Which one is best? We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words: E (we already know one), S, T, L, I, O, etc.

We haven't tested S, T, L, I, O, etc.

""POISE"" has S and I and O. ""MOUSE"" has S, O, U. ""THYME"" has T, H, Y, M.

I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it includes S (very common), O, and I (vowels). Also, P is common.

Alternatively, ""SLIME"" but we cannot use L? We can use L, but ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we don't know about L. However, we must avoid A, which is absent. ""SLIME"" does not contain A, C, R, N. So it's valid.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""POISE"" is a solid choice because it tests three new vowels (O, I) and a common consonant (S, P).

So I'll go with ""POISE"".

But note: we are not testing T, which is very common. Maybe we can choose a word with T? Such as ""TOISE""? Not a word. Or ""QUITE""? But Q is less common. ""TIMES""? But ends with S, not E. We need to end with E.

""TIMES"" ends with S, not E. We need a word ending with E.

""THOSE"" -> but contains O and S and T, but also H. However, ""THOSE"" ends with E and has T, H, O, S. But we must avoid A? It doesn't have A. But we don't know about O, S, T, H.

But ""THOSE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" -> ends with E, has S, T, O, L, E. But we are avoiding? It doesn't have C, R, A, N. So it's okay.

But note: we are testing E again? In ""STOLE"", we have E at the end (which we know) and no other E. So we are testing S, T, O, L.

""STOLE"" is a good word because it tests S, T, O, L, which are very common.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

I think ""STOLE"" is a better choice because it tests more common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).

But wait: we are on the second guess, and we want to maximize information. The letters S, T, L are among the most common.

So I choose ""STOLE"".

But we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" has none of these.

Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the first four letters are not C, R, A, N. So we are safe.

So the next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: 
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5 (which we know is correct)

We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

If we get:
- S: ✓ or - or x
- T: similarly
- O: similarly
- L: similarly

And E is fixed as ✓.

This will give us good information.

So I'll go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E correct and in position 5), the secret word must:
- End with ""E"" (since E is confirmed in position 5).
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, and N (as they are absent).
- Potentially include other common vowels (like I, O, U) or consonants (like S, T, L, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.

For the second guess, I chose **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with ""E"", respecting the confirmed position.
- It avoids the absent letters (C, R, A, N).
- It tests new high-frequency letters: S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), and L (position 4), which are among the most common in English words.
- This combination covers multiple common consonants and a vowel, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.",Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. There's no previous feedback, so we want a starting word that covers common letters and positions.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include a good mix of vowels and consonants. 
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common. 

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.To make an effective first guess in Wordle, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means using:

- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoiding repeated or rare letters

After evaluating options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ROAST"", I selected **CRANE** because:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) + common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers frequent letters: E (appears in ~46% of words), A (~43%), R (~38%)
- No repeated letters
- Tests multiple positions with high-frequency letters

This starting word balances vowel/consonant coverage and positions likely to yield useful feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We know:
- The word is 5 letters, ending with E: _ _ _ _ E
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Common letters to try: We can try to include other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.)

We also note that the first four letters of the secret word do not include E (because if E were in an earlier position, it would have been marked as present but in the wrong position, but in our first guess, only the last E was correct). However, it's possible that there is another E? But the feedback only showed one E and it was correct. But note: the feedback for the first guess only marked the last E as correct. The other letters were absent. So the word has exactly one E? Not necessarily: it could have more, but in the first guess, we only had one E and it was in the correct position. The other positions were marked as absent for the letters we guessed, but if the word had an E in another position, then in our guess ""crane"", the E was only in the last position, so we wouldn't have tested E elsewhere. Therefore, we don't know if there are other E's.

But note: the feedback for the other positions (first four) were marked as x for the letters we guessed (C, R, A, N) but not for E. So if the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have an E in the last position (which is correct) and the secret word might have an E in an earlier position. However, in our guess, we didn't put E in any earlier position, so we wouldn't get feedback about an E in an earlier position. Therefore, we must consider that there might be another E.

But the feedback for the first four letters was x, meaning that the secret word does not have C, R, A, or N in those positions. It doesn't tell us about E in those positions because we didn't guess E there.

So we have to consider that the secret word might have E in an earlier position? Actually, no: because we only have one E in our guess, and it was in the correct position. If the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then in the feedback, the E in the last position would be correct (✓) and the earlier positions (where we have C, R, A, N) would be x, which they are. But we don't have any information about whether there is an E in an earlier position because we didn't guess an E there. So we must account for the possibility of multiple E's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid putting E in an earlier position in our next guess? Or we can try to test for it? Since we have 5 more guesses, we can try to get more information.

But note: we are only on the second guess. We can design a guess that tests for other common letters and also checks for E in other positions? However, we know the last letter is E, so we can only test for E in positions 1-4 by putting E in one of those positions.

But if we put E in an earlier position, then if the secret word has an E there, we get a '-' (if it's present but not in the correct position) or a '✓' (if it is in the correct position). However, we already know that the last position is E, so if we put E in an earlier position and it is present, then we know there are at least two E's.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to save a guess? But that might be risky because we don't know if there are multiple E's.

Given that we have 5 guesses left, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat E and then if we get no E in the feedback, we can assume there is only one E (at the end). But if we use a word without E in the other positions, we won't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in an earlier position to test? But note: we cannot put E in the last position again? Actually, we can, because the last position is fixed as E. So we must have the last letter as E. Therefore, if we put E in an earlier position, then we are testing for multiple E's.

But we are forced to have the last letter as E. So our next guess must end with E.

We can choose a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position? For example, a word like ""SPEED"" but that has two E's? But we don't know if the word has E in the first four positions.

But note: we are limited by the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

Let me think of common words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.

Some ideas:
- Words ending with E: many options.

We want to test other common vowels and consonants.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that includes S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Also, we want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: ""SLATE"" -> but contains A? A is absent, so we cannot use A. We know A is absent.

So we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Therefore, we cannot use A.

Option 2: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E. Ends with E, and doesn't contain C, R, A, N.

Option 3: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E. Also good.

Option 4: ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E.

Option 5: ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

We also note that we are testing for the possibility of E in other positions? Actually, in these words, we are not putting E in an earlier position. They all have E only at the end.

But if we want to test for E in other positions, we could choose a word that has E in an earlier position, such as ""SPEED"" (but that has two E's: one at the end and one in position 3). However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and we know the last E is correct. If we use ""SPEED"", then the first E (if present in the secret word in an earlier position) would be marked.

But note: ""SPEED"" has two E's. The last E is fixed and will be correct. The E in position 3: if the secret word has an E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for that E? But wait, the secret word ends with E, so if it has an E in position 3, then we would get:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S? 
- Position 2: P -> ?
- Position 3: E -> if the secret word has E in position 3, then it would be ✓ because it's the correct letter and position.
- Position 4: E -> but the secret word has the last letter as E, so position 4 is not E? The secret word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So if we put E in position 4, then if the secret word has E in position 4, it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere? But we already have E in position 5.

But note: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E in position 3 and 4 would be incorrect. Specifically, if we guess ""SPEED"", then:
- Position 5: E is correct (✓)
- Position 3: E would be marked as absent (x) if there is no other E? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word, it's 'x'. But if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 and 4 are not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one E, which is at the end. So the E in position 3 and 4 are not present? Then they would be marked as 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, then one of them is at the end, and the other could be in position 3 or 4? Then we would get a '-' for the E in the position where it is present but not at the end? For example, if the secret word is ""SPEED"", then we get all correct. But if the secret word is ""STEED"", then for ""SPEED"": 
- S: if in position 1? 
- P: not in STEED? 
- E: in position 3: STEED has E in position 3? STEED: S, T, E, E, D -> wait, no: STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:D? But we know the secret word ends with E, so it must be ...E at the end. So STEED ends with D? No, STEED ends with D? Actually, STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position. Example: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E. But we cannot use E in position 1 because we don't know if it's present? And we are avoiding C, R, A, N.

But ""ELITE"" has E at the beginning and the end. So if we use ""ELITE"", then:
- Position 1: E -> if the secret word has E at position 1, then ✓. Otherwise, if E is only at the end, then we get '-' for position 1? Because the E is present but in the wrong position? But wait, if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E at position 1 is not present? So it would be 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, one at the end and one at the beginning, then we get ✓ for both? Or if one at the end and one elsewhere, then we get a '-' for the E in position 1 if it is present but not at position 1.

This is getting complicated. Since we are only on the second guess, it might be better to avoid using E again in an earlier position and instead test other vowels and consonants. Then, if we don't find the word, we can test for multiple E's later.

So I will choose a word that ends with E and does not contain E in the first four positions, and avoids C, R, A, N.

We can try to cover common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words: 
- ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> tests P, O, I, S (and E at the end, which we know is correct). 
- ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S.
- ""GUISE"": G, U, I, S, E -> tests G, U, I, S.
- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> tests T, H, Y, M.

Which one is best? We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words: E (we already know one), S, T, L, I, O, etc.

We haven't tested S, T, L, I, O, etc.

""POISE"" has S and I and O. ""MOUSE"" has S, O, U. ""THYME"" has T, H, Y, M.

I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it includes S (very common), O, and I (vowels). Also, P is common.

Alternatively, ""SLIME"" but we cannot use L? We can use L, but ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we don't know about L. However, we must avoid A, which is absent. ""SLIME"" does not contain A, C, R, N. So it's valid.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""POISE"" is a solid choice because it tests three new vowels (O, I) and a common consonant (S, P).

So I'll go with ""POISE"".

But note: we are not testing T, which is very common. Maybe we can choose a word with T? Such as ""TOISE""? Not a word. Or ""QUITE""? But Q is less common. ""TIMES""? But ends with S, not E. We need to end with E.

""TIMES"" ends with S, not E. We need a word ending with E.

""THOSE"" -> but contains O and S and T, but also H. However, ""THOSE"" ends with E and has T, H, O, S. But we must avoid A? It doesn't have A. But we don't know about O, S, T, H.

But ""THOSE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" -> ends with E, has S, T, O, L, E. But we are avoiding? It doesn't have C, R, A, N. So it's okay.

But note: we are testing E again? In ""STOLE"", we have E at the end (which we know) and no other E. So we are testing S, T, O, L.

""STOLE"" is a good word because it tests S, T, O, L, which are very common.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

I think ""STOLE"" is a better choice because it tests more common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).

But wait: we are on the second guess, and we want to maximize information. The letters S, T, L are among the most common.

So I choose ""STOLE"".

But we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" has none of these.

Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the first four letters are not C, R, A, N. So we are safe.

So the next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: 
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5 (which we know is correct)

We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

If we get:
- S: ✓ or - or x
- T: similarly
- O: similarly
- L: similarly

And E is fixed as ✓.

This will give us good information.

So I'll go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E correct and in position 5), the secret word must:
- End with ""E"" (since E is confirmed in position 5).
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, and N (as they are absent).
- Potentially include other common vowels (like I, O, U) or consonants (like S, T, L, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.

For the second guess, I chose **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with ""E"", respecting the confirmed position.
- It avoids the absent letters (C, R, A, N).
- It tests new high-frequency letters: S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), and L (position 4), which are among the most common in English words.
- This combination covers multiple common consonants and a vowel, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

However, it\'s possible that there is another E? But the feedback only showed one E and it was correct. But note: the feedback for the first guess only marked the last E as correct. The other letters were absent. So the word has exactly one E? Not necessarily: it could have more, but in the first guess, we only had one E and it was in the correct position. The other positions were marked as absent for the letters we guessed, but if the word had an E in another position, then in our guess ""crane"", the E was only in the last position, so we wouldn\'t have tested E elsewhere. Therefore, we don\'t know if there are other E\'s.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the other positions (first four) were marked as x for the letters we guessed (C, R, A, N) but not for E. So if the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have an E in the last position (which is correct) and the secret word might have an E in an earlier position. However, in our guess, we didn\'t put E in any earlier position, so we wouldn\'t get feedback about an E in an earlier position. Therefore, we must consider that there might be another E.\n\nBut the feedback for the first four letters was x, meaning that the secret word does not have C, R, A, or N in those positions. It doesn\'t tell us about E in those positions because we didn\'t guess E there.\n\nSo we have to consider that the secret word might have E in an earlier position? Actually, no: because we only have one E in our guess, and it was in the correct position. If the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then in the feedback, the E in the last position would be correct (✓) and the earlier positions (where we have C, R, A, N) would be x, which they are. But we don\'t have any information about whether there is an E in an earlier position because we didn\'t guess an E there. So we must account for the possibility of multiple E\'s.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should avoid putting E in an earlier position in our next guess? Or we can try to test for it? Since we have 5 more guesses, we can try to get more information.\n\nBut note: we are only on the second guess. We can design a guess that tests for other common letters and also checks for E in other positions? However, we know the last letter is E, so we can only test for E in positions 1-4 by putting E in one of those positions.\n\nBut if we put E in an earlier position, then if the secret word has an E there, we get a \'-\' (if it\'s present but not in the correct position) or a \'✓\' (if it is in the correct position). However, we already know that the last position is E, so if we put E in an earlier position and it is present, then we know there are at least two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using E again to save a guess? But that might be risky because we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s.\n\nGiven that we have 5 guesses left, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t repeat E and then if we get no E in the feedback, we can assume there is only one E (at the end). But if we use a word without E in the other positions, we won\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has E in an earlier position to test? But note: we cannot put E in the last position again? Actually, we can, because the last position is fixed as E. So we must have the last letter as E. Therefore, if we put E in an earlier position, then we are testing for multiple E\'s.\n\nBut we are forced to have the last letter as E. So our next guess must end with E.\n\nWe can choose a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position? For example, a word like ""SPEED"" but that has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has E in the first four positions.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the absent letters: C, R, A, N.\n\nLet me think of common words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.\n\nSome ideas:\n- Words ending with E: many options.\n\nWe want to test other common vowels and consonants.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that includes S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nAlso, we want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: ""SLATE"" -> but contains A? A is absent, so we cannot use A. We know A is absent.\n\nSo we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use A.\n\nOption 2: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E. Ends with E, and doesn\'t contain C, R, A, N.\n\nOption 3: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E. Also good.\n\nOption 4: ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E.\n\nOption 5: ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\nWe also note that we are testing for the possibility of E in other positions? Actually, in these words, we are not putting E in an earlier position. They all have E only at the end.\n\nBut if we want to test for E in other positions, we could choose a word that has E in an earlier position, such as ""SPEED"" (but that has two E\'s: one at the end and one in position 3). However, ""SPEED"" has two E\'s and we know the last E is correct. If we use ""SPEED"", then the first E (if present in the secret word in an earlier position) would be marked.\n\nBut note: ""SPEED"" has two E\'s. The last E is fixed and will be correct. The E in position 3: if the secret word has an E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for that E? But wait, the secret word ends with E, so if it has an E in position 3, then we would get:\n- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S? \n- Position 2: P -> ?\n- Position 3: E -> if the secret word has E in position 3, then it would be ✓ because it\'s the correct letter and position.\n- Position 4: E -> but the secret word has the last letter as E, so position 4 is not E? The secret word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So if we put E in position 4, then if the secret word has E in position 4, it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere? But we already have E in position 5.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E in position 3 and 4 would be incorrect. Specifically, if we guess ""SPEED"", then:\n- Position 5: E is correct (✓)\n- Position 3: E would be marked as absent (x) if there is no other E? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s \'-\'. If it\'s not in the word, it\'s \'x\'. But if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 and 4 are not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one E, which is at the end. So the E in position 3 and 4 are not present? Then they would be marked as \'x\'. \n\nBut if the secret word has two E\'s, then one of them is at the end, and the other could be in position 3 or 4? Then we would get a \'-\' for the E in the position where it is present but not at the end? For example, if the secret word is ""SPEED"", then we get all correct. But if the secret word is ""STEED"", then for ""SPEED"": \n- S: if in position 1? \n- P: not in STEED? \n- E: in position 3: STEED has E in position 3? STEED: S, T, E, E, D -> wait, no: STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:D? But we know the secret word ends with E, so it must be ...E at the end. So STEED ends with D? No, STEED ends with D? Actually, STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position. Example: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E. But we cannot use E in position 1 because we don\'t know if it\'s present? And we are avoiding C, R, A, N.\n\nBut ""ELITE"" has E at the beginning and the end. So if we use ""ELITE"", then:\n- Position 1: E -> if the secret word has E at position 1, then ✓. Otherwise, if E is only at the end, then we get \'-\' for position 1? Because the E is present but in the wrong position? But wait, if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E at position 1 is not present? So it would be \'x\'. \n\nBut if the secret word has two E\'s, one at the end and one at the beginning, then we get ✓ for both? Or if one at the end and one elsewhere, then we get a \'-\' for the E in position 1 if it is present but not at position 1.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Since we are only on the second guess, it might be better to avoid using E again in an earlier position and instead test other vowels and consonants. Then, if we don\'t find the word, we can test for multiple E\'s later.\n\nSo I will choose a word that ends with E and does not contain E in the first four positions, and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\nWe can try to cover common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nLet me think of words: \n- ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> tests P, O, I, S (and E at the end, which we know is correct). \n- ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S.\n- ""GUISE"": G, U, I, S, E -> tests G, U, I, S.\n- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> tests T, H, Y, M.\n\nWhich one is best? We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters in 5-letter words: E (we already know one), S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n""POISE"" has S and I and O. ""MOUSE"" has S, O, U. ""THYME"" has T, H, Y, M.\n\nI think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it includes S (very common), O, and I (vowels). Also, P is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLIME"" but we cannot use L? We can use L, but ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we don\'t know about L. However, we must avoid A, which is absent. ""SLIME"" does not contain A, C, R, N. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""POISE"" is a solid choice because it tests three new vowels (O, I) and a common consonant (S, P).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""POISE"".\n\nBut note: we are not testing T, which is very common. Maybe we can choose a word with T? Such as ""TOISE""? Not a word. Or ""QUITE""? But Q is less common. ""TIMES""? But ends with S, not E. We need to end with E.\n\n""TIMES"" ends with S, not E. We need a word ending with E.\n\n""THOSE"" -> but contains O and S and T, but also H. However, ""THOSE"" ends with E and has T, H, O, S. But we must avoid A? It doesn\'t have A. But we don\'t know about O, S, T, H.\n\nBut ""THOSE"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""STOLE"" -> ends with E, has S, T, O, L, E. But we are avoiding? It doesn\'t have C, R, A, N. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we are testing E again? In ""STOLE"", we have E at the end (which we know) and no other E. So we are testing S, T, O, L.\n\n""STOLE"" is a good word because it tests S, T, O, L, which are very common.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a better choice because it tests more common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).\n\nBut wait: we are on the second guess, and we want to maximize information. The letters S, T, L are among the most common.\n\nSo I choose ""STOLE"".\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" has none of these.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the first four letters are not C, R, A, N. So we are safe.\n\nSo the next guess: ""STOLE""\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- S in position 1\n- T in position 2\n- O in position 3\n- L in position 4\n- E in position 5 (which we know is correct)\n\nWe hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.\n\nIf we get:\n- S: ✓ or - or x\n- T: similarly\n- O: similarly\n- L: similarly\n\nAnd E is fixed as ✓.\n\nThis will give us good information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E correct and in position 5), the secret word must:\n- End with ""E"" (since E is confirmed in position 5).\n- Exclude the letters C, R, A, and N (as they are absent).\n- Potentially include other common vowels (like I, O, U) or consonants (like S, T, L, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose **""STOLE""** because:\n- It ends with ""E"", respecting the confirmed position.\n- It avoids the absent letters (C, R, A, N).\n- It tests new high-frequency letters: S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), and L (position 4), which are among the most common in English words.\n- This combination covers multiple common consonants and a vowel, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This means the secret word ends with E (position 5) and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

2. Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)
   - E(✓) at position 5 is consistent with the first guess.
   - S(x) means S is not in the word at all.
   - O(x) means not in the word at all.
   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 4.

So, combining the information:

- The secret word is ? ? ? ? E.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O (from both guesses).
- Present letters that are not in the correct position: T and L. Since T is marked as present but wrong position, and similarly for L.

Important: T and L are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We know the word must contain T and L, but T cannot be in position 2 and L cannot be in position 4.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, N, S, O. We must include T and L, and we have an E at the end.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones).

The word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (fixed E).

T is in the word but not position 2 -> possible positions: 1, 3, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

Similarly, L is in the word but not position 4 -> possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

But note: we cannot have T and L in positions that conflict with the feedback.

We also know that the word must have exactly these letters: T, L, E (and two more, since T and L are two, plus E is one, so two unknown letters? Or possibly repeated letters? But we don't know). However, we have only one E confirmed at the end, but there might be more? But in the feedback from ""stole"", we only had T and L as present and wrong, and S and O absent, E correct. Since we had three absents (S, O) and one correct (E), and two presents in wrong positions (T and L).

So the secret word must contain at least: T, L, E, and two more letters? Or one more letter if repeated? For example, it might have two T's or two L's? But we don't know.

But based on the feedback, we know:

- T is present: so at least one T.
- L is present: at least one L.
- E is present at the end.

Now, we have three known letters: T, L, E. We need two more.

But they could be any letters not in the absent list.

Moreover, T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4.

Also, from the first guess, we have no constraints on repeated letters? But let's assume we try to avoid repeats for now.

Now, we need to form a word ? ? ? ? E that includes T and L, excludes C,R,A,N,S,O.

We also must not use the letters that were absent: so avoid C,R,A,N,S,O.

We can try to place T and L in the positions.

Possible placements for T: positions 1, 3, 4? However, position 4 is the fourth letter? The positions are:

Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? (cannot be T because T not in position 2)
Pos3: ?
Pos4: ? (cannot be L because L not in position 4)
Pos5: E (fixed)

So:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 4.
- L can be in 1, 2, or 3? Because the positions available: 1,2,3,4. And L cannot be in 4, so L can be in 1,2, or 3.

We have to consider possible words.

We want a word that satisfies:
- Ends in E
- Contains T and L
- Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O

And we need two more letters? Or possibly only two letters: for example, the word might be ""TITLE"" but that has T at position 1 and 4? But ""TITLE"" has T in 1 and 4? Positions: T,I,T,L,E -> no, T I T L E -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E. But we know that L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was guessed in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is not in position 4. So if the word were ""TITLE"", L is in position 4? That would be wrong position? No, but L is in position 4, but the feedback said L is not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4, which contradicts the feedback? Because the feedback says L is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, L cannot be in position 4. So ""TITLE"" is not possible.

Another example: ""LATTE"" but has A? A is absent, and also ends with E? T T E? Not really. And has A? So no.

We need words without those letters.

Let me think of words: the word must contain T and L and end with E.

Some words:
- ""TITLE"": invalid because L cannot be position 4.
- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E. But we don't know about I and H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes, I is allowed? We have not tested I.

But in ""LITHE"":
- Position 1: L -> possible? L can be in position 1 or 2 or 3.
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: E

Is T in the word? Yes, at position 3. But we know T cannot be in position 2? And here T is in position 3, which is fine? Also, L is in position 1, and L cannot be in position 4? Yes, so position 1 is allowed for L.

But we must check if ""LITHE"" contains any absent letters? It has I, T, H, E, L. We haven't tested I or H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.

So ""LITHE"" is possible.

But is L allowed in the first position? We don't know? But it is possible.

Similarly, T is in position 3.

But we don't know if I and H are in the word? But we need to guess again.

Another word: ""BELIE"" but ends with E? B E L I E -> ends with E? Yes? Positions: B, E, L, I, E. But we have E in position 2? And we are told that E is in position 5? But if the secret word has E in position 2? But in our first guess, we didn't guess any other E except at the end, so we don't know if E is elsewhere? And also, in ""stole"", we guessed O and L. Here, if we use ""BELIE"", it contains E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E. But if we put E in position 2, then if the word has E in position 2, it might be correct or present? But we want to avoid? Actually, we need to include T and L? ""BELIE"" has no T and L? It has B, E, L, I, E -> has L? Yes? But L is in position 3. And E in position 2 and 5.

But the feedback from ""stole"" tells us that T must be in the word? So if we use ""BELIE"", we have L and E, but no T? Which contradicts the requirement that T is present? So we must include T.

Therefore, our guess must include T and L.

So ""BELIE"" is invalid because it does not have T.

Another word: ""GLUTE"" ? G L U T E -> positions: G, L, U, T, E. Ends with E. Has L and T. Avoids absent letters? G,L,U,T,E: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So allowed.

Positions: 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: L -> but L in position 2: is that allowed? L can be in position 2? Because the feedback says L is not in position 4? Position 4: T? So L is in position 2? Possible? Yes.
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: T -> T in position 4? But T not in position 2? Could be in position 4? Yes.

Feedback for T: T was guessed in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position? So in this word, T is in position 4? Which is allowed? Similarly, L is in position 2? Which is an available position.

We can consider such words.

We want to choose a word that tests new common letters and helps narrow positions.

Since T and L are misplaced, and we have positions 1,2,3,4 to fill with T and L and two new letters? Plus we have E at end.

We need to cover more letters? For example, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to include common ones like H, I, D, M, etc.

But we also have to try to put T and L in a position that we have not ruled out.

We know T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4. So:

- T can be in position 1, 3, or 4? Position 4? Yes.
- L can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We don't know where they are exactly.

So our next guess should try to place T and L in different positions to test.

For example, put T in position 1 and L in position 2? Or other combinations.

We also want to test for missing letters.

Some words:

1. ""TILE "": but 5 letters? ""TILED"" but ends with D? Not E. We need E at end.
2. ""TILES"" ends with S? But S is absent? We know S is absent? From guess 2: S(x) meaning S is not in the word? So we cannot use S? So ""TILES"" has S? Invalid.
3. ""TIRED"" but ends with D? Not E, also R is absent? R is absent? So invalid.
4. ""BILGE"" ends with E? B,I,L,G,E -> has L? Position 2: I? Position 3: L? Position 4: G? Has no T? We need T? So invalid.
5. ""GUILT"" but does not end with E? Not valid.
6. ""MELT"" 4 letters? Only 4? Not 5.
7. ""TEPID"" ends with D? Not E.

So we need 5-letter word ending with E, containing T and L, not containing C,R,A,N,S,O.

Examples:

- ""TITLE"": invalid because L in position 4? But L cannot be in position 4? So not possible? Because if L were in position 4, it would be correct if secret has it? But feedback says L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4? So it can't be the secret? Because we would have feedback showing L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would be invalid? Actually for guessing, we can use it? But it would be inconsistent? Because in our new guess, we want a valid word that might be the secret? But without repeating positions? However, we are trying to find a word that could be the secret? No, we are making a guess; it doesn't have to be the secret.

But we must choose a word that uses only available letters? According to the rules, the guess must be a valid English word? And it can include letters we don't know about, but ideally we should avoid letters we know are absent? Because if we use an absent letter, it will not help? But the feedback might be messy.

Especially, we cannot use C,R,A,N,S,O because they are confirmed absent? Yes? So we should not use them? Because they will just show as absent again? But we might get feedback for other letters? However, it wastes the guess? So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.

Therefore, our guess must not include C,R,A,N,S,O.

So must use letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and we know T and L must be included.

So, possible words:

- ""TIL E"" with E? But we need two more letters? Actually, ""TILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

Perhaps:

- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E
  - Includes T and L? Yes: T at position 3, L at position 1.
  - No C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.
- ""BILGE"": B,I,L,G,E -> but no T? So invalid.
- ""GLUTE"": G,L,U,T,E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> has T and L? At position 4 and 2? Yes.
- ""F L I T E"" : ""FLITE"" is a word? Check: FLITE is an alternative spelling of FITE? Not commonly used. ""FLUTE"" but ends with E? Not E? Flute ends with E? F L U T E? Is it flute? Not, flute ends with E? Flute: F L U T E? No, flute is F-L-U-T-E? But that's 5 letters? F L U T E? That is ""FLUTE"", but often pronounced, but spelling: F-L-U-T-E? Actually, flute is typically 5 letters: F-L-U-T-E? But E at end? Yes? Positions: F, L, U, T, E? So yes.

But ""flute"" has U? And T? We need T and L? Flute has L and T? So it has L and T? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes? So ""FLUTE"" is valid? FLUTE: F,L,U,T,E.

Similarly, ""GLUTE"" as above.

Another common word: ""METAL"" but ends with L? Not E? Also no T necessarily? Metal has T? Positions: M,E,T,A,L has A absent? So no.

""TIMED"" ends with D? Not E.

""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E -> has E and T and L? But E in position 1? And when we guess, position 1 is E? Which? But from the feedback, E is only confirmed at position 5? But if we use E in position 1, then if the word has E in position 1, it might be correct or present? Also, ""ELITE"" avoids? E,L,I,T,E: has two E's? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? I is not absent? Yes.

But ""ELITE"" has E at position 1? So we would have E at position 1 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E.

In this case, for positions of T and L: L is in position 2? And T in position 4? Position 4: T? But feedback says L not in position 4? L is not in position 4? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? So position 4 is T? Which is fine? But we don't know about E at position 1? If we guess ""ELITE"", then we might get feedback about E at position 1.

But we also know T and L: T is at position 4 and L at position 2? Both are new positions.

So possible words: ""ELITE"", ""LITHE"", ""GLUTE"", ""FLUTE"", etc.

Now, which one to choose for maximum information? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ELITE"": uses E twice? Known E at end, and tests E at beginning? Also I and T,L. Letters: E, L, I, T. But we already know E and T and L? So really we are testing I? And E at position 1? And L is in position 2? But L in position 2: is that possible? Allowed.

In ""GLUTE"": tests G,U,T,L,E -> tests G and U? New letters? U is a vowel?

Similarly, ""LITHE"" tests H and I.

""FLUTE"" tests F,L,U,T,E -> F and U?

Now, which letters are more common? H, I are common. So ""LITHE"" might be good.

On the other hand, ""FLUTE"" has F which is less common.

But in ""LITHE"", we have:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: E

Feedback from ""stole"": L not in position 4? In ""LITHE"", L is in position 1? So it is possible? Similarly, T not in position 2? Here T is in position 3, which is fine? Yes.

But when we get feedback, if the letter is in the correct position, it would be ✓, etc.

We can try ""LITHE"" to test H and I.

But we have many vowels? U is also vowel? We mostly consonants except vowels E and I? Or U? 

Alternatively, ""QUOTE"" but has O? Absent? So no.

""PIET "": not word. ""PILTE"" not word.

Another word: ""WHILE"" but ends with E? W H I L E -> has L? But no T? We need T? So not? ""WHILE"" has H,I,L,E? No T.

"" THEME"": T,H,E,M,E -> has T? But has E at position 3? And E at the end? But avoids? And H and M? But ""THEME"" has T and E? But we need L? We must have L? Because feedback says L is present? So if we guess ""THEME"", it doesn't have L? Then it would show L absent? But L is in the word? So we would get conflicting feedback and lose a guess? So we cannot guess a word without L? We must include L? Similarly for T.

Therefore, we must include L and T? And E at end.

""METLE"" not word? ""METAL"" no E end? ""METTLED"" too many letters.

""TABLE"" has A and S or? A is absent and ends with E? Yes? ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but A is absent? Cannot use A.

""LAT E"" not 5? ""LATTE"" has A and ends with E? A absent? No.

So I think ""LITHE"" or ""GLUTE"" or ""ELITE"" or ""FLUTE"".

Now, let me pick one that maximizes new common letters? Since we haven't tested I or H or G or U? 

""LITHE"" tests I and H? H is decently common.

""GLUTE"" tests G and U? U common vowel.

Perhaps ""ELITE"" tests I? But uses E twice? Which might be useful? If there is a double E? But not necessarily.

But ""ELITE"" has the advantage of potentially revealing if E is in position 1? But if not, then we know E is only at the end.

Whereas ""LITHE"" doesn't test E elsewhere? But we don't care? We want to solve the word.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to be cautious about duplicated letters? But in Wordle, duplicates can happen.

Generally, we should avoid using a letter twice unless necessary? Because it complicates the feedback? But in this case, for ""ELITE"", we have two E's? We know E is at the end? And testing E at position 1? 

We could also choose ""THYME"" but that has Y? And ends with E: T,H,Y,M,E -> yes? Has T? But no L? Must have L? So not.

Similarly, ""PHLO E""? Not word.

I think ""LITHE"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new common letters: I and H? And positions L at 1 and T at 3.

But we don't know if L can be at 1 or T at 3? It is possible? 

In ""stole"", L was guessed position 4? Not position 4, that is bad? But in LITHE, L is at position 1? Which is different.

Similarly, T was at 2? Which is bad? But in LITHE, T at 3? Which is not 2.

So we can use ""LITHE"".

Similarly, ""QUITE"" has U,I? But no L? Must have L.

So I will go with ""LITHE"".

But let me confirm: L has not been tested in position 1? And T not in position 3? But we have already ruled out positions for T and L? No, we only ruled out specific positions.

Another contender: ""BELTE"" not word? ""DELTE"" not.

Perhaps ""WEL T E D"" but 6? ""WELTE"" not word.

I think ""LITHE"" is fine.

So I guess ""LITHE"".

But let's see: ""TILDE"" but has D? Ends with E? T I L D E -> yes? Has T,I,L,D,E? Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.

Positions: T at 1? L at 3? D at 4? E at 5? So ""TILDE"": T,I,L,D,E.

Possible? But T at position 1: allowed? L at position 3? And T not in position 2? Here T in position 1? L not in position 4? Here L in position 3? So yes.

But ""TILDE"" has D? Which is a common letter? ""LITHE"" has H? Which is also common.

Both are possible? But ""TILDE"" tests D? H might be less common? Or I and H? I think both are valid.

But since I suggested ""LITHE"" first? Or should I choose based on letter frequency?

Letter frequency: I is more common than D? In English? But we need to know which.

Perhaps ""LITHE"" because L is at a new position? Unlike in ""TILDE"" where T is at position 1? Which may be valid? 

All are valid.

But I'll go with ""LITHE"" because I think the the letters I and H are good to test? And it avoids duplication.

So word: ""LITHE""
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → The secret word ends with ""E"" and excludes C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**: S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓) → Confirms the secret word ends with ""E"". S and O are absent. T and L are present but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

2. **Inferred Constraints:**
   - **Secret word format**: `_ _ _ _ E`
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O (must avoid).
   - **Present letters**: T and L are confirmed to be in the word, but:
     - T cannot be in position 2.
     - L cannot be in position 4.
   - **Remaining positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (position 5 is fixed as E).
   - **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) while including T and L.

3. **New Guess Requirements:**
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in ""E"".
   - Must include T and L to respect their presence.
   - Cannot use C, R, A, N, S, O (absent letters).
   - Must test new common letters (e.g., H, I, U, D) to maximize information gain.
   - Test possible positions for T and L (T allowed in positions 1, 3, or 4; L allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3).

4. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - Considered words: ""LITHE"" (L, I, T, H, E), ""GLUTE"" (G, L, U, T, E), ""FLUTE"" (F, L, U, T, E), ""ELITE"" (E, L, I, T, E), and ""TILDE"" (T, I, L, D, E).
   - **Why ""LITHE"" stands out**:
     - Ends with ""E"", satisfying the fixed position.
     - Includes T (position 3) and L (position 1), respecting their misplaced positions from previous feedback.
     - Tests new common vowels/consonants: I (position 2) and H (position 4).
     - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O) and letters already confirmed present to avoid redundancy.
     - Positions test key hypotheses:
       - If L is in position 1 (was position 4 in ""stole"", now tested in a new position).
       - If T is in position 3 (was position 2 in ""stole"", now tested elsewhere).

5. **Expected Information Gain:**
   - Feedback will reveal if I or H are present and in which positions.
   - Will clarify if T and L are correctly placed (e.g., T in position 3 or L in position 1).
   - If all correct, solves the word; otherwise, tightens constraints for next guess.

<guess>lithe</guess>",lithe,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This means the secret word ends with E (position 5) and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

2. Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)
   - E(✓) at position 5 is consistent with the first guess.
   - S(x) means S is not in the word at all.
   - O(x) means not in the word at all.
   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 4.

So, combining the information:

- The secret word is ? ? ? ? E.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O (from both guesses).
- Present letters that are not in the correct position: T and L. Since T is marked as present but wrong position, and similarly for L.

Important: T and L are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We know the word must contain T and L, but T cannot be in position 2 and L cannot be in position 4.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, N, S, O. We must include T and L, and we have an E at the end.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones).

The word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (fixed E).

T is in the word but not position 2 -> possible positions: 1, 3, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

Similarly, L is in the word but not position 4 -> possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

But note: we cannot have T and L in positions that conflict with the feedback.

We also know that the word must have exactly these letters: T, L, E (and two more, since T and L are two, plus E is one, so two unknown letters? Or possibly repeated letters? But we don't know). However, we have only one E confirmed at the end, but there might be more? But in the feedback from ""stole"", we only had T and L as present and wrong, and S and O absent, E correct. Since we had three absents (S, O) and one correct (E), and two presents in wrong positions (T and L).

So the secret word must contain at least: T, L, E, and two more letters? Or one more letter if repeated? For example, it might have two T's or two L's? But we don't know.

But based on the feedback, we know:

- T is present: so at least one T.
- L is present: at least one L.
- E is present at the end.

Now, we have three known letters: T, L, E. We need two more.

But they could be any letters not in the absent list.

Moreover, T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4.

Also, from the first guess, we have no constraints on repeated letters? But let's assume we try to avoid repeats for now.

Now, we need to form a word ? ? ? ? E that includes T and L, excludes C,R,A,N,S,O.

We also must not use the letters that were absent: so avoid C,R,A,N,S,O.

We can try to place T and L in the positions.

Possible placements for T: positions 1, 3, 4? However, position 4 is the fourth letter? The positions are:

Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? (cannot be T because T not in position 2)
Pos3: ?
Pos4: ? (cannot be L because L not in position 4)
Pos5: E (fixed)

So:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 4.
- L can be in 1, 2, or 3? Because the positions available: 1,2,3,4. And L cannot be in 4, so L can be in 1,2, or 3.

We have to consider possible words.

We want a word that satisfies:
- Ends in E
- Contains T and L
- Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O

And we need two more letters? Or possibly only two letters: for example, the word might be ""TITLE"" but that has T at position 1 and 4? But ""TITLE"" has T in 1 and 4? Positions: T,I,T,L,E -> no, T I T L E -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E. But we know that L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was guessed in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is not in position 4. So if the word were ""TITLE"", L is in position 4? That would be wrong position? No, but L is in position 4, but the feedback said L is not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4, which contradicts the feedback? Because the feedback says L is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, L cannot be in position 4. So ""TITLE"" is not possible.

Another example: ""LATTE"" but has A? A is absent, and also ends with E? T T E? Not really. And has A? So no.

We need words without those letters.

Let me think of words: the word must contain T and L and end with E.

Some words:
- ""TITLE"": invalid because L cannot be position 4.
- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E. But we don't know about I and H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes, I is allowed? We have not tested I.

But in ""LITHE"":
- Position 1: L -> possible? L can be in position 1 or 2 or 3.
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: E

Is T in the word? Yes, at position 3. But we know T cannot be in position 2? And here T is in position 3, which is fine? Also, L is in position 1, and L cannot be in position 4? Yes, so position 1 is allowed for L.

But we must check if ""LITHE"" contains any absent letters? It has I, T, H, E, L. We haven't tested I or H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.

So ""LITHE"" is possible.

But is L allowed in the first position? We don't know? But it is possible.

Similarly, T is in position 3.

But we don't know if I and H are in the word? But we need to guess again.

Another word: ""BELIE"" but ends with E? B E L I E -> ends with E? Yes? Positions: B, E, L, I, E. But we have E in position 2? And we are told that E is in position 5? But if the secret word has E in position 2? But in our first guess, we didn't guess any other E except at the end, so we don't know if E is elsewhere? And also, in ""stole"", we guessed O and L. Here, if we use ""BELIE"", it contains E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E. But if we put E in position 2, then if the word has E in position 2, it might be correct or present? But we want to avoid? Actually, we need to include T and L? ""BELIE"" has no T and L? It has B, E, L, I, E -> has L? Yes? But L is in position 3. And E in position 2 and 5.

But the feedback from ""stole"" tells us that T must be in the word? So if we use ""BELIE"", we have L and E, but no T? Which contradicts the requirement that T is present? So we must include T.

Therefore, our guess must include T and L.

So ""BELIE"" is invalid because it does not have T.

Another word: ""GLUTE"" ? G L U T E -> positions: G, L, U, T, E. Ends with E. Has L and T. Avoids absent letters? G,L,U,T,E: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So allowed.

Positions: 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: L -> but L in position 2: is that allowed? L can be in position 2? Because the feedback says L is not in position 4? Position 4: T? So L is in position 2? Possible? Yes.
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: T -> T in position 4? But T not in position 2? Could be in position 4? Yes.

Feedback for T: T was guessed in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position? So in this word, T is in position 4? Which is allowed? Similarly, L is in position 2? Which is an available position.

We can consider such words.

We want to choose a word that tests new common letters and helps narrow positions.

Since T and L are misplaced, and we have positions 1,2,3,4 to fill with T and L and two new letters? Plus we have E at end.

We need to cover more letters? For example, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to include common ones like H, I, D, M, etc.

But we also have to try to put T and L in a position that we have not ruled out.

We know T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4. So:

- T can be in position 1, 3, or 4? Position 4? Yes.
- L can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We don't know where they are exactly.

So our next guess should try to place T and L in different positions to test.

For example, put T in position 1 and L in position 2? Or other combinations.

We also want to test for missing letters.

Some words:

1. ""TILE "": but 5 letters? ""TILED"" but ends with D? Not E. We need E at end.
2. ""TILES"" ends with S? But S is absent? We know S is absent? From guess 2: S(x) meaning S is not in the word? So we cannot use S? So ""TILES"" has S? Invalid.
3. ""TIRED"" but ends with D? Not E, also R is absent? R is absent? So invalid.
4. ""BILGE"" ends with E? B,I,L,G,E -> has L? Position 2: I? Position 3: L? Position 4: G? Has no T? We need T? So invalid.
5. ""GUILT"" but does not end with E? Not valid.
6. ""MELT"" 4 letters? Only 4? Not 5.
7. ""TEPID"" ends with D? Not E.

So we need 5-letter word ending with E, containing T and L, not containing C,R,A,N,S,O.

Examples:

- ""TITLE"": invalid because L in position 4? But L cannot be in position 4? So not possible? Because if L were in position 4, it would be correct if secret has it? But feedback says L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4? So it can't be the secret? Because we would have feedback showing L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would be invalid? Actually for guessing, we can use it? But it would be inconsistent? Because in our new guess, we want a valid word that might be the secret? But without repeating positions? However, we are trying to find a word that could be the secret? No, we are making a guess; it doesn't have to be the secret.

But we must choose a word that uses only available letters? According to the rules, the guess must be a valid English word? And it can include letters we don't know about, but ideally we should avoid letters we know are absent? Because if we use an absent letter, it will not help? But the feedback might be messy.

Especially, we cannot use C,R,A,N,S,O because they are confirmed absent? Yes? So we should not use them? Because they will just show as absent again? But we might get feedback for other letters? However, it wastes the guess? So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.

Therefore, our guess must not include C,R,A,N,S,O.

So must use letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and we know T and L must be included.

So, possible words:

- ""TIL E"" with E? But we need two more letters? Actually, ""TILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

Perhaps:

- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E
  - Includes T and L? Yes: T at position 3, L at position 1.
  - No C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.
- ""BILGE"": B,I,L,G,E -> but no T? So invalid.
- ""GLUTE"": G,L,U,T,E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> has T and L? At position 4 and 2? Yes.
- ""F L I T E"" : ""FLITE"" is a word? Check: FLITE is an alternative spelling of FITE? Not commonly used. ""FLUTE"" but ends with E? Not E? Flute ends with E? F L U T E? Is it flute? Not, flute ends with E? Flute: F L U T E? No, flute is F-L-U-T-E? But that's 5 letters? F L U T E? That is ""FLUTE"", but often pronounced, but spelling: F-L-U-T-E? Actually, flute is typically 5 letters: F-L-U-T-E? But E at end? Yes? Positions: F, L, U, T, E? So yes.

But ""flute"" has U? And T? We need T and L? Flute has L and T? So it has L and T? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes? So ""FLUTE"" is valid? FLUTE: F,L,U,T,E.

Similarly, ""GLUTE"" as above.

Another common word: ""METAL"" but ends with L? Not E? Also no T necessarily? Metal has T? Positions: M,E,T,A,L has A absent? So no.

""TIMED"" ends with D? Not E.

""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E -> has E and T and L? But E in position 1? And when we guess, position 1 is E? Which? But from the feedback, E is only confirmed at position 5? But if we use E in position 1, then if the word has E in position 1, it might be correct or present? Also, ""ELITE"" avoids? E,L,I,T,E: has two E's? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? I is not absent? Yes.

But ""ELITE"" has E at position 1? So we would have E at position 1 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E.

In this case, for positions of T and L: L is in position 2? And T in position 4? Position 4: T? But feedback says L not in position 4? L is not in position 4? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? So position 4 is T? Which is fine? But we don't know about E at position 1? If we guess ""ELITE"", then we might get feedback about E at position 1.

But we also know T and L: T is at position 4 and L at position 2? Both are new positions.

So possible words: ""ELITE"", ""LITHE"", ""GLUTE"", ""FLUTE"", etc.

Now, which one to choose for maximum information? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ELITE"": uses E twice? Known E at end, and tests E at beginning? Also I and T,L. Letters: E, L, I, T. But we already know E and T and L? So really we are testing I? And E at position 1? And L is in position 2? But L in position 2: is that possible? Allowed.

In ""GLUTE"": tests G,U,T,L,E -> tests G and U? New letters? U is a vowel?

Similarly, ""LITHE"" tests H and I.

""FLUTE"" tests F,L,U,T,E -> F and U?

Now, which letters are more common? H, I are common. So ""LITHE"" might be good.

On the other hand, ""FLUTE"" has F which is less common.

But in ""LITHE"", we have:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: E

Feedback from ""stole"": L not in position 4? In ""LITHE"", L is in position 1? So it is possible? Similarly, T not in position 2? Here T is in position 3, which is fine? Yes.

But when we get feedback, if the letter is in the correct position, it would be ✓, etc.

We can try ""LITHE"" to test H and I.

But we have many vowels? U is also vowel? We mostly consonants except vowels E and I? Or U? 

Alternatively, ""QUOTE"" but has O? Absent? So no.

""PIET "": not word. ""PILTE"" not word.

Another word: ""WHILE"" but ends with E? W H I L E -> has L? But no T? We need T? So not? ""WHILE"" has H,I,L,E? No T.

"" THEME"": T,H,E,M,E -> has T? But has E at position 3? And E at the end? But avoids? And H and M? But ""THEME"" has T and E? But we need L? We must have L? Because feedback says L is present? So if we guess ""THEME"", it doesn't have L? Then it would show L absent? But L is in the word? So we would get conflicting feedback and lose a guess? So we cannot guess a word without L? We must include L? Similarly for T.

Therefore, we must include L and T? And E at end.

""METLE"" not word? ""METAL"" no E end? ""METTLED"" too many letters.

""TABLE"" has A and S or? A is absent and ends with E? Yes? ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but A is absent? Cannot use A.

""LAT E"" not 5? ""LATTE"" has A and ends with E? A absent? No.

So I think ""LITHE"" or ""GLUTE"" or ""ELITE"" or ""FLUTE"".

Now, let me pick one that maximizes new common letters? Since we haven't tested I or H or G or U? 

""LITHE"" tests I and H? H is decently common.

""GLUTE"" tests G and U? U common vowel.

Perhaps ""ELITE"" tests I? But uses E twice? Which might be useful? If there is a double E? But not necessarily.

But ""ELITE"" has the advantage of potentially revealing if E is in position 1? But if not, then we know E is only at the end.

Whereas ""LITHE"" doesn't test E elsewhere? But we don't care? We want to solve the word.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to be cautious about duplicated letters? But in Wordle, duplicates can happen.

Generally, we should avoid using a letter twice unless necessary? Because it complicates the feedback? But in this case, for ""ELITE"", we have two E's? We know E is at the end? And testing E at position 1? 

We could also choose ""THYME"" but that has Y? And ends with E: T,H,Y,M,E -> yes? Has T? But no L? Must have L? So not.

Similarly, ""PHLO E""? Not word.

I think ""LITHE"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new common letters: I and H? And positions L at 1 and T at 3.

But we don't know if L can be at 1 or T at 3? It is possible? 

In ""stole"", L was guessed position 4? Not position 4, that is bad? But in LITHE, L is at position 1? Which is different.

Similarly, T was at 2? Which is bad? But in LITHE, T at 3? Which is not 2.

So we can use ""LITHE"".

Similarly, ""QUITE"" has U,I? But no L? Must have L.

So I will go with ""LITHE"".

But let me confirm: L has not been tested in position 1? And T not in position 3? But we have already ruled out positions for T and L? No, we only ruled out specific positions.

Another contender: ""BELTE"" not word? ""DELTE"" not.

Perhaps ""WEL T E D"" but 6? ""WELTE"" not word.

I think ""LITHE"" is fine.

So I guess ""LITHE"".

But let's see: ""TILDE"" but has D? Ends with E? T I L D E -> yes? Has T,I,L,D,E? Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.

Positions: T at 1? L at 3? D at 4? E at 5? So ""TILDE"": T,I,L,D,E.

Possible? But T at position 1: allowed? L at position 3? And T not in position 2? Here T in position 1? L not in position 4? Here L in position 3? So yes.

But ""TILDE"" has D? Which is a common letter? ""LITHE"" has H? Which is also common.

Both are possible? But ""TILDE"" tests D? H might be less common? Or I and H? I think both are valid.

But since I suggested ""LITHE"" first? Or should I choose based on letter frequency?

Letter frequency: I is more common than D? In English? But we need to know which.

Perhaps ""LITHE"" because L is at a new position? Unlike in ""TILDE"" where T is at position 1? Which may be valid? 

All are valid.

But I'll go with ""LITHE"" because I think the the letters I and H are good to test? And it avoids duplication.

So word: ""LITHE""### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → The secret word ends with ""E"" and excludes C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**: S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓) → Confirms the secret word ends with ""E"". S and O are absent. T and L are present but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

2. **Inferred Constraints:**
   - **Secret word format**: `_ _ _ _ E`
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O (must avoid).
   - **Present letters**: T and L are confirmed to be in the word, but:
     - T cannot be in position 2.
     - L cannot be in position 4.
   - **Remaining positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (position 5 is fixed as E).
   - **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) while including T and L.

3. **New Guess Requirements:**
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in ""E"".
   - Must include T and L to respect their presence.
   - Cannot use C, R, A, N, S, O (absent letters).
   - Must test new common letters (e.g., H, I, U, D) to maximize information gain.
   - Test possible positions for T and L (T allowed in positions 1, 3, or 4; L allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3).

4. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - Considered words: ""LITHE"" (L, I, T, H, E), ""GLUTE"" (G, L, U, T, E), ""FLUTE"" (F, L, U, T, E), ""ELITE"" (E, L, I, T, E), and ""TILDE"" (T, I, L, D, E).
   - **Why ""LITHE"" stands out**:
     - Ends with ""E"", satisfying the fixed position.
     - Includes T (position 3) and L (position 1), respecting their misplaced positions from previous feedback.
     - Tests new common vowels/consonants: I (position 2) and H (position 4).
     - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O) and letters already confirmed present to avoid redundancy.
     - Positions test key hypotheses:
       - If L is in position 1 (was position 4 in ""stole"", now tested in a new position).
       - If T is in position 3 (was position 2 in ""stole"", now tested elsewhere).

5. **Expected Information Gain:**
   - Feedback will reveal if I or H are present and in which positions.
   - Will clarify if T and L are correctly placed (e.g., T in position 3 or L in position 1).
   - If all correct, solves the word; otherwise, tightens constraints for next guess.",Guess 3: lithe -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) T(-) H(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. There's no previous feedback, so we want a starting word that covers common letters and positions.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include a good mix of vowels and consonants. 
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common. 

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.To make an effective first guess in Wordle, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means using:

- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoiding repeated or rare letters

After evaluating options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ROAST"", I selected **CRANE** because:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) + common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers frequent letters: E (appears in ~46% of words), A (~43%), R (~38%)
- No repeated letters
- Tests multiple positions with high-frequency letters

This starting word balances vowel/consonant coverage and positions likely to yield useful feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We know:
- The word is 5 letters, ending with E: _ _ _ _ E
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Common letters to try: We can try to include other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.)

We also note that the first four letters of the secret word do not include E (because if E were in an earlier position, it would have been marked as present but in the wrong position, but in our first guess, only the last E was correct). However, it's possible that there is another E? But the feedback only showed one E and it was correct. But note: the feedback for the first guess only marked the last E as correct. The other letters were absent. So the word has exactly one E? Not necessarily: it could have more, but in the first guess, we only had one E and it was in the correct position. The other positions were marked as absent for the letters we guessed, but if the word had an E in another position, then in our guess ""crane"", the E was only in the last position, so we wouldn't have tested E elsewhere. Therefore, we don't know if there are other E's.

But note: the feedback for the other positions (first four) were marked as x for the letters we guessed (C, R, A, N) but not for E. So if the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have an E in the last position (which is correct) and the secret word might have an E in an earlier position. However, in our guess, we didn't put E in any earlier position, so we wouldn't get feedback about an E in an earlier position. Therefore, we must consider that there might be another E.

But the feedback for the first four letters was x, meaning that the secret word does not have C, R, A, or N in those positions. It doesn't tell us about E in those positions because we didn't guess E there.

So we have to consider that the secret word might have E in an earlier position? Actually, no: because we only have one E in our guess, and it was in the correct position. If the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then in the feedback, the E in the last position would be correct (✓) and the earlier positions (where we have C, R, A, N) would be x, which they are. But we don't have any information about whether there is an E in an earlier position because we didn't guess an E there. So we must account for the possibility of multiple E's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid putting E in an earlier position in our next guess? Or we can try to test for it? Since we have 5 more guesses, we can try to get more information.

But note: we are only on the second guess. We can design a guess that tests for other common letters and also checks for E in other positions? However, we know the last letter is E, so we can only test for E in positions 1-4 by putting E in one of those positions.

But if we put E in an earlier position, then if the secret word has an E there, we get a '-' (if it's present but not in the correct position) or a '✓' (if it is in the correct position). However, we already know that the last position is E, so if we put E in an earlier position and it is present, then we know there are at least two E's.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to save a guess? But that might be risky because we don't know if there are multiple E's.

Given that we have 5 guesses left, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat E and then if we get no E in the feedback, we can assume there is only one E (at the end). But if we use a word without E in the other positions, we won't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in an earlier position to test? But note: we cannot put E in the last position again? Actually, we can, because the last position is fixed as E. So we must have the last letter as E. Therefore, if we put E in an earlier position, then we are testing for multiple E's.

But we are forced to have the last letter as E. So our next guess must end with E.

We can choose a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position? For example, a word like ""SPEED"" but that has two E's? But we don't know if the word has E in the first four positions.

But note: we are limited by the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

Let me think of common words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.

Some ideas:
- Words ending with E: many options.

We want to test other common vowels and consonants.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that includes S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Also, we want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: ""SLATE"" -> but contains A? A is absent, so we cannot use A. We know A is absent.

So we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Therefore, we cannot use A.

Option 2: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E. Ends with E, and doesn't contain C, R, A, N.

Option 3: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E. Also good.

Option 4: ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E.

Option 5: ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

We also note that we are testing for the possibility of E in other positions? Actually, in these words, we are not putting E in an earlier position. They all have E only at the end.

But if we want to test for E in other positions, we could choose a word that has E in an earlier position, such as ""SPEED"" (but that has two E's: one at the end and one in position 3). However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and we know the last E is correct. If we use ""SPEED"", then the first E (if present in the secret word in an earlier position) would be marked.

But note: ""SPEED"" has two E's. The last E is fixed and will be correct. The E in position 3: if the secret word has an E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for that E? But wait, the secret word ends with E, so if it has an E in position 3, then we would get:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S? 
- Position 2: P -> ?
- Position 3: E -> if the secret word has E in position 3, then it would be ✓ because it's the correct letter and position.
- Position 4: E -> but the secret word has the last letter as E, so position 4 is not E? The secret word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So if we put E in position 4, then if the secret word has E in position 4, it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere? But we already have E in position 5.

But note: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E in position 3 and 4 would be incorrect. Specifically, if we guess ""SPEED"", then:
- Position 5: E is correct (✓)
- Position 3: E would be marked as absent (x) if there is no other E? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word, it's 'x'. But if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 and 4 are not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one E, which is at the end. So the E in position 3 and 4 are not present? Then they would be marked as 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, then one of them is at the end, and the other could be in position 3 or 4? Then we would get a '-' for the E in the position where it is present but not at the end? For example, if the secret word is ""SPEED"", then we get all correct. But if the secret word is ""STEED"", then for ""SPEED"": 
- S: if in position 1? 
- P: not in STEED? 
- E: in position 3: STEED has E in position 3? STEED: S, T, E, E, D -> wait, no: STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:D? But we know the secret word ends with E, so it must be ...E at the end. So STEED ends with D? No, STEED ends with D? Actually, STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position. Example: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E. But we cannot use E in position 1 because we don't know if it's present? And we are avoiding C, R, A, N.

But ""ELITE"" has E at the beginning and the end. So if we use ""ELITE"", then:
- Position 1: E -> if the secret word has E at position 1, then ✓. Otherwise, if E is only at the end, then we get '-' for position 1? Because the E is present but in the wrong position? But wait, if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E at position 1 is not present? So it would be 'x'. 

But if the secret word has two E's, one at the end and one at the beginning, then we get ✓ for both? Or if one at the end and one elsewhere, then we get a '-' for the E in position 1 if it is present but not at position 1.

This is getting complicated. Since we are only on the second guess, it might be better to avoid using E again in an earlier position and instead test other vowels and consonants. Then, if we don't find the word, we can test for multiple E's later.

So I will choose a word that ends with E and does not contain E in the first four positions, and avoids C, R, A, N.

We can try to cover common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words: 
- ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> tests P, O, I, S (and E at the end, which we know is correct). 
- ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S.
- ""GUISE"": G, U, I, S, E -> tests G, U, I, S.
- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> tests T, H, Y, M.

Which one is best? We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words: E (we already know one), S, T, L, I, O, etc.

We haven't tested S, T, L, I, O, etc.

""POISE"" has S and I and O. ""MOUSE"" has S, O, U. ""THYME"" has T, H, Y, M.

I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it includes S (very common), O, and I (vowels). Also, P is common.

Alternatively, ""SLIME"" but we cannot use L? We can use L, but ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we don't know about L. However, we must avoid A, which is absent. ""SLIME"" does not contain A, C, R, N. So it's valid.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""POISE"" is a solid choice because it tests three new vowels (O, I) and a common consonant (S, P).

So I'll go with ""POISE"".

But note: we are not testing T, which is very common. Maybe we can choose a word with T? Such as ""TOISE""? Not a word. Or ""QUITE""? But Q is less common. ""TIMES""? But ends with S, not E. We need to end with E.

""TIMES"" ends with S, not E. We need a word ending with E.

""THOSE"" -> but contains O and S and T, but also H. However, ""THOSE"" ends with E and has T, H, O, S. But we must avoid A? It doesn't have A. But we don't know about O, S, T, H.

But ""THOSE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" -> ends with E, has S, T, O, L, E. But we are avoiding? It doesn't have C, R, A, N. So it's okay.

But note: we are testing E again? In ""STOLE"", we have E at the end (which we know) and no other E. So we are testing S, T, O, L.

""STOLE"" is a good word because it tests S, T, O, L, which are very common.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

I think ""STOLE"" is a better choice because it tests more common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).

But wait: we are on the second guess, and we want to maximize information. The letters S, T, L are among the most common.

So I choose ""STOLE"".

But we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" has none of these.

Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the first four letters are not C, R, A, N. So we are safe.

So the next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: 
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5 (which we know is correct)

We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

If we get:
- S: ✓ or - or x
- T: similarly
- O: similarly
- L: similarly

And E is fixed as ✓.

This will give us good information.

So I'll go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E correct and in position 5), the secret word must:
- End with ""E"" (since E is confirmed in position 5).
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, and N (as they are absent).
- Potentially include other common vowels (like I, O, U) or consonants (like S, T, L, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.

For the second guess, I chose **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with ""E"", respecting the confirmed position.
- It avoids the absent letters (C, R, A, N).
- It tests new high-frequency letters: S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), and L (position 4), which are among the most common in English words.
- This combination covers multiple common consonants and a vowel, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This means the secret word ends with E (position 5) and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

2. Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)
   - E(✓) at position 5 is consistent with the first guess.
   - S(x) means S is not in the word at all.
   - O(x) means not in the word at all.
   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 4.

So, combining the information:

- The secret word is ? ? ? ? E.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O (from both guesses).
- Present letters that are not in the correct position: T and L. Since T is marked as present but wrong position, and similarly for L.

Important: T and L are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We know the word must contain T and L, but T cannot be in position 2 and L cannot be in position 4.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, N, S, O. We must include T and L, and we have an E at the end.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones).

The word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (fixed E).

T is in the word but not position 2 -> possible positions: 1, 3, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

Similarly, L is in the word but not position 4 -> possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

But note: we cannot have T and L in positions that conflict with the feedback.

We also know that the word must have exactly these letters: T, L, E (and two more, since T and L are two, plus E is one, so two unknown letters? Or possibly repeated letters? But we don't know). However, we have only one E confirmed at the end, but there might be more? But in the feedback from ""stole"", we only had T and L as present and wrong, and S and O absent, E correct. Since we had three absents (S, O) and one correct (E), and two presents in wrong positions (T and L).

So the secret word must contain at least: T, L, E, and two more letters? Or one more letter if repeated? For example, it might have two T's or two L's? But we don't know.

But based on the feedback, we know:

- T is present: so at least one T.
- L is present: at least one L.
- E is present at the end.

Now, we have three known letters: T, L, E. We need two more.

But they could be any letters not in the absent list.

Moreover, T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4.

Also, from the first guess, we have no constraints on repeated letters? But let's assume we try to avoid repeats for now.

Now, we need to form a word ? ? ? ? E that includes T and L, excludes C,R,A,N,S,O.

We also must not use the letters that were absent: so avoid C,R,A,N,S,O.

We can try to place T and L in the positions.

Possible placements for T: positions 1, 3, 4? However, position 4 is the fourth letter? The positions are:

Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? (cannot be T because T not in position 2)
Pos3: ?
Pos4: ? (cannot be L because L not in position 4)
Pos5: E (fixed)

So:
- T can be in 1, 3, or 4.
- L can be in 1, 2, or 3? Because the positions available: 1,2,3,4. And L cannot be in 4, so L can be in 1,2, or 3.

We have to consider possible words.

We want a word that satisfies:
- Ends in E
- Contains T and L
- Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O

And we need two more letters? Or possibly only two letters: for example, the word might be ""TITLE"" but that has T at position 1 and 4? But ""TITLE"" has T in 1 and 4? Positions: T,I,T,L,E -> no, T I T L E -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E. But we know that L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was guessed in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is not in position 4. So if the word were ""TITLE"", L is in position 4? That would be wrong position? No, but L is in position 4, but the feedback said L is not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4, which contradicts the feedback? Because the feedback says L is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, L cannot be in position 4. So ""TITLE"" is not possible.

Another example: ""LATTE"" but has A? A is absent, and also ends with E? T T E? Not really. And has A? So no.

We need words without those letters.

Let me think of words: the word must contain T and L and end with E.

Some words:
- ""TITLE"": invalid because L cannot be position 4.
- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E. But we don't know about I and H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes, I is allowed? We have not tested I.

But in ""LITHE"":
- Position 1: L -> possible? L can be in position 1 or 2 or 3.
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: E

Is T in the word? Yes, at position 3. But we know T cannot be in position 2? And here T is in position 3, which is fine? Also, L is in position 1, and L cannot be in position 4? Yes, so position 1 is allowed for L.

But we must check if ""LITHE"" contains any absent letters? It has I, T, H, E, L. We haven't tested I or H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.

So ""LITHE"" is possible.

But is L allowed in the first position? We don't know? But it is possible.

Similarly, T is in position 3.

But we don't know if I and H are in the word? But we need to guess again.

Another word: ""BELIE"" but ends with E? B E L I E -> ends with E? Yes? Positions: B, E, L, I, E. But we have E in position 2? And we are told that E is in position 5? But if the secret word has E in position 2? But in our first guess, we didn't guess any other E except at the end, so we don't know if E is elsewhere? And also, in ""stole"", we guessed O and L. Here, if we use ""BELIE"", it contains E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E. But if we put E in position 2, then if the word has E in position 2, it might be correct or present? But we want to avoid? Actually, we need to include T and L? ""BELIE"" has no T and L? It has B, E, L, I, E -> has L? Yes? But L is in position 3. And E in position 2 and 5.

But the feedback from ""stole"" tells us that T must be in the word? So if we use ""BELIE"", we have L and E, but no T? Which contradicts the requirement that T is present? So we must include T.

Therefore, our guess must include T and L.

So ""BELIE"" is invalid because it does not have T.

Another word: ""GLUTE"" ? G L U T E -> positions: G, L, U, T, E. Ends with E. Has L and T. Avoids absent letters? G,L,U,T,E: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So allowed.

Positions: 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: L -> but L in position 2: is that allowed? L can be in position 2? Because the feedback says L is not in position 4? Position 4: T? So L is in position 2? Possible? Yes.
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: T -> T in position 4? But T not in position 2? Could be in position 4? Yes.

Feedback for T: T was guessed in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position? So in this word, T is in position 4? Which is allowed? Similarly, L is in position 2? Which is an available position.

We can consider such words.

We want to choose a word that tests new common letters and helps narrow positions.

Since T and L are misplaced, and we have positions 1,2,3,4 to fill with T and L and two new letters? Plus we have E at end.

We need to cover more letters? For example, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to include common ones like H, I, D, M, etc.

But we also have to try to put T and L in a position that we have not ruled out.

We know T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4. So:

- T can be in position 1, 3, or 4? Position 4? Yes.
- L can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We don't know where they are exactly.

So our next guess should try to place T and L in different positions to test.

For example, put T in position 1 and L in position 2? Or other combinations.

We also want to test for missing letters.

Some words:

1. ""TILE "": but 5 letters? ""TILED"" but ends with D? Not E. We need E at end.
2. ""TILES"" ends with S? But S is absent? We know S is absent? From guess 2: S(x) meaning S is not in the word? So we cannot use S? So ""TILES"" has S? Invalid.
3. ""TIRED"" but ends with D? Not E, also R is absent? R is absent? So invalid.
4. ""BILGE"" ends with E? B,I,L,G,E -> has L? Position 2: I? Position 3: L? Position 4: G? Has no T? We need T? So invalid.
5. ""GUILT"" but does not end with E? Not valid.
6. ""MELT"" 4 letters? Only 4? Not 5.
7. ""TEPID"" ends with D? Not E.

So we need 5-letter word ending with E, containing T and L, not containing C,R,A,N,S,O.

Examples:

- ""TITLE"": invalid because L in position 4? But L cannot be in position 4? So not possible? Because if L were in position 4, it would be correct if secret has it? But feedback says L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4? So it can't be the secret? Because we would have feedback showing L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would be invalid? Actually for guessing, we can use it? But it would be inconsistent? Because in our new guess, we want a valid word that might be the secret? But without repeating positions? However, we are trying to find a word that could be the secret? No, we are making a guess; it doesn't have to be the secret.

But we must choose a word that uses only available letters? According to the rules, the guess must be a valid English word? And it can include letters we don't know about, but ideally we should avoid letters we know are absent? Because if we use an absent letter, it will not help? But the feedback might be messy.

Especially, we cannot use C,R,A,N,S,O because they are confirmed absent? Yes? So we should not use them? Because they will just show as absent again? But we might get feedback for other letters? However, it wastes the guess? So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.

Therefore, our guess must not include C,R,A,N,S,O.

So must use letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and we know T and L must be included.

So, possible words:

- ""TIL E"" with E? But we need two more letters? Actually, ""TILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

Perhaps:

- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E
  - Includes T and L? Yes: T at position 3, L at position 1.
  - No C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.
- ""BILGE"": B,I,L,G,E -> but no T? So invalid.
- ""GLUTE"": G,L,U,T,E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> has T and L? At position 4 and 2? Yes.
- ""F L I T E"" : ""FLITE"" is a word? Check: FLITE is an alternative spelling of FITE? Not commonly used. ""FLUTE"" but ends with E? Not E? Flute ends with E? F L U T E? Is it flute? Not, flute ends with E? Flute: F L U T E? No, flute is F-L-U-T-E? But that's 5 letters? F L U T E? That is ""FLUTE"", but often pronounced, but spelling: F-L-U-T-E? Actually, flute is typically 5 letters: F-L-U-T-E? But E at end? Yes? Positions: F, L, U, T, E? So yes.

But ""flute"" has U? And T? We need T and L? Flute has L and T? So it has L and T? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes? So ""FLUTE"" is valid? FLUTE: F,L,U,T,E.

Similarly, ""GLUTE"" as above.

Another common word: ""METAL"" but ends with L? Not E? Also no T necessarily? Metal has T? Positions: M,E,T,A,L has A absent? So no.

""TIMED"" ends with D? Not E.

""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E -> has E and T and L? But E in position 1? And when we guess, position 1 is E? Which? But from the feedback, E is only confirmed at position 5? But if we use E in position 1, then if the word has E in position 1, it might be correct or present? Also, ""ELITE"" avoids? E,L,I,T,E: has two E's? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? I is not absent? Yes.

But ""ELITE"" has E at position 1? So we would have E at position 1 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E.

In this case, for positions of T and L: L is in position 2? And T in position 4? Position 4: T? But feedback says L not in position 4? L is not in position 4? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? So position 4 is T? Which is fine? But we don't know about E at position 1? If we guess ""ELITE"", then we might get feedback about E at position 1.

But we also know T and L: T is at position 4 and L at position 2? Both are new positions.

So possible words: ""ELITE"", ""LITHE"", ""GLUTE"", ""FLUTE"", etc.

Now, which one to choose for maximum information? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ELITE"": uses E twice? Known E at end, and tests E at beginning? Also I and T,L. Letters: E, L, I, T. But we already know E and T and L? So really we are testing I? And E at position 1? And L is in position 2? But L in position 2: is that possible? Allowed.

In ""GLUTE"": tests G,U,T,L,E -> tests G and U? New letters? U is a vowel?

Similarly, ""LITHE"" tests H and I.

""FLUTE"" tests F,L,U,T,E -> F and U?

Now, which letters are more common? H, I are common. So ""LITHE"" might be good.

On the other hand, ""FLUTE"" has F which is less common.

But in ""LITHE"", we have:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: E

Feedback from ""stole"": L not in position 4? In ""LITHE"", L is in position 1? So it is possible? Similarly, T not in position 2? Here T is in position 3, which is fine? Yes.

But when we get feedback, if the letter is in the correct position, it would be ✓, etc.

We can try ""LITHE"" to test H and I.

But we have many vowels? U is also vowel? We mostly consonants except vowels E and I? Or U? 

Alternatively, ""QUOTE"" but has O? Absent? So no.

""PIET "": not word. ""PILTE"" not word.

Another word: ""WHILE"" but ends with E? W H I L E -> has L? But no T? We need T? So not? ""WHILE"" has H,I,L,E? No T.

"" THEME"": T,H,E,M,E -> has T? But has E at position 3? And E at the end? But avoids? And H and M? But ""THEME"" has T and E? But we need L? We must have L? Because feedback says L is present? So if we guess ""THEME"", it doesn't have L? Then it would show L absent? But L is in the word? So we would get conflicting feedback and lose a guess? So we cannot guess a word without L? We must include L? Similarly for T.

Therefore, we must include L and T? And E at end.

""METLE"" not word? ""METAL"" no E end? ""METTLED"" too many letters.

""TABLE"" has A and S or? A is absent and ends with E? Yes? ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but A is absent? Cannot use A.

""LAT E"" not 5? ""LATTE"" has A and ends with E? A absent? No.

So I think ""LITHE"" or ""GLUTE"" or ""ELITE"" or ""FLUTE"".

Now, let me pick one that maximizes new common letters? Since we haven't tested I or H or G or U? 

""LITHE"" tests I and H? H is decently common.

""GLUTE"" tests G and U? U common vowel.

Perhaps ""ELITE"" tests I? But uses E twice? Which might be useful? If there is a double E? But not necessarily.

But ""ELITE"" has the advantage of potentially revealing if E is in position 1? But if not, then we know E is only at the end.

Whereas ""LITHE"" doesn't test E elsewhere? But we don't care? We want to solve the word.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to be cautious about duplicated letters? But in Wordle, duplicates can happen.

Generally, we should avoid using a letter twice unless necessary? Because it complicates the feedback? But in this case, for ""ELITE"", we have two E's? We know E is at the end? And testing E at position 1? 

We could also choose ""THYME"" but that has Y? And ends with E: T,H,Y,M,E -> yes? Has T? But no L? Must have L? So not.

Similarly, ""PHLO E""? Not word.

I think ""LITHE"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new common letters: I and H? And positions L at 1 and T at 3.

But we don't know if L can be at 1 or T at 3? It is possible? 

In ""stole"", L was guessed position 4? Not position 4, that is bad? But in LITHE, L is at position 1? Which is different.

Similarly, T was at 2? Which is bad? But in LITHE, T at 3? Which is not 2.

So we can use ""LITHE"".

Similarly, ""QUITE"" has U,I? But no L? Must have L.

So I will go with ""LITHE"".

But let me confirm: L has not been tested in position 1? And T not in position 3? But we have already ruled out positions for T and L? No, we only ruled out specific positions.

Another contender: ""BELTE"" not word? ""DELTE"" not.

Perhaps ""WEL T E D"" but 6? ""WELTE"" not word.

I think ""LITHE"" is fine.

So I guess ""LITHE"".

But let's see: ""TILDE"" but has D? Ends with E? T I L D E -> yes? Has T,I,L,D,E? Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.

Positions: T at 1? L at 3? D at 4? E at 5? So ""TILDE"": T,I,L,D,E.

Possible? But T at position 1: allowed? L at position 3? And T not in position 2? Here T in position 1? L not in position 4? Here L in position 3? So yes.

But ""TILDE"" has D? Which is a common letter? ""LITHE"" has H? Which is also common.

Both are possible? But ""TILDE"" tests D? H might be less common? Or I and H? I think both are valid.

But since I suggested ""LITHE"" first? Or should I choose based on letter frequency?

Letter frequency: I is more common than D? In English? But we need to know which.

Perhaps ""LITHE"" because L is at a new position? Unlike in ""TILDE"" where T is at position 1? Which may be valid? 

All are valid.

But I'll go with ""LITHE"" because I think the the letters I and H are good to test? And it avoids duplication.

So word: ""LITHE""### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → The secret word ends with ""E"" and excludes C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**: S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓) → Confirms the secret word ends with ""E"". S and O are absent. T and L are present but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

2. **Inferred Constraints:**
   - **Secret word format**: `_ _ _ _ E`
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O (must avoid).
   - **Present letters**: T and L are confirmed to be in the word, but:
     - T cannot be in position 2.
     - L cannot be in position 4.
   - **Remaining positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (position 5 is fixed as E).
   - **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) while including T and L.

3. **New Guess Requirements:**
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in ""E"".
   - Must include T and L to respect their presence.
   - Cannot use C, R, A, N, S, O (absent letters).
   - Must test new common letters (e.g., H, I, U, D) to maximize information gain.
   - Test possible positions for T and L (T allowed in positions 1, 3, or 4; L allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3).

4. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - Considered words: ""LITHE"" (L, I, T, H, E), ""GLUTE"" (G, L, U, T, E), ""FLUTE"" (F, L, U, T, E), ""ELITE"" (E, L, I, T, E), and ""TILDE"" (T, I, L, D, E).
   - **Why ""LITHE"" stands out**:
     - Ends with ""E"", satisfying the fixed position.
     - Includes T (position 3) and L (position 1), respecting their misplaced positions from previous feedback.
     - Tests new common vowels/consonants: I (position 2) and H (position 4).
     - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O) and letters already confirmed present to avoid redundancy.
     - Positions test key hypotheses:
       - If L is in position 1 (was position 4 in ""stole"", now tested in a new position).
       - If T is in position 3 (was position 2 in ""stole"", now tested elsewhere).

5. **Expected Information Gain:**
   - Feedback will reveal if I or H are present and in which positions.
   - Will clarify if T and L are correctly placed (e.g., T in position 3 or L in position 1).
   - If all correct, solves the word; otherwise, tightens constraints for next guess.

However, it\'s possible that there is another E? But the feedback only showed one E and it was correct. But note: the feedback for the first guess only marked the last E as correct. The other letters were absent. So the word has exactly one E? Not necessarily: it could have more, but in the first guess, we only had one E and it was in the correct position. The other positions were marked as absent for the letters we guessed, but if the word had an E in another position, then in our guess ""crane"", the E was only in the last position, so we wouldn\'t have tested E elsewhere. Therefore, we don\'t know if there are other E\'s.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the other positions (first four) were marked as x for the letters we guessed (C, R, A, N) but not for E. So if the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have an E in the last position (which is correct) and the secret word might have an E in an earlier position. However, in our guess, we didn\'t put E in any earlier position, so we wouldn\'t get feedback about an E in an earlier position. Therefore, we must consider that there might be another E.\n\nBut the feedback for the first four letters was x, meaning that the secret word does not have C, R, A, or N in those positions. It doesn\'t tell us about E in those positions because we didn\'t guess E there.\n\nSo we have to consider that the secret word might have E in an earlier position? Actually, no: because we only have one E in our guess, and it was in the correct position. If the secret word had an E in an earlier position, then in the feedback, the E in the last position would be correct (✓) and the earlier positions (where we have C, R, A, N) would be x, which they are. But we don\'t have any information about whether there is an E in an earlier position because we didn\'t guess an E there. So we must account for the possibility of multiple E\'s.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should avoid putting E in an earlier position in our next guess? Or we can try to test for it? Since we have 5 more guesses, we can try to get more information.\n\nBut note: we are only on the second guess. We can design a guess that tests for other common letters and also checks for E in other positions? However, we know the last letter is E, so we can only test for E in positions 1-4 by putting E in one of those positions.\n\nBut if we put E in an earlier position, then if the secret word has an E there, we get a \'-\' (if it\'s present but not in the correct position) or a \'✓\' (if it is in the correct position). However, we already know that the last position is E, so if we put E in an earlier position and it is present, then we know there are at least two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using E again to save a guess? But that might be risky because we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s.\n\nGiven that we have 5 guesses left, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t repeat E and then if we get no E in the feedback, we can assume there is only one E (at the end). But if we use a word without E in the other positions, we won\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has E in an earlier position to test? But note: we cannot put E in the last position again? Actually, we can, because the last position is fixed as E. So we must have the last letter as E. Therefore, if we put E in an earlier position, then we are testing for multiple E\'s.\n\nBut we are forced to have the last letter as E. So our next guess must end with E.\n\nWe can choose a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position? For example, a word like ""SPEED"" but that has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has E in the first four positions.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the absent letters: C, R, A, N.\n\nLet me think of common words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.\n\nSome ideas:\n- Words ending with E: many options.\n\nWe want to test other common vowels and consonants.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that includes S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nAlso, we want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: ""SLATE"" -> but contains A? A is absent, so we cannot use A. We know A is absent.\n\nSo we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use A.\n\nOption 2: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E. Ends with E, and doesn\'t contain C, R, A, N.\n\nOption 3: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E. Also good.\n\nOption 4: ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E.\n\nOption 5: ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\nWe also note that we are testing for the possibility of E in other positions? Actually, in these words, we are not putting E in an earlier position. They all have E only at the end.\n\nBut if we want to test for E in other positions, we could choose a word that has E in an earlier position, such as ""SPEED"" (but that has two E\'s: one at the end and one in position 3). However, ""SPEED"" has two E\'s and we know the last E is correct. If we use ""SPEED"", then the first E (if present in the secret word in an earlier position) would be marked.\n\nBut note: ""SPEED"" has two E\'s. The last E is fixed and will be correct. The E in position 3: if the secret word has an E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for that E? But wait, the secret word ends with E, so if it has an E in position 3, then we would get:\n- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S? \n- Position 2: P -> ?\n- Position 3: E -> if the secret word has E in position 3, then it would be ✓ because it\'s the correct letter and position.\n- Position 4: E -> but the secret word has the last letter as E, so position 4 is not E? The secret word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So if we put E in position 4, then if the secret word has E in position 4, it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere? But we already have E in position 5.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E in position 3 and 4 would be incorrect. Specifically, if we guess ""SPEED"", then:\n- Position 5: E is correct (✓)\n- Position 3: E would be marked as absent (x) if there is no other E? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s \'-\'. If it\'s not in the word, it\'s \'x\'. But if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 and 4 are not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one E, which is at the end. So the E in position 3 and 4 are not present? Then they would be marked as \'x\'. \n\nBut if the secret word has two E\'s, then one of them is at the end, and the other could be in position 3 or 4? Then we would get a \'-\' for the E in the position where it is present but not at the end? For example, if the secret word is ""SPEED"", then we get all correct. But if the secret word is ""STEED"", then for ""SPEED"": \n- S: if in position 1? \n- P: not in STEED? \n- E: in position 3: STEED has E in position 3? STEED: S, T, E, E, D -> wait, no: STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:D? But we know the secret word ends with E, so it must be ...E at the end. So STEED ends with D? No, STEED ends with D? Actually, STEED is S-T-E-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need a word that ends with E and has E in an earlier position. Example: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E. But we cannot use E in position 1 because we don\'t know if it\'s present? And we are avoiding C, R, A, N.\n\nBut ""ELITE"" has E at the beginning and the end. So if we use ""ELITE"", then:\n- Position 1: E -> if the secret word has E at position 1, then ✓. Otherwise, if E is only at the end, then we get \'-\' for position 1? Because the E is present but in the wrong position? But wait, if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E at position 1 is not present? So it would be \'x\'. \n\nBut if the secret word has two E\'s, one at the end and one at the beginning, then we get ✓ for both? Or if one at the end and one elsewhere, then we get a \'-\' for the E in position 1 if it is present but not at position 1.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Since we are only on the second guess, it might be better to avoid using E again in an earlier position and instead test other vowels and consonants. Then, if we don\'t find the word, we can test for multiple E\'s later.\n\nSo I will choose a word that ends with E and does not contain E in the first four positions, and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\nWe can try to cover common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nLet me think of words: \n- ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> tests P, O, I, S (and E at the end, which we know is correct). \n- ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S.\n- ""GUISE"": G, U, I, S, E -> tests G, U, I, S.\n- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> tests T, H, Y, M.\n\nWhich one is best? We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters in 5-letter words: E (we already know one), S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n""POISE"" has S and I and O. ""MOUSE"" has S, O, U. ""THYME"" has T, H, Y, M.\n\nI think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it includes S (very common), O, and I (vowels). Also, P is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLIME"" but we cannot use L? We can use L, but ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we don\'t know about L. However, we must avoid A, which is absent. ""SLIME"" does not contain A, C, R, N. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""POISE"" is a solid choice because it tests three new vowels (O, I) and a common consonant (S, P).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""POISE"".\n\nBut note: we are not testing T, which is very common. Maybe we can choose a word with T? Such as ""TOISE""? Not a word. Or ""QUITE""? But Q is less common. ""TIMES""? But ends with S, not E. We need to end with E.\n\n""TIMES"" ends with S, not E. We need a word ending with E.\n\n""THOSE"" -> but contains O and S and T, but also H. However, ""THOSE"" ends with E and has T, H, O, S. But we must avoid A? It doesn\'t have A. But we don\'t know about O, S, T, H.\n\nBut ""THOSE"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""STOLE"" -> ends with E, has S, T, O, L, E. But we are avoiding? It doesn\'t have C, R, A, N. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we are testing E again? In ""STOLE"", we have E at the end (which we know) and no other E. So we are testing S, T, O, L.\n\n""STOLE"" is a good word because it tests S, T, O, L, which are very common.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a better choice because it tests more common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).\n\nBut wait: we are on the second guess, and we want to maximize information. The letters S, T, L are among the most common.\n\nSo I choose ""STOLE"".\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" has none of these.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the first four letters are not C, R, A, N. So we are safe.\n\nSo the next guess: ""STOLE""\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- S in position 1\n- T in position 2\n- O in position 3\n- L in position 4\n- E in position 5 (which we know is correct)\n\nWe hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.\n\nIf we get:\n- S: ✓ or - or x\n- T: similarly\n- O: similarly\n- L: similarly\n\nAnd E is fixed as ✓.\n\nThis will give us good information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E correct and in position 5), the secret word must:\n- End with ""E"" (since E is confirmed in position 5).\n- Exclude the letters C, R, A, and N (as they are absent).\n- Potentially include other common vowels (like I, O, U) or consonants (like S, T, L, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose **""STOLE""** because:\n- It ends with ""E"", respecting the confirmed position.\n- It avoids the absent letters (C, R, A, N).\n- It tests new high-frequency letters: S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), and L (position 4), which are among the most common in English words.\n- This combination covers multiple common consonants and a vowel, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\n   - This means the secret word ends with E (position 5) and does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\n2. Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)\n   - E(✓) at position 5 is consistent with the first guess.\n   - S(x) means S is not in the word at all.\n   - O(x) means not in the word at all.\n   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.\n   - L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\n- The secret word is ? ? ? ? E.\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O (from both guesses).\n- Present letters that are not in the correct position: T and L. Since T is marked as present but wrong position, and similarly for L.\n\nImportant: T and L are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n\nWe know the word must contain T and L, but T cannot be in position 2 and L cannot be in position 4.\n\nAlso, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L.\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C, R, A, N, S, O. We must include T and L, and we have an E at the end.\n\nPossible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones).\n\nThe word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (fixed E).\n\nT is in the word but not position 2 -> possible positions: 1, 3, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.\n\nSimilarly, L is in the word but not position 4 -> possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: we cannot have T and L in positions that conflict with the feedback.\n\nWe also know that the word must have exactly these letters: T, L, E (and two more, since T and L are two, plus E is one, so two unknown letters? Or possibly repeated letters? But we don\'t know). However, we have only one E confirmed at the end, but there might be more? But in the feedback from ""stole"", we only had T and L as present and wrong, and S and O absent, E correct. Since we had three absents (S, O) and one correct (E), and two presents in wrong positions (T and L).\n\nSo the secret word must contain at least: T, L, E, and two more letters? Or one more letter if repeated? For example, it might have two T\'s or two L\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut based on the feedback, we know:\n\n- T is present: so at least one T.\n- L is present: at least one L.\n- E is present at the end.\n\nNow, we have three known letters: T, L, E. We need two more.\n\nBut they could be any letters not in the absent list.\n\nMoreover, T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we have no constraints on repeated letters? But let\'s assume we try to avoid repeats for now.\n\nNow, we need to form a word ? ? ? ? E that includes T and L, excludes C,R,A,N,S,O.\n\nWe also must not use the letters that were absent: so avoid C,R,A,N,S,O.\n\nWe can try to place T and L in the positions.\n\nPossible placements for T: positions 1, 3, 4? However, position 4 is the fourth letter? The positions are:\n\nPos1: ? \nPos2: ? (cannot be T because T not in position 2)\nPos3: ?\nPos4: ? (cannot be L because L not in position 4)\nPos5: E (fixed)\n\nSo:\n- T can be in 1, 3, or 4.\n- L can be in 1, 2, or 3? Because the positions available: 1,2,3,4. And L cannot be in 4, so L can be in 1,2, or 3.\n\nWe have to consider possible words.\n\nWe want a word that satisfies:\n- Ends in E\n- Contains T and L\n- Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O\n\nAnd we need two more letters? Or possibly only two letters: for example, the word might be ""TITLE"" but that has T at position 1 and 4? But ""TITLE"" has T in 1 and 4? Positions: T,I,T,L,E -> no, T I T L E -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E. But we know that L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was guessed in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is not in position 4. So if the word were ""TITLE"", L is in position 4? That would be wrong position? No, but L is in position 4, but the feedback said L is not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4, which contradicts the feedback? Because the feedback says L is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, L cannot be in position 4. So ""TITLE"" is not possible.\n\nAnother example: ""LATTE"" but has A? A is absent, and also ends with E? T T E? Not really. And has A? So no.\n\nWe need words without those letters.\n\nLet me think of words: the word must contain T and L and end with E.\n\nSome words:\n- ""TITLE"": invalid because L cannot be position 4.\n- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E. But we don\'t know about I and H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes, I is allowed? We have not tested I.\n\nBut in ""LITHE"":\n- Position 1: L -> possible? L can be in position 1 or 2 or 3.\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: H\n- Position 5: E\n\nIs T in the word? Yes, at position 3. But we know T cannot be in position 2? And here T is in position 3, which is fine? Also, L is in position 1, and L cannot be in position 4? Yes, so position 1 is allowed for L.\n\nBut we must check if ""LITHE"" contains any absent letters? It has I, T, H, E, L. We haven\'t tested I or H? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.\n\nSo ""LITHE"" is possible.\n\nBut is L allowed in the first position? We don\'t know? But it is possible.\n\nSimilarly, T is in position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I and H are in the word? But we need to guess again.\n\nAnother word: ""BELIE"" but ends with E? B E L I E -> ends with E? Yes? Positions: B, E, L, I, E. But we have E in position 2? And we are told that E is in position 5? But if the secret word has E in position 2? But in our first guess, we didn\'t guess any other E except at the end, so we don\'t know if E is elsewhere? And also, in ""stole"", we guessed O and L. Here, if we use ""BELIE"", it contains E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E. But if we put E in position 2, then if the word has E in position 2, it might be correct or present? But we want to avoid? Actually, we need to include T and L? ""BELIE"" has no T and L? It has B, E, L, I, E -> has L? Yes? But L is in position 3. And E in position 2 and 5.\n\nBut the feedback from ""stole"" tells us that T must be in the word? So if we use ""BELIE"", we have L and E, but no T? Which contradicts the requirement that T is present? So we must include T.\n\nTherefore, our guess must include T and L.\n\nSo ""BELIE"" is invalid because it does not have T.\n\nAnother word: ""GLUTE"" ? G L U T E -> positions: G, L, U, T, E. Ends with E. Has L and T. Avoids absent letters? G,L,U,T,E: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So allowed.\n\nPositions: \n- Position 1: G\n- Position 2: L -> but L in position 2: is that allowed? L can be in position 2? Because the feedback says L is not in position 4? Position 4: T? So L is in position 2? Possible? Yes.\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: T -> T in position 4? But T not in position 2? Could be in position 4? Yes.\n\nFeedback for T: T was guessed in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position? So in this word, T is in position 4? Which is allowed? Similarly, L is in position 2? Which is an available position.\n\nWe can consider such words.\n\nWe want to choose a word that tests new common letters and helps narrow positions.\n\nSince T and L are misplaced, and we have positions 1,2,3,4 to fill with T and L and two new letters? Plus we have E at end.\n\nWe need to cover more letters? For example, we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to include common ones like H, I, D, M, etc.\n\nBut we also have to try to put T and L in a position that we have not ruled out.\n\nWe know T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4. So:\n\n- T can be in position 1, 3, or 4? Position 4? Yes.\n- L can be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe don\'t know where they are exactly.\n\nSo our next guess should try to place T and L in different positions to test.\n\nFor example, put T in position 1 and L in position 2? Or other combinations.\n\nWe also want to test for missing letters.\n\nSome words:\n\n1. ""TILE "": but 5 letters? ""TILED"" but ends with D? Not E. We need E at end.\n2. ""TILES"" ends with S? But S is absent? We know S is absent? From guess 2: S(x) meaning S is not in the word? So we cannot use S? So ""TILES"" has S? Invalid.\n3. ""TIRED"" but ends with D? Not E, also R is absent? R is absent? So invalid.\n4. ""BILGE"" ends with E? B,I,L,G,E -> has L? Position 2: I? Position 3: L? Position 4: G? Has no T? We need T? So invalid.\n5. ""GUILT"" but does not end with E? Not valid.\n6. ""MELT"" 4 letters? Only 4? Not 5.\n7. ""TEPID"" ends with D? Not E.\n\nSo we need 5-letter word ending with E, containing T and L, not containing C,R,A,N,S,O.\n\nExamples:\n\n- ""TITLE"": invalid because L in position 4? But L cannot be in position 4? So not possible? Because if L were in position 4, it would be correct if secret has it? But feedback says L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would have L in position 4? So it can\'t be the secret? Because we would have feedback showing L not in position 4? So ""TITLE"" would be invalid? Actually for guessing, we can use it? But it would be inconsistent? Because in our new guess, we want a valid word that might be the secret? But without repeating positions? However, we are trying to find a word that could be the secret? No, we are making a guess; it doesn\'t have to be the secret.\n\nBut we must choose a word that uses only available letters? According to the rules, the guess must be a valid English word? And it can include letters we don\'t know about, but ideally we should avoid letters we know are absent? Because if we use an absent letter, it will not help? But the feedback might be messy.\n\nEspecially, we cannot use C,R,A,N,S,O because they are confirmed absent? Yes? So we should not use them? Because they will just show as absent again? But we might get feedback for other letters? However, it wastes the guess? So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.\n\nTherefore, our guess must not include C,R,A,N,S,O.\n\nSo must use letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and we know T and L must be included.\n\nSo, possible words:\n\n- ""TIL E"" with E? But we need two more letters? Actually, ""TILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- ""LITHE"": L,I,T,H,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E\n  - Includes T and L? Yes: T at position 3, L at position 1.\n  - No C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.\n- ""BILGE"": B,I,L,G,E -> but no T? So invalid.\n- ""GLUTE"": G,L,U,T,E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> has T and L? At position 4 and 2? Yes.\n- ""F L I T E"" : ""FLITE"" is a word? Check: FLITE is an alternative spelling of FITE? Not commonly used. ""FLUTE"" but ends with E? Not E? Flute ends with E? F L U T E? Is it flute? Not, flute ends with E? Flute: F L U T E? No, flute is F-L-U-T-E? But that\'s 5 letters? F L U T E? That is ""FLUTE"", but often pronounced, but spelling: F-L-U-T-E? Actually, flute is typically 5 letters: F-L-U-T-E? But E at end? Yes? Positions: F, L, U, T, E? So yes.\n\nBut ""flute"" has U? And T? We need T and L? Flute has L and T? So it has L and T? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes? So ""FLUTE"" is valid? FLUTE: F,L,U,T,E.\n\nSimilarly, ""GLUTE"" as above.\n\nAnother common word: ""METAL"" but ends with L? Not E? Also no T necessarily? Metal has T? Positions: M,E,T,A,L has A absent? So no.\n\n""TIMED"" ends with D? Not E.\n\n""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E -> has E and T and L? But E in position 1? And when we guess, position 1 is E? Which? But from the feedback, E is only confirmed at position 5? But if we use E in position 1, then if the word has E in position 1, it might be correct or present? Also, ""ELITE"" avoids? E,L,I,T,E: has two E\'s? And avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? I is not absent? Yes.\n\nBut ""ELITE"" has E at position 1? So we would have E at position 1 and 5? Position 5 is fixed E.\n\nIn this case, for positions of T and L: L is in position 2? And T in position 4? Position 4: T? But feedback says L not in position 4? L is not in position 4? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? So position 4 is T? Which is fine? But we don\'t know about E at position 1? If we guess ""ELITE"", then we might get feedback about E at position 1.\n\nBut we also know T and L: T is at position 4 and L at position 2? Both are new positions.\n\nSo possible words: ""ELITE"", ""LITHE"", ""GLUTE"", ""FLUTE"", etc.\n\nNow, which one to choose for maximum information? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""ELITE"": uses E twice? Known E at end, and tests E at beginning? Also I and T,L. Letters: E, L, I, T. But we already know E and T and L? So really we are testing I? And E at position 1? And L is in position 2? But L in position 2: is that possible? Allowed.\n\nIn ""GLUTE"": tests G,U,T,L,E -> tests G and U? New letters? U is a vowel?\n\nSimilarly, ""LITHE"" tests H and I.\n\n""FLUTE"" tests F,L,U,T,E -> F and U?\n\nNow, which letters are more common? H, I are common. So ""LITHE"" might be good.\n\nOn the other hand, ""FLUTE"" has F which is less common.\n\nBut in ""LITHE"", we have:\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: H\n- Position 5: E\n\nFeedback from ""stole"": L not in position 4? In ""LITHE"", L is in position 1? So it is possible? Similarly, T not in position 2? Here T is in position 3, which is fine? Yes.\n\nBut when we get feedback, if the letter is in the correct position, it would be ✓, etc.\n\nWe can try ""LITHE"" to test H and I.\n\nBut we have many vowels? U is also vowel? We mostly consonants except vowels E and I? Or U? \n\nAlternatively, ""QUOTE"" but has O? Absent? So no.\n\n""PIET "": not word. ""PILTE"" not word.\n\nAnother word: ""WHILE"" but ends with E? W H I L E -> has L? But no T? We need T? So not? ""WHILE"" has H,I,L,E? No T.\n\n"" THEME"": T,H,E,M,E -> has T? But has E at position 3? And E at the end? But avoids? And H and M? But ""THEME"" has T and E? But we need L? We must have L? Because feedback says L is present? So if we guess ""THEME"", it doesn\'t have L? Then it would show L absent? But L is in the word? So we would get conflicting feedback and lose a guess? So we cannot guess a word without L? We must include L? Similarly for T.\n\nTherefore, we must include L and T? And E at end.\n\n""METLE"" not word? ""METAL"" no E end? ""METTLED"" too many letters.\n\n""TABLE"" has A and S or? A is absent and ends with E? Yes? ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but A is absent? Cannot use A.\n\n""LAT E"" not 5? ""LATTE"" has A and ends with E? A absent? No.\n\nSo I think ""LITHE"" or ""GLUTE"" or ""ELITE"" or ""FLUTE"".\n\nNow, let me pick one that maximizes new common letters? Since we haven\'t tested I or H or G or U? \n\n""LITHE"" tests I and H? H is decently common.\n\n""GLUTE"" tests G and U? U common vowel.\n\nPerhaps ""ELITE"" tests I? But uses E twice? Which might be useful? If there is a double E? But not necessarily.\n\nBut ""ELITE"" has the advantage of potentially revealing if E is in position 1? But if not, then we know E is only at the end.\n\nWhereas ""LITHE"" doesn\'t test E elsewhere? But we don\'t care? We want to solve the word.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we need to be cautious about duplicated letters? But in Wordle, duplicates can happen.\n\nGenerally, we should avoid using a letter twice unless necessary? Because it complicates the feedback? But in this case, for ""ELITE"", we have two E\'s? We know E is at the end? And testing E at position 1? \n\nWe could also choose ""THYME"" but that has Y? And ends with E: T,H,Y,M,E -> yes? Has T? But no L? Must have L? So not.\n\nSimilarly, ""PHLO E""? Not word.\n\nI think ""LITHE"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new common letters: I and H? And positions L at 1 and T at 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L can be at 1 or T at 3? It is possible? \n\nIn ""stole"", L was guessed position 4? Not position 4, that is bad? But in LITHE, L is at position 1? Which is different.\n\nSimilarly, T was at 2? Which is bad? But in LITHE, T at 3? Which is not 2.\n\nSo we can use ""LITHE"".\n\nSimilarly, ""QUITE"" has U,I? But no L? Must have L.\n\nSo I will go with ""LITHE"".\n\nBut let me confirm: L has not been tested in position 1? And T not in position 3? But we have already ruled out positions for T and L? No, we only ruled out specific positions.\n\nAnother contender: ""BELTE"" not word? ""DELTE"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""WEL T E D"" but 6? ""WELTE"" not word.\n\nI think ""LITHE"" is fine.\n\nSo I guess ""LITHE"".\n\nBut let\'s see: ""TILDE"" but has D? Ends with E? T I L D E -> yes? Has T,I,L,D,E? Avoids C,R,A,N,S,O? Yes.\n\nPositions: T at 1? L at 3? D at 4? E at 5? So ""TILDE"": T,I,L,D,E.\n\nPossible? But T at position 1: allowed? L at position 3? And T not in position 2? Here T in position 1? L not in position 4? Here L in position 3? So yes.\n\nBut ""TILDE"" has D? Which is a common letter? ""LITHE"" has H? Which is also common.\n\nBoth are possible? But ""TILDE"" tests D? H might be less common? Or I and H? I think both are valid.\n\nBut since I suggested ""LITHE"" first? Or should I choose based on letter frequency?\n\nLetter frequency: I is more common than D? In English? But we need to know which.\n\nPerhaps ""LITHE"" because L is at a new position? Unlike in ""TILDE"" where T is at position 1? Which may be valid? \n\nAll are valid.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""LITHE"" because I think the the letters I and H are good to test?

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: The secret word has E in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓)
Meaning: S and O are not in the word. T is in the word but not in position 2. L is in the word but not in position 4. E is correct in position 5.

Guess 3: ""lithe"" -> L(-) I(-) T(-) H(x) E(✓)
Meaning: L is in the word but not in position 1. I is in the word but not in position 2. T is in the word but not in position 3. H is not in the word. E is correct in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The secret word is _ _ _ _ E
- Letters that are in the word: T, L, I, E (E is fixed at the end)
- Letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, O, H
- Position constraints:
  - T: not in position 2 (from ""stole"") and not in position 3 (from ""lithe"") -> so T must be in position 1 or 4.
  - L: not in position 4 (from ""stole"") and not in position 1 (from ""lithe"") -> so L must be in position 2 or 3.
  - I: not in position 2 (from ""lithe"") -> so I must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions 1,2,3,4 are open, but we have constraints.

Also, we have three letters that must be placed: T, L, I, and one more unknown letter? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E fixed, and we know T, L, I are present, so that's 4 letters. Therefore, there is one more letter that we haven't identified yet.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains T, L, I
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, O, H
- T is in position 1 or 4
- L is in position 2 or 3
- I is not in position 2 (so in 1, 3, or 4) but note that positions must be assigned without conflict.

Let's list the possible positions:

Position 1: can be T or I (since L cannot be here, and T can be here)
Position 2: can be L (since T and I cannot be here? T cannot be in 2, I cannot be in 2? But L can be in 2)
Position 3: can be L or I (T cannot be in 3)
Position 4: can be T or I (L cannot be in 4)

But note: we have three letters (T, L, I) to place in positions 1,2,3,4 and one more letter (let's call it X) in the remaining position.

The positions must be filled without overlapping.

Possible cases for T:
- If T is in position 1, then:
  - Position 4 must be I or X? But we have to place I and L as well.
  - Position 2 must be L (since L must be in 2 or 3, and if T is in 1, then position 2 is available for L)
  - Then position 3 must be I? Or X? But we have I to place.

Alternatively, if T is in position 4, then:
  - Position 1: cannot be L (L must be in 2 or 3) so must be I or X?
  - Position 2: can be L
  - Position 3: can be L or I

But we must account for the fact that I must be placed and cannot be in position 2? Actually, I can be in 1,3,4? But if T is in 4, then I can be in 1 or 3.

Now, we also have an unknown letter X in one of the positions.

We need to think of words that fit.

List of available letters (excluding absent ones): B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is fixed at the end, so for the first four positions, we have T, L, I, and one from the above).

We can try to form words.

Possible words:

Case 1: T in position 1.
Then:
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: must be L (because L must be in 2 or 3, and if we put L in 2, then position 3 is open for I or X? But I must be placed and cannot be in 2? So if position 2 is L, then I must be in 3 or 4? But position 4 is open? But we have four positions: 1,2,3,4 and three letters: T (used), L (used), and I and one more? So we have two more: I and X.

So if position 1: T, position 2: L, then positions 3 and 4: I and X (unknown) and then position 5: E.

But I cannot be in position 2? But position 2 is taken by L, so I can be in 3 or 4? Yes.

So possible words: T L ? ? E

The word must be T L ? ? E, with the third and fourth letters being I and an unknown letter (from available set) or vice versa.

But we know I is in the word, so one of the two must be I.

Examples:
- T L I ? E -> but what letter? The word must be valid. E.g., ""T L I E E""? Not, only one E at end? And we have two E's? But we don't know if E is duplicated? But we have E at end, and if we put E in position 4? But we don't know if E is duplicated? But in previous feedback, we only know E at position 5 is present? We don't know about other E's? But we have not tested E in other positions? However, we have avoided using E in other positions so far? In ""lithe"", we had no E in other positions? So we don't know.

But we must avoid H, which is absent? So we cannot use H.

Possible words: 
- ""T L I E E"" -> not a word? And we have only 5 letters? T,L,I,E,E -> but that's 5? But ""belie"" is B E L I E? Not starting with T.

What about ""T L I C E""? But C is absent? No.

""T L I D E"" -> ""T L I D E"" is ""slide""? But S is absent? And we have S absent? So no.

""T L I P E"" -> ""tlipe"" not a word? 
""T L I V E"" -> ""tlive"" not a word.

""T L I M E"" -> ""tlime"" not common? But ""lime"" is, but with T? Not a word.

""T L I T E"" -> ""T L I T E"" has two T's? But T is already in position 1? So if the word has two T's? But we don't know? And ""title"" is T I T L E? But that has T at 1 and 3? But in our case, we have T at 1, then L at 2, then I at 3? Then T at 4? But that would be T L I T E? Not a standard word.

So maybe T in position 1 and L in position 2 is not yielding common words? 

Case 2: T in position 1, and L in position 3? But L can be in position 3? Then position 2 must be filled by something else? And I must be placed? 

So positions:
1: T
2: ? (must be X, the unknown letter, because L is in 3 and I is not in 2? But I can be in 4? Or 3? But position 3 is L? So I must be in 4? Or position 2 can be I? But I cannot be in position 2? From feedback: I is not in position 2? So position 2 cannot be I? Therefore, if T is in 1 and L in 3, then position 2 must be X (unknown) and position 4 must be I? Because I must be placed and cannot be in 2? So position 4: I? Then the word is T X L I E.

Now, what words are T X L I E? With X not in absent letters? And not T,L,I,E? But T and L and I are already used? So X is a new letter.

Examples: 
- ""T A L I E"" but A absent? No.
- ""T U L I E"" -> ""tulie"" not a word? 
- ""T B L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T D L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T G L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T M L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T P L I E"" -> ""tplie"" not a word? But ""plie"" is, but with T? Not.
- ""T W L I E"" -> not a word.

""tulip"" ends with P? Not E.

So not many options.

Therefore, T in position 1 might not be promising.

Now, try T in position 4.

Then:
Position 4: T
Position 5: E

Now, positions 1,2,3 to fill with L, I, and X (unknown).

Constraints:
- L must be in position 2 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 2? So I must be in position 1 or 3? But if L is in position 2, then I cannot be in 2? So I must be in 1 or 3? But position 3 is available? Or if L is in 3, then I can be in 1? 

Subcases:

Subcase 1: L in position 2.
Then:
  Position 2: L
  Position 1: can be I or X? But I cannot be in 2? So position 1 can be I? Or X? And position 3 must be the remaining? But I must be placed? So if position 1 is I, then position 3 is X? If position 1 is X, then position 3 must be I? Because I must be in the word? And cannot be in 2? So position 3 is available for I.

So two possibilities:
  a) Position 1: I, position 2: L, position 3: X, position 4: T, position 5: E -> word: I L X T E
  b) Position 1: X, position 2: L, position 3: I, position 4: T, position 5: E -> word: X L I T E

Subcase 2: L in position 3.
Then:
  Position 3: L
  Position 1: can be I or X? (I cannot be in 2? But position 2 is open? And position 1 can be I? Or X? And position 2 must be X? Or I? But I cannot be in 2? So position 2 must be X? And position 1 must be I? Because I must be placed? So:
  Position 1: I, position 2: X, position 3: L, position 4: T, position 5: E -> word: I X L T E

Now, let's find valid words:

First, for pattern I L X T E:
- What is X? Must be a letter not absent? And not I,L,T,E? So from available: B,D,F,G,K,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we have to form a word.
- Examples: 
  - ""I L K T E"" -> ""ilkte"" not a word.
  - ""I L M T E"" -> ""ilmte"" not a word.
  - ""I L U T E"" -> ""ilute"" not a word.
  - ""I L D T E"" -> ""ildte"" not a word.
  - ""I L E T E"" -> but E is at position 3? And we have E at end? But ""ilete"" not a word? And we don't know if E is duplicated? But we can try? But not a word.

Second pattern: X L I T E
- Examples:
  - ""A L I T E"" but A absent? No.
  - ""B L I T E"" -> ""BLITE"" is a word? Not common? But it is a valid word (e.g., a type of rock or mineral? Or in botany? But let's assume it's acceptable? However, we need common words? But Wordle accepts various words? But let's see if there are better.
  - ""D L I T E"" -> ""dlite"" not a word.
  - ""F L I T E"" -> ""FLITE"" is an old word for quarrel? Or variant of flyte? But it's accepted in some dictionaries? 
  - ""G L I T E"" -> ""glite"" not common? 
  - ""K L I T E"" -> not a word.
  - ""M L I T E"" -> not a word.
  - ""P L I T E"" -> ""PLITE"" not a word? But ""polite"" has O? O is absent? So no.
  - ""U L I T E"" -> ""ulite"" not a word.
  - ""W L I T E"" -> ""wlite"" not a word.
  - ""Y L I T E"" -> not a word.
  - ""Z L I T E"" -> not.

But ""BLITE"" might be acceptable? But let's see if there are more common words.

Third pattern: I X L T E
- Examples:
  - ""I B L T E"" -> ""IBLTE"" not a word.
  - ""I D L T E"" -> ""id lte"" not.
  - ""I F L T E"" -> ""if lte"" not.
  - ""I G L T E"" -> ""IGLTE"" not.
  - ""I K L T E"" -> not.
  - ""I M L T E"" -> ""imlte"" not.
  - ""I P L T E"" -> ""IPLTE"" not.
  - ""I U L T E"" -> ""IULTE"" not.
  - ""I W L T E"" -> not.

But what about ""I M M E E""? Not.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""UTILE""? But U T I L E -> positions: U, T, I, L, E? But T is in position 2? But T cannot be in position 2? From ""stole"", T is not in position 2? So ""UTILE"" has T in position 2? Which is forbidden? So no.

""DEL T I E"" but D E L T I E? 6 letters? Not.

Perhaps we missed a word? 

Another common word: ""T I L E D"" but ends with D? Not E.

""L I T E R"" ends with R? Not E.

But we have the pattern for T in position 4: X L I T E? We have ""ELITE""? But ""ELITE"" is E L I T E? But E is at position 1? And we have E at position 5? So ""ELITE"" has E at 1 and 5? But in our pattern for T in position 4, we have position 1 as X? In ""ELITE"", position 1 is E? So it would be a candidate? But we have not ruled out E in other positions? And we know E is at position 5? But we don't know about other positions? 

But in ""ELITE"", we have:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

Now, check constraints:
- T is in position 4? Allowed? Yes, because T can be in 4.
- L is in position 2? Allowed? Yes, because L can be in 2 or 3.
- I is in position 3? And I cannot be in position 2? Here it is in 3? So allowed? 
- Also, the word has E at position 1? We don't know if that is present? But it might be? And we have not used any absent letters? Absent letters are C,R,A,N,S,O,H? E is not absent? So it's allowed.

But we have feedback from ""lithe"": in ""lithe"", we had I in position 2? And it was marked as present but wrong position? So I is in the word but not in position 2? In ""ELITE"", I is in position 3? Which is fine? And L in position 1 of ""lithe"" was marked as present but wrong position? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? Which is a different position? So it could be.

Also, in ""ELITE"", we have two E's? But that's okay? We don't know if the word has two E's? 

But let's see if it fits the feedback:

From ""stole"": T is present but not in position 2? In ""ELITE"", T is in position 4? So not in 2? Good.
L is present but not in position 4? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? Not 4? Good.

From ""lithe"": L is present but not in position 1? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? Not 1? Good.
I is present but not in position 2? In ""ELITE"", I is in position 3? Not 2? Good.
T is present but not in position 3? In ""ELITE"", T is in position 4? Not 3? Good.
H is absent? ""ELITE"" has no H? Good.

And E at end is good.

So ""ELITE"" is a valid candidate? But we didn't think of it earlier because we were avoiding E in position 1? But we don't know that E is not in position 1? 

But in the feedback from ""crane"", we only know E is at position 5? We don't know about other positions? So it could be.

Moreover, ""ELITE"" is a common word.

But we have to make a guess? And it fits all the constraints.

But is there another word? 

What about ""UNTIE""? U N T I E? But N is absent? From guess 1? N is absent? So no.

""UTILE"" has T in position 2? Not allowed.

""DELVE"" has no T or L? Must have both.

""BELIE"" has B E L I E? But no T? Must have T.

So ""ELITE"" seems a strong candidate.

But in ""ELITE"", we have E in position 1? If we guess it, we might get feedback.

But we are not sure if E is in position 1? But it might be.

Another word: ""EXILE""? X is not absent? But ""EXILE"" is E X I L E? Positions: E, X, I, L, E? 
- T is not in the word? But we need T? So no.

""EDILE"" is E D I L E? But no T? So no.

So ""ELITE"" is a good guess.

But let's see the pattern I X L T E? We didn't find a word? But ""ELITE"" is not in that pattern? It is E L I T E? Which is position 1: E, 2: L, 3: I, 4: T, 5: E.

So it fits the pattern of having T in position 4 and L in position 2? And I in position 3.

And the unknown letter is E? But we already know E is in the word? But we didn't know it could be in position 1? 

So I think ""ELITE"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ELITE"".

But to be thorough, is there a word with T in position 1? We had trouble finding one? So ""ELITE"" seems the best bet.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word ends with ""E"" and excludes C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**: S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓) → S and O are absent; T and L are present but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.
   - **Guess 3 (""lithe"")**: L(-), I(-), T(-), H(x), E(✓) → H is absent; L, I, and T are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively.

2. **Consolidate Known Information:**
   - **Secret word format**: `_ _ _ _ E` (position 5 is ""E"").
   - **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O, H.
   - **Confirmed present letters**: T, L, I, E (E is fixed at position 5).
   - **Position constraints**:
     - T must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be in 2 or 3).
     - L must be in position 2 or 3 (cannot be in 1 or 4).
     - I must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be in 2).
   - **Key insight**: The secret word contains exactly 4 unique confirmed letters (T, L, I, E) and one unknown letter (denoted as ""X""). Since E is fixed at position 5, positions 1–4 must contain T, L, I, and X.

3. **Deduce Possible Words:**
   - Given the constraints, valid words must:
     - End with ""E"".
     - Include T, L, I.
     - Exclude C, R, A, N, S, O, H.
     - Place T in 1/4, L in 2/3, and I in 1/3/4 without conflicts.
   - **Analysis of T placement**:
     - If T is in position 1, L must be in position 2 or 3, and I in position 3 or 4. However, common words like ""TLI_E"" (e.g., ""TLICE"") are invalid, and no standard English words fit.
     - If T is in position 4, L can be in 2 or 3, and I in 1 or 3. This yields valid patterns:
       - Pattern 1: `I L X T E` (e.g., ""ILXTE"" – no common words).
       - Pattern 2: `X L I T E` (e.g., ""BLITE"" or ""FLITE"" – obscure/rare).
       - Pattern 3: `I X L T E` (e.g., ""IXLTE"" – no common words).
   - **Discovery of ""ELITE""**:
     - ""ELITE"" (E, L, I, T, E) fits all constraints:
       - Ends with ""E"".
       - Contains T (position 4), L (position 2), I (position 3).
       - Avoids absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O, H).
       - Satisfies position rules: 
         - T in 4 (allowed, not 2/3).
         - L in 2 (allowed, not 1/4).
         - I in 3 (allowed, not 2).
     - E in position 1 is plausible (not tested before; feedback only confirms E at position 5).

4. **Why ""ELITE"" is Optimal for Guess 4**:
   - Tests E in position 1 (new information on potential duplicate E).
   - Verifies positions for T, L, I under constraints.
   - Uses common letters; if incorrect, feedback will resolve positions for T/L/I and reveal if E is duplicated.
   - Avoids wasting guesses on absent letters or invalid positions.

<guess>elite</guess>",elite,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: The secret word has E in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓)
Meaning: S and O are not in the word. T is in the word but not in position 2. L is in the word but not in position 4. E is correct in position 5.

Guess 3: ""lithe"" -> L(-) I(-) T(-) H(x) E(✓)
Meaning: L is in the word but not in position 1. I is in the word but not in position 2. T is in the word but not in position 3. H is not in the word. E is correct in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The secret word is _ _ _ _ E
- Letters that are in the word: T, L, I, E (E is fixed at the end)
- Letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, O, H
- Position constraints:
  - T: not in position 2 (from ""stole"") and not in position 3 (from ""lithe"") -> so T must be in position 1 or 4.
  - L: not in position 4 (from ""stole"") and not in position 1 (from ""lithe"") -> so L must be in position 2 or 3.
  - I: not in position 2 (from ""lithe"") -> so I must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions 1,2,3,4 are open, but we have constraints.

Also, we have three letters that must be placed: T, L, I, and one more unknown letter? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E fixed, and we know T, L, I are present, so that's 4 letters. Therefore, there is one more letter that we haven't identified yet.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains T, L, I
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, O, H
- T is in position 1 or 4
- L is in position 2 or 3
- I is not in position 2 (so in 1, 3, or 4) but note that positions must be assigned without conflict.

Let's list the possible positions:

Position 1: can be T or I (since L cannot be here, and T can be here)
Position 2: can be L (since T and I cannot be here? T cannot be in 2, I cannot be in 2? But L can be in 2)
Position 3: can be L or I (T cannot be in 3)
Position 4: can be T or I (L cannot be in 4)

But note: we have three letters (T, L, I) to place in positions 1,2,3,4 and one more letter (let's call it X) in the remaining position.

The positions must be filled without overlapping.

Possible cases for T:
- If T is in position 1, then:
  - Position 4 must be I or X? But we have to place I and L as well.
  - Position 2 must be L (since L must be in 2 or 3, and if T is in 1, then position 2 is available for L)
  - Then position 3 must be I? Or X? But we have I to place.

Alternatively, if T is in position 4, then:
  - Position 1: cannot be L (L must be in 2 or 3) so must be I or X?
  - Position 2: can be L
  - Position 3: can be L or I

But we must account for the fact that I must be placed and cannot be in position 2? Actually, I can be in 1,3,4? But if T is in 4, then I can be in 1 or 3.

Now, we also have an unknown letter X in one of the positions.

We need to think of words that fit.

List of available letters (excluding absent ones): B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is fixed at the end, so for the first four positions, we have T, L, I, and one from the above).

We can try to form words.

Possible words:

Case 1: T in position 1.
Then:
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: must be L (because L must be in 2 or 3, and if we put L in 2, then position 3 is open for I or X? But I must be placed and cannot be in 2? So if position 2 is L, then I must be in 3 or 4? But position 4 is open? But we have four positions: 1,2,3,4 and three letters: T (used), L (used), and I and one more? So we have two more: I and X.

So if position 1: T, position 2: L, then positions 3 and 4: I and X (unknown) and then position 5: E.

But I cannot be in position 2? But position 2 is taken by L, so I can be in 3 or 4? Yes.

So possible words: T L ? ? E

The word must be T L ? ? E, with the third and fourth letters being I and an unknown letter (from available set) or vice versa.

But we know I is in the word, so one of the two must be I.

Examples:
- T L I ? E -> but what letter? The word must be valid. E.g., ""T L I E E""? Not, only one E at end? And we have two E's? But we don't know if E is duplicated? But we have E at end, and if we put E in position 4? But we don't know if E is duplicated? But in previous feedback, we only know E at position 5 is present? We don't know about other E's? But we have not tested E in other positions? However, we have avoided using E in other positions so far? In ""lithe"", we had no E in other positions? So we don't know.

But we must avoid H, which is absent? So we cannot use H.

Possible words: 
- ""T L I E E"" -> not a word? And we have only 5 letters? T,L,I,E,E -> but that's 5? But ""belie"" is B E L I E? Not starting with T.

What about ""T L I C E""? But C is absent? No.

""T L I D E"" -> ""T L I D E"" is ""slide""? But S is absent? And we have S absent? So no.

""T L I P E"" -> ""tlipe"" not a word? 
""T L I V E"" -> ""tlive"" not a word.

""T L I M E"" -> ""tlime"" not common? But ""lime"" is, but with T? Not a word.

""T L I T E"" -> ""T L I T E"" has two T's? But T is already in position 1? So if the word has two T's? But we don't know? And ""title"" is T I T L E? But that has T at 1 and 3? But in our case, we have T at 1, then L at 2, then I at 3? Then T at 4? But that would be T L I T E? Not a standard word.

So maybe T in position 1 and L in position 2 is not yielding common words? 

Case 2: T in position 1, and L in position 3? But L can be in position 3? Then position 2 must be filled by something else? And I must be placed? 

So positions:
1: T
2: ? (must be X, the unknown letter, because L is in 3 and I is not in 2? But I can be in 4? Or 3? But position 3 is L? So I must be in 4? Or position 2 can be I? But I cannot be in position 2? From feedback: I is not in position 2? So position 2 cannot be I? Therefore, if T is in 1 and L in 3, then position 2 must be X (unknown) and position 4 must be I? Because I must be placed and cannot be in 2? So position 4: I? Then the word is T X L I E.

Now, what words are T X L I E? With X not in absent letters? And not T,L,I,E? But T and L and I are already used? So X is a new letter.

Examples: 
- ""T A L I E"" but A absent? No.
- ""T U L I E"" -> ""tulie"" not a word? 
- ""T B L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T D L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T G L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T M L I E"" -> not a word.
- ""T P L I E"" -> ""tplie"" not a word? But ""plie"" is, but with T? Not.
- ""T W L I E"" -> not a word.

""tulip"" ends with P? Not E.

So not many options.

Therefore, T in position 1 might not be promising.

Now, try T in position 4.

Then:
Position 4: T
Position 5: E

Now, positions 1,2,3 to fill with L, I, and X (unknown).

Constraints:
- L must be in position 2 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 2? So I must be in position 1 or 3? But if L is in position 2, then I cannot be in 2? So I must be in 1 or 3? But position 3 is available? Or if L is in 3, then I can be in 1? 

Subcases:

Subcase 1: L in position 2.
Then:
  Position 2: L
  Position 1: can be I or X? But I cannot be in 2? So position 1 can be I? Or X? And position 3 must be the remaining? But I must be placed? So if position 1 is I, then position 3 is X? If position 1 is X, then position 3 must be I? Because I must be in the word? And cannot be in 2? So position 3 is available for I.

So two possibilities:
  a) Position 1: I, position 2: L, position 3: X, position 4: T, position 5: E -> word: I L X T E
  b) Position 1: X, position 2: L, position 3: I, position 4: T, position 5: E -> word: X L I T E

Subcase 2: L in position 3.
Then:
  Position 3: L
  Position 1: can be I or X? (I cannot be in 2? But position 2 is open? And position 1 can be I? Or X? And position 2 must be X? Or I? But I cannot be in 2? So position 2 must be X? And position 1 must be I? Because I must be placed? So:
  Position 1: I, position 2: X, position 3: L, position 4: T, position 5: E -> word: I X L T E

Now, let's find valid words:

First, for pattern I L X T E:
- What is X? Must be a letter not absent? And not I,L,T,E? So from available: B,D,F,G,K,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we have to form a word.
- Examples: 
  - ""I L K T E"" -> ""ilkte"" not a word.
  - ""I L M T E"" -> ""ilmte"" not a word.
  - ""I L U T E"" -> ""ilute"" not a word.
  - ""I L D T E"" -> ""ildte"" not a word.
  - ""I L E T E"" -> but E is at position 3? And we have E at end? But ""ilete"" not a word? And we don't know if E is duplicated? But we can try? But not a word.

Second pattern: X L I T E
- Examples:
  - ""A L I T E"" but A absent? No.
  - ""B L I T E"" -> ""BLITE"" is a word? Not common? But it is a valid word (e.g., a type of rock or mineral? Or in botany? But let's assume it's acceptable? However, we need common words? But Wordle accepts various words? But let's see if there are better.
  - ""D L I T E"" -> ""dlite"" not a word.
  - ""F L I T E"" -> ""FLITE"" is an old word for quarrel? Or variant of flyte? But it's accepted in some dictionaries? 
  - ""G L I T E"" -> ""glite"" not common? 
  - ""K L I T E"" -> not a word.
  - ""M L I T E"" -> not a word.
  - ""P L I T E"" -> ""PLITE"" not a word? But ""polite"" has O? O is absent? So no.
  - ""U L I T E"" -> ""ulite"" not a word.
  - ""W L I T E"" -> ""wlite"" not a word.
  - ""Y L I T E"" -> not a word.
  - ""Z L I T E"" -> not.

But ""BLITE"" might be acceptable? But let's see if there are more common words.

Third pattern: I X L T E
- Examples:
  - ""I B L T E"" -> ""IBLTE"" not a word.
  - ""I D L T E"" -> ""id lte"" not.
  - ""I F L T E"" -> ""if lte"" not.
  - ""I G L T E"" -> ""IGLTE"" not.
  - ""I K L T E"" -> not.
  - ""I M L T E"" -> ""imlte"" not.
  - ""I P L T E"" -> ""IPLTE"" not.
  - ""I U L T E"" -> ""IULTE"" not.
  - ""I W L T E"" -> not.

But what about ""I M M E E""? Not.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""UTILE""? But U T I L E -> positions: U, T, I, L, E? But T is in position 2? But T cannot be in position 2? From ""stole"", T is not in position 2? So ""UTILE"" has T in position 2? Which is forbidden? So no.

""DEL T I E"" but D E L T I E? 6 letters? Not.

Perhaps we missed a word? 

Another common word: ""T I L E D"" but ends with D? Not E.

""L I T E R"" ends with R? Not E.

But we have the pattern for T in position 4: X L I T E? We have ""ELITE""? But ""ELITE"" is E L I T E? But E is at position 1? And we have E at position 5? So ""ELITE"" has E at 1 and 5? But in our pattern for T in position 4, we have position 1 as X? In ""ELITE"", position 1 is E? So it would be a candidate? But we have not ruled out E in other positions? And we know E is at position 5? But we don't know about other positions? 

But in ""ELITE"", we have:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

Now, check constraints:
- T is in position 4? Allowed? Yes, because T can be in 4.
- L is in position 2? Allowed? Yes, because L can be in 2 or 3.
- I is in position 3? And I cannot be in position 2? Here it is in 3? So allowed? 
- Also, the word has E at position 1? We don't know if that is present? But it might be? And we have not used any absent letters? Absent letters are C,R,A,N,S,O,H? E is not absent? So it's allowed.

But we have feedback from ""lithe"": in ""lithe"", we had I in position 2? And it was marked as present but wrong position? So I is in the word but not in position 2? In ""ELITE"", I is in position 3? Which is fine? And L in position 1 of ""lithe"" was marked as present but wrong position? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? Which is a different position? So it could be.

Also, in ""ELITE"", we have two E's? But that's okay? We don't know if the word has two E's? 

But let's see if it fits the feedback:

From ""stole"": T is present but not in position 2? In ""ELITE"", T is in position 4? So not in 2? Good.
L is present but not in position 4? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? Not 4? Good.

From ""lithe"": L is present but not in position 1? In ""ELITE"", L is in position 2? Not 1? Good.
I is present but not in position 2? In ""ELITE"", I is in position 3? Not 2? Good.
T is present but not in position 3? In ""ELITE"", T is in position 4? Not 3? Good.
H is absent? ""ELITE"" has no H? Good.

And E at end is good.

So ""ELITE"" is a valid candidate? But we didn't think of it earlier because we were avoiding E in position 1? But we don't know that E is not in position 1? 

But in the feedback from ""crane"", we only know E is at position 5? We don't know about other positions? So it could be.

Moreover, ""ELITE"" is a common word.

But we have to make a guess? And it fits all the constraints.

But is there another word? 

What about ""UNTIE""? U N T I E? But N is absent? From guess 1? N is absent? So no.

""UTILE"" has T in position 2? Not allowed.

""DELVE"" has no T or L? Must have both.

""BELIE"" has B E L I E? But no T? Must have T.

So ""ELITE"" seems a strong candidate.

But in ""ELITE"", we have E in position 1? If we guess it, we might get feedback.

But we are not sure if E is in position 1? But it might be.

Another word: ""EXILE""? X is not absent? But ""EXILE"" is E X I L E? Positions: E, X, I, L, E? 
- T is not in the word? But we need T? So no.

""EDILE"" is E D I L E? But no T? So no.

So ""ELITE"" is a good guess.

But let's see the pattern I X L T E? We didn't find a word? But ""ELITE"" is not in that pattern? It is E L I T E? Which is position 1: E, 2: L, 3: I, 4: T, 5: E.

So it fits the pattern of having T in position 4 and L in position 2? And I in position 3.

And the unknown letter is E? But we already know E is in the word? But we didn't know it could be in position 1? 

So I think ""ELITE"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ELITE"".

But to be thorough, is there a word with T in position 1? We had trouble finding one? So ""ELITE"" seems the best bet.

<guess>elite</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word ends with ""E"" and excludes C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**: S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓) → S and O are absent; T and L are present but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.
   - **Guess 3 (""lithe"")**: L(-), I(-), T(-), H(x), E(✓) → H is absent; L, I, and T are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively.

2. **Consolidate Known Information:**
   - **Secret word format**: `_ _ _ _ E` (position 5 is ""E"").
   - **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O, H.
   - **Confirmed present letters**: T, L, I, E (E is fixed at position 5).
   - **Position constraints**:
     - T must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be in 2 or 3).
     - L must be in position 2 or 3 (cannot be in 1 or 4).
     - I must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be in 2).
   - **Key insight**: The secret word contains exactly 4 unique confirmed letters (T, L, I, E) and one unknown letter (denoted as ""X""). Since E is fixed at position 5, positions 1–4 must contain T, L, I, and X.

3. **Deduce Possible Words:**
   - Given the constraints, valid words must:
     - End with ""E"".
     - Include T, L, I.
     - Exclude C, R, A, N, S, O, H.
     - Place T in 1/4, L in 2/3, and I in 1/3/4 without conflicts.
   - **Analysis of T placement**:
     - If T is in position 1, L must be in position 2 or 3, and I in position 3 or 4. However, common words like ""TLI_E"" (e.g., ""TLICE"") are invalid, and no standard English words fit.
     - If T is in position 4, L can be in 2 or 3, and I in 1 or 3. This yields valid patterns:
       - Pattern 1: `I L X T E` (e.g., ""ILXTE"" – no common words).
       - Pattern 2: `X L I T E` (e.g., ""BLITE"" or ""FLITE"" – obscure/rare).
       - Pattern 3: `I X L T E` (e.g., ""IXLTE"" – no common words).
   - **Discovery of ""ELITE""**:
     - ""ELITE"" (E, L, I, T, E) fits all constraints:
       - Ends with ""E"".
       - Contains T (position 4), L (position 2), I (position 3).
       - Avoids absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O, H).
       - Satisfies position rules: 
         - T in 4 (allowed, not 2/3).
         - L in 2 (allowed, not 1/4).
         - I in 3 (allowed, not 2).
     - E in position 1 is plausible (not tested before; feedback only confirms E at position 5).

4. **Why ""ELITE"" is Optimal for Guess 4**:
   - Tests E in position 1 (new information on potential duplicate E).
   - Verifies positions for T, L, I under constraints.
   - Uses common letters; if incorrect, feedback will resolve positions for T/L/I and reveal if E is duplicated.
   - Avoids wasting guesses on absent letters or invalid positions.",Guess 4: elite -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) L(✓) I(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
