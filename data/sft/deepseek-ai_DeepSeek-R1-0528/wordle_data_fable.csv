We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

Therefore, we know:
  - The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
  - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Ends with E (because E is confirmed in the 5th position).
  - Contains the letter A (but not in the third position? Actually, in the feedback, A was in position 3 and got '-', so A is in the word but not at position 3. However, it could be in any other position except 3? Actually, we don't know the other positions yet. But note: the word has 5 letters, so A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be at position 5. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
  - Does not contain C, R, or N.

Also, note that we have only one confirmed letter (E at the end) and one present letter (A, but not at position 3).

We should try to use a word that has A in a different position and also includes other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

We can try to put A in the first position? For example, words starting with A and ending with E: like ""ABUSE"", ""ABASE"", ""AGAPE"", etc. But we don't know if A is at the start.

Alternatively, we can put A in the second position? Like ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", etc.

Or in the fourth position? Like ""CAUSE"" (but C is not allowed) or ""PAUSE"" (P is allowed).

But note: we must avoid C, R, N.

Let me list some candidate words:

- With A in position 1: 
  - AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> but we have two A's? The feedback only told us one A is present? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. But the feedback for ""crane"" had only one A and it was marked present. So there is at least one A. But it could be more? We don't know. However, we can try words with one A to start.

  Words: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, etc.

- With A in position 2:
  - SAUTE: S, A, U, T, E
  - PASTE: P, A, S, T, E
  - BASTE: B, A, S, T, E

- With A in position 4:
  - PHASE: P, H, A, S, E
  - CHASE: but C is not allowed -> invalid.
  - SHADE: S, H, A, D, E

But note: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

We have to avoid the letters C, R, N.

I think a good candidate is ""PASTE"" because:
  - It ends with E (so the E is in the correct position).
  - It has A in the second position (which is a new position for A, so we can check if A is there).
  - It uses common letters: P, A, S, T, E.

Alternatively, ""SAUTE"" is also good.

But note: we have the letter E already confirmed at the end, so we don't need to test E again. We are more interested in testing new letters and the position of A.

Another candidate: ""SLATE"" -> but we have to avoid R? Wait, no R in ""SLATE"". But we have an A in the third position? But in the first guess, A was in the third position and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an A, but not in the third position. Therefore, we cannot put A in the third position again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in the third position.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" has A in the third position -> not good.

Similarly, ""PASTE"" has A in the second position -> good.

But wait, what about the letter S? We don't know if S is in the word. Similarly, T and P are new.

So I think ""PASTE"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can try ""ABASE"" to test A at the beginning? But that has two A's? Actually, ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> two A's. The feedback from the first guess only showed one A, but it could have two? We don't know. However, if we use ""ABASE"", we are testing A at position 1 and 3. But we already know that A is not at position 3 (from the first feedback). So if the word has only one A, then the A at position 1 would be the one, and the A at position 3 would be redundant and might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback for the second A would be: if the word has only one A, then the second A would be marked as absent? But we don't want to waste a letter.

So perhaps ""PASTE"" is better.

Another candidate: ""ADAGE"" -> A, D, A, G, E -> again two A's. And we don't know if there are two A's.

To avoid confusion, let's pick a word with only one A.

For example: ""PAUSE"" -> P, A, U, S, E -> but A is in the second position? Actually, in ""PAUSE"", the A is in the second position? Let me check: P-A-U-S-E -> yes, A is at position 2. But we have U and S. Also, we avoid C, R, N.

But ""PAUSE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> but A is in the third position? We know A is not in the third position, so we should avoid that.

So ""PLATE"" is not good.

What about ""SAUCE""? But C is not allowed -> invalid.

So let's go with ""PASTE"": 
  P, A, S, T, E

This way:
  - We test A in position 2 (which is a new position).
  - We test the letters P, S, T (which are new and common).

If the secret word has A in position 2, then we get a check. If not, then we know A must be in position 1 or 4.

So I choose ""PASTE"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""PASTE"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, my second guess is ""PASTE"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".
- **A** is present in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- **C**, **R**, and **N** are absent from the word (x).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"".
- It must include ""A"" (but not in the 3rd position, and possibly in position 1, 2, or 4).
- It should avoid ""C"", ""R"", and ""N"".
- To maximize information, I chose a word with new common letters (P, S, T) and placed ""A"" in the 2nd position to test a new location.

Alternatively, ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> but A is in the third position? We know A is not in the third position, so we should avoid that.

So ""PLATE"" is not good.

What about ""SAUCE""? But C is not allowed -> invalid.

So let's go with ""PASTE"": 
  P, A, S, T, E

This way:
  - We test A in position 2 (which is a new position).
  - We test the letters P, S, T (which are new and common).

If the secret word has A in position 2, then we get a check. If not, then we know A must be in position 1 or 4.

So I choose ""PASTE"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""PASTE"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, my second guess is ""PASTE"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".
- **A** is present in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- **C**, **R**, and **N** are absent from the word (x).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"".
- It must include ""A"" (but not in the 3rd position, and possibly in position 1, 2, or 4).
- It should avoid ""C"", ""R"", and ""N"".
- To maximize information, I chose a word with new common letters (P, S, T) and placed ""A"" in the 2nd position to test a new location.

For example, words starting with A and ending with E: like ""ABUSE"", ""ABASE"", ""AGAPE"", etc. But we don\'t know if A is at the start.\n\nAlternatively, we can put A in the second position? Like ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", etc.\n\nOr in the fourth position? Like ""CAUSE"" (but C is not allowed) or ""PAUSE"" (P is allowed).\n\nBut note: we must avoid C, R, N.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- With A in position 1: \n  - AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> but we have two A\'s? The feedback only told us one A is present? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s. But the feedback for ""crane"" had only one A and it was marked present. So there is at least one A. But it could be more? We don\'t know. However, we can try words with one A to start.\n\n  Words: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, etc.\n\n- With A in position 2:\n  - SAUTE: S, A, U, T, E\n  - PASTE: P, A, S, T, E\n  - BASTE: B, A, S, T, E\n\n- With A in position 4:\n  - PHASE: P, H, A, S, E\n  - CHASE: but C is not allowed -> invalid.\n  - SHADE: S, H, A, D, E\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nWe have to avoid the letters C, R, N.\n\nI think a good candidate is ""PASTE"" because:\n  - It ends with E (so the E is in the correct position).\n  - It has A in the second position (which is a new position for A, so we can check if A is there).\n  - It uses common letters: P, A, S, T, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""SAUTE"" is also good.\n\nBut note: we have the letter E already confirmed at the end, so we don\'t need to test E again. We are more interested in testing new letters and the position of A.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SLATE"" -> but we have to avoid R? Wait, no R in ""SLATE"". But we have an A in the third position? But in the first guess, A was in the third position and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an A, but not in the third position. Therefore, we cannot put A in the third position again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nTherefore, ""SLATE"" has A in the third position -> not good.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"" has A in the second position -> good.\n\nBut wait, what about the letter S? We don\'t know if S is in the word. Similarly, T and P are new.\n\nSo I think ""PASTE"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ABASE"" to test A at the beginning? But that has two A\'s? Actually, ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> two A\'s. The feedback from the first guess only showed one A, but it could have two? We don\'t know. However, if we use ""ABASE"", we are testing A at position 1 and 3. But we already know that A is not at position 3 (from the first feedback). So if the word has only one A, then the A at position 1 would be the one, and the A at position 3 would be redundant and might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback for the second A would be: if the word has only one A, then the second A would be marked as absent? But we don\'t want to waste a letter.\n\nSo perhaps ""PASTE"" is better.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ADAGE"" -> A, D, A, G, E -> again two A\'s. And we don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s pick a word with only one A.\n\nFor example: ""PAUSE"" -> P, A, U, S, E -> but A is in the second position? Actually, in ""PAUSE"", the A is in the second position? Let me check: P-A-U-S-E -> yes, A is at position 2. But we have U and S. Also, we avoid C, R, N.\n\nBut ""PAUSE"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> but A is in the third position? We know A is not in the third position, so we should avoid that.\n\nSo ""PLATE"" is not good.\n\nWhat about ""SAUCE""? But C is not allowed -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PASTE"": \n  P, A, S, T, E\n\nThis way:\n  - We test A in position 2 (which is a new position).\n  - We test the letters P, S, T (which are new and common).\n\nIf the secret word has A in position 2, then we get a check.

We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: - (present, but wrong position; not in position 3)
  N: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Guess 2: ""paste""
  P: x (absent)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the 2nd letter is A)
  S: x (absent)
  T: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Now we know:
- The secret word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letter A is now confirmed to be in the 2nd position (so the '-' from the first guess was because it was in the wrong position, and now we know it's fixed at position 2).
- We have confirmed that the following letters are absent: C, R, N, P, S, T (from both guesses: C, R, N, P, S, T are all absent).
- The only confirmed present letters are A (at position 2) and E (at position 5).

We need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ _ E and does not contain the absent letters: C, R, N, P, S, T.

We also know from the first guess that A was present but not in position 3, but now we have fixed it at position 2, so that condition is satisfied.

Now, what letters can we use? We have to avoid: C, R, N, P, S, T.

We can use other common letters such as: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ E.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern and use only the allowed letters.

Some possibilities:

- The first blank: can be any letter except the absent ones and except A (since A is already in position 2, but the first letter could be A? But note: we don't have any information about the first letter. However, if the first letter were A, then in the first guess ""crane"" the A was in position 3 and marked present, but that doesn't prevent the word from having an A in position 1. However, in the second guess we have A in position 2 and it was correct, so if the word had an A in position 1, then we would have two A's? But we don't know that. The feedback from the first guess only showed one A (in position 3) and that was marked present, but it could be that the word has two A's? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have duplicates in the guess. In ""crane"", we had one A and it was present. In ""paste"", we had one A and it was correct. So if the word has two A's, we wouldn't know. But we must consider the possibility.

However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one A. But for now, let's try to find words without the forbidden letters.

Common words with pattern _ A _ _ E:

- ""HALVE"": H A L V E -> but we don't know if L, V are in the word? But we can use it to test new letters.
- ""DANCE"": but D A N C E -> N and C are absent -> invalid.
- ""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> letters M, U, V are not forbidden? Let's check: absent letters are C, R, N, P, S, T. So M, U, V are allowed.
- ""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> two F's? 
- ""BAYLE"": not common? 
- ""VALVE"": V A L V E -> but L and V are allowed? 
- ""WACKY"": but not ending with E.

But note: we are avoiding C, R, N, P, S, T.

Let me list some words:

- ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> I and Z are allowed? But Z is less common. However, it's a valid word.
- ""BAYLE"": not a word? 
- ""HASTE"": but S and T are absent -> invalid.
- ""LATHE"": but T is absent -> invalid.

Another idea: ""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> but the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so M A Y B E -> that's M in first, A in second, Y in third, B in fourth, E in fifth. And letters: M, Y, B are allowed (not in the absent list).

But is ""MAYBE"" a 5-letter word? Yes.

Other words:
- ""GAZED"": but D is allowed? But the pattern must end with E, not D. So invalid.
- ""GAMME"": not a common word? 
- ""JAZZY"": doesn't end with E.

We need to focus on words that have the pattern and use common letters to get more information.

We have two confirmed letters: A at 2 and E at 5. We need to guess the 1st, 3rd, and 4th letters.

We should try to use a word that has common letters in the unknown positions to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: L, I, O, U, D, M, B, G, etc.

Let me try to form words:

- ""TABLE"": but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> but P is absent -> invalid.
- ""MALE"": too short? We need 5 letters: M A L _ E -> but that's 4 letters? No, M A L E is 4. We need 5: so ""MAPLE"" is 5 but P is absent.

Another: ""BAKER"": B A K E R -> but R is absent -> invalid.

""BAGEL"": B A G E L -> but the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so the fourth letter must be the one before E. In ""BAGEL"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:G, 4:E, 5:L -> but that would be _ A G E L, but we need the fifth to be E? So it doesn't fit.

We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must end with E.

So the pattern is: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We can think of words like:
- ""DANCE"": invalid because of N and C.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> letters F, B, L are allowed? Yes, because F, B, L are not in the absent list (absent: C, R, N, P, S, T). So ""FABLE"" is a candidate.

Similarly:
- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> G, B, L allowed.
- ""MABLE"": not a word? 
- ""SABLE"": but S is absent -> invalid.

So ""FABLE"" and ""GABLE"" are candidates.

Also:
- ""HABLE"": not a word.
- ""TABLE"": T absent -> invalid.
- ""CABAL"": doesn't end with E.

Another: ""AMAZE"": A M A Z E -> but then the first letter is A? So the pattern is A A _ _ E? But we have two A's? And the third letter is Z? So ""AMAZE"": A(1) M(2) but wait, the second letter must be A, so if we put A in first and second, then the word is A A ...? But ""AMAZE"" is A in first, M in second? That doesn't have A in second? Actually, ""AMAZE"": A (position1), M (position2), A (position3), Z (position4), E (position5). So the second letter is M, not A. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the second letter to be A. So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] E.

So ""FABLE"": F (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) -> fits.

Similarly, ""GABLE"": G (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5).

Also, ""BAYLE"" is not a word. But ""BAKKE"" not a word.

Another: ""MAYBE"": M (1), A (2), Y (3), B (4), E (5) -> fits.

Also, ""HAZEL"": H (1), A (2), Z (3), E (4), L (5) -> but then the fourth letter is E? Then the fifth is L, but we need the fifth to be E. So it doesn't fit.

""HAZEL"" is H A Z E L -> so the fifth letter is L, not E. So invalid.

""JAZZE"" not a word.

""VALVE"": V (1), A (2), L (3), V (4), E (5) -> fits? But ""VALVE"" is a word? Yes, and it ends with E. And V, L are allowed.

Similarly, ""HALVE"": H (1), A (2), L (3), V (4), E (5).

So we have several candidates: FABLE, GABLE, MAYBE, VALVE, HALVE.

We want to choose one that uses common letters to get more information. Since we have three positions to guess (1,3,4) and we have many letters to test, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

In the candidates:
- FABLE: tests F, B, L
- GABLE: tests G, B, L
- MAYBE: tests M, Y, B
- VALVE: tests V, L, V (duplicate V) -> but we don't know if V is in the word, and duplicate might not be efficient.
- HALVE: tests H, L, V

We should avoid duplicates if possible? But VALVE has two V's, which might not be ideal for information gathering.

So let's consider FABLE, GABLE, MAYBE, HALVE.

We can also consider other words like ""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> tests G, F, F (duplicate F) -> not ideal.

""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> tests M, I, Z -> Z is less common.

I think ""MAYBE"" is a good choice because it tests M, Y, B which are common and we haven't tried.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was present, but now we have fixed A in position 2. So if the word has only one A, then we are safe. But if it has two A's, then we might miss it? However, we are testing with only one A (in position 2) and the other letters are not A, so we won't get information about a second A. But that's okay because we can deduce from the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has an A in a different position? But we already know A is in position 2, so we don't need to test A again. We are only testing the other positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that A was present but not in position 3. Now we have A in position 2. If the word has a second A, we don't know. But we are not testing for that. We can only handle one step at a time.

So I think ""MAYBE"" is a good guess.

But let me check if ""MAYBE"" is allowed: M, A, Y, B, E. Absent letters are C, R, N, P, S, T. So all are allowed.

Another candidate: ""BAYLE"" is not a word, so no.

""DAILY"": but doesn't end with E.

So I'll go with ""MAYBE"".

But wait, what about ""FABLE""? It tests F and B and L, which are also common.

We can choose either. But let's see which one covers more common letters.

In terms of letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we have to avoid T, N, S, R. So the next are A (already known), O, I, H, D, L, U.

So we should try to include O, I, H, D, L, U.

In ""MAYBE"": M, Y, B -> M is 12th, Y is 20th, B is 4th? Actually, in word games, we often use frequency in the word list.

But for now, let's consider:

- ""HALVE"": H, L, V -> H is common, L is common, V is less common.
- ""FABLE"": F, B, L -> F is common, B is common, L is common.
- ""GABLE"": G, B, L -> G is common, B, L common.
- ""MAYBE"": M, Y, B -> M common, Y less common, B common.

So ""FABLE"" and ""GABLE"" test three common letters (F/B/L or G/B/L) and ""MAYBE"" tests M and B (with Y being less common).

But note: we have the letter L in both FABLE and GABLE, which is very common.

Alternatively, we can try a word with O or I? For example:

- ""OAKEN"": but O A K E N -> but N is absent -> invalid.
- ""OASIS"": doesn't end with E and has S -> invalid.
- ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> I is common, but Z is not. Pattern: M A I Z E -> so first letter M, third I, fourth Z.

But Z is not common.

- ""RAISE"": but R and S are absent -> invalid.
- ""DAISE"": not a word.

Another word: ""ALIVE"": A L I V E -> but the second letter must be A? In ""ALIVE"": A (1), L (2), I (3), V (4), E (5). So the second letter is L, not A. So it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be A.

""AGILE"": A G I L E -> A (1), G (2), ... -> second letter is G, not A.

So it's hard to get O or I in the first position.

What about ""HASTE"": but S and T absent.

I think ""FABLE"" is a good choice because it has F, B, L which are common and not yet tested.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" is good too.

But note: we have to avoid P, S, T, and T is absent, so we can't use T.

I'll go with ""FABLE"".

But let me confirm: ""FABLE"" is a valid word.

So my third guess is ""FABLE"".

But wait, in the pattern, the fourth letter in ""FABLE"" is L, and then E. So it's F A B L E.

We are testing:
- F in position 1
- B in position 3
- L in position 4

If we get feedback, we will know about these letters.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a vowel in the third or fourth position to get more coverage? But we already have two vowels (A and E) and we don't know about others.

But I think ""FABLE"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - E is in the correct position (5th letter).  
  - A is present but not in the 3rd position.  
  - C, R, and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""paste""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), S(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - A is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
  - E is in the correct position (5th letter).  
  - P, S, and T are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E` (2nd letter is A, 5th letter is E).  
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, P, S, T**.  
- We need to guess the 1st, 3rd, and 4th letters using remaining letters (avoiding the absent ones).  
- Focus on common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, V, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ A _ _ E` and uses new, common letters to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters like B, L, M, and F.  
- **Selected word: ""FABLE""** (F, A, B, L, E):  
  - Tests F in position 1, B in position 3, and L in position 4.  
  - All letters are allowed (no C, R, N, P, S, T).  
  - Common letters like B, L, and F provide good coverage for potential matches.

However, in the second guess we have A in position 2 and it was correct, so if the word had an A in position 1, then we would have two A's? But we don't know that. The feedback from the first guess only showed one A (in position 3) and that was marked present, but it could be that the word has two A's? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have duplicates in the guess. In ""crane"", we had one A and it was present. In ""paste"", we had one A and it was correct. So if the word has two A's, we wouldn't know. But we must consider the possibility.

However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one A. But for now, let's try to find words without the forbidden letters.

Common words with pattern _ A _ _ E:

- ""HALVE"": H A L V E -> but we don't know if L, V are in the word? But we can use it to test new letters.
- ""DANCE"": but D A N C E -> N and C are absent -> invalid.
- ""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> letters M, U, V are not forbidden? Let's check: absent letters are C, R, N, P, S, T. So M, U, V are allowed.
- ""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> two F's? 
- ""BAYLE"": not common? 
- ""VALVE"": V A L V E -> but L and V are allowed? 
- ""WACKY"": but not ending with E.

But note: we are avoiding C, R, N, P, S, T.

Let me list some words:

- ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> I and Z are allowed? But Z is less common. However, it's a valid word.
- ""BAYLE"": not a word? 
- ""HASTE"": but S and T are absent -> invalid.
- ""LATHE"": but T is absent -> invalid.

Another idea: ""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> but the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so M A Y B E -> that's M in first, A in second, Y in third, B in fourth, E in fifth. And letters: M, Y, B are allowed (not in the absent list).

But is ""MAYBE"" a 5-letter word? Yes.

Other words:
- ""GAZED"": but D is allowed? But the pattern must end with E, not D. So invalid.
- ""GAMME"": not a common word? 
- ""JAZZY"": doesn't end with E.

We need to focus on words that have the pattern and use common letters to get more information.

We have two confirmed letters: A at 2 and E at 5. We need to guess the 1st, 3rd, and 4th letters.

We should try to use a word that has common letters in the unknown positions to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: L, I, O, U, D, M, B, G, etc.

Let me try to form words:

- ""TABLE"": but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> but P is absent -> invalid.
- ""MALE"": too short? We need 5 letters: M A L _ E -> but that's 4 letters? No, M A L E is 4. We need 5: so ""MAPLE"" is 5 but P is absent.

Another: ""BAKER"": B A K E R -> but R is absent -> invalid.

""BAGEL"": B A G E L -> but the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so the fourth letter must be the one before E. In ""BAGEL"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:G, 4:E, 5:L -> but that would be _ A G E L, but we need the fifth to be E? So it doesn't fit.

We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must end with E.

So the pattern is: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We can think of words like:
- ""DANCE"": invalid because of N and C.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> letters F, B, L are allowed? Yes, because F, B, L are not in the absent list (absent: C, R, N, P, S, T). So ""FABLE"" is a candidate.

Similarly:
- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> G, B, L allowed.
- ""MABLE"": not a word? 
- ""SABLE"": but S is absent -> invalid.

So ""FABLE"" and ""GABLE"" are candidates.

Also:
- ""HABLE"": not a word.
- ""TABLE"": T absent -> invalid.
- ""CABAL"": doesn't end with E.

Another: ""AMAZE"": A M A Z E -> but then the first letter is A? So the pattern is A A _ _ E? But we have two A's? And the third letter is Z? So ""AMAZE"": A(1) M(2) but wait, the second letter must be A, so if we put A in first and second, then the word is A A ...? But ""AMAZE"" is A in first, M in second? That doesn't have A in second? Actually, ""AMAZE"": A (position1), M (position2), A (position3), Z (position4), E (position5). So the second letter is M, not A. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the second letter to be A. So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] E.

So ""FABLE"": F (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) -> fits.

Similarly, ""GABLE"": G (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5).

Also, ""BAYLE"" is not a word. But ""BAKKE"" not a word.

Another: ""MAYBE"": M (1), A (2), Y (3), B (4), E (5) -> fits.

Also, ""HAZEL"": H (1), A (2), Z (3), E (4), L (5) -> but then the fourth letter is E? Then the fifth is L, but we need the fifth to be E. So it doesn't fit.

""HAZEL"" is H A Z E L -> so the fifth letter is L, not E. So invalid.

""JAZZE"" not a word.

""VALVE"": V (1), A (2), L (3), V (4), E (5) -> fits? But ""VALVE"" is a word? Yes, and it ends with E. And V, L are allowed.

Similarly, ""HALVE"": H (1), A (2), L (3), V (4), E (5).

So we have several candidates: FABLE, GABLE, MAYBE, VALVE, HALVE.

We want to choose one that uses common letters to get more information. Since we have three positions to guess (1,3,4) and we have many letters to test, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

In the candidates:
- FABLE: tests F, B, L
- GABLE: tests G, B, L
- MAYBE: tests M, Y, B
- VALVE: tests V, L, V (duplicate V) -> but we don't know if V is in the word, and duplicate might not be efficient.
- HALVE: tests H, L, V

We should avoid duplicates if possible? But VALVE has two V's, which might not be ideal for information gathering.

So let's consider FABLE, GABLE, MAYBE, HALVE.

We can also consider other words like ""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> tests G, F, F (duplicate F) -> not ideal.

""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> tests M, I, Z -> Z is less common.

I think ""MAYBE"" is a good choice because it tests M, Y, B which are common and we haven't tried.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was present, but now we have fixed A in position 2. So if the word has only one A, then we are safe. But if it has two A's, then we might miss it? However, we are testing with only one A (in position 2) and the other letters are not A, so we won't get information about a second A. But that's okay because we can deduce from the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has an A in a different position? But we already know A is in position 2, so we don't need to test A again. We are only testing the other positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that A was present but not in position 3. Now we have A in position 2. If the word has a second A, we don't know. But we are not testing for that. We can only handle one step at a time.

So I think ""MAYBE"" is a good guess.

But let me check if ""MAYBE"" is allowed: M, A, Y, B, E. Absent letters are C, R, N, P, S, T. So all are allowed.

Another candidate: ""BAYLE"" is not a word, so no.

""DAILY"": but doesn't end with E.

So I'll go with ""MAYBE"".

But wait, what about ""FABLE""? It tests F and B and L, which are also common.

We can choose either. But let's see which one covers more common letters.

In terms of letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we have to avoid T, N, S, R. So the next are A (already known), O, I, H, D, L, U.

So we should try to include O, I, H, D, L, U.

In ""MAYBE"": M, Y, B -> M is 12th, Y is 20th, B is 4th? Actually, in word games, we often use frequency in the word list.

But for now, let's consider:

- ""HALVE"": H, L, V -> H is common, L is common, V is less common.
- ""FABLE"": F, B, L -> F is common, B is common, L is common.
- ""GABLE"": G, B, L -> G is common, B, L common.
- ""MAYBE"": M, Y, B -> M common, Y less common, B common.

So ""FABLE"" and ""GABLE"" test three common letters (F/B/L or G/B/L) and ""MAYBE"" tests M and B (with Y being less common).

But note: we have the letter L in both FABLE and GABLE, which is very common.

Alternatively, we can try a word with O or I? For example:

- ""OAKEN"": but O A K E N -> but N is absent -> invalid.
- ""OASIS"": doesn't end with E and has S -> invalid.
- ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> I is common, but Z is not. Pattern: M A I Z E -> so first letter M, third I, fourth Z.

But Z is not common.

- ""RAISE"": but R and S are absent -> invalid.
- ""DAISE"": not a word.

Another word: ""ALIVE"": A L I V E -> but the second letter must be A? In ""ALIVE"": A (1), L (2), I (3), V (4), E (5). So the second letter is L, not A. So it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be A.

""AGILE"": A G I L E -> A (1), G (2), ... -> second letter is G, not A.

So it's hard to get O or I in the first position.

What about ""HASTE"": but S and T absent.

I think ""FABLE"" is a good choice because it has F, B, L which are common and not yet tested.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" is good too.

But note: we have to avoid P, S, T, and T is absent, so we can't use T.

I'll go with ""FABLE"".

But let me confirm: ""FABLE"" is a valid word.

So my third guess is ""FABLE"".

But wait, in the pattern, the fourth letter in ""FABLE"" is L, and then E. So it's F A B L E.

We are testing:
- F in position 1
- B in position 3
- L in position 4

If we get feedback, we will know about these letters.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a vowel in the third or fourth position to get more coverage? But we already have two vowels (A and E) and we don't know about others.

But I think ""FABLE"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - E is in the correct position (5th letter).  
  - A is present but not in the 3rd position.  
  - C, R, and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""paste""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), S(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - A is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
  - E is in the correct position (5th letter).  
  - P, S, and T are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E` (2nd letter is A, 5th letter is E).  
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, P, S, T**.  
- We need to guess the 1st, 3rd, and 4th letters using remaining letters (avoiding the absent ones).  
- Focus on common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, V, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ A _ _ E` and uses new, common letters to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters like B, L, M, and F.  
- **Selected word: ""FABLE""** (F, A, B, L, E):  
  - Tests F in position 1, B in position 3, and L in position 4.  
  - All letters are allowed (no C, R, N, P, S, T).  
  - Common letters like B, L, and F provide good coverage for potential matches.",Guess 3: fable -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) B(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
