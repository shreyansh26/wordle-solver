First, I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any previous feedback to go on. I should choose a word that covers common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback.

Common letters in English words are vowels like A, E, I, O, U and frequent consonants like R, S, T, L, N. I recall that in Wordle, a good starting word often includes several vowels and common consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities.

A popular first guess in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which includes two vowels (A and E) and common consonants. Another one is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E.

But I need to ensure it's a valid English word. Words like ""SOARE"" aren't common, so I should stick to familiar words.

Possible good first guesses:
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O — this has many vowels, but might miss consonants.
- STERN: S, T, E, R, N — good coverage.

""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has R, A, I, S, E — three vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants like R and S.

Similarly, ""ARISE"" or ""ROATE"".

""ROATE"" might not be very common; better to use a standard one.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a solid choice. It has the letters C, R, A, N, E.

C and R are common consonants, A and E are vowels, and N is also frequent.

After guessing, I'll get feedback like symbols for each position, which will help me narrow down for future guesses.

But since this is the first guess, I just need to make a educated choice.

Response format: I must think step by step within <thinking> tags, then provide the guess in <guess> tags.

So step-by-step thinking:
- No prior feedback, so choose a word that maximizes information gain.
- Opt for a word with diverse, common letters and no repeats to cover more ground.
- ""CRANE"" is a good option: letters C, R, A, N, E.
- Alternatives: ""SLATE"" (S,L,A,T,E), ""CRATE"" (C,R,A,T,E), but I've seen ""CRANE"" used often.
- ""DEUCE"" might have less common letters, so probably not.
- Aim for high-frequency letters: E is the most common letter, then A, R, etc.
- According to letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are top.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E — five of the top letters.
- Similarly, ""SOARE"" but that might not be great.
- I think ""RAISE"" could be better than ""CRANE"" because it has more high-frequency letters.

Letter frequency in English:
1. E
2. A
3. R
4. I
5. O
6. T
7. N
8. S
Etc.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E — so positions: E is common, A common, I common, S common, R common. Wait, RAISE: R, A, I, S, E — all top letters.

""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E — C is less common than S or I, N is common but S might be better.

S is more frequent than C. Frequency: E (11%), A (8.5%), R (7.6%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.6%), S (5.7%), etc. C is around 2.8%, so higher than some but S is better.

In terms of vowel/consonant balance, ""RAISE"" has three vowels A,I,E and two consonants R,S.

""CRANE"" has vowels A,E and consonants C,R,N.

""SLATE"" has vowels A,E and consonants S,L,T.

""ROAST"" is another option.

But for information gain, having distinct letters is key, so no repeats. All these examples have no repeats, which is good.

I think either is fine; I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses 5 very common letters.

- This increases the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The word should have common letters and no repeated letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (based on frequency) are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

Some classic starting words are:
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- ROAST: R, O, A, S, T

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). The letters R, A, I, S, E are all in the top 10 most common letters in English.

Therefore, I will choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

Note: The response format requires the guess to be in <guess> tags. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback to consider.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- It uses distinct letters (no repeats), covering five different positions.

We are making the first guess, so no prior feedback exists. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repeating letters.

<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E.
- All five letters are among the most common in English (E ~11%, A ~8.5%, R ~7.6%, I ~7.3%, S ~5.7%).
- This combination provides broad coverage across vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S), which increases the likelihood of revealing matching letters in the secret word.

Alternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also solid choices, but ""RAISE"" has a slightly higher frequency score due to the inclusion of ""I"" (more common than ""C"" or ""L""). ""RAISE"" is a valid English word, ensuring it's accepted.

By selecting this word, I can use the feedback (✓, -, or x) to refine subsequent guesses efficiently.

We are provided with feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- R: present but wrong position (marked as -)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: present but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, I, E (all in wrong positions)
- Does not contain A or S
- Letters known to be present: R, I, E
- Letters known to be absent: A, S

Now, since R, I, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (as in ""RAISE""), we must avoid placing them in these positions in the next guess.

Positions in RAISE:
1: R -> wrong position (so R cannot be in position 1)
2: A -> absent (so A not in word)
3: I -> wrong position (so I cannot be in position 3)
4: S -> absent (so S not in word)
5: E -> wrong position (so E cannot be in position 5)

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include R, I, E (since they are present per feedback).
- Must exclude A and S (since they are absent).
- Do not put R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- We have three known letters: R, I, E. We need to add two more letters that are not A or S (and not already used). Also, avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Possible new letters: Try common letters that haven't been ruled out. From common frequency: O, T, N, L, C, U, etc. Avoid A and S.

Candidates:
- Include R, I, E and two other letters from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} - excluding A, S.

Considering words that contain R, I, E and satisfy the position constraints.

Try to form a word:
- Options: 
  - Could be something like ""PRICE"", but P and C are allowed? 
  - But ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E. 
  - Positions: R would be in position 2 (not 1, allowed). I in position 3? But feedback said I was wrong in position 3, so cannot put I in 3? Actually, the feedback means that in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but it might be elsewhere. So in the next guess, we can put I in another position to test.

Constraints for next guess positions:
- Position 1: cannot be R (but could be I or E? Since they were not in their original positions, but R was in 1 and that was wrong, so avoid R at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be I (since that was wrong)
- Position 5: cannot be E (since that was wrong)

But E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Not 5, so 1-4.
Similarly, R: anywhere but 1? Actually, R might be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly I: anywhere but 3? So positions 1,2,4,5.

Also, we don't know the exact positions, so we need a word that shuffles R, I, E to other positions.

Try common words: 
- Consider words starting with E? Since E might be at start? But E was at position 5 and wrong, but could it be at position 1? Yes! We don't have info about E except not at 5.

Examples of words with R, I, E and without A, S:
- ""CRIER"" - but might have repeated R? C, R, I, E, R -> has two R's, which is less information efficient because it uses a repeated letter. Prefer distinct letters if possible.
- ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> letters are distinct. Positions: D at 1, R at 2, I at 3 -> but I cannot be at position 3 (feedback from guess 1: I was at position 3 and was wrong position). So cannot have I in position 3 in next guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient because we know I is not at 3. Why test the same position? We should try a different position for I? To get new information.

Best to test I in a new position: position 1,2,4,5 because position 3 is ruled out.

Similarly, E cannot be in 5, so position 1,2,3,4.

Thus for ""DRIVE"":
- Position 3 is I: which is not allowed because I was wrong in position 3. Therefore, avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R in position 1 and E in position 5.

So ""DRIVE"" places I at position 3: invalid because we know I cannot be at position 3.

What about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E
- Position 1: P -> allowed (since unknown letter)
- Position 2: R -> allowed (R is not prohibited from position 2, only position 1)
- Position 3: I -> not allowed, because position 3 for I returned '-' meaning wrong position? And since we know I is in the word but not at 3, we should avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can put I at position 3 to rule out other positions? No, better to use a new position because placing I at 3 would get '-' again if it's still wrong, but we don't gain information. Placing at a new position might reveal if that's the correct position or not.

Therefore, prioritize changing positions for known letters (R, I, E) to gather new information.

So:
- Place R anywhere but 1.
- Place I anywhere but 3.
- Place E anywhere but 5.

Also, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E could be at 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, R could be at 2,3,4,5.

I could be at 1,2,4,5.

Try to find words that reposition these letters.

Ideal: put R in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (not 1), I in 1,2,4,5 (not 3), E in 1,2,3,4 (not 5), and add two new letters (distinct and not A, S).

Considering common words:
- ""RIVEN"": R, I, V, E, N -> positions: R at 1 -> not allowed? Because R was found at position 1 and was wrong position? So we know position 1 cannot be R? So avoid R at position 1. Therefore, ""RIVEN"" places R at 1: invalid.

Another: ""RIPEN"": R at 1 -> same issue.

How about ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> positions: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R -> allowed
  Position 3: I -> not allowed (position 3 is bad for I). So skip.

How about ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> positions:
  Pos1: U
  Pos2: R -> allowed? Yes, R not at 1 now.
  Pos3: I -> but I cannot be at pos3 -> invalid.

We must avoid pos3 for I.

So any word with at position 3 something that is not I? But I could be elsewhere.

Try words with I not in pos3:
Example: place I at position 1.

Possible: ""IRATE"" but that has A -> A is absent? We cannot use A because feedback said A is not in the word.

A is ruled out.

""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> letters: I, N, E, R, T -> distinct, no A or S.
Positions:
1: I (allowed? since I was at pos3 before and now at pos1, new position)
2: N
3: E -> E can be at position 3? we haven't ruled out any position for E except pos5. Also, E was absent at position 5? Not absent: E was at position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it could be at position 3? Yes, we don't know. 
4: R -> R not at position 1: this is position 4, allowed? Yes.
5: T -> no E at 5: good.

Feedback constraints:
- Don't place R at pos1: done (R is at pos4)
- Don't place I at pos3: yes, because I at pos1
- Don't place E at pos5: done (E at pos3)

So ""INERT"" is a valid choice.

Is ""INERT"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning inanimate or lacking vigor.

Another option: ""OLDER"" but O, L, D, E, R -> doesn't include I? We must include R, I, E because they are present in the word? The feedback says R, I, E must be in the guess? Or no? Actually, not necessarily: the guess doesn't have to include all known letters. However, missing a known letter might be inefficient because we wouldn't get information about its position. Since we have three known letters (R,I,E) to place, we should include them to test positions.

Therefore, ""INERT"" covers I at 1 (new position), E at 3 (new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at 3), R at 4 (new position? Previously R was at 1, now at 4).

We add N and T, common letters.

Another word: ""EVICT"" — includes E and I? But missing R? So not including R: inefficient.

Or ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> includes I and E but not R, so missing R.

Therefore, ""INERT"" is a good choice.

Another: ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
Pos1: T 
Pos2: R (allowed because not pos1? Yes) 
Pos3: I -> cannot be pos3: avoid.

""TRIED"" puts I at position 3.

Not good.

""CRIED"": same issue.

""HIDER"": H, I, D, E, R -> 
Pos1: H 
Pos2: I -> allowed? Position 2 for I: new position? Yes. Previously I was at pos3? Previously I at pos3 marked wrong, so now at pos2: good. 
Pos3: D 
Pos4: E -> E at pos4? Previously E at pos5: now moved to pos4. 
Pos5: R 

This works? Positions: 
- R at position 5: allowed? Previously R was at pos1 and wrong? Now at pos5: different position. 
- I at position 2: not position 3 -> allowed? Yes. 
- E at position 4: not position 5 -> allowed? Yes.

So ""HIDER"" is an option.

But how common? Also, N and T might be better than D and H? ""INERT"" uses N and T.

I think both are possible. ""INERT"" seems more standard.

Let's list possible words: including R, I, E; without A, S; and position constraints.

Word: ""INER  T"" -> ""INERT"" valid. 
Word: ""T I E R D"" -> ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> 
Pos: 
1:T 
2:I 
3:R -> I is not at 3? No, I at position 2, R at position 3. 
Is R allowed at 3? Previously R was at position 1 and found to be incorrect. We suspect R might be elsewhere? We don't know, so R at position 3 is allowed? Similarly, positions: 
2: I -> okay? Previously I at 2? No, I was at 3 before. Now at 2: new position. 
3: R -> okay? R's position? Previously at 1: now at 3: distinct position? Yes. 
4: E -> previously at 5? Now at 4: allowed. 
5: D 

But ""TIRED"" doesn't satisfy? The word is ""TIRED"": letters T,I,R,E,D? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D.

I at position 2: new -> ok. 
E at position 4: new -> ok. 
R at position 3: new? Previously R at pos1: yes, now at 3: so we'd get a symbol to see if R at pos3 is correct or not? Not inefficient? It gains information.

The feedback would tell us: if R at position 3 is correct or not? Similarly for I at 2.

Both ""INERT"" and ""TIRED"" are options.

I think ""INERT"" uses letters N and T, which are more common than D? But both valid.

Stick with ""INERT"".

Confirm: secret word must contain R, I, E somewhere? Yes.

Next guess: INERT

If ""INERT"" is: 
- I at position 1: if correct, would get ✓. If not, '-' or x? But I is in the word, so only ✓ or '-' for I? Because I is in the word? Wait, feedback symbols: 
✓ if correct position and present.
- if present but wrong position.
x if absent.

Since we know I is present (from first guess), so for any new position, we'd get ✓ if correct, or '-' if wrong position? Never x.

Similarly for R and E.

So it makes sense to try them in new positions.

Therefore, I choose ""INERT"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R: present but wrong position (not in position 1)
- A: absent
- I: present but wrong position (not in position 3)
- S: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not in position 5)

This means:
- The secret word contains R, I, E but not A or S.
- R cannot be in position 1.
- I cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Includes R, I, E (since they are confirmed present).
- Excludes A and S.
- Avoids placing R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- Uses new positions for R, I, E to gather better information.
- Incorporates new common letters (e.g., T, N) to maximize coverage.

After evaluating options:
- ""INERT"" is ideal: 
  - Positions: I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5) — all constraints are met.
  - I is moved to position 1 (new position), E to position 3 (new), R to position 4 (new).
  - Uses N and T, which are highly common letters.
  - It will reveal fresh feedback on the positions of R, I, E and test new letters.

Other considered words like ""TIRED"" or ""HIDER"" met some constraints but were less optimal (e.g., using less common letters). ""INERT"" is a valid word meaning lacking vigor or inanimate, making it a strong second guess.
</thinking>

<guess>INERT</guess>",INERT,"We are provided with feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- R: present but wrong position (marked as -)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: present but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, I, E (all in wrong positions)
- Does not contain A or S
- Letters known to be present: R, I, E
- Letters known to be absent: A, S

Now, since R, I, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (as in ""RAISE""), we must avoid placing them in these positions in the next guess.

Positions in RAISE:
1: R -> wrong position (so R cannot be in position 1)
2: A -> absent (so A not in word)
3: I -> wrong position (so I cannot be in position 3)
4: S -> absent (so S not in word)
5: E -> wrong position (so E cannot be in position 5)

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include R, I, E (since they are present per feedback).
- Must exclude A and S (since they are absent).
- Do not put R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- We have three known letters: R, I, E. We need to add two more letters that are not A or S (and not already used). Also, avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Possible new letters: Try common letters that haven't been ruled out. From common frequency: O, T, N, L, C, U, etc. Avoid A and S.

Candidates:
- Include R, I, E and two other letters from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} - excluding A, S.

Considering words that contain R, I, E and satisfy the position constraints.

Try to form a word:
- Options: 
  - Could be something like ""PRICE"", but P and C are allowed? 
  - But ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E. 
  - Positions: R would be in position 2 (not 1, allowed). I in position 3? But feedback said I was wrong in position 3, so cannot put I in 3? Actually, the feedback means that in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but it might be elsewhere. So in the next guess, we can put I in another position to test.

Constraints for next guess positions:
- Position 1: cannot be R (but could be I or E? Since they were not in their original positions, but R was in 1 and that was wrong, so avoid R at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be I (since that was wrong)
- Position 5: cannot be E (since that was wrong)

But E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Not 5, so 1-4.
Similarly, R: anywhere but 1? Actually, R might be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly I: anywhere but 3? So positions 1,2,4,5.

Also, we don't know the exact positions, so we need a word that shuffles R, I, E to other positions.

Try common words: 
- Consider words starting with E? Since E might be at start? But E was at position 5 and wrong, but could it be at position 1? Yes! We don't have info about E except not at 5.

Examples of words with R, I, E and without A, S:
- ""CRIER"" - but might have repeated R? C, R, I, E, R -> has two R's, which is less information efficient because it uses a repeated letter. Prefer distinct letters if possible.
- ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> letters are distinct. Positions: D at 1, R at 2, I at 3 -> but I cannot be at position 3 (feedback from guess 1: I was at position 3 and was wrong position). So cannot have I in position 3 in next guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient because we know I is not at 3. Why test the same position? We should try a different position for I? To get new information.

Best to test I in a new position: position 1,2,4,5 because position 3 is ruled out.

Similarly, E cannot be in 5, so position 1,2,3,4.

Thus for ""DRIVE"":
- Position 3 is I: which is not allowed because I was wrong in position 3. Therefore, avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R in position 1 and E in position 5.

So ""DRIVE"" places I at position 3: invalid because we know I cannot be at position 3.

What about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E
- Position 1: P -> allowed (since unknown letter)
- Position 2: R -> allowed (R is not prohibited from position 2, only position 1)
- Position 3: I -> not allowed, because position 3 for I returned '-' meaning wrong position? And since we know I is in the word but not at 3, we should avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can put I at position 3 to rule out other positions? No, better to use a new position because placing I at 3 would get '-' again if it's still wrong, but we don't gain information. Placing at a new position might reveal if that's the correct position or not.

Therefore, prioritize changing positions for known letters (R, I, E) to gather new information.

So:
- Place R anywhere but 1.
- Place I anywhere but 3.
- Place E anywhere but 5.

Also, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E could be at 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, R could be at 2,3,4,5.

I could be at 1,2,4,5.

Try to find words that reposition these letters.

Ideal: put R in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (not 1), I in 1,2,4,5 (not 3), E in 1,2,3,4 (not 5), and add two new letters (distinct and not A, S).

Considering common words:
- ""RIVEN"": R, I, V, E, N -> positions: R at 1 -> not allowed? Because R was found at position 1 and was wrong position? So we know position 1 cannot be R? So avoid R at position 1. Therefore, ""RIVEN"" places R at 1: invalid.

Another: ""RIPEN"": R at 1 -> same issue.

How about ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> positions: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R -> allowed
  Position 3: I -> not allowed (position 3 is bad for I). So skip.

How about ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> positions:
  Pos1: U
  Pos2: R -> allowed? Yes, R not at 1 now.
  Pos3: I -> but I cannot be at pos3 -> invalid.

We must avoid pos3 for I.

So any word with at position 3 something that is not I? But I could be elsewhere.

Try words with I not in pos3:
Example: place I at position 1.

Possible: ""IRATE"" but that has A -> A is absent? We cannot use A because feedback said A is not in the word.

A is ruled out.

""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> letters: I, N, E, R, T -> distinct, no A or S.
Positions:
1: I (allowed? since I was at pos3 before and now at pos1, new position)
2: N
3: E -> E can be at position 3? we haven't ruled out any position for E except pos5. Also, E was absent at position 5? Not absent: E was at position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it could be at position 3? Yes, we don't know. 
4: R -> R not at position 1: this is position 4, allowed? Yes.
5: T -> no E at 5: good.

Feedback constraints:
- Don't place R at pos1: done (R is at pos4)
- Don't place I at pos3: yes, because I at pos1
- Don't place E at pos5: done (E at pos3)

So ""INERT"" is a valid choice.

Is ""INERT"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning inanimate or lacking vigor.

Another option: ""OLDER"" but O, L, D, E, R -> doesn't include I? We must include R, I, E because they are present in the word? The feedback says R, I, E must be in the guess? Or no? Actually, not necessarily: the guess doesn't have to include all known letters. However, missing a known letter might be inefficient because we wouldn't get information about its position. Since we have three known letters (R,I,E) to place, we should include them to test positions.

Therefore, ""INERT"" covers I at 1 (new position), E at 3 (new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at 3), R at 4 (new position? Previously R was at 1, now at 4).

We add N and T, common letters.

Another word: ""EVICT"" — includes E and I? But missing R? So not including R: inefficient.

Or ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> includes I and E but not R, so missing R.

Therefore, ""INERT"" is a good choice.

Another: ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
Pos1: T 
Pos2: R (allowed because not pos1? Yes) 
Pos3: I -> cannot be pos3: avoid.

""TRIED"" puts I at position 3.

Not good.

""CRIED"": same issue.

""HIDER"": H, I, D, E, R -> 
Pos1: H 
Pos2: I -> allowed? Position 2 for I: new position? Yes. Previously I was at pos3? Previously I at pos3 marked wrong, so now at pos2: good. 
Pos3: D 
Pos4: E -> E at pos4? Previously E at pos5: now moved to pos4. 
Pos5: R 

This works? Positions: 
- R at position 5: allowed? Previously R was at pos1 and wrong? Now at pos5: different position. 
- I at position 2: not position 3 -> allowed? Yes. 
- E at position 4: not position 5 -> allowed? Yes.

So ""HIDER"" is an option.

But how common? Also, N and T might be better than D and H? ""INERT"" uses N and T.

I think both are possible. ""INERT"" seems more standard.

Let's list possible words: including R, I, E; without A, S; and position constraints.

Word: ""INER  T"" -> ""INERT"" valid. 
Word: ""T I E R D"" -> ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> 
Pos: 
1:T 
2:I 
3:R -> I is not at 3? No, I at position 2, R at position 3. 
Is R allowed at 3? Previously R was at position 1 and found to be incorrect. We suspect R might be elsewhere? We don't know, so R at position 3 is allowed? Similarly, positions: 
2: I -> okay? Previously I at 2? No, I was at 3 before. Now at 2: new position. 
3: R -> okay? R's position? Previously at 1: now at 3: distinct position? Yes. 
4: E -> previously at 5? Now at 4: allowed. 
5: D 

But ""TIRED"" doesn't satisfy? The word is ""TIRED"": letters T,I,R,E,D? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D.

I at position 2: new -> ok. 
E at position 4: new -> ok. 
R at position 3: new? Previously R at pos1: yes, now at 3: so we'd get a symbol to see if R at pos3 is correct or not? Not inefficient? It gains information.

The feedback would tell us: if R at position 3 is correct or not? Similarly for I at 2.

Both ""INERT"" and ""TIRED"" are options.

I think ""INERT"" uses letters N and T, which are more common than D? But both valid.

Stick with ""INERT"".

Confirm: secret word must contain R, I, E somewhere? Yes.

Next guess: INERT

If ""INERT"" is: 
- I at position 1: if correct, would get ✓. If not, '-' or x? But I is in the word, so only ✓ or '-' for I? Because I is in the word? Wait, feedback symbols: 
✓ if correct position and present.
- if present but wrong position.
x if absent.

Since we know I is present (from first guess), so for any new position, we'd get ✓ if correct, or '-' if wrong position? Never x.

Similarly for R and E.

So it makes sense to try them in new positions.

Therefore, I choose ""INERT"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R: present but wrong position (not in position 1)
- A: absent
- I: present but wrong position (not in position 3)
- S: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not in position 5)

This means:
- The secret word contains R, I, E but not A or S.
- R cannot be in position 1.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a valid 5-letter English word that includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and frequent consonants include R, S, T, L, N.

Based on English letter frequency analysis:
- E is the most common letter (~11%)
- A, R, I, O, T, N, S are also top-tier (~5-8% each)

A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal for the first guess because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E — all high-frequency letters.
- It uses distinct letters (no repeats), covering five different positions.
- This increases the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

- According to letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are top.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E — five of the top letters.

S is more frequent than C. Frequency: E (11%), A (8.5%), R (7.6%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.6%), S (5.7%), etc. C is around 2.8%, so higher than some but S is better.

In terms of vowel/consonant balance, ""RAISE"" has three vowels A,I,E and two consonants R,S.

""CRANE"" has vowels A,E and consonants C,R,N.

""SLATE"" has vowels A,E and consonants S,L,T.

""ROAST"" is another option.

<guess>RAISE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, so no prior feedback exists. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repeating letters. Based on English letter frequency (E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S being the most common), ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice as it uses five top-frequency distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E.
- All five letters are among the most common in English (E ~11%, A ~8.5%, R ~7.6%, I ~7.3%, S ~5.7%).
- This combination provides broad coverage across vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S), which increases the likelihood of revealing matching letters in the secret word.

Alternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also solid choices, but ""RAISE"" has a slightly higher frequency score due to the inclusion of ""I"" (more common than ""C"" or ""L""). ""RAISE"" is a valid English word, ensuring it's accepted.

- Letters known to be absent: A, S

Now, since R, I, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (as in ""RAISE""), we must avoid placing them in these positions in the next guess.

Positions in RAISE:
1: R -> wrong position (so R cannot be in position 1)
2: A -> absent (so A not in word)
3: I -> wrong position (so I cannot be in position 3)
4: S -> absent (so S not in word)
5: E -> wrong position (so E cannot be in position 5)

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include R, I, E (since they are present per feedback).
- Must exclude A and S (since they are absent).
- Do not put R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- We have three known letters: R, I, E. We need to add two more letters that are not A or S (and not already used). Also, avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Possible new letters: Try common letters that haven't been ruled out. From common frequency: O, T, N, L, C, U, etc. Avoid A and S.

Candidates:
- Include R, I, E and two other letters from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} - excluding A, S.

Considering words that contain R, I, E and satisfy the position constraints.

Try to form a word:
- Options: 
  - Could be something like ""PRICE"", but P and C are allowed? 
  - But ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E. 
  - Positions: R would be in position 2 (not 1, allowed). I in position 3? But feedback said I was wrong in position 3, so cannot put I in 3? Actually, the feedback means that in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but it might be elsewhere. So in the next guess, we can put I in another position to test.

Constraints for next guess positions:
- Position 1: cannot be R (but could be I or E? Since they were not in their original positions, but R was in 1 and that was wrong, so avoid R at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be I (since that was wrong)
- Position 5: cannot be E (since that was wrong)

But E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Not 5, so 1-4.
Similarly, R: anywhere but 1? Actually, R might be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly I: anywhere but 3? So positions 1,2,4,5.

Also, we don't know the exact positions, so we need a word that shuffles R, I, E to other positions.

Try common words: 
- Consider words starting with E? Since E might be at start? But E was at position 5 and wrong, but could it be at position 1? Yes! We don't have info about E except not at 5.

Examples of words with R, I, E and without A, S:
- ""CRIER"" - but might have repeated R? C, R, I, E, R -> has two R's, which is less information efficient because it uses a repeated letter. Prefer distinct letters if possible.
- ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> letters are distinct. Positions: D at 1, R at 2, I at 3 -> but I cannot be at position 3 (feedback from guess 1: I was at position 3 and was wrong position). So cannot have I in position 3 in next guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient because we know I is not at 3. Why test the same position? We should try a different position for I? To get new information.

Best to test I in a new position: position 1,2,4,5 because position 3 is ruled out.

Similarly, E cannot be in 5, so position 1,2,3,4.

Thus for ""DRIVE"":
- Position 3 is I: which is not allowed because I was wrong in position 3. Therefore, avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R in position 1 and E in position 5.

So ""DRIVE"" places I at position 3: invalid because we know I cannot be at position 3.

What about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E
- Position 1: P -> allowed (since unknown letter)
- Position 2: R -> allowed (R is not prohibited from position 2, only position 1)
- Position 3: I -> not allowed, because position 3 for I returned '-' meaning wrong position? And since we know I is in the word but not at 3, we should avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can put I at position 3 to rule out other positions? No, better to use a new position because placing I at 3 would get '-' again if it's still wrong, but we don't gain information. Placing at a new position might reveal if that's the correct position or not.

Therefore, prioritize changing positions for known letters (R, I, E) to gather new information.

So:
- Place R anywhere but 1.
- Place I anywhere but 3.
- Place E anywhere but 5.

Also, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E could be at 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, R could be at 2,3,4,5.

I could be at 1,2,4,5.

Try to find words that reposition these letters.

Ideal: put R in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (not 1), I in 1,2,4,5 (not 3), E in 1,2,3,4 (not 5), and add two new letters (distinct and not A, S).

Considering common words:
- ""RIVEN"": R, I, V, E, N -> positions: R at 1 -> not allowed? Because R was found at position 1 and was wrong position? So we know position 1 cannot be R? So avoid R at position 1. Therefore, ""RIVEN"" places R at 1: invalid.

Another: ""RIPEN"": R at 1 -> same issue.

How about ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> positions: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R -> allowed
  Position 3: I -> not allowed (position 3 is bad for I). So skip.

How about ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> positions:
  Pos1: U
  Pos2: R -> allowed? Yes, R not at 1 now.
  Pos3: I -> but I cannot be at pos3 -> invalid.

We must avoid pos3 for I.

So any word with at position 3 something that is not I? But I could be elsewhere.

Try words with I not in pos3:
Example: place I at position 1.

Possible: ""IRATE"" but that has A -> A is absent? We cannot use A because feedback said A is not in the word.

A is ruled out.

""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> letters: I, N, E, R, T -> distinct, no A or S.
Positions:
1: I (allowed? since I was at pos3 before and now at pos1, new position)
2: N
3: E -> E can be at position 3? we haven't ruled out any position for E except pos5. Also, E was absent at position 5? Not absent: E was at position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it could be at position 3? Yes, we don't know. 
4: R -> R not at position 1: this is position 4, allowed? Yes.
5: T -> no E at 5: good.

Feedback constraints:
- Don't place R at pos1: done (R is at pos4)
- Don't place I at pos3: yes, because I at pos1
- Don't place E at pos5: done (E at pos3)

So ""INERT"" is a valid choice.

Is ""INERT"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning inanimate or lacking vigor.

Another option: ""OLDER"" but O, L, D, E, R -> doesn't include I? We must include R, I, E because they are present in the word? The feedback says R, I, E must be in the guess? Or no? Actually, not necessarily: the guess doesn't have to include all known letters. However, missing a known letter might be inefficient because we wouldn't get information about its position. Since we have three known letters (R,I,E) to place, we should include them to test positions.

Therefore, ""INERT"" covers I at 1 (new position), E at 3 (new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at 3), R at 4 (new position? Previously R was at 1, now at 4).

We add N and T, common letters.

Another word: ""EVICT"" — includes E and I? But missing R? So not including R: inefficient.

Or ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> includes I and E but not R, so missing R.

Therefore, ""INERT"" is a good choice.

Another: ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
Pos1: T 
Pos2: R (allowed because not pos1? Yes) 
Pos3: I -> cannot be pos3: avoid.

""TRIED"" puts I at position 3.

Not good.

""CRIED"": same issue.

""HIDER"": H, I, D, E, R -> 
Pos1: H 
Pos2: I -> allowed? Position 2 for I: new position? Yes. Previously I was at pos3? Previously I at pos3 marked wrong, so now at pos2: good. 
Pos3: D 
Pos4: E -> E at pos4? Previously E at pos5: now moved to pos4. 
Pos5: R 

This works? Positions: 
- R at position 5: allowed? Previously R was at pos1 and wrong? Now at pos5: different position. 
- I at position 2: not position 3 -> allowed? Yes. 
- E at position 4: not position 5 -> allowed? Yes.

So ""HIDER"" is an option.

But how common? Also, N and T might be better than D and H? ""INERT"" uses N and T.

I think both are possible. ""INERT"" seems more standard.

Let's list possible words: including R, I, E; without A, S; and position constraints.

Word: ""INER  T"" -> ""INERT"" valid. 
Word: ""T I E R D"" -> ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> 
Pos: 
1:T 
2:I 
3:R -> I is not at 3? No, I at position 2, R at position 3. 
Is R allowed at 3? Previously R was at position 1 and found to be incorrect. We suspect R might be elsewhere? We don't know, so R at position 3 is allowed? Similarly, positions: 
2: I -> okay? Previously I at 2? No, I was at 3 before. Now at 2: new position. 
3: R -> okay? R's position? Previously at 1: now at 3: distinct position? Yes. 
4: E -> previously at 5? Now at 4: allowed. 
5: D 

But ""TIRED"" doesn't satisfy? The word is ""TIRED"": letters T,I,R,E,D? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D.

I at position 2: new -> ok. 
E at position 4: new -> ok. 
R at position 3: new? Previously R at pos1: yes, now at 3: so we'd get a symbol to see if R at pos3 is correct or not? Not inefficient? It gains information.

The feedback would tell us: if R at position 3 is correct or not? Similarly for I at 2.

Both ""INERT"" and ""TIRED"" are options.

I think ""INERT"" uses letters N and T, which are more common than D? But both valid.

Stick with ""INERT"".

Confirm: secret word must contain R, I, E somewhere? Yes.

Next guess: INERT

If ""INERT"" is: 
- I at position 1: if correct, would get ✓. If not, '-' or x? But I is in the word, so only ✓ or '-' for I? Because I is in the word? Wait, feedback symbols: 
✓ if correct position and present.
- if present but wrong position.
x if absent.

Since we know I is present (from first guess), so for any new position, we'd get ✓ if correct, or '-' if wrong position? Never x.

Similarly for R and E.

So it makes sense to try them in new positions.

Therefore, I choose ""INERT"".
</thinking>
<guess>INERT</guess><thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R: present but wrong position (not in position 1)
- A: absent
- I: present but wrong position (not in position 3)
- S: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not in position 5)

This means:
- The secret word contains R, I, E but not A or S.
- R cannot be in position 1.
- I cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Includes R, I, E (since they are confirmed present).
- Excludes A and S.
- Avoids placing R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- Uses new positions for R, I, E to gather better information.
- Incorporates new common letters (e.g., T, N) to maximize coverage.

After evaluating options:
- ""INERT"" is ideal: 
  - Positions: I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5) — all constraints are met.
  - I is moved to position 1 (new position), E to position 3 (new), R to position 4 (new).
  - Uses N and T, which are highly common letters.
  - It will reveal fresh feedback on the positions of R, I, E and test new letters.

Other considered words like ""TIRED"" or ""HIDER"" met some constraints but were less optimal (e.g., using less common letters). ""INERT"" is a valid word meaning lacking vigor or inanimate, making it a strong second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

So step-by-step thinking:
- No prior feedback, so choose a word that maximizes information gain.
- Opt for a word with diverse, common letters and no repeats to cover more ground.
- ""CRANE"" is a good option: letters C, R, A, N, E.
- Alternatives: ""SLATE"" (S,L,A,T,E), ""CRATE"" (C,R,A,T,E), but I've seen ""CRANE"" used often.
- ""DEUCE"" might have less common letters, so probably not.
- Aim for high-frequency letters: E is the most common letter, then A, R, etc.
- According to letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are top.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E — five of the top letters.
- Similarly, ""SOARE"" but that might not be great.
- I think ""RAISE"" could be better than ""CRANE"" because it has more high-frequency letters.

Letter frequency in English:
1. E
2. A
3. R
4. I
5. O
6. T
7. N
8. S
Etc.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E — so positions: E is common, A common, I common, S common, R common. Wait, RAISE: R, A, I, S, E — all top letters.

""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E — C is less common than S or I, N is common but S might be better.

S is more frequent than C. Frequency: E (11%), A (8.5%), R (7.6%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.6%), S (5.7%), etc. C is around 2.8%, so higher than some but S is better.

In terms of vowel/consonant balance, ""RAISE"" has three vowels A,I,E and two consonants R,S.

""CRANE"" has vowels A,E and consonants C,R,N.

""SLATE"" has vowels A,E and consonants S,L,T.

""ROAST"" is another option.

But for information gain, having distinct letters is key, so no repeats. All these examples have no repeats, which is good.

I think either is fine; I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses 5 very common letters.
</think>
<thinking>
Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a valid 5-letter English word that includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and frequent consonants include R, S, T, L, N.

Based on English letter frequency analysis:
- E is the most common letter (~11%)
- A, R, I, O, T, N, S are also top-tier (~5-8% each)

A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal for the first guess because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E — all high-frequency letters.
- It uses distinct letters (no repeats), covering five different positions.
- This increases the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

""RAISE"" is a valid English word meaning to cause to rise or lift, making it an appropriate choice.

I in position 3? But feedback said I was wrong in position 3, so cannot put I in 3? Actually, the feedback means that in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but it might be elsewhere. So in the next guess, we can put I in another position to test.\n\nConstraints for next guess positions:\n- Position 1: cannot be R (but could be I or E? Since they were not in their original positions, but R was in 1 and that was wrong, so avoid R at 1)\n- Position 3: cannot be I (since that was wrong)\n- Position 5: cannot be E (since that was wrong)\n\nBut E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Not 5, so 1-4.\nSimilarly, R: anywhere but 1? Actually, R might be in 2,3,4,5.\nSimilarly I: anywhere but 3? So positions 1,2,4,5.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know the exact positions, so we need a word that shuffles R, I, E to other positions.\n\nTry common words: \n- Consider words starting with E? Since E might be at start? But E was at position 5 and wrong, but could it be at position 1? Yes! We don\'t have info about E except not at 5.\n\nExamples of words with R, I, E and without A, S:\n- ""CRIER"" - but might have repeated R? C, R, I, E, R -> has two R\'s, which is less information efficient because it uses a repeated letter. Prefer distinct letters if possible.\n- ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> letters are distinct. Positions: D at 1, R at 2, I at 3 -> but I cannot be at position 3 (feedback from guess 1: I was at position 3 and was wrong position). So cannot have I in position 3 in next guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient because we know I is not at 3. Why test the same position? We should try a different position for I? To get new information.\n\nBest to test I in a new position: position 1,2,4,5 because position 3 is ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be in 5, so position 1,2,3,4.\n\nThus for ""DRIVE"":\n- Position 3 is I: which is not allowed because I was wrong in position 3. Therefore, avoid putting I in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting R in position 1 and E in position 5.\n\nSo ""DRIVE"" places I at position 3: invalid because we know I cannot be at position 3.\n\nWhat about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E\n- Position 1: P -> allowed (since unknown letter)\n- Position 2: R -> allowed (R is not prohibited from position 2, only position 1)\n- Position 3: I -> not allowed, because position 3 for I returned \'-\' meaning wrong position? And since we know I is in the word but not at 3, we should avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can put I at position 3 to rule out other positions? No, better to use a new position because placing I at 3 would get \'-\' again if it\'s still wrong, but we don\'t gain information. Placing at a new position might reveal if that\'s the correct position or not.\n\nTherefore, prioritize changing positions for known letters (R, I, E) to gather new information.\n\nSo:\n- Place R anywhere but 1.\n- Place I anywhere but 3.\n- Place E anywhere but 5.\n\nAlso, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E could be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, R could be at 2,3,4,5.\n\nI could be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nTry to find words that reposition these letters.\n\nIdeal: put R in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (not 1), I in 1,2,4,5 (not 3), E in 1,2,3,4 (not 5), and add two new letters (distinct and not A, S).\n\nConsidering common words:\n- ""RIVEN"": R, I, V, E, N -> positions: R at 1 -> not allowed? Because R was found at position 1 and was wrong position? So we know position 1 cannot be R? So avoid R at position 1. Therefore, ""RIVEN"" places R at 1: invalid.\n\nAnother: ""RIPEN"": R at 1 -> same issue.\n\nHow about ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> positions: \n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: R -> allowed\n  Position 3: I -> not allowed (position 3 is bad for I). So skip.\n\nHow about ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> positions:\n  Pos1: U\n  Pos2: R -> allowed? Yes, R not at 1 now.\n  Pos3: I -> but I cannot be at pos3 -> invalid.\n\nWe must avoid pos3 for I.\n\nSo any word with at position 3 something that is not I? But I could be elsewhere.\n\nTry words with I not in pos3:\nExample: place I at position 1.\n\nPossible: ""IRATE"" but that has A -> A is absent? We cannot use A because feedback said A is not in the word.\n\nA is ruled out.\n\n""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> letters: I, N, E, R, T -> distinct, no A or S.\nPositions:\n1: I (allowed? since I was at pos3 before and now at pos1, new position)\n2: N\n3: E -> E can be at position 3? we haven\'t ruled out any position for E except pos5. Also, E was absent at position 5? Not absent: E was at position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it could be at position 3? Yes, we don\'t know. \n4: R -> R not at position 1: this is position 4, allowed? Yes.\n5: T -> no E at 5: good.\n\nFeedback constraints:\n- Don\'t place R at pos1: done (R is at pos4)\n- Don\'t place I at pos3: yes, because I at pos1\n- Don\'t place E at pos5: done (E at pos3)\n\nSo ""INERT"" is a valid choice.\n\nIs ""INERT"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning inanimate or lacking vigor.\n\nAnother option: ""OLDER"" but O, L, D, E, R -> doesn\'t include I? We must include R, I, E because they are present in the word? The feedback says R, I, E must be in the guess? Or no? Actually, not necessarily: the guess doesn\'t have to include all known letters. However, missing a known letter might be inefficient because we wouldn\'t get information about its position. Since we have three known letters (R,I,E) to place, we should include them to test positions.\n\nTherefore, ""INERT"" covers I at 1 (new position), E at 3 (new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at 3), R at 4 (new position? Previously R was at 1, now at 4).\n\nWe add N and T, common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""EVICT"" — includes E and I? But missing R? So not including R: inefficient.\n\nOr ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> includes I and E but not R, so missing R.\n\nTherefore, ""INERT"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother: ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> \nPos1: T \nPos2: R (allowed because not pos1? Yes) \nPos3: I -> cannot be pos3: avoid.\n\n""TRIED"" puts I at position 3.\n\nNot good.\n\n""CRIED"": same issue.\n\n""HIDER"": H, I, D, E, R -> \nPos1: H \nPos2: I -> allowed? Position 2 for I: new position? Yes. Previously I was at pos3? Previously I at pos3 marked wrong, so now at pos2: good. \nPos3: D \nPos4: E -> E at pos4? Previously E at pos5: now moved to pos4. \nPos5: R \n\nThis works? Positions: \n- R at position 5: allowed? Previously R was at pos1 and wrong? Now at pos5: different position. \n- I at position 2: not position 3 -> allowed? Yes. \n- E at position 4: not position 5 -> allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""HIDER"" is an option.\n\nBut how common? Also, N and T might be better than D and H? ""INERT"" uses N and T.\n\nI think both are possible. ""INERT"" seems more standard.\n\nLet\'s list possible words: including R, I, E; without A, S; and position constraints.\n\nWord: ""INER  T"" -> ""INERT"" valid. \nWord: ""T I E R D"" -> ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> \nPos: \n1:T \n2:I \n3:R -> I is not at 3? No, I at position 2, R at position 3. \nIs R allowed at 3? Previously R was at position 1 and found to be incorrect. We suspect R might be elsewhere? We don\'t know, so R at position 3 is allowed? Similarly, positions: \n2: I -> okay? Previously I at 2? No, I was at 3 before. Now at 2: new position. \n3: R -> okay? R\'s position? Previously at 1: now at 3: distinct position? Yes. \n4: E -> previously at 5? Now at 4: allowed. \n5: D \n\nBut ""TIRED"" doesn\'t satisfy? The word is ""TIRED"": letters T,I,R,E,D? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D.\n\nI at position 2: new -> ok. \nE at position 4: new -> ok. \nR at position 3: new? Previously R at pos1: yes, now at 3: so we\'d get a symbol to see if R at pos3 is correct or not? Not inefficient? It gains information.\n\nThe feedback would tell us: if R at position 3 is correct or not? Similarly for I at 2.\n\nBoth ""INERT"" and ""TIRED"" are options.\n\nI think ""INERT"" uses letters N and T, which are more common than D? But both valid.\n\nStick with ""INERT"".\n\nConfirm: secret word must contain R, I, E somewhere? Yes.\n\nNext guess: INERT\n\nIf ""INERT"" is: \n- I at position 1: if correct, would get ✓. If not, \'-\' or x? But I is in the word, so only ✓ or \'-\' for I? Because I is in the word? Wait, feedback symbols: \n✓ if correct position and present.\n- if present but wrong position.\nx if absent.\n\nSince we know I is present (from first guess), so for any new position, we\'d get ✓ if correct, or \'-\' if wrong position?

  - R: not in position 1 (from RAISE) and not in position 4 (from INERT). So R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  - I: not in position 3 (from RAISE) and not in position 1 (from INERT). So I cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  - E: not in position 5 (from RAISE) and not in position 3 (from INERT). So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

We know the word has 5 letters and contains R, I, E. The remaining two letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, S, N, T and the known present letters (R,I,E). Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, I, N, E, R, T (from the two guesses). The absent letters are A, S, N, T.

So the available letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, I, E (each exactly once, since we have no indication of duplicates and we haven't seen any).
- Contains two more letters from the available set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Satisfies the position constraints:
  - R: not in 1 or 4 -> possible positions: 2, 3, 5.
  - I: not in 1 or 3 -> possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - E: not in 3 or 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's try to assign positions:

Consider possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4.

Similarly for R: 2, 3, 5.

And for I: 2, 4, 5.

Note that position 2 is a possible position for all three, but we can only have one letter per position.

We need to choose positions that don't conflict.

Let's list possible words:

Option 1: Place E at position 1.
Then:
- E at 1: allowed.
- Then R can be at 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be at 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 might be taken by R).

If E at 1, then position 2 is free for R or I? But we have two more letters to place.

The word structure: E _ _ _ _

Now, we need to place R, I, and two other letters.

But R and I must be in the word, so two of the remaining four positions must be R and I.

Positions: 2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R: not 1 (already taken by E) and not 4 -> so R can be at 2,3,5.
- I: not 1 (taken) and not 3 -> so I can be at 2,4,5.

But if we put R at 2, then I cannot be at 2 -> so I at 4 or 5.

Similarly, if R at 3, then I at 2,4,5 (but 3 taken by R, so I at 2,4,5).

If R at 5, then I at 2 or 4.

Also, E is at 1, which is allowed.

Now, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.

Example: E at 1, R at 2, then I at 4 (since 2 taken) -> then positions 3 and 5 need letters: E _ R I _ -> but we have E at 1, R at 2, I at 4, so position 3 and 5 are open. But we have only two more letters? The word must have R, I, E and two others. So positions: 3 and 5 are for the new letters.

But R is at 2? Then the word so far: E, R, ?, I, ?

But we have constraint that R cannot be at 4? We are putting R at 2, which is allowed.

But we also have I at 4: allowed? Yes, because I can be at 4.

Now, what words start with ""ER"" and have I at position 4? And contain E, R, I and two other letters not A,S,N,T.

For example: ""ERBIA"" but A is not allowed. ""ERICA"" has A. ""ERMIN"" has N? N is not allowed.

""ERBIA"" is not a word? Let's think.

Another: ""ERGOT"" but T is not allowed? T is absent.

We need letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Try ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> but T is absent? T is not allowed.

""ERODE"": E, R, O, D, E -> but E repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far? The feedback didn't show duplicates. But we should avoid repeating letters to maximize information? However, E is already known, but we might have two E's? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and in the second at position 3, both marked as present but wrong position. It could be the same E? Or two E's? We don't know. But to be safe, assume no duplicates for now.

But ""ERODE"" has two E's? So not distinct.

""ERUCT"": E, R, U, C, T -> T absent? Not allowed.

""ERIKA"" has A and K? A not allowed.

This is difficult. Maybe E at 1 is not the best.

Option 2: Place E at position 2.
Then:
- E at 2: allowed (since E not forbidden at 2).
- Then positions: _ E _ _ _
- R: can be at 3 or 5 (since not 1,4; and 2 taken by E) -> so 3 or 5.
- I: can be at 4 or 5 (since not 1,3; and 2 taken) -> so 4 or 5.

If R at 3, then I can be at 4 or 5.
If R at 5, then I can be at 4.

Also, position 1 and the remaining position need letters.

Example: R at 3, I at 4: then word: _ E R I _
Position 1 and 5 need letters.

We have to fill with two new letters.

What words: ? E R I ?

With the last letter at position 5.

And the word must contain E, R, I and two others.

Known: E at 2, R at 3, I at 4.

So the word is: X E R I Y

Where X and Y are from the available letters (not A,S,N,T).

Possible words: 
- ""DERIV"" - D, E, R, I, V -> valid? ""DERIV"" is not a common word? Derivative? But 5 letters? ""DERIV"" might be a root, but let's see: ""DERIVE"" is 6 letters. So not.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> but T is absent? Not allowed.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> L is allowed? Yes. And no A,S,N,T. So ""PERIL"" is a valid word.

Check positions:
- E at 2: allowed? Yes.
- R at 3: allowed? R can be at 3? Yes, because R was not forbidden at 3? Previously R was at 1 and 4, so 3 is new.
- I at 4: allowed? I was at 3 and 1 before, so 4 is new? Yes.

Also, P at 1 and L at 5: both new.

So ""PERIL"" is a candidate.

Another: ""HEROIC"" is 6 letters. ""HERO"" is 4.

""BERIM"" not a word.

""FERIA"" has A? Not allowed.

""VERIFY"" too long.

So ""PERIL"" seems good.

Another possibility: R at 5 and I at 4: then word: _ E _ I R

So positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: I, 5: R.

Word: X E Y I R

What words? ""DEVIL"" but L at 3? D E V I R? ""DEVIR"" not a word.

""LEVIR"" not common.

""PECAN"" has N? Not allowed.

""LEGIT"" has T? Not allowed.

So ""PERIL"" is better.

Option 3: Place E at position 4.
Then:
- E at 4: allowed (since E not forbidden at 4).
- Then positions: _ _ _ E _
- R: can be at 2,3,5 (not 1,4; 4 taken by E) -> so 2,3,5.
- I: can be at 2,5 (since not 1,3; and 4 taken) -> so 2 or 5.

If R at 2, then I at 5 (since 2 taken).
If R at 3, then I at 2 or 5.
If R at 5, then I at 2.

Example: R at 2, I at 5: then word: _ R _ E I

So: X R Y E I

What words: ""URAEI"" not common. ""CRAWL"" but L at 3? C R A W I? A not allowed.

""GRUEL"" has U and E? G R U E I? ""GRUEI"" not a word.

""FREUD"" has D? F R E U D? But E is at position 3? We have E at 4? In this structure: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: I.

So ""FR E E I"" but two E's? Not.

""BREAD"" has A and D? A not allowed.

Not many options.

R at 3, I at 2: then word: _ I R E _

So: X I R E Y

Words: ""DIRECT"" too long. ""DIRGE"": D I R G E -> but E is at position 5? We have E at 4? So ""DIRGE"" is D at 1, I at 2, R at 3, G at 4, E at 5? But we need E at 4? In this case, we have position 4 as E? But in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G? Not E.

We need E at position 4.

So for ""X I R E Y"": position 1: X, 2: I, 3: R, 4: E, 5: Y.

What words: ""FIRE"" is 4 letters. ""FIRED"" is F I R E D -> that's 5 letters: F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

""FIRED"" is a word? Yes, meaning dismissed from a job.

Check constraints:
- I at 2: allowed? I was not at 2 before? Previously I at 3 and 1, so 2 is new -> allowed.
- R at 3: allowed? R was at 1 and 4 before, so 3 is new -> allowed.
- E at 4: allowed? E was at 5 and 3 before, so 4 is new -> allowed.
- F and D: not in the absent list? F and D are allowed.

Absent letters: A, S, N, T. So F and D are okay.

So ""FIRED"" is a candidate.

But we have two candidates: ""PERIL"" and ""FIRED"".

Which one to choose?

""PERIL"": uses P and L, which are less common? But valid.

""FIRED"": uses F and D.

Letter frequency: F is about 2.2%, D is 4.3%, P is 1.9%, L is 4.0%. So D and L are more common than F and P.

But both are acceptable.

We might also consider that in ""PERIL"", we have E at position 2, which we haven't tested? Previously E was at 5 and 3.

In ""FIRED"", E is at 4, which is new.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"", R is at 3, which is new for R? Previously R at 1 and 4.

In ""FIRED"", R is at 3, same as in ""PERIL"".

But ""PERIL"" has I at 4, which is new? Previously I at 3 and 1.

""FIRED"" has I at 2, which is also new.

So both test new positions.

But ""PERIL"" might be better because it uses more common letters? L is more common than F? L: 4.0%, F: 2.2%. But D is 4.3% and P is 1.9%. So ""FIRED"" has D (4.3%) and F (2.2%), ""PERIL"" has P (1.9%) and L (4.0%). Average: ""FIRED"" (3.25%) vs ""PERIL"" (2.95%)? But not a big difference.

We can choose either.

Another word: ""RIPED"" but not common? ""RIPED"" is not standard; ""RIPEN"" has N.

""WIRED"": W I R E D -> same as ""FIRED"" but with W? W is less common.

""FIRED"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with more common letters.

""OILER"": O I L E R -> 
Positions: O at 1, I at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
Check constraints:
- I at 2: allowed.
- E at 4: allowed.
- R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5? Yes, because not forbidden (only not 1 and 4).
- O and L: allowed? Yes.

""OILER"" is a word (one who oils or a tanker ship).

And O and L are common: O ~7.2%, L ~4.0%.

So ""OILER"" is also a candidate.

Now, among ""PERIL"", ""FIRED"", ""OILER"", which is best?

""OILER"" uses O and L, which are more common than the letters in the others? O is 7.2%, L 4.0% -> average 5.6%. ""FIRED"": F 2.2%, D 4.3% -> 3.25%. ""PERIL"": P 1.9%, L 4.0% -> 2.95%. So ""OILER"" has higher frequency letters.

Also, positions: 
- I at 2: new
- E at 4: new
- R at 5: new

All good.

So I choose ""OILER"".

But let's confirm: the word must not have A,S,N,T, and ""OILER"" has O,I,L,E,R -> no A,S,N,T. Good.

Therefore, next guess: OILER.
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-) → R, I, E are present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5), while A and S are absent.
- **Guess 2 (INERT)**: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x) → I, E, R are still present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 for E; not in 1 or 4 for R; not in 1 for I), while N and T are absent.

Key insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, I, E (all must appear exactly once, as no duplicates indicated).
- **Absent letters**: A, S, N, T (cannot appear).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE) or 4 (from INERT) → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
  - I: Cannot be in position 1 (from INERT) or 3 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
  - E: Cannot be in position 3 (from INERT) or 5 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
- **Available letters for remaining positions**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, S, N, T are ruled out).

For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R, I, E and two new letters from the available set.
- Respects the position constraints for R, I, E.
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- **OILER** (O, I, L, E, R) is a strong choice:
  - Positions: I(2), E(4), R(5) → satisfies all constraints (I not in 1/3, E not in 3/5, R not in 1/4).
  - New letters: O and L (both common; O is ~7.2% frequency, L is ~4.0%).
  - Tests new positions: I at 2 (previously tested at 1 and 3), E at 4 (previously at 3 and 5), R at 5 (previously at 1 and 4).
  - Valid English word (meaning: one who oils or a type of ship).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the feedback.
</thinking>

<guess>OILER</guess>",OILER,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. RAISE: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. INERT: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x)
   Interpretation:
   - I is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for I at position 1).
   - N is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for E at position 3).
   - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since we got '-' for R at position 4).
   - T is not in the word.

Combining the feedback:
- Letters in the word: R, I, E (from both guesses, and they are still present but in wrong positions).
- Letters not in the word: A, S, N, T (from the feedback of both guesses).
- Position constraints:
  - R: not in position 1 (from RAISE) and not in position 4 (from INERT). So R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  - I: not in position 3 (from RAISE) and not in position 1 (from INERT). So I cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  - E: not in position 5 (from RAISE) and not in position 3 (from INERT). So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

We know the word has 5 letters and contains R, I, E. The remaining two letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, S, N, T and the known present letters (R,I,E). Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, I, N, E, R, T (from the two guesses). The absent letters are A, S, N, T.

So the available letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, I, E (each exactly once, since we have no indication of duplicates and we haven't seen any).
- Contains two more letters from the available set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Satisfies the position constraints:
  - R: not in 1 or 4 -> possible positions: 2, 3, 5.
  - I: not in 1 or 3 -> possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - E: not in 3 or 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's try to assign positions:

Consider possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4.

Similarly for R: 2, 3, 5.

And for I: 2, 4, 5.

Note that position 2 is a possible position for all three, but we can only have one letter per position.

We need to choose positions that don't conflict.

Let's list possible words:

Option 1: Place E at position 1.
Then:
- E at 1: allowed.
- Then R can be at 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be at 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 might be taken by R).

If E at 1, then position 2 is free for R or I? But we have two more letters to place.

The word structure: E _ _ _ _

Now, we need to place R, I, and two other letters.

But R and I must be in the word, so two of the remaining four positions must be R and I.

Positions: 2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R: not 1 (already taken by E) and not 4 -> so R can be at 2,3,5.
- I: not 1 (taken) and not 3 -> so I can be at 2,4,5.

But if we put R at 2, then I cannot be at 2 -> so I at 4 or 5.

Similarly, if R at 3, then I at 2,4,5 (but 3 taken by R, so I at 2,4,5).

If R at 5, then I at 2 or 4.

Also, E is at 1, which is allowed.

Now, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.

Example: E at 1, R at 2, then I at 4 (since 2 taken) -> then positions 3 and 5 need letters: E _ R I _ -> but we have E at 1, R at 2, I at 4, so position 3 and 5 are open. But we have only two more letters? The word must have R, I, E and two others. So positions: 3 and 5 are for the new letters.

But R is at 2? Then the word so far: E, R, ?, I, ?

But we have constraint that R cannot be at 4? We are putting R at 2, which is allowed.

But we also have I at 4: allowed? Yes, because I can be at 4.

Now, what words start with ""ER"" and have I at position 4? And contain E, R, I and two other letters not A,S,N,T.

For example: ""ERBIA"" but A is not allowed. ""ERICA"" has A. ""ERMIN"" has N? N is not allowed.

""ERBIA"" is not a word? Let's think.

Another: ""ERGOT"" but T is not allowed? T is absent.

We need letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Try ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> but T is absent? T is not allowed.

""ERODE"": E, R, O, D, E -> but E repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far? The feedback didn't show duplicates. But we should avoid repeating letters to maximize information? However, E is already known, but we might have two E's? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and in the second at position 3, both marked as present but wrong position. It could be the same E? Or two E's? We don't know. But to be safe, assume no duplicates for now.

But ""ERODE"" has two E's? So not distinct.

""ERUCT"": E, R, U, C, T -> T absent? Not allowed.

""ERIKA"" has A and K? A not allowed.

This is difficult. Maybe E at 1 is not the best.

Option 2: Place E at position 2.
Then:
- E at 2: allowed (since E not forbidden at 2).
- Then positions: _ E _ _ _
- R: can be at 3 or 5 (since not 1,4; and 2 taken by E) -> so 3 or 5.
- I: can be at 4 or 5 (since not 1,3; and 2 taken) -> so 4 or 5.

If R at 3, then I can be at 4 or 5.
If R at 5, then I can be at 4.

Also, position 1 and the remaining position need letters.

Example: R at 3, I at 4: then word: _ E R I _
Position 1 and 5 need letters.

We have to fill with two new letters.

What words: ? E R I ?

With the last letter at position 5.

And the word must contain E, R, I and two others.

Known: E at 2, R at 3, I at 4.

So the word is: X E R I Y

Where X and Y are from the available letters (not A,S,N,T).

Possible words: 
- ""DERIV"" - D, E, R, I, V -> valid? ""DERIV"" is not a common word? Derivative? But 5 letters? ""DERIV"" might be a root, but let's see: ""DERIVE"" is 6 letters. So not.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> but T is absent? Not allowed.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> L is allowed? Yes. And no A,S,N,T. So ""PERIL"" is a valid word.

Check positions:
- E at 2: allowed? Yes.
- R at 3: allowed? R can be at 3? Yes, because R was not forbidden at 3? Previously R was at 1 and 4, so 3 is new.
- I at 4: allowed? I was at 3 and 1 before, so 4 is new? Yes.

Also, P at 1 and L at 5: both new.

So ""PERIL"" is a candidate.

Another: ""HEROIC"" is 6 letters. ""HERO"" is 4.

""BERIM"" not a word.

""FERIA"" has A? Not allowed.

""VERIFY"" too long.

So ""PERIL"" seems good.

Another possibility: R at 5 and I at 4: then word: _ E _ I R

So positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: I, 5: R.

Word: X E Y I R

What words? ""DEVIL"" but L at 3? D E V I R? ""DEVIR"" not a word.

""LEVIR"" not common.

""PECAN"" has N? Not allowed.

""LEGIT"" has T? Not allowed.

So ""PERIL"" is better.

Option 3: Place E at position 4.
Then:
- E at 4: allowed (since E not forbidden at 4).
- Then positions: _ _ _ E _
- R: can be at 2,3,5 (not 1,4; 4 taken by E) -> so 2,3,5.
- I: can be at 2,5 (since not 1,3; and 4 taken) -> so 2 or 5.

If R at 2, then I at 5 (since 2 taken).
If R at 3, then I at 2 or 5.
If R at 5, then I at 2.

Example: R at 2, I at 5: then word: _ R _ E I

So: X R Y E I

What words: ""URAEI"" not common. ""CRAWL"" but L at 3? C R A W I? A not allowed.

""GRUEL"" has U and E? G R U E I? ""GRUEI"" not a word.

""FREUD"" has D? F R E U D? But E is at position 3? We have E at 4? In this structure: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: I.

So ""FR E E I"" but two E's? Not.

""BREAD"" has A and D? A not allowed.

Not many options.

R at 3, I at 2: then word: _ I R E _

So: X I R E Y

Words: ""DIRECT"" too long. ""DIRGE"": D I R G E -> but E is at position 5? We have E at 4? So ""DIRGE"" is D at 1, I at 2, R at 3, G at 4, E at 5? But we need E at 4? In this case, we have position 4 as E? But in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G? Not E.

We need E at position 4.

So for ""X I R E Y"": position 1: X, 2: I, 3: R, 4: E, 5: Y.

What words: ""FIRE"" is 4 letters. ""FIRED"" is F I R E D -> that's 5 letters: F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

""FIRED"" is a word? Yes, meaning dismissed from a job.

Check constraints:
- I at 2: allowed? I was not at 2 before? Previously I at 3 and 1, so 2 is new -> allowed.
- R at 3: allowed? R was at 1 and 4 before, so 3 is new -> allowed.
- E at 4: allowed? E was at 5 and 3 before, so 4 is new -> allowed.
- F and D: not in the absent list? F and D are allowed.

Absent letters: A, S, N, T. So F and D are okay.

So ""FIRED"" is a candidate.

But we have two candidates: ""PERIL"" and ""FIRED"".

Which one to choose?

""PERIL"": uses P and L, which are less common? But valid.

""FIRED"": uses F and D.

Letter frequency: F is about 2.2%, D is 4.3%, P is 1.9%, L is 4.0%. So D and L are more common than F and P.

But both are acceptable.

We might also consider that in ""PERIL"", we have E at position 2, which we haven't tested? Previously E was at 5 and 3.

In ""FIRED"", E is at 4, which is new.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"", R is at 3, which is new for R? Previously R at 1 and 4.

In ""FIRED"", R is at 3, same as in ""PERIL"".

But ""PERIL"" has I at 4, which is new? Previously I at 3 and 1.

""FIRED"" has I at 2, which is also new.

So both test new positions.

But ""PERIL"" might be better because it uses more common letters? L is more common than F? L: 4.0%, F: 2.2%. But D is 4.3% and P is 1.9%. So ""FIRED"" has D (4.3%) and F (2.2%), ""PERIL"" has P (1.9%) and L (4.0%). Average: ""FIRED"" (3.25%) vs ""PERIL"" (2.95%)? But not a big difference.

We can choose either.

Another word: ""RIPED"" but not common? ""RIPED"" is not standard; ""RIPEN"" has N.

""WIRED"": W I R E D -> same as ""FIRED"" but with W? W is less common.

""FIRED"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with more common letters.

""OILER"": O I L E R -> 
Positions: O at 1, I at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
Check constraints:
- I at 2: allowed.
- E at 4: allowed.
- R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5? Yes, because not forbidden (only not 1 and 4).
- O and L: allowed? Yes.

""OILER"" is a word (one who oils or a tanker ship).

And O and L are common: O ~7.2%, L ~4.0%.

So ""OILER"" is also a candidate.

Now, among ""PERIL"", ""FIRED"", ""OILER"", which is best?

""OILER"" uses O and L, which are more common than the letters in the others? O is 7.2%, L 4.0% -> average 5.6%. ""FIRED"": F 2.2%, D 4.3% -> 3.25%. ""PERIL"": P 1.9%, L 4.0% -> 2.95%. So ""OILER"" has higher frequency letters.

Also, positions: 
- I at 2: new
- E at 4: new
- R at 5: new

All good.

So I choose ""OILER"".

But let's confirm: the word must not have A,S,N,T, and ""OILER"" has O,I,L,E,R -> no A,S,N,T. Good.

Therefore, next guess: OILER.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-) → R, I, E are present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5), while A and S are absent.
- **Guess 2 (INERT)**: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x) → I, E, R are still present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 for E; not in 1 or 4 for R; not in 1 for I), while N and T are absent.

Key insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, I, E (all must appear exactly once, as no duplicates indicated).
- **Absent letters**: A, S, N, T (cannot appear).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE) or 4 (from INERT) → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
  - I: Cannot be in position 1 (from INERT) or 3 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
  - E: Cannot be in position 3 (from INERT) or 5 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
- **Available letters for remaining positions**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, S, N, T are ruled out).

For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R, I, E and two new letters from the available set.
- Respects the position constraints for R, I, E.
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- **OILER** (O, I, L, E, R) is a strong choice:
  - Positions: I(2), E(4), R(5) → satisfies all constraints (I not in 1/3, E not in 3/5, R not in 1/4).
  - New letters: O and L (both common; O is ~7.2% frequency, L is ~4.0%).
  - Tests new positions: I at 2 (previously tested at 1 and 3), E at 4 (previously at 3 and 5), R at 5 (previously at 1 and 4).
  - Valid English word (meaning: one who oils or a type of ship).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the feedback.

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a valid 5-letter English word that includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and frequent consonants include R, S, T, L, N.

Based on English letter frequency analysis:
- E is the most common letter (~11%)
- A, R, I, O, T, N, S are also top-tier (~5-8% each)

A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal for the first guess because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E — all high-frequency letters.
- It uses distinct letters (no repeats), covering five different positions.
- This increases the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, so no prior feedback exists. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repeating letters. Based on English letter frequency (E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S being the most common), ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice as it uses five top-frequency distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word with high-frequency letters to maximize information. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E.
- All five letters are among the most common in English (E ~11%, A ~8.5%, R ~7.6%, I ~7.3%, S ~5.7%).
- This combination provides broad coverage across vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S), which increases the likelihood of revealing matching letters in the secret word.

Alternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also solid choices, but ""RAISE"" has a slightly higher frequency score due to the inclusion of ""I"" (more common than ""C"" or ""L""). ""RAISE"" is a valid English word, ensuring it's accepted.

By selecting this word, I can use the feedback (✓, -, or x) to refine subsequent guesses efficiently.

<guess> RAISE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: tags. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback to consider.

Let me output the guess accordingly.
</think>
<guess>RAISE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are provided with feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- R: present but wrong position (marked as -)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: present but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, I, E (all in wrong positions)
- Does not contain A or S
- Letters known to be present: R, I, E
- Letters known to be absent: A, S

Now, since R, I, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (as in ""RAISE""), we must avoid placing them in these positions in the next guess.

Positions in RAISE:
1: R -> wrong position (so R cannot be in position 1)
2: A -> absent (so A not in word)
3: I -> wrong position (so I cannot be in position 3)
4: S -> absent (so S not in word)
5: E -> wrong position (so E cannot be in position 5)

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include R, I, E (since they are present per feedback).
- Must exclude A and S (since they are absent).
- Do not put R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- We have three known letters: R, I, E. We need to add two more letters that are not A or S (and not already used). Also, avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Possible new letters: Try common letters that haven't been ruled out. From common frequency: O, T, N, L, C, U, etc. Avoid A and S.

Candidates:
- Include R, I, E and two other letters from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} - excluding A, S.

Considering words that contain R, I, E and satisfy the position constraints.

Try to form a word:
- Options: 
  - Could be something like ""PRICE"", but P and C are allowed? 
  - But ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E. 
  - Positions: R would be in position 2 (not 1, allowed). I in position 3? But feedback said I was wrong in position 3, so cannot put I in 3? Actually, the feedback means that in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but it might be elsewhere. So in the next guess, we can put I in another position to test.

Constraints for next guess positions:
- Position 1: cannot be R (but could be I or E? Since they were not in their original positions, but R was in 1 and that was wrong, so avoid R at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be I (since that was wrong)
- Position 5: cannot be E (since that was wrong)

But E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Not 5, so 1-4.
Similarly, R: anywhere but 1? Actually, R might be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly I: anywhere but 3? So positions 1,2,4,5.

Also, we don't know the exact positions, so we need a word that shuffles R, I, E to other positions.

Try common words: 
- Consider words starting with E? Since E might be at start? But E was at position 5 and wrong, but could it be at position 1? Yes! We don't have info about E except not at 5.

Examples of words with R, I, E and without A, S:
- ""CRIER"" - but might have repeated R? C, R, I, E, R -> has two R's, which is less information efficient because it uses a repeated letter. Prefer distinct letters if possible.
- ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> letters are distinct. Positions: D at 1, R at 2, I at 3 -> but I cannot be at position 3 (feedback from guess 1: I was at position 3 and was wrong position). So cannot have I in position 3 in next guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient because we know I is not at 3. Why test the same position? We should try a different position for I? To get new information.

Best to test I in a new position: position 1,2,4,5 because position 3 is ruled out.

Similarly, E cannot be in 5, so position 1,2,3,4.

Thus for ""DRIVE"":
- Position 3 is I: which is not allowed because I was wrong in position 3. Therefore, avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R in position 1 and E in position 5.

So ""DRIVE"" places I at position 3: invalid because we know I cannot be at position 3.

What about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E
- Position 1: P -> allowed (since unknown letter)
- Position 2: R -> allowed (R is not prohibited from position 2, only position 1)
- Position 3: I -> not allowed, because position 3 for I returned '-' meaning wrong position? And since we know I is in the word but not at 3, we should avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can put I at position 3 to rule out other positions? No, better to use a new position because placing I at 3 would get '-' again if it's still wrong, but we don't gain information. Placing at a new position might reveal if that's the correct position or not.

Therefore, prioritize changing positions for known letters (R, I, E) to gather new information.

So:
- Place R anywhere but 1.
- Place I anywhere but 3.
- Place E anywhere but 5.

Also, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E could be at 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, R could be at 2,3,4,5.

I could be at 1,2,4,5.

Try to find words that reposition these letters.

Ideal: put R in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (not 1), I in 1,2,4,5 (not 3), E in 1,2,3,4 (not 5), and add two new letters (distinct and not A, S).

Considering common words:
- ""RIVEN"": R, I, V, E, N -> positions: R at 1 -> not allowed? Because R was found at position 1 and was wrong position? So we know position 1 cannot be R? So avoid R at position 1. Therefore, ""RIVEN"" places R at 1: invalid.

Another: ""RIPEN"": R at 1 -> same issue.

How about ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> positions: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R -> allowed
  Position 3: I -> not allowed (position 3 is bad for I). So skip.

How about ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> positions:
  Pos1: U
  Pos2: R -> allowed? Yes, R not at 1 now.
  Pos3: I -> but I cannot be at pos3 -> invalid.

We must avoid pos3 for I.

So any word with at position 3 something that is not I? But I could be elsewhere.

Try words with I not in pos3:
Example: place I at position 1.

Possible: ""IRATE"" but that has A -> A is absent? We cannot use A because feedback said A is not in the word.

A is ruled out.

""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> letters: I, N, E, R, T -> distinct, no A or S.
Positions:
1: I (allowed? since I was at pos3 before and now at pos1, new position)
2: N
3: E -> E can be at position 3? we haven't ruled out any position for E except pos5. Also, E was absent at position 5? Not absent: E was at position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it could be at position 3? Yes, we don't know. 
4: R -> R not at position 1: this is position 4, allowed? Yes.
5: T -> no E at 5: good.

Feedback constraints:
- Don't place R at pos1: done (R is at pos4)
- Don't place I at pos3: yes, because I at pos1
- Don't place E at pos5: done (E at pos3)

So ""INERT"" is a valid choice.

Is ""INERT"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning inanimate or lacking vigor.

Another option: ""OLDER"" but O, L, D, E, R -> doesn't include I? We must include R, I, E because they are present in the word? The feedback says R, I, E must be in the guess? Or no? Actually, not necessarily: the guess doesn't have to include all known letters. However, missing a known letter might be inefficient because we wouldn't get information about its position. Since we have three known letters (R,I,E) to place, we should include them to test positions.

Therefore, ""INERT"" covers I at 1 (new position), E at 3 (new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at 3), R at 4 (new position? Previously R was at 1, now at 4).

We add N and T, common letters.

Another word: ""EVICT"" — includes E and I? But missing R? So not including R: inefficient.

Or ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> includes I and E but not R, so missing R.

Therefore, ""INERT"" is a good choice.

Another: ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
Pos1: T 
Pos2: R (allowed because not pos1? Yes) 
Pos3: I -> cannot be pos3: avoid.

""TRIED"" puts I at position 3.

Not good.

""CRIED"": same issue.

""HIDER"": H, I, D, E, R -> 
Pos1: H 
Pos2: I -> allowed? Position 2 for I: new position? Yes. Previously I was at pos3? Previously I at pos3 marked wrong, so now at pos2: good. 
Pos3: D 
Pos4: E -> E at pos4? Previously E at pos5: now moved to pos4. 
Pos5: R 

This works? Positions: 
- R at position 5: allowed? Previously R was at pos1 and wrong? Now at pos5: different position. 
- I at position 2: not position 3 -> allowed? Yes. 
- E at position 4: not position 5 -> allowed? Yes.

So ""HIDER"" is an option.

But how common? Also, N and T might be better than D and H? ""INERT"" uses N and T.

I think both are possible. ""INERT"" seems more standard.

Let's list possible words: including R, I, E; without A, S; and position constraints.

Word: ""INER  T"" -> ""INERT"" valid. 
Word: ""T I E R D"" -> ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> 
Pos: 
1:T 
2:I 
3:R -> I is not at 3? No, I at position 2, R at position 3. 
Is R allowed at 3? Previously R was at position 1 and found to be incorrect. We suspect R might be elsewhere? We don't know, so R at position 3 is allowed? Similarly, positions: 
2: I -> okay? Previously I at 2? No, I was at 3 before. Now at 2: new position. 
3: R -> okay? R's position? Previously at 1: now at 3: distinct position? Yes. 
4: E -> previously at 5? Now at 4: allowed. 
5: D 

But ""TIRED"" doesn't satisfy? The word is ""TIRED"": letters T,I,R,E,D? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D.

I at position 2: new -> ok. 
E at position 4: new -> ok. 
R at position 3: new? Previously R at pos1: yes, now at 3: so we'd get a symbol to see if R at pos3 is correct or not? Not inefficient? It gains information.

The feedback would tell us: if R at position 3 is correct or not? Similarly for I at 2.

Both ""INERT"" and ""TIRED"" are options.

I think ""INERT"" uses letters N and T, which are more common than D? But both valid.

Stick with ""INERT"".

Confirm: secret word must contain R, I, E somewhere? Yes.

Next guess: INERT

If ""INERT"" is: 
- I at position 1: if correct, would get ✓. If not, '-' or x? But I is in the word, so only ✓ or '-' for I? Because I is in the word? Wait, feedback symbols: 
✓ if correct position and present.
- if present but wrong position.
x if absent.

Since we know I is present (from first guess), so for any new position, we'd get ✓ if correct, or '-' if wrong position? Never x.

Similarly for R and E.

So it makes sense to try them in new positions.

Therefore, I choose ""INERT"".
</thinking>
<guess>INERT</guess><thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R: present but wrong position (not in position 1)
- A: absent
- I: present but wrong position (not in position 3)
- S: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not in position 5)

This means:
- The secret word contains R, I, E but not A or S.
- R cannot be in position 1.
- I cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Includes R, I, E (since they are confirmed present).
- Excludes A and S.
- Avoids placing R in position 1, I in position 3, or E in position 5.
- Uses new positions for R, I, E to gather better information.
- Incorporates new common letters (e.g., T, N) to maximize coverage.

After evaluating options:
- ""INERT"" is ideal: 
  - Positions: I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5) — all constraints are met.
  - I is moved to position 1 (new position), E to position 3 (new), R to position 4 (new).
  - Uses N and T, which are highly common letters.
  - It will reveal fresh feedback on the positions of R, I, E and test new letters.

Other considered words like ""TIRED"" or ""HIDER"" met some constraints but were less optimal (e.g., using less common letters). ""INERT"" is a valid word meaning lacking vigor or inanimate, making it a strong second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

So step-by-step thinking:
- No prior feedback, so choose a word that maximizes information gain.
- Opt for a word with diverse, common letters and no repeats to cover more ground.
- ""CRANE"" is a good option: letters C, R, A, N, E.
- Alternatives: ""SLATE"" (S,L,A,T,E), ""CRATE"" (C,R,A,T,E), but I've seen ""CRANE"" used often.
- ""DEUCE"" might have less common letters, so probably not.
- Aim for high-frequency letters: E is the most common letter, then A, R, etc.
- According to letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are top.
- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E — five of the top letters.
- Similarly, ""SOARE"" but that might not be great.
- I think ""RAISE"" could be better than ""CRANE"" because it has more high-frequency letters.

Letter frequency in English:
1. E
2. A
3. R
4. I
5. O
6. T
7. N
8. S
Etc.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E — so positions: E is common, A common, I common, S common, R common. Wait, RAISE: R, A, I, S, E — all top letters.

""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E — C is less common than S or I, N is common but S might be better.

S is more frequent than C. Frequency: E (11%), A (8.5%), R (7.6%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.6%), S (5.7%), etc. C is around 2.8%, so higher than some but S is better.

In terms of vowel/consonant balance, ""RAISE"" has three vowels A,I,E and two consonants R,S.

""CRANE"" has vowels A,E and consonants C,R,N.

""SLATE"" has vowels A,E and consonants S,L,T.

""ROAST"" is another option.

But for information gain, having distinct letters is key, so no repeats. All these examples have no repeats, which is good.

I think either is fine; I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses 5 very common letters.
</think>
<thinking>
Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a valid 5-letter English word that includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and frequent consonants include R, S, T, L, N.

Based on English letter frequency analysis:
- E is the most common letter (~11%)
- A, R, I, O, T, N, S are also top-tier (~5-8% each)

A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal for the first guess because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E — all high-frequency letters.
- It uses distinct letters (no repeats), covering five different positions.
- This increases the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

""RAISE"" is a valid English word meaning to cause to rise or lift, making it an appropriate choice.
</thinking>

<guess> RAISE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: tags. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback to consider.

Let me output the guess accordingly.
</think>
<guess>RAISE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 4: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. RAISE: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. INERT: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x)
   Interpretation:
   - I is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for I at position 1).
   - N is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for E at position 3).
   - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since we got '-' for R at position 4).
   - T is not in the word.

Combining the feedback:
- Letters in the word: R, I, E (from both guesses, and they are still present but in wrong positions).
- Letters not in the word: A, S, N, T (from the feedback of both guesses).
- Position constraints:
  - R: not in position 1 (from RAISE) and not in position 4 (from INERT). So R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  - I: not in position 3 (from RAISE) and not in position 1 (from INERT). So I cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  - E: not in position 5 (from RAISE) and not in position 3 (from INERT). So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

We know the word has 5 letters and contains R, I, E. The remaining two letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, S, N, T and the known present letters (R,I,E). Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, I, N, E, R, T (from the two guesses). The absent letters are A, S, N, T.

So the available letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, I, E (each exactly once, since we have no indication of duplicates and we haven't seen any).
- Contains two more letters from the available set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Satisfies the position constraints:
  - R: not in 1 or 4 -> possible positions: 2, 3, 5.
  - I: not in 1 or 3 -> possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - E: not in 3 or 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's try to assign positions:

Consider possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4.

Similarly for R: 2, 3, 5.

And for I: 2, 4, 5.

Note that position 2 is a possible position for all three, but we can only have one letter per position.

We need to choose positions that don't conflict.

Let's list possible words:

Option 1: Place E at position 1.
Then:
- E at 1: allowed.
- Then R can be at 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be at 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 might be taken by R).

If E at 1, then position 2 is free for R or I? But we have two more letters to place.

The word structure: E _ _ _ _

Now, we need to place R, I, and two other letters.

But R and I must be in the word, so two of the remaining four positions must be R and I.

Positions: 2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R: not 1 (already taken by E) and not 4 -> so R can be at 2,3,5.
- I: not 1 (taken) and not 3 -> so I can be at 2,4,5.

But if we put R at 2, then I cannot be at 2 -> so I at 4 or 5.

Similarly, if R at 3, then I at 2,4,5 (but 3 taken by R, so I at 2,4,5).

If R at 5, then I at 2 or 4.

Also, E is at 1, which is allowed.

Now, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.

Example: E at 1, R at 2, then I at 4 (since 2 taken) -> then positions 3 and 5 need letters: E _ R I _ -> but we have E at 1, R at 2, I at 4, so position 3 and 5 are open. But we have only two more letters? The word must have R, I, E and two others. So positions: 3 and 5 are for the new letters.

But R is at 2? Then the word so far: E, R, ?, I, ?

But we have constraint that R cannot be at 4? We are putting R at 2, which is allowed.

But we also have I at 4: allowed? Yes, because I can be at 4.

Now, what words start with ""ER"" and have I at position 4? And contain E, R, I and two other letters not A,S,N,T.

For example: ""ERBIA"" but A is not allowed. ""ERICA"" has A. ""ERMIN"" has N? N is not allowed.

""ERBIA"" is not a word? Let's think.

Another: ""ERGOT"" but T is not allowed? T is absent.

We need letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Try ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> but T is absent? T is not allowed.

""ERODE"": E, R, O, D, E -> but E repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far? The feedback didn't show duplicates. But we should avoid repeating letters to maximize information? However, E is already known, but we might have two E's? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and in the second at position 3, both marked as present but wrong position. It could be the same E? Or two E's? We don't know. But to be safe, assume no duplicates for now.

But ""ERODE"" has two E's? So not distinct.

""ERUCT"": E, R, U, C, T -> T absent? Not allowed.

""ERIKA"" has A and K? A not allowed.

This is difficult. Maybe E at 1 is not the best.

Option 2: Place E at position 2.
Then:
- E at 2: allowed (since E not forbidden at 2).
- Then positions: _ E _ _ _
- R: can be at 3 or 5 (since not 1,4; and 2 taken by E) -> so 3 or 5.
- I: can be at 4 or 5 (since not 1,3; and 2 taken) -> so 4 or 5.

If R at 3, then I can be at 4 or 5.
If R at 5, then I can be at 4.

Also, position 1 and the remaining position need letters.

Example: R at 3, I at 4: then word: _ E R I _
Position 1 and 5 need letters.

We have to fill with two new letters.

What words: ? E R I ?

With the last letter at position 5.

And the word must contain E, R, I and two others.

Known: E at 2, R at 3, I at 4.

So the word is: X E R I Y

Where X and Y are from the available letters (not A,S,N,T).

Possible words: 
- ""DERIV"" - D, E, R, I, V -> valid? ""DERIV"" is not a common word? Derivative? But 5 letters? ""DERIV"" might be a root, but let's see: ""DERIVE"" is 6 letters. So not.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> but T is absent? Not allowed.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> L is allowed? Yes. And no A,S,N,T. So ""PERIL"" is a valid word.

Check positions:
- E at 2: allowed? Yes.
- R at 3: allowed? R can be at 3? Yes, because R was not forbidden at 3? Previously R was at 1 and 4, so 3 is new.
- I at 4: allowed? I was at 3 and 1 before, so 4 is new? Yes.

Also, P at 1 and L at 5: both new.

So ""PERIL"" is a candidate.

Another: ""HEROIC"" is 6 letters. ""HERO"" is 4.

""BERIM"" not a word.

""FERIA"" has A? Not allowed.

""VERIFY"" too long.

So ""PERIL"" seems good.

Another possibility: R at 5 and I at 4: then word: _ E _ I R

So positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: I, 5: R.

Word: X E Y I R

What words? ""DEVIL"" but L at 3? D E V I R? ""DEVIR"" not a word.

""LEVIR"" not common.

""PECAN"" has N? Not allowed.

""LEGIT"" has T? Not allowed.

So ""PERIL"" is better.

Option 3: Place E at position 4.
Then:
- E at 4: allowed (since E not forbidden at 4).
- Then positions: _ _ _ E _
- R: can be at 2,3,5 (not 1,4; 4 taken by E) -> so 2,3,5.
- I: can be at 2,5 (since not 1,3; and 4 taken) -> so 2 or 5.

If R at 2, then I at 5 (since 2 taken).
If R at 3, then I at 2 or 5.
If R at 5, then I at 2.

Example: R at 2, I at 5: then word: _ R _ E I

So: X R Y E I

What words: ""URAEI"" not common. ""CRAWL"" but L at 3? C R A W I? A not allowed.

""GRUEL"" has U and E? G R U E I? ""GRUEI"" not a word.

""FREUD"" has D? F R E U D? But E is at position 3? We have E at 4? In this structure: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: I.

So ""FR E E I"" but two E's? Not.

""BREAD"" has A and D? A not allowed.

Not many options.

R at 3, I at 2: then word: _ I R E _

So: X I R E Y

Words: ""DIRECT"" too long. ""DIRGE"": D I R G E -> but E is at position 5? We have E at 4? So ""DIRGE"" is D at 1, I at 2, R at 3, G at 4, E at 5? But we need E at 4? In this case, we have position 4 as E? But in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G? Not E.

We need E at position 4.

So for ""X I R E Y"": position 1: X, 2: I, 3: R, 4: E, 5: Y.

What words: ""FIRE"" is 4 letters. ""FIRED"" is F I R E D -> that's 5 letters: F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

""FIRED"" is a word? Yes, meaning dismissed from a job.

Check constraints:
- I at 2: allowed? I was not at 2 before? Previously I at 3 and 1, so 2 is new -> allowed.
- R at 3: allowed? R was at 1 and 4 before, so 3 is new -> allowed.
- E at 4: allowed? E was at 5 and 3 before, so 4 is new -> allowed.
- F and D: not in the absent list? F and D are allowed.

Absent letters: A, S, N, T. So F and D are okay.

So ""FIRED"" is a candidate.

But we have two candidates: ""PERIL"" and ""FIRED"".

Which one to choose?

""PERIL"": uses P and L, which are less common? But valid.

""FIRED"": uses F and D.

Letter frequency: F is about 2.2%, D is 4.3%, P is 1.9%, L is 4.0%. So D and L are more common than F and P.

But both are acceptable.

We might also consider that in ""PERIL"", we have E at position 2, which we haven't tested? Previously E was at 5 and 3.

In ""FIRED"", E is at 4, which is new.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"", R is at 3, which is new for R? Previously R at 1 and 4.

In ""FIRED"", R is at 3, same as in ""PERIL"".

But ""PERIL"" has I at 4, which is new? Previously I at 3 and 1.

""FIRED"" has I at 2, which is also new.

So both test new positions.

But ""PERIL"" might be better because it uses more common letters? L is more common than F? L: 4.0%, F: 2.2%. But D is 4.3% and P is 1.9%. So ""FIRED"" has D (4.3%) and F (2.2%), ""PERIL"" has P (1.9%) and L (4.0%). Average: ""FIRED"" (3.25%) vs ""PERIL"" (2.95%)? But not a big difference.

We can choose either.

Another word: ""RIPED"" but not common? ""RIPED"" is not standard; ""RIPEN"" has N.

""WIRED"": W I R E D -> same as ""FIRED"" but with W? W is less common.

""FIRED"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with more common letters.

""OILER"": O I L E R -> 
Positions: O at 1, I at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
Check constraints:
- I at 2: allowed.
- E at 4: allowed.
- R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5? Yes, because not forbidden (only not 1 and 4).
- O and L: allowed? Yes.

""OILER"" is a word (one who oils or a tanker ship).

And O and L are common: O ~7.2%, L ~4.0%.

So ""OILER"" is also a candidate.

Now, among ""PERIL"", ""FIRED"", ""OILER"", which is best?

""OILER"" uses O and L, which are more common than the letters in the others? O is 7.2%, L 4.0% -> average 5.6%. ""FIRED"": F 2.2%, D 4.3% -> 3.25%. ""PERIL"": P 1.9%, L 4.0% -> 2.95%. So ""OILER"" has higher frequency letters.

Also, positions: 
- I at 2: new
- E at 4: new
- R at 5: new

All good.

So I choose ""OILER"".

But let's confirm: the word must not have A,S,N,T, and ""OILER"" has O,I,L,E,R -> no A,S,N,T. Good.

Therefore, next guess: OILER.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-) → R, I, E are present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5), while A and S are absent.
- **Guess 2 (INERT)**: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x) → I, E, R are still present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 for E; not in 1 or 4 for R; not in 1 for I), while N and T are absent.

Key insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, I, E (all must appear exactly once, as no duplicates indicated).
- **Absent letters**: A, S, N, T (cannot appear).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE) or 4 (from INERT) → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
  - I: Cannot be in position 1 (from INERT) or 3 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
  - E: Cannot be in position 3 (from INERT) or 5 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
- **Available letters for remaining positions**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, S, N, T are ruled out).

For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Includes R, I, E and two new letters from the available set.
- Respects the position constraints for R, I, E.
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- **OILER** (O, I, L, E, R) is a strong choice:
  - Positions: I(2), E(4), R(5) → satisfies all constraints (I not in 1/3, E not in 3/5, R not in 1/4).
  - New letters: O and L (both common; O is ~7.2% frequency, L is ~4.0%).
  - Tests new positions: I at 2 (previously tested at 1 and 3), E at 4 (previously at 3 and 5), R at 5 (previously at 1 and 4).
  - Valid English word (meaning: one who oils or a type of ship).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the feedback.

I in position 3? But feedback said I was wrong in position 3, so cannot put I in 3? Actually, the feedback means that in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but it might be elsewhere. So in the next guess, we can put I in another position to test.\n\nConstraints for next guess positions:\n- Position 1: cannot be R (but could be I or E? Since they were not in their original positions, but R was in 1 and that was wrong, so avoid R at 1)\n- Position 3: cannot be I (since that was wrong)\n- Position 5: cannot be E (since that was wrong)\n\nBut E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Not 5, so 1-4.\nSimilarly, R: anywhere but 1? Actually, R might be in 2,3,4,5.\nSimilarly I: anywhere but 3? So positions 1,2,4,5.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know the exact positions, so we need a word that shuffles R, I, E to other positions.\n\nTry common words: \n- Consider words starting with E? Since E might be at start? But E was at position 5 and wrong, but could it be at position 1? Yes! We don\'t have info about E except not at 5.\n\nExamples of words with R, I, E and without A, S:\n- ""CRIER"" - but might have repeated R? C, R, I, E, R -> has two R\'s, which is less information efficient because it uses a repeated letter. Prefer distinct letters if possible.\n- ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> letters are distinct. Positions: D at 1, R at 2, I at 3 -> but I cannot be at position 3 (feedback from guess 1: I was at position 3 and was wrong position). So cannot have I in position 3 in next guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient because we know I is not at 3. Why test the same position? We should try a different position for I? To get new information.\n\nBest to test I in a new position: position 1,2,4,5 because position 3 is ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be in 5, so position 1,2,3,4.\n\nThus for ""DRIVE"":\n- Position 3 is I: which is not allowed because I was wrong in position 3. Therefore, avoid putting I in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting R in position 1 and E in position 5.\n\nSo ""DRIVE"" places I at position 3: invalid because we know I cannot be at position 3.\n\nWhat about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E\n- Position 1: P -> allowed (since unknown letter)\n- Position 2: R -> allowed (R is not prohibited from position 2, only position 1)\n- Position 3: I -> not allowed, because position 3 for I returned \'-\' meaning wrong position? And since we know I is in the word but not at 3, we should avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can put I at position 3 to rule out other positions? No, better to use a new position because placing I at 3 would get \'-\' again if it\'s still wrong, but we don\'t gain information. Placing at a new position might reveal if that\'s the correct position or not.\n\nTherefore, prioritize changing positions for known letters (R, I, E) to gather new information.\n\nSo:\n- Place R anywhere but 1.\n- Place I anywhere but 3.\n- Place E anywhere but 5.\n\nAlso, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E could be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, R could be at 2,3,4,5.\n\nI could be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nTry to find words that reposition these letters.\n\nIdeal: put R in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (not 1), I in 1,2,4,5 (not 3), E in 1,2,3,4 (not 5), and add two new letters (distinct and not A, S).\n\nConsidering common words:\n- ""RIVEN"": R, I, V, E, N -> positions: R at 1 -> not allowed? Because R was found at position 1 and was wrong position? So we know position 1 cannot be R? So avoid R at position 1. Therefore, ""RIVEN"" places R at 1: invalid.\n\nAnother: ""RIPEN"": R at 1 -> same issue.\n\nHow about ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> positions: \n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: R -> allowed\n  Position 3: I -> not allowed (position 3 is bad for I). So skip.\n\nHow about ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> positions:\n  Pos1: U\n  Pos2: R -> allowed? Yes, R not at 1 now.\n  Pos3: I -> but I cannot be at pos3 -> invalid.\n\nWe must avoid pos3 for I.\n\nSo any word with at position 3 something that is not I? But I could be elsewhere.\n\nTry words with I not in pos3:\nExample: place I at position 1.\n\nPossible: ""IRATE"" but that has A -> A is absent? We cannot use A because feedback said A is not in the word.\n\nA is ruled out.\n\n""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> letters: I, N, E, R, T -> distinct, no A or S.\nPositions:\n1: I (allowed? since I was at pos3 before and now at pos1, new position)\n2: N\n3: E -> E can be at position 3? we haven\'t ruled out any position for E except pos5. Also, E was absent at position 5? Not absent: E was at position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it could be at position 3? Yes, we don\'t know. \n4: R -> R not at position 1: this is position 4, allowed? Yes.\n5: T -> no E at 5: good.\n\nFeedback constraints:\n- Don\'t place R at pos1: done (R is at pos4)\n- Don\'t place I at pos3: yes, because I at pos1\n- Don\'t place E at pos5: done (E at pos3)\n\nSo ""INERT"" is a valid choice.\n\nIs ""INERT"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning inanimate or lacking vigor.\n\nAnother option: ""OLDER"" but O, L, D, E, R -> doesn\'t include I? We must include R, I, E because they are present in the word? The feedback says R, I, E must be in the guess? Or no? Actually, not necessarily: the guess doesn\'t have to include all known letters. However, missing a known letter might be inefficient because we wouldn\'t get information about its position. Since we have three known letters (R,I,E) to place, we should include them to test positions.\n\nTherefore, ""INERT"" covers I at 1 (new position), E at 3 (new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at 3), R at 4 (new position? Previously R was at 1, now at 4).\n\nWe add N and T, common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""EVICT"" — includes E and I? But missing R? So not including R: inefficient.\n\nOr ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> includes I and E but not R, so missing R.\n\nTherefore, ""INERT"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother: ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> \nPos1: T \nPos2: R (allowed because not pos1? Yes) \nPos3: I -> cannot be pos3: avoid.\n\n""TRIED"" puts I at position 3.\n\nNot good.\n\n""CRIED"": same issue.\n\n""HIDER"": H, I, D, E, R -> \nPos1: H \nPos2: I -> allowed?

Previously E at pos5: now moved to pos4. \nPos5: R \n\nThis works? Positions: \n- R at position 5: allowed? Previously R was at pos1 and wrong? Now at pos5: different position. \n- I at position 2: not position 3 -> allowed? Yes. \n- E at position 4: not position 5 -> allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""HIDER"" is an option.\n\nBut how common? Also, N and T might be better than D and H? ""INERT"" uses N and T.\n\nI think both are possible. ""INERT"" seems more standard.\n\nLet\'s list possible words: including R, I, E; without A, S; and position constraints.\n\nWord: ""INER  T"" -> ""INERT"" valid. \nWord: ""T I E R D"" -> ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> \nPos: \n1:T \n2:I \n3:R -> I is not at 3? No, I at position 2, R at position 3. \nIs R allowed at 3? Previously R was at position 1 and found to be incorrect. We suspect R might be elsewhere? We don\'t know, so R at position 3 is allowed? Similarly, positions: \n2: I -> okay? Previously I at 2? No, I was at 3 before. Now at 2: new position. \n3: R -> okay? R\'s position? Previously at 1: now at 3: distinct position? Yes. \n4: E -> previously at 5? Now at 4: allowed. \n5: D \n\nBut ""TIRED"" doesn\'t satisfy? The word is ""TIRED"": letters T,I,R,E,D?

Previously R at pos1: yes, now at 3: so we\'d get a symbol to see if R at pos3 is correct or not? Not inefficient? It gains information.\n\nThe feedback would tell us: if R at position 3 is correct or not? Similarly for I at 2.\n\nBoth ""INERT"" and ""TIRED"" are options.\n\nI think ""INERT"" uses letters N and T, which are more common than D? But both valid.\n\nStick with ""INERT"".\n\nConfirm: secret word must contain R, I, E somewhere? Yes.\n\nNext guess: INERT\n\nIf ""INERT"" is: \n- I at position 1: if correct, would get ✓.

Wait, feedback symbols: \n✓ if correct position and present.\n- if present but wrong position.\nx if absent.\n\nSince we know I is present (from first guess), so for any new position, we\'d get ✓ if correct, or \'-\' if wrong position?

So I cannot be in positions 1 or 3.\n  - E: not in position 5 (from RAISE) and not in position 3 (from INERT). So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters and contains R, I, E. The remaining two letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, S, N, T and the known present letters (R,I,E). Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, I, N, E, R, T (from the two guesses). The absent letters are A, S, N, T.\n\nSo the available letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R, I, E (each exactly once, since we have no indication of duplicates and we haven\'t seen any).\n- Contains two more letters from the available set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n- Satisfies the position constraints:\n  - R: not in 1 or 4 -> possible positions: 2, 3, 5.\n  - I: not in 1 or 3 -> possible positions: 2, 4, 5.\n  - E: not in 3 or 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s try to assign positions:\n\nConsider possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4.\n\nSimilarly for R: 2, 3, 5.\n\nAnd for I: 2, 4, 5.\n\nNote that position 2 is a possible position for all three, but we can only have one letter per position.\n\nWe need to choose positions that don\'t conflict.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nOption 1: Place E at position 1.\nThen:\n- E at 1: allowed.\n- Then R can be at 2, 3, or 5.\n- I can be at 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 might be taken by R).\n\nIf E at 1, then position 2 is free for R or I? But we have two more letters to place.\n\nThe word structure: E _ _ _ _\n\nNow, we need to place R, I, and two other letters.\n\nBut R and I must be in the word, so two of the remaining four positions must be R and I.\n\nPositions: 2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints:\n- R: not 1 (already taken by E) and not 4 -> so R can be at 2,3,5.\n- I: not 1 (taken) and not 3 -> so I can be at 2,4,5.\n\nBut if we put R at 2, then I cannot be at 2 -> so I at 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if R at 3, then I at 2,4,5 (but 3 taken by R, so I at 2,4,5).\n\nIf R at 5, then I at 2 or 4.\n\nAlso, E is at 1, which is allowed.\n\nNow, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.\n\nExample: E at 1, R at 2, then I at 4 (since 2 taken) -> then positions 3 and 5 need letters: E _ R I _ -> but we have E at 1, R at 2, I at 4, so position 3 and 5 are open. But we have only two more letters? The word must have R, I, E and two others. So positions: 3 and 5 are for the new letters.\n\nBut R is at 2? Then the word so far: E, R, ?, I, ?\n\nBut we have constraint that R cannot be at 4? We are putting R at 2, which is allowed.\n\nBut we also have I at 4: allowed? Yes, because I can be at 4.\n\nNow, what words start with ""ER"" and have I at position 4? And contain E, R, I and two other letters not A,S,N,T.\n\nFor example: ""ERBIA"" but A is not allowed. ""ERICA"" has A. ""ERMIN"" has N? N is not allowed.\n\n""ERBIA"" is not a word? Let\'s think.\n\nAnother: ""ERGOT"" but T is not allowed? T is absent.\n\nWe need letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nTry ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> but T is absent? T is not allowed.\n\n""ERODE"": E, R, O, D, E -> but E repeated? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven\'t seen any duplicate so far? The feedback didn\'t show duplicates. But we should avoid repeating letters to maximize information? However, E is already known, but we might have two E\'s? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and in the second at position 3, both marked as present but wrong position. It could be the same E? Or two E\'s? We don\'t know. But to be safe, assume no duplicates for now.\n\nBut ""ERODE"" has two E\'s? So not distinct.\n\n""ERUCT"": E, R, U, C, T -> T absent? Not allowed.\n\n""ERIKA"" has A and K? A not allowed.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe E at 1 is not the best.\n\nOption 2: Place E at position 2.\nThen:\n- E at 2: allowed (since E not forbidden at 2).\n- Then positions: _ E _ _ _\n- R: can be at 3 or 5 (since not 1,4; and 2 taken by E) -> so 3 or 5.\n- I: can be at 4 or 5 (since not 1,3; and 2 taken) -> so 4 or 5.\n\nIf R at 3, then I can be at 4 or 5.\nIf R at 5, then I can be at 4.\n\nAlso, position 1 and the remaining position need letters.\n\nExample: R at 3, I at 4: then word: _ E R I _\nPosition 1 and 5 need letters.\n\nWe have to fill with two new letters.\n\nWhat words: ? E R I ?\n\nWith the last letter at position 5.\n\nAnd the word must contain E, R, I and two others.\n\nKnown: E at 2, R at 3, I at 4.\n\nSo the word is: X E R I Y\n\nWhere X and Y are from the available letters (not A,S,N,T).\n\nPossible words: \n- ""DERIV"" - D, E, R, I, V -> valid? ""DERIV"" is not a common word? Derivative? But 5 letters? ""DERIV"" might be a root, but let\'s see: ""DERIVE"" is 6 letters. So not.\n\n""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> but T is absent? Not allowed.\n\n""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> L is allowed? Yes. And no A,S,N,T. So ""PERIL"" is a valid word.\n\nCheck positions:\n- E at 2: allowed? Yes.\n- R at 3: allowed? R can be at 3? Yes, because R was not forbidden at 3? Previously R was at 1 and 4, so 3 is new.\n- I at 4: allowed? I was at 3 and 1 before, so 4 is new? Yes.\n\nAlso, P at 1 and L at 5: both new.\n\nSo ""PERIL"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""HEROIC"" is 6 letters. ""HERO"" is 4.\n\n""BERIM"" not a word.\n\n""FERIA"" has A? Not allowed.\n\n""VERIFY"" too long.\n\nSo ""PERIL"" seems good.\n\nAnother possibility: R at 5 and I at 4: then word: _ E _ I R\n\nSo positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: I, 5: R.\n\nWord: X E Y I R\n\nWhat words? ""DEVIL"" but L at 3? D E V I R? ""DEVIR"" not a word.\n\n""LEVIR"" not common.\n\n""PECAN"" has N? Not allowed.\n\n""LEGIT"" has T? Not allowed.\n\nSo ""PERIL"" is better.\n\nOption 3: Place E at position 4.\nThen:\n- E at 4: allowed (since E not forbidden at 4).\n- Then positions: _ _ _ E _\n- R: can be at 2,3,5 (not 1,4; 4 taken by E) -> so 2,3,5.\n- I: can be at 2,5 (since not 1,3; and 4 taken) -> so 2 or 5.\n\nIf R at 2, then I at 5 (since 2 taken).\nIf R at 3, then I at 2 or 5.\nIf R at 5, then I at 2.\n\nExample: R at 2, I at 5: then word: _ R _ E I\n\nSo: X R Y E I\n\nWhat words: ""URAEI"" not common. ""CRAWL"" but L at 3? C R A W I? A not allowed.\n\n""GRUEL"" has U and E? G R U E I? ""GRUEI"" not a word.\n\n""FREUD"" has D? F R E U D? But E is at position 3? We have E at 4? In this structure: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: I.\n\nSo ""FR E E I"" but two E\'s? Not.\n\n""BREAD"" has A and D? A not allowed.\n\nNot many options.\n\nR at 3, I at 2: then word: _ I R E _\n\nSo: X I R E Y\n\nWords: ""DIRECT"" too long. ""DIRGE"": D I R G E -> but E is at position 5? We have E at 4? So ""DIRGE"" is D at 1, I at 2, R at 3, G at 4, E at 5? But we need E at 4? In this case, we have position 4 as E? But in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G? Not E.\n\nWe need E at position 4.\n\nSo for ""X I R E Y"": position 1: X, 2: I, 3: R, 4: E, 5: Y.\n\nWhat words: ""FIRE"" is 4 letters. ""FIRED"" is F I R E D -> that\'s 5 letters: F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\n""FIRED"" is a word? Yes, meaning dismissed from a job.\n\nCheck constraints:\n- I at 2: allowed? I was not at 2 before? Previously I at 3 and 1, so 2 is new -> allowed.\n- R at 3: allowed? R was at 1 and 4 before, so 3 is new -> allowed.\n- E at 4: allowed? E was at 5 and 3 before, so 4 is new -> allowed.\n- F and D: not in the absent list? F and D are allowed.\n\nAbsent letters: A, S, N, T. So F and D are okay.\n\nSo ""FIRED"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we have two candidates: ""PERIL"" and ""FIRED"".\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\n""PERIL"": uses P and L, which are less common? But valid.\n\n""FIRED"": uses F and D.\n\nLetter frequency: F is about 2.2%, D is 4.3%, P is 1.9%, L is 4.0%. So D and L are more common than F and P.\n\nBut both are acceptable.\n\nWe might also consider that in ""PERIL"", we have E at position 2, which we haven\'t tested? Previously E was at 5 and 3.\n\nIn ""FIRED"", E is at 4, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PERIL"", R is at 3, which is new for R? Previously R at 1 and 4.\n\nIn ""FIRED"", R is at 3, same as in ""PERIL"".\n\nBut ""PERIL"" has I at 4, which is new? Previously I at 3 and 1.\n\n""FIRED"" has I at 2, which is also new.\n\nSo both test new positions.\n\nBut ""PERIL"" might be better because it uses more common letters? L is more common than F? L: 4.0%, F: 2.2%. But D is 4.3% and P is 1.9%. So ""FIRED"" has D (4.3%) and F (2.2%), ""PERIL"" has P (1.9%) and L (4.0%). Average: ""FIRED"" (3.25%) vs ""PERIL"" (2.95%)? But not a big difference.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nAnother word: ""RIPED"" but not common? ""RIPED"" is not standard; ""RIPEN"" has N.\n\n""WIRED"": W I R E D -> same as ""FIRED"" but with W? W is less common.\n\n""FIRED"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with more common letters.\n\n""OILER"": O I L E R -> \nPositions: O at 1, I at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\nCheck constraints:\n- I at 2: allowed.\n- E at 4: allowed.\n- R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5? Yes, because not forbidden (only not 1 and 4).\n- O and L: allowed? Yes.\n\n""OILER"" is a word (one who oils or a tanker ship).\n\nAnd O and L are common: O ~7.2%, L ~4.0%.\n\nSo ""OILER"" is also a candidate.\n\nNow, among ""PERIL"", ""FIRED"", ""OILER"", which is best?\n\n""OILER"" uses O and L, which are more common than the letters in the others? O is 7.2%, L 4.0% -> average 5.6%. ""FIRED"": F 2.2%, D 4.3% -> 3.25%. ""PERIL"": P 1.9%, L 4.0% -> 2.95%. So ""OILER"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nAlso, positions: \n- I at 2: new\n- E at 4: new\n- R at 5: new\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I choose ""OILER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word must not have A,S,N,T, and ""OILER"" has O,I,L,E,R -> no A,S,N,T. Good.\n\nTherefore, next guess: OILER.<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-) → R, I, E are present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5), while A and S are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (INERT)**: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x) → I, E, R are still present (but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 for E; not in 1 or 4 for R; not in 1 for I), while N and T are absent.\n\nKey insights:\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, I, E (all must appear exactly once, as no duplicates indicated).\n- **Absent letters**: A, S, N, T (cannot appear).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R: Cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE) or 4 (from INERT) → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.\n  - I: Cannot be in position 1 (from INERT) or 3 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.\n  - E: Cannot be in position 3 (from INERT) or 5 (from RAISE) → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.\n- **Available letters for remaining positions**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, S, N, T are ruled out).\n\nFor the next guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes R, I, E and two new letters from the available set.\n- Respects the position constraints for R, I, E.\n- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- **OILER** (O, I, L, E, R) is a strong choice:\n  - Positions: I(2), E(4), R(5) → satisfies all constraints (I not in 1/3, E not in 3/5, R not in 1/4).\n  - New letters: O and L (both common; O is ~7.2% frequency, L is ~4.0%).\n  - Tests new positions: I at 2 (previously tested at 1 and 3), E at 4 (previously at 3 and 5), R at 5 (previously at 1 and 4).\n  - Valid English word (meaning: one who oils or a type of ship).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the feedback.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>OILER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo step-by-step thinking:\n- No prior feedback, so choose a word that maximizes information gain.\n- Opt for a word with diverse, common letters and no repeats to cover more ground.\n- ""CRANE"" is a good option: letters C, R, A, N, E.\n- Alternatives: ""SLATE"" (S,L,A,T,E), ""CRATE"" (C,R,A,T,E), but I\'ve seen ""CRANE"" used often.\n- ""DEUCE"" might have less common letters, so probably not.\n- Aim for high-frequency letters: E is the most common letter, then A, R, etc.\n- According to letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are top.\n- ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E — five of the top letters.\n- Similarly, ""SOARE"" but that might not be great.\n- I think ""RAISE"" could be better than ""CRANE"" because it has more high-frequency letters.\n\nLetter frequency in English:\n1.

We have feedback from the last guess (OILER): O(x) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Interpretation:
- O: absent (x) → not in the word
- I: correct position (✓) at position 2
- L: absent (x) → not in the word
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4
- R: correct position (✓) at position 5

So the secret word:
- Has I in position 2, E in position 4, and R in position 5.
- Does not contain O or L.
- The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

From previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (RAISE): R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-) → A and S absent.
- Guess 2 (INERT): I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x) → N and T absent.
- Guess 4 (OILER): O(x), L(x) → O and L absent.

Absent letters: A, S, N, T, O, L.

Known positions:
- Position 1: unknown letter (not A, S, N, T, O, L)
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown letter (not A, S, N, T, O, L)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)

The word structure: _ I _ E R

We need to find valid 5-letter words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E R, where:
- letter1 and letter3 are from the remaining alphabet (not A, S, N, T, O, L).
- The word must include only these letters, and letter1/letter3 cannot be I, E, R (since they are already placed and distinct).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters from this set: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- Consider ""WIVER"" but V is at position 3? W I V E R → ""WIVER"" is not a common word (might be invalid).
- ""DIVER"": D I V E R → V is available? Yes. ""DIVER"" is valid (meaning one who dives).
- ""FIVER"": F I V E R → valid (slang for five pounds/dollars).
- ""HIVER"": H I V E R → valid (one who hives or a beekeeper).
- ""JIVER"": J I V E R → valid (one who jives or dances).
- ""MIVER"": Not common.
- ""PIVER"": Not common.
- ""WIDER"": W I D E R → D is available. ""WIDER"" is valid (comparative of wide).
- ""CIDER"": C I D E R → but D is at position 3? C I D E R → positions: C(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). Valid word (apple drink).
- ""BIDER"": B I D E R → valid (one who bids or waits).
- ""GIVER"": G I V E R → valid (one who gives).

But note: We must ensure the word hasn't been ruled out. For example, ""CIDER"" uses C and D, both available.

However, we have limited guesses left (only 2 tries remaining), so we should choose a word that tests common letters to confirm the solution.

Since positions 2,4,5 are fixed (I, E, R), we only need to guess positions 1 and 3.

The secret word is ? I ? E R, with ? being letters not in {A, S, N, T, O, L, I, E, R}.

Common options:
- ""CIDER"": C(1), D(3) → tests C and D.
- ""WIDER"": W(1), D(3) → tests W and D.
- ""DIVER"": D(1), V(3) → tests D and V.
- ""FIVER"": F(1), V(3) → tests F and V.

To maximize information, we could choose a word with common letters to cover more possibilities. However, since we have only one unknown letter if we guess correctly, but we need to solve the word.

Given the constraints, ""CIDER"" is a strong candidate because:
- C and D are relatively common (C ~2.8%, D ~4.3%).
- It is a common word, reducing the risk of invalidity.

If ""CIDER"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal if C or D are present/absent, narrowing down the options for the final guess.

Alternative: ""WIDER"" uses W (less common) and D.

But ""CIDER"" is more frequent.

Another option: ""BIDER"" (B and D) or ""GIVER"" (G and V).

But ""CIDER"" seems optimal.

Therefore, I choose ""CIDER"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-) → R, I, E present (wrong positions); A, S absent.
- **Guess 2 (INERT)**: I(-), N(x), E(-), R(-), T(x) → I, E, R present (wrong positions); N, T absent.
- **Guess 3 (OILER)**: O(x), I(✓), L(x), E(✓), R(✓) → I, E, R in correct positions (2, 4, 5); O, L absent.

Key insights:
- **Correct positions**: I at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5. So the word pattern is `_ I _ E R`.
- **Absent letters**: A, S, N, T, O, L (cannot appear).
- **Unknown positions**: Position 1 and 3 need letters from the remaining alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- I must choose a valid 5-letter word fitting `? I ? E R`.
- Prioritize common letters to cover likely solutions (e.g., C, D, F, V).
- **CIDER** (C, I, D, E, R) is ideal:
  - Tests C (position 1) and D (position 3), both common and untested.
  - Valid word (meaning apple-based drink).
  - If incorrect, feedback on C/D will allow solving in the final guess (e.g., if C is absent, try ""DIVER"" or ""WIDER"").

Other options like ""WIDER"" or ""FIVER"" are less optimal (W/F less common than C).
