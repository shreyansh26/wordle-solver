We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to start with a word that has a good distribution of common letters and repeated letters are minimized to maximize information.

I recall that in Wordle, a common starting word is ""CRATE"" because it includes common letters (C, R, A, T, E) and they are all distinct. This can help us quickly identify several letters.

Alternatively, words like ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are also popular. However, I think ""CRANE"" is also a good candidate because it has common letters and avoids repeated letters.

But let me think: the goal of the first guess is to get as much information as possible.

After some thought, I see that the letter E is the most common in English, so including it might be helpful. Also, we have A, R, S, T, N, O, I, etc.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"". Why?
- S and T are common consonants
- L is also common
- A and E are vowels

Another good one is ""CRATE"". Let me compare:

""CRATE"": C, R, A, T, E -> includes common letters and two vowels (A, E). It covers a good set.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> more vowels, which are frequent, but U is less common. D might be less common than T or R.

I think ""CRATE"" is a solid first guess.

So for my first guess, I'll go with: CRATE

Therefore, my first guess is ""CRATE"".
</think>
I'm making my first guess with a strategic starting word. For Wordle-style games, it's beneficial to choose a word that includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information from the first feedback. The word ""CRATE"" is an excellent choice because:

- It contains 5 distinct letters, avoiding repeats to cover more possibilities.
- The letters are among the most common in English words (E, A, R, T, C).
- It includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, T), providing balanced coverage.
- This helps identify presence or absence of frequent letters quickly, setting up better subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
T: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crate"". Specifically:
  - R is not the second letter.
  - E is not the fifth letter.
- The letters C, A, T are not in the word at all.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
1. Include R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crate"".
2. Avoid using C, A, T because they are not in the word.
3. Try to use other common letters to get more information.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

Let's think about the positions:
In ""crate"", the positions are:
1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R (because R is present but in the wrong position, so it can't be in the first position either? Actually, no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, the feedback for position 1 is C(x), meaning the letter at position 1 is not C. But it could be R? However, the feedback for R is at position 2 and says it's present but not there. That doesn't prevent R from being at position 1. But note: if R were at position 1, then in the word ""crate"", the first letter would be R? But it's C. So the feedback for position 1 is that the letter is not C, and we don't have any information about R at position 1 from the first guess because R was at position 2.

Actually, the feedback tells us:
- Position 1: not C (and also, since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at position 1? But we don't know about position 1 for R. The feedback for R is only that it is in the word and not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it could be at positions 1,2,3,4.

But we also know that the word does not contain A, C, T.

So, for the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Has R in a position other than 2 (so positions 1,3,4,5) and E in a position other than 5 (so positions 1,2,3,4).
- Does not contain C, A, T.
- Uses other common letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, I, O, U, N, D, H, etc.

We also want to try to place R and E in positions that are possible.

Let me list possible positions for R and E.

But note: we don't know the exact positions yet, so we can try a word that puts R and E in new positions and also tests other letters.

Idea: put R in position 1 and E in position 2? But we don't know if that's correct, but it would test.

But we have to avoid the known absent letters.

Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.

Some words: 
- ""robes"" -> but has S? and O, B. But let's see: R at position 1 (which is a new position for R) and E at position 4? Actually, ""robes"" is R O B E S -> positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, in ""crate"", E was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""robes"", E is at position 4, which is allowed. Also, R is at position 1, which is not position 2 (so that's allowed).

But we also need to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn't have A, C, T. So that's good.

Another word: ""reign"" -> R E I G N. But then E is at position 2? That's a new position for E (previously we only know it's not at 5). And R at position 1. Also, avoids A, C, T.

But we might want to test more letters. We have only tested C,R,A,T,E so far. So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we know the word has R and E, and doesn't have C,A,T. So we have 21 letters that are possible? (26-5, but we have 5 letters: C,R,A,T,E, but R and E are in, so we know 3 are out: C,A,T).

So we have 23 letters left? Actually, 26 letters minus the 5 we tried: C,R,A,T,E. Among these, R and E are in, and C,A,T are out. So we have 21 letters that we haven't tried and that might be in the word.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""robes"", we would test O, B, S (and R and E again, but we already know they are in, so we are testing their positions and also the new letters).

Similarly, in ""reign"", we test I, G, N.

Which is better? Both are valid.

Another common word: ""risen"" -> R I S E N. This has R at 1 (new position), E at 4 (new position, since previously it was at 5). And tests I, S, N.

But note: we don't know if the word has S or not. So ""risen"" might be good.

But we have to avoid A, C, T. ""risen"" doesn't have them.

Similarly, ""robed"" is another one, but ""robed"" has D.

I think ""risen"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and tests three new letters (I, S, N) and places R and E in new positions.

But let me check: in ""risen"", R is at position 1 (which was not tested for R before, because in ""crate"" R was at position 2) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed). Also, the word has I at 2, S at 3, N at 5.

We also know that E cannot be at position 5, but in this word it's at 4, so that's fine.

Another candidate: ""renew"" -> but has W and N, and E is at position 2 and 4? But we don't want to repeat E? Actually, we don't know if the word has two E's? But the feedback for ""crate"" had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could have two E's? But we don't know. So it's safer to assume one E for now? But we can use a word with two E's? However, we are trying to get information, so using a word with repeated letters might not be efficient. So ""renew"" has two E's, which might not be ideal.

Similarly, ""roper"" has two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's. So again, might be less efficient.

So I think ""risen"" is a good choice.

But let me think of other words: ""liner"" -> but has L, I, N, E, R. But R is at the end? That's position 5. And E at position 4. Also, avoids A,C,T. But then we are testing L, I, N. And R at 5 is a new position.

But we don't know if R can be at 5. It could be.

But ""risen"" seems more balanced.

Another one: ""rouse"" -> R O U S E. This has R at 1, E at 5? But wait, we know E cannot be at position 5 because the feedback from ""crate"" said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at position 2.

So in ""rouse"", if we put E at position 5, that would be a position we know is wrong, so we don't get new information about E's position. Therefore, we should avoid that.

So ""rouse"" is not good because E is at 5.

Similarly, any word with E at 5 is not good.

So we must have E in positions 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).

So back to ""risen"": 
- R at 1 (position 1 is allowed for R)
- E at 4 (allowed for E)
- Positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:N

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Also good.

But in ""reign"", we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's possible. Similarly, in ""risen"", E is at 4.

We don't have a preference, but we want to test more common letters.

The letters in ""risen"": R (known), I, S, E (known), N. So testing I, S, N.

The letters in ""reign"": R, E, I, G, N. Testing I, G, N.

S is more common than G? In English, S is more frequent than G. So testing S might be better.

Therefore, I choose ""risen"".

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication, so we avoid repeated letters for now.

So my next guess: ""risen""

But let me confirm: we are avoiding C, A, T, and we are including R and E, and we are using new letters I, S, N.

Also, positions: R is at 1 (not 2), E is at 4 (not 5). Good.

So I'll go with ""risen"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, and T are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The letters C, A, and T must be avoided.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not previously tried.
- ""risen"" is a strong choice because:
  - It places R at position 1 (a new position for R) and E at position 4 (a new position for E).
  - It avoids C, A, and T.
  - It introduces three new common letters: I, S, and N, which could help identify more letters in the word.

Another candidate: ""renew"" -> but has W and N, and E is at position 2 and 4? But we don't want to repeat E? Actually, we don't know if the word has two E's? But the feedback for ""crate"" had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could have two E's? But we don't know. So it's safer to assume one E for now? But we can use a word with two E's? However, we are trying to get information, so using a word with repeated letters might not be efficient. So ""renew"" has two E's, which might not be ideal.

Similarly, ""roper"" has two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's. So again, might be less efficient.

So I think ""risen"" is a good choice.

But let me think of other words: ""liner"" -> but has L, I, N, E, R. But R is at the end? That's position 5. And E at position 4. Also, avoids A,C,T. But then we are testing L, I, N. And R at 5 is a new position.

But we don't know if R can be at 5. It could be.

But ""risen"" seems more balanced.

Another one: ""rouse"" -> R O U S E. This has R at 1, E at 5? But wait, we know E cannot be at position 5 because the feedback from ""crate"" said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at position 2.

So in ""rouse"", if we put E at position 5, that would be a position we know is wrong, so we don't get new information about E's position. Therefore, we should avoid that.

So ""rouse"" is not good because E is at 5.

Similarly, any word with E at 5 is not good.

So we must have E in positions 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).

So back to ""risen"": 
- R at 1 (position 1 is allowed for R)
- E at 4 (allowed for E)
- Positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:N

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Also good.

But in ""reign"", we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's possible. Similarly, in ""risen"", E is at 4.

We don't have a preference, but we want to test more common letters.

The letters in ""risen"": R (known), I, S, E (known), N. So testing I, S, N.

The letters in ""reign"": R, E, I, G, N. Testing I, G, N.

S is more common than G? In English, S is more frequent than G. So testing S might be better.

Therefore, I choose ""risen"".

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication, so we avoid repeated letters for now.

So my next guess: ""risen""

But let me confirm: we are avoiding C, A, T, and we are including R and E, and we are using new letters I, S, N.

Also, positions: R is at 1 (not 2), E is at 4 (not 5). Good.

So I'll go with ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, and T are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The letters C, A, and T must be avoided.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not previously tried.
- ""risen"" is a strong choice because:
  - It places R at position 1 (a new position for R) and E at position 4 (a new position for E).
  - It avoids C, A, and T.
  - It introduces three new common letters: I, S, and N, which could help identify more letters in the word.",Guess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
