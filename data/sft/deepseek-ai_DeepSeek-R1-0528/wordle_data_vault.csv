We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can give us a lot of information. 
 Common strategies suggest using words with a mix of common consonants and vowels, avoiding repeating letters.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", which has C, R, A, N, E. 
 Another one is ""SLATE"".

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers common letters.

 Let's choose: CRANE
</think>
<thinking>
Step-by-step Thought Process:

1. **Initial Strategy**: For the first guess, I aim to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. I'll avoid repeating letters.

2. **Letter Selection**: Choose letters frequently used in English 5-letter words. Common vowels: A, E. Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L.

3. **Word Choice**: ""CRANE"" is a strong starting word because:
   - It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - All letters are unique (no repeats).
   - It's accepted in most word lists and has good coverage.

4. **Alternative Considerations**: Words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" are also effective, but ""CRANE"" has been proven statistically efficient.

Conclusion: I'll start with ""CRANE"". If this were a real game, I'd adjust subsequent guesses based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) for each letter position.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since we placed it there and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the 3rd position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 3rd position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.
3. Use a word that has other common letters to maximize information.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and know A is present. We can try to use other vowels or common consonants.

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, etc.

We should also consider the position of A. Since it's not in the 3rd position, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Possible starting letters for the next guess: We might try A in the first position? Or second? Let's see.

We can also try to use a word that has multiple common letters to test.

One common approach is to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words that:
- Include A (but not in the 3rd position)
- Exclude C, R, N, E
- Use other common letters.

For example:
- If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", etc. But note: we must avoid R (in ABOUT, R is present but we know R is not in the word). Similarly, E is in ABOUT and ABOVE, but E is excluded.

We must avoid R, so ABOUT is invalid because of R. Similarly, ABOVE has E and is invalid. AFTER has E and R? AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R, both excluded. ALONG: A, L, O, N, G -> N is excluded. APART: A, P, A, R, T -> has R and repeated A? Actually, APART has two A's? But the word is 5 letters: A-P-A-R-T. So two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word, but it might be only one. However, we can use words with repeated letters? But in this case, we are avoiding R and N, so APART has R -> invalid.

So, let's try A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Another idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try a word that has A in a different position and four new common letters.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with as many of the most common consonants and vowels as possible.

Common consonants in 5-letter words: S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.

Vowels: O, I, U (we already know A is present, but we don't know about others).

We can try to include O and I, for example.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: A in the first position. But we need to avoid C, R, N, E. So what words start with A and don't have those? 
- How about ""ALOFT""? A, L, O, F, T -> no C, R, N, E. But we have L, O, F, T. And A is in position 1 (which is different from position 3). This seems valid.

Option 2: A in the second position. Words like ""SALAD""? But SALAD has two A's and also S, L, D. But it has A in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? It might. But also, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so SALAD is acceptable? But let's see: S, A, L, A, D -> no R, N, E, C. However, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient if the word has only one A. But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's and avoids R, N, E, C. But we are repeating A.

To avoid repetition, we can try a word with A only once and in a new position.

Option 3: A in the fourth position. Words like ""PLAIT""? P, L, A, I, T -> avoids R, N, E, C. But I is a vowel. This is a valid word.

Option 4: A in the fifth position. Words like ""PIZZA""? But that has Z and Z, which are uncommon. Or ""JUMBA""? Not a word. ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> two A's? And A in second and fifth? Not ideal.

So, let's consider:

- ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and we test L, O, F, T.
- ""PLAIT"": A in position 4, and we test P, L, I, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But that has A in first position and tests U, D, I, O. However, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let me check: no R, N, E, C. Yes. And it has four vowels? But that might be good for information.

But the word ""AUDIO"" is a common test word because it has four vowels. However, we know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J.

Another word: ""SAULT""? But that might not be common. Or ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> A in third position? But we are not supposed to put A in third because we know it's misplaced there? Actually, we can put A in third again? But we already know it's not in third, so if we put it in third and get a '-' again, we don't learn anything new? Actually, we might get a '✓' if it is in third? But the feedback said it was misplaced, meaning it is not in third. So it cannot be in third. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the next guess, we must place A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Back to ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, which is acceptable. It tests A (which we know is present) and U, D, I, O.

But we are testing four new letters. That seems efficient.

Another option: ""STOMP"" -> but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit A.

So, we must include A.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.

But let me check if there are better words.

Another candidate: ""PAINT""? But N is excluded (we got N as x in the first guess). So PAINT has N -> invalid.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in second position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is good.

""MAILS"" vs ""AUDIO"": 
- ""MAILS"" has M, A, I, L, S. We test M, I, L, S (and A, which we know).
- ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O.

Which set of letters is more common? S, L, M are very common, while U and D are less common. So ""MAILS"" might be better.

But we also have to consider the positions. We know A is not in position 3, so in ""MAILS"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

Similarly, in ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

Another word: ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> A in third position? But we cannot put A in third because we know it's not there. So avoid.

""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is excluded.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> avoids R, N, E, C. A in second position.

""DAILY"" tests D, A, I, L, Y.

But Y is less common.

""SOLAR"": has R and A? But R is excluded.

After considering, I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, A, I, L, S.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's, which might not be efficient.

Or ""PASTA"" has two A's and P, S, T.

But let's avoid repetition if possible.

Another word: ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in fourth position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is a valid word.

""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A, T. All common letters.

We can also consider ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A in second position, and Y at the end.

But ""SPLAT"" seems better because it has no Y.

So, between ""MAILS"", ""AUDIO"", and ""SPLAT"", which one?

We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also position A in a new place.

In the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

In ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", A is in position 2.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

All are new positions.

Now, the set of letters:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (A known)
- ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> tests S, P, L, T (A known) -> note that S and L are in both, but that's okay because we are testing them in different positions.
- ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> tests U, D, I, O

The most common letters among the remaining are S, T, L, P, M, etc. So ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"" are better than ""AUDIO"" in terms of letter frequency.

Between ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"", ""SPLAT"" has the advantage of having T, which is very common, and P, while ""MAILS"" has M and I.

But both are good.

I'll choose ""SPLAT"" because it has T and P, and A is in position 4, which we haven't tested.

So, next guess: SPLAT

But let me confirm: S, P, L, A, T. No C, R, N, E. And A is in position 4 (not 3). Valid word.

Alternatively, ""PLATS"": P, L, A, T, S -> same letters, but A in third position? We cannot put A in third. So ""PLATS"" is invalid for A position.

So ""SPLAT"" is good.

Another option: ""PASTY"" but Y is less common.

I think ""SPLAT"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the 3rd position (since it was misplaced there).
2. The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
3. Therefore, the next guess must:
   - Include ""A"" in a new position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
   - Avoid using C, R, N, or E.
   - Use common unused letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P, M, I, O, etc.).

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with ""A"" in a position not yet tested (avoiding 3rd) and include other high-frequency consonants/vowels.
- Avoid repeating letters from the first guess that were excluded (C, R, N, E).
- Prioritize words with unique, common letters to test more possibilities.

Selected word: ""SPLAT""
- Letters: S, P, L, A, T
- Why ""SPLAT""?
  - Includes ""A"" in the 4th position (a new position to test).
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests new common letters: S (very common), P, L, T (all high-frequency).
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Provides good coverage for feedback on multiple letter positions.

Alternatives considered:
- ""MAILS"" (A in 2nd position, tests M, I, L, S) – also strong, but ""SPLAT"" tests T and P, which are slightly more common than M and I.
- ""AUDIO"" (A in 1st position, tests U, D, I, O) – less ideal as U and D are less common, and we miss testing key consonants.
- ""PLAIT"" (A in 4th position, tests P, L, I, T) – similar to ""SPLAT"", but ""SPLAT"" includes S (more common than I).

This guess should help narrow down the possibilities significantly based on the feedback.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But that has A in first position and tests U, D, I, O. However, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let me check: no R, N, E, C. Yes. And it has four vowels? But that might be good for information.

But the word ""AUDIO"" is a common test word because it has four vowels. However, we know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J.

Another word: ""SAULT""? But that might not be common. Or ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> A in third position? But we are not supposed to put A in third because we know it's misplaced there? Actually, we can put A in third again? But we already know it's not in third, so if we put it in third and get a '-' again, we don't learn anything new? Actually, we might get a '✓' if it is in third? But the feedback said it was misplaced, meaning it is not in third. So it cannot be in third. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the next guess, we must place A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Back to ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, which is acceptable. It tests A (which we know is present) and U, D, I, O.

But we are testing four new letters. That seems efficient.

Another option: ""STOMP"" -> but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit A.

So, we must include A.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.

But let me check if there are better words.

Another candidate: ""PAINT""? But N is excluded (we got N as x in the first guess). So PAINT has N -> invalid.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in second position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is good.

""MAILS"" vs ""AUDIO"": 
- ""MAILS"" has M, A, I, L, S. We test M, I, L, S (and A, which we know).
- ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O.

Which set of letters is more common? S, L, M are very common, while U and D are less common. So ""MAILS"" might be better.

But we also have to consider the positions. We know A is not in position 3, so in ""MAILS"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

Similarly, in ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

Another word: ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> A in third position? But we cannot put A in third because we know it's not there. So avoid.

""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is excluded.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> avoids R, N, E, C. A in second position.

""DAILY"" tests D, A, I, L, Y.

But Y is less common.

""SOLAR"": has R and A? But R is excluded.

After considering, I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, A, I, L, S.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's, which might not be efficient.

Or ""PASTA"" has two A's and P, S, T.

But let's avoid repetition if possible.

Another word: ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in fourth position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is a valid word.

""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A, T. All common letters.

We can also consider ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A in second position, and Y at the end.

But ""SPLAT"" seems better because it has no Y.

So, between ""MAILS"", ""AUDIO"", and ""SPLAT"", which one?

We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also position A in a new place.

In the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

In ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", A is in position 2.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

All are new positions.

Now, the set of letters:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (A known)
- ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> tests S, P, L, T (A known) -> note that S and L are in both, but that's okay because we are testing them in different positions.
- ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> tests U, D, I, O

The most common letters among the remaining are S, T, L, P, M, etc. So ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"" are better than ""AUDIO"" in terms of letter frequency.

Between ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"", ""SPLAT"" has the advantage of having T, which is very common, and P, while ""MAILS"" has M and I.

But both are good.

I'll choose ""SPLAT"" because it has T and P, and A is in position 4, which we haven't tested.

So, next guess: SPLAT

But let me confirm: S, P, L, A, T. No C, R, N, E. And A is in position 4 (not 3). Valid word.

Alternatively, ""PLATS"": P, L, A, T, S -> same letters, but A in third position? We cannot put A in third. So ""PLATS"" is invalid for A position.

So ""SPLAT"" is good.

Another option: ""PASTY"" but Y is less common.

I think ""SPLAT"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the 3rd position (since it was misplaced there).
2. The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
3. Therefore, the next guess must:
   - Include ""A"" in a new position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
   - Avoid using C, R, N, or E.
   - Use common unused letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P, M, I, O, etc.).

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with ""A"" in a position not yet tested (avoiding 3rd) and include other high-frequency consonants/vowels.
- Avoid repeating letters from the first guess that were excluded (C, R, N, E).
- Prioritize words with unique, common letters to test more possibilities.

Selected word: ""SPLAT""
- Letters: S, P, L, A, T
- Why ""SPLAT""?
  - Includes ""A"" in the 4th position (a new position to test).
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests new common letters: S (very common), P, L, T (all high-frequency).
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Provides good coverage for feedback on multiple letter positions.

Alternatives considered:
- ""MAILS"" (A in 2nd position, tests M, I, L, S) – also strong, but ""SPLAT"" tests T and P, which are slightly more common than M and I.
- ""AUDIO"" (A in 1st position, tests U, D, I, O) – less ideal as U and D are less common, and we miss testing key consonants.
- ""PLAIT"" (A in 4th position, tests P, L, I, T) – similar to ""SPLAT"", but ""SPLAT"" includes S (more common than I).

This guess should help narrow down the possibilities significantly based on the feedback.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can give us a lot of information. 
 Common strategies suggest using words with a mix of common consonants and vowels, avoiding repeating letters.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", which has C, R, A, N, E. 
 Another one is ""SLATE"".

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers common letters.

 Let's choose: CRANE<thinking>
Step-by-step Thought Process:

1. **Initial Strategy**: For the first guess, I aim to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. I'll avoid repeating letters.

2. **Letter Selection**: Choose letters frequently used in English 5-letter words. Common vowels: A, E. Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L.

3. **Word Choice**: ""CRANE"" is a strong starting word because:
   - It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - All letters are unique (no repeats).
   - It's accepted in most word lists and has good coverage.

4. **Alternative Considerations**: Words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" are also effective, but ""CRANE"" has been proven statistically efficient.

Conclusion: I'll start with ""CRANE"". If this were a real game, I'd adjust subsequent guesses based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) for each letter position.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since we placed it there and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the 3rd position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 3rd position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.
3. Use a word that has other common letters to maximize information.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and know A is present. We can try to use other vowels or common consonants.

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, etc.

We should also consider the position of A. Since it's not in the 3rd position, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Possible starting letters for the next guess: We might try A in the first position? Or second? Let's see.

We can also try to use a word that has multiple common letters to test.

One common approach is to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words that:
- Include A (but not in the 3rd position)
- Exclude C, R, N, E
- Use other common letters.

For example:
- If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", etc. But note: we must avoid R (in ABOUT, R is present but we know R is not in the word). Similarly, E is in ABOUT and ABOVE, but E is excluded.

We must avoid R, so ABOUT is invalid because of R. Similarly, ABOVE has E and is invalid. AFTER has E and R? AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R, both excluded. ALONG: A, L, O, N, G -> N is excluded. APART: A, P, A, R, T -> has R and repeated A? Actually, APART has two A's? But the word is 5 letters: A-P-A-R-T. So two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word, but it might be only one. However, we can use words with repeated letters? But in this case, we are avoiding R and N, so APART has R -> invalid.

So, let's try A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Another idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try a word that has A in a different position and four new common letters.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with as many of the most common consonants and vowels as possible.

Common consonants in 5-letter words: S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.

Vowels: O, I, U (we already know A is present, but we don't know about others).

We can try to include O and I, for example.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: A in the first position. But we need to avoid C, R, N, E. So what words start with A and don't have those? 
- How about ""ALOFT""? A, L, O, F, T -> no C, R, N, E. But we have L, O, F, T. And A is in position 1 (which is different from position 3). This seems valid.

Option 2: A in the second position. Words like ""SALAD""? But SALAD has two A's and also S, L, D. But it has A in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? It might. But also, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so SALAD is acceptable? But let's see: S, A, L, A, D -> no R, N, E, C. However, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient if the word has only one A. But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's and avoids R, N, E, C. But we are repeating A.

To avoid repetition, we can try a word with A only once and in a new position.

Option 3: A in the fourth position. Words like ""PLAIT""? P, L, A, I, T -> avoids R, N, E, C. But I is a vowel. This is a valid word.

Option 4: A in the fifth position. Words like ""PIZZA""? But that has Z and Z, which are uncommon. Or ""JUMBA""? Not a word. ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> two A's? And A in second and fifth? Not ideal.

So, let's consider:

- ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and we test L, O, F, T.
- ""PLAIT"": A in position 4, and we test P, L, I, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But that has A in first position and tests U, D, I, O. However, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let me check: no R, N, E, C. Yes. And it has four vowels? But that might be good for information.

But the word ""AUDIO"" is a common test word because it has four vowels. However, we know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J.

Another word: ""SAULT""? But that might not be common. Or ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> A in third position? But we are not supposed to put A in third because we know it's misplaced there? Actually, we can put A in third again? But we already know it's not in third, so if we put it in third and get a '-' again, we don't learn anything new? Actually, we might get a '✓' if it is in third? But the feedback said it was misplaced, meaning it is not in third. So it cannot be in third. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the next guess, we must place A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Back to ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, which is acceptable. It tests A (which we know is present) and U, D, I, O.

But we are testing four new letters. That seems efficient.

Another option: ""STOMP"" -> but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit A.

So, we must include A.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.

But let me check if there are better words.

Another candidate: ""PAINT""? But N is excluded (we got N as x in the first guess). So PAINT has N -> invalid.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in second position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is good.

""MAILS"" vs ""AUDIO"": 
- ""MAILS"" has M, A, I, L, S. We test M, I, L, S (and A, which we know).
- ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O.

Which set of letters is more common? S, L, M are very common, while U and D are less common. So ""MAILS"" might be better.

But we also have to consider the positions. We know A is not in position 3, so in ""MAILS"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

Similarly, in ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

Another word: ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> A in third position? But we cannot put A in third because we know it's not there. So avoid.

""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is excluded.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> avoids R, N, E, C. A in second position.

""DAILY"" tests D, A, I, L, Y.

But Y is less common.

""SOLAR"": has R and A? But R is excluded.

After considering, I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, A, I, L, S.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's, which might not be efficient.

Or ""PASTA"" has two A's and P, S, T.

But let's avoid repetition if possible.

Another word: ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in fourth position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is a valid word.

""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A, T. All common letters.

We can also consider ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A in second position, and Y at the end.

But ""SPLAT"" seems better because it has no Y.

So, between ""MAILS"", ""AUDIO"", and ""SPLAT"", which one?

We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also position A in a new place.

In the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

In ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", A is in position 2.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

All are new positions.

Now, the set of letters:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (A known)
- ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> tests S, P, L, T (A known) -> note that S and L are in both, but that's okay because we are testing them in different positions.
- ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> tests U, D, I, O

The most common letters among the remaining are S, T, L, P, M, etc. So ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"" are better than ""AUDIO"" in terms of letter frequency.

Between ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"", ""SPLAT"" has the advantage of having T, which is very common, and P, while ""MAILS"" has M and I.

But both are good.

I'll choose ""SPLAT"" because it has T and P, and A is in position 4, which we haven't tested.

So, next guess: SPLAT

But let me confirm: S, P, L, A, T. No C, R, N, E. And A is in position 4 (not 3). Valid word.

Alternatively, ""PLATS"": P, L, A, T, S -> same letters, but A in third position? We cannot put A in third. So ""PLATS"" is invalid for A position.

So ""SPLAT"" is good.

Another option: ""PASTY"" but Y is less common.

I think ""SPLAT"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the 3rd position (since it was misplaced there).
2. The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
3. Therefore, the next guess must:
   - Include ""A"" in a new position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
   - Avoid using C, R, N, or E.
   - Use common unused letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P, M, I, O, etc.).

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with ""A"" in a position not yet tested (avoiding 3rd) and include other high-frequency consonants/vowels.
- Avoid repeating letters from the first guess that were excluded (C, R, N, E).
- Prioritize words with unique, common letters to test more possibilities.

Selected word: ""SPLAT""
- Letters: S, P, L, A, T
- Why ""SPLAT""?
  - Includes ""A"" in the 4th position (a new position to test).
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests new common letters: S (very common), P, L, T (all high-frequency).
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Provides good coverage for feedback on multiple letter positions.

Alternatives considered:
- ""MAILS"" (A in 2nd position, tests M, I, L, S) – also strong, but ""SPLAT"" tests T and P, which are slightly more common than M and I.
- ""AUDIO"" (A in 1st position, tests U, D, I, O) – less ideal as U and D are less common, and we miss testing key consonants.
- ""PLAIT"" (A in 4th position, tests P, L, I, T) – similar to ""SPLAT"", but ""SPLAT"" includes S (more common than I).

This guess should help narrow down the possibilities significantly based on the feedback.

However, we can use words with repeated letters? But in this case, we are avoiding R and N, so APART has R -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s try A in the second position? Or fourth? \n\nAnother idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try a word that has A in a different position and four new common letters.\n\nLet me think of words without C, R, N, E.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with as many of the most common consonants and vowels as possible.\n\nCommon consonants in 5-letter words: S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.\n\nVowels: O, I, U (we already know A is present, but we don\'t know about others).\n\nWe can try to include O and I, for example.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption 1: A in the first position. But we need to avoid C, R, N, E. So what words start with A and don\'t have those? \n- How about ""ALOFT""? A, L, O, F, T -> no C, R, N, E. But we have L, O, F, T. And A is in position 1 (which is different from position 3). This seems valid.\n\nOption 2: A in the second position. Words like ""SALAD""? But SALAD has two A\'s and also S, L, D. But it has A in position 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? It might. But also, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so SALAD is acceptable? But let\'s see: S, A, L, A, D -> no R, N, E, C. However, we are using two A\'s, which might not be efficient if the word has only one A. But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> again two A\'s and avoids R, N, E, C. But we are repeating A.\n\nTo avoid repetition, we can try a word with A only once and in a new position.\n\nOption 3: A in the fourth position. Words like ""PLAIT""? P, L, A, I, T -> avoids R, N, E, C. But I is a vowel. This is a valid word.\n\nOption 4: A in the fifth position. Words like ""PIZZA""? But that has Z and Z, which are uncommon. Or ""JUMBA""? Not a word. ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> two A\'s? And A in second and fifth? Not ideal.\n\nSo, let\'s consider:\n\n- ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and we test L, O, F, T.\n- ""PLAIT"": A in position 4, and we test P, L, I, T.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But that has A in first position and tests U, D, I, O. However, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let me check: no R, N, E, C. Yes. And it has four vowels? But that might be good for information.\n\nBut the word ""AUDIO"" is a common test word because it has four vowels. However, we know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.\n\nAlternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J.\n\nAnother word: ""SAULT""? But that might not be common. Or ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> A in third position? But we are not supposed to put A in third because we know it\'s misplaced there? Actually, we can put A in third again? But we already know it\'s not in third, so if we put it in third and get a \'-\' again, we don\'t learn anything new? Actually, we might get a \'✓\' if it is in third? But the feedback said it was misplaced, meaning it is not in third. So it cannot be in third. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we must place A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBack to ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, which is acceptable. It tests A (which we know is present) and U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we are testing four new letters. That seems efficient.\n\nAnother option: ""STOMP"" -> but no A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit A.\n\nSo, we must include A.\n\nTherefore, ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me check if there are better words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT""? But N is excluded (we got N as x in the first guess). So PAINT has N -> invalid.\n\n""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in second position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is good.\n\n""MAILS"" vs ""AUDIO"": \n- ""MAILS"" has M, A, I, L, S. We test M, I, L, S (and A, which we know).\n- ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O.\n\nWhich set of letters is more common? S, L, M are very common, while U and D are less common. So ""MAILS"" might be better.\n\nBut we also have to consider the positions. We know A is not in position 3, so in ""MAILS"", A is in position 2. That\'s a new position.\n\nSimilarly, in ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> A in third position? But we cannot put A in third because we know it\'s not there. So avoid.\n\n""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is excluded.\n\n""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> avoids R, N, E, C. A in second position.\n\n""DAILY"" tests D, A, I, L, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""SOLAR"": has R and A? But R is excluded.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, A, I, L, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A\'s, which might not be efficient.\n\nOr ""PASTA"" has two A\'s and P, S, T.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repetition if possible.\n\nAnother word: ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in fourth position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is a valid word.\n\n""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A, T. All common letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A in second position, and Y at the end.\n\nBut ""SPLAT"" seems better because it has no Y.\n\nSo, between ""MAILS"", ""AUDIO"", and ""SPLAT"", which one?\n\nWe want to cover as many common letters as possible and also position A in a new place.\n\nIn the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we can try position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nIn ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4.\n\nIn ""MAILS"", A is in position 2.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.\n\nAll are new positions.\n\nNow, the set of letters:\n\n- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (A known)\n- ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> tests S, P, L, T (A known) -> note that S and L are in both, but that\'s okay because we are testing them in different positions.\n- ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> tests U, D, I, O\n\nThe most common letters among the remaining are S, T, L, P, M, etc. So ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"" are better than ""AUDIO"" in terms of letter frequency.\n\nBetween ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"", ""SPLAT"" has the advantage of having T, which is very common, and P, while ""MAILS"" has M and I.\n\nBut both are good.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SPLAT"" because it has T and P, and A is in position 4, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nSo, next guess: SPLAT\n\nBut let me confirm: S, P, L, A, T. No C, R, N, E. And A is in position 4 (not 3). Valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLATS"": P, L, A, T, S -> same letters, but A in third position? We cannot put A in third. So ""PLATS"" is invalid for A position.\n\nSo ""SPLAT"" is good.\n\nAnother option: ""PASTY"" but Y is less common.\n\nI think ""SPLAT"" is a good choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SPLAT"".<thinking>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the 3rd position (since it was misplaced there).\n2. The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n3. Therefore, the next guess must:\n   - Include ""A"" in a new position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).\n   - Avoid using C, R, N, or E.\n   - Use common unused letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P, M, I, O, etc.).\n\nStrategy for the second guess:\n- Choose a word with ""A"" in a position not yet tested (avoiding 3rd) and include other high-frequency consonants/vowels.\n- Avoid repeating letters from the first guess that were excluded (C, R, N, E).\n- Prioritize words with unique, common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nSelected word: ""SPLAT""\n- Letters: S, P, L, A, T\n- Why ""SPLAT""?\n  - Includes ""A"" in the 4th position (a new position to test).\n  - Avoids C, R, N, E.\n  - Tests new common letters: S (very common), P, L, T (all high-frequency).\n  - Valid 5-letter English word.\n  - Provides good coverage for feedback on multiple letter positions.\n\nAlternatives considered:\n- ""MAILS"" (A in 2nd position, tests M, I, L, S) – also strong, but ""SPLAT"" tests T and P, which are slightly more common than M and I.\n- ""AUDIO"" (A in 1st position, tests U, D, I, O) – less ideal as U and D are less common, and we miss testing key consonants.\n- ""PLAIT"" (A in 4th position, tests P, L, I, T) – similar to ""SPLAT"", but ""SPLAT"" includes S (more common than I).\n\nThis guess should help narrow down the possibilities significantly based on the feedback.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SPLAT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLAT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: SPLAT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- L: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: ✓ (in word and correct position)

Key information:
1. T is in the word and in the 5th position (since it was the last letter and got a check).
2. A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (from first guess) and not in the 4th position (from second guess).
3. L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (it was guessed there and got a dash, meaning wrong position).
4. The following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, P.
5. Since T is in the 5th position, the word ends with T.

We are looking for a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 5 is T).
- Contains A and L, but not in the positions we've tried.
- Avoids C, R, N, E, S, P.

Known positions for excluded placements:
- A cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from guess 1 and 2).
- L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).

Therefore, possible positions for A: 1 or 2 (since position 5 is T, and positions 3 and 4 are excluded for A).
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 4 (since position 5 is T and position 3 is excluded for L).

We need to form a word with T at the end, and containing A and L.

We also need three other letters (or possibly repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of repetition).

We must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Considering common English words ending with T:

Think of words fitting the constraints:
- Must have A and L somewhere in first four positions, with A not in 3 or 4, L not in 3, and T at position 5.

So, positions: 
- Let the word be _ _ _ _ T

A must be in position 1 or 2.
L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Case 1: A in position 1.
Then word: A _ _ _ T
L would be in position 2 or 4. (cannot be in 3).

If L in position 2: A L _ _ T
Missing two letters. What could fit? The third letter cannot be A or L again? We don't know if repetition is allowed, but avoid unless necessary.

Words like ""ALERT"" has E and R -> excluded.
""ALTIT"" not a word.
""ALBAT"" not a word, and has B - okay, but not common? ""ALBAT"" might not be a word. ""ABASE"" has S and E excluded.

Common words: ""ALOFT"" but O, and we haven't excluded O? But also F. However, we have L in position 3? In ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2? A-L-O-F-T -> positions: A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5).

But from feedback, L cannot be in position 3? Here L is in position 2, which is allowed. And A is in position 1, allowed. Now check letters: O and F. Are they excluded? No, we haven't guessed them. So ""ALOFT"" is a possibility.

But we need to see if it fits the constraints.

Another word: ""ADULT"" has D, U, L, but L is in position 4? A-D-U-L-T -> A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). Here L is in position 4, which is allowed. Also, A in 1.

But we don't know if D and U are in the word.

Case 2: A in position 2.
Then word: _ A _ _ T
And L could be in position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so L in 1 or 4.

If L in position 1: L A _ _ T
Now, words like ""LAITY"" has Y, I. ""LATT?"" not common. ""LAST"" is 4 letters? Need 5: ""LASTS"" has S excluded.

Other possibilities: ""DAILY"" but D, A, I, L, Y -> A in 2, L in 4? D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5). But Y at the end? But we have T at the end? Must end with T. So ""DAILY"" ends with Y, not T.

Must end with T, so ""LATT?"" or ""BALDT"" not words.

If L in position 4 and A in position 2: _ A _ L T
Now, words: Ex. ""HAILT"" not word. ""MALTS"" has S and M? ""MALTS"": M-A-L-T-S -> but S is excluded and we need T at the end? M-A-L-T-S ends with S, not T. We need the fifth letter to be T, so after L? The pattern is: _ A _ L T -> four letters before T? No: positions: 1, 2 is A, 3, 4 is L? 4 is L and 5 is T. So word like _ A _ L T.

What words? ""GAULT"" is a word? G-A-U-L-T? Or ""FAULT"" -> F-A-U-L-T. Both have U. ""VAULT"" similar.

Another: ""HALTS"" has S.

But ""FAULT"": letters F, A, U, L, T. Avoids excluded letters: C,R,N,E,S,P. And A in position 2, L in position 4.

We also have L in position 4: from feedback in guess 2, we placed L in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. Position 4 is different so it can be.

Similarly, A was not in pos 3 or 4, here in pos 2 is new.

Back to ""ALOFT"": A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5). This fits: A not in 3 or 4 (it's in 1), L not in 3 (it's in 2), T at 5. And letters: A,L,O,F,T. O and F not excluded.

Similarly, ""FAULT"": F(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). A in 2 (not 3 or 4), L in 4 (not 3), T at 5.

We have two candidates: ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"".

We need to choose one for the next guess.

We can also think if there are other letters we know? From feedback, we only know A, L, T are in the word, T in position 5.

We have tested O and U in ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"", but we don't have information on them.

We need to maximize new information.

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters?

For example, we know T is fixed at the end. We need to find the first four letters with A, L, and two other letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters are C, R, N, E, S, P. So available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but T and A,L are already in, so others).

Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

In ""ALOFT"", letters tested: A, L, O, F, T -> we already know A,L,T, so testing O and F.

In ""FAULT"", testing F, U.

We could test other letters? For example, ""HALT"" not 5 letters. ""BAULT"" not word? ""DAILY"" not ends with T.

Another candidate: ""DEALT"" -> but E is excluded? E not in word. ""DEALT"" has E -> excluded.

""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,S,P? Yes. A in position 1, D in 2, U in 3, L in 4, T in 5. Position for A: 1, which is allowed. Position for L: 4, allowed.

""ADULT"" tests D and U.

Similarly, ""OAKT"" not word.

Another possibility: ""MALTS"" but S excluded? S not in, so invalid.

Perhaps ""GALLT"" not word.

So main candidates: ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"".

We need to pick one. How about including a letter that hasn't been tested? We haven't tested B, D, H, I, M, O, U, F, etc.

Since we know T is fixed and A must be in 1 or 2, and L in 1,2,4 (but not 3), we can choose a word that uses a common consonant.

Another idea: let's put A in position 1 and L in position 2? Like ""ALIGHT"" too long. ""ALITE"" not word. ""ALIOT"" not word. ""ALBAT"" not word.

Earlier we thought of ""ALOFT"".

Similarly, A in position 2 and L in position 4: ""HAULT"" not common, ""JAULT"" not word, ""MAULT"" not word? But ""Vault"" is with V? ""VAULT"" is a word.

But ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. V is less common.

Perhaps ""DAULT"" not.

So among valid words: ""ADULT"" (A-D-U-L-T), ""ALOFT"" (A-L-O-F-T), ""FAULT"" (F-A-U-L-T).

All seem valid.

Now, which to choose? We want to test letters that are more common. 

- O is a common vowel, F is a common consonant?
- U is a vowel, less common than O?
- D is common.

But let's see frequency in English:

According to letter frequency in English words:
- O is high frequency (about 7.5%)
- U is less (about 2.8%)
- F is medium (about 2.2%)
- D is medium (about 4.3%)

So O is very common.

We should test O? So ""ALOFT"" might be good.

Also, in ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2, which we haven't tested for L. 

Similarly, we can test F.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has I? But no word ending with T with I and our positions.

For example, ""DELIST"" has E,S excluded.

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" has O,U,T but O in position 2, U in 3, T in 5? But ""ABOUT"": A-B-O-U-T -> A in 1, B in ? Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). Here A in 1, L not present? But we know L must be in the word, so ""ABOUT"" cannot be because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, any guess must include L because we know L is in the word.

So we must include L.

Similarly include A.

So among the candidates, ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"" all include A and L.

Perhaps ""ALOFT"" is the best because O is common.

Another word: ""BELTS"" has E,S excluded.

Or ""MULCT"" not common and has C excluded? C not in.

Anyway, let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But note: in ""ALOFT"", we have O and F.

Alternatively, if we use ""DOULT"" not word.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good guess.

So next guess: ALOFT

But let's confirm the positions:
- A in pos 1: new, might be correct?
- L in pos 2: new
- O in pos 3: we haven't tested before
- F in pos 4: new
- T in pos 5: already correct

This tests O and F, which could be in the word.

Even if not all correct, we get information.

Another candidate: ""THALM"" not word? Not ending with T.

I think ""ALOFT"" is fine.

<thinking>
We have received feedback from two previous guesses:

- Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - This tells us:
    - Letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

- Guess 2: SPLAT → Feedback: S(x), P(x), L(-), A(-), T(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - Letters S and P are NOT in the secret word.
    - Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was misplaced again).
    - Letter T is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5).

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: A, L, T must be in the word.
  - T is fixed at position 5.
  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
  - L cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P (all marked ""x"").
- **Word structure**: The word ends with T (position 5). Positions 1 and 2 must accommodate A if it's not in position 1 or 2, but A must be in 1 or 2.
- **Available letters**: We must avoid excluded letters. Common unused letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a word that:
  - Ends with T (to test or confirm position 5).
  - Includes both A and L in valid positions:
    - A in position 1 or 2.
    - L in position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, S, P).
  - Maximizes new letter information: Introduce common unused letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

Candidate words:
- ""ALOFT"": A (position 1), L (position 2), O, F, T (position 5). This tests O and F (new letters), places A and L in previously untested positions, and adheres to constraints. A in 1 and L in 2 are allowed.
- ""FAULT"": F (position 1), A (position 2), U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests F and U, with A in pos 2 and L in pos 4.
- ""ADULT"": A (position 1), D, U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests D and U, with A in pos 1 and L in pos 4.

Selection rationale:
- ""ALOFT"" is preferred because:
  - It tests O (a high-frequency vowel) and F (common consonant).
  - Positions for A (1) and L (2) are both new and plausible.
  - Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters.
  - If incorrect, feedback will provide strong clues about the positions of A and L, as well as existence of O/F.

Next steps:
- After this guess, feedback will help confirm positions for A and L, reveal if O/F are in the word, and further narrow possibilities.

<guess>ALOFT</guess>",ALOFT,"We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: CRANE

1. T is in the word and in the 5th position (since it was the last letter and got a check).
2. A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (from first guess) and not in the 4th position (from second guess).
3. L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (it was guessed there and got a dash, meaning wrong position).
4. The following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, P.
5. Since T is in the 5th position, the word ends with T.

We are looking for a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 5 is T).
- Contains A and L, but not in the positions we've tried.
- Avoids C, R, N, E, S, P.

Known positions for excluded placements:
- A cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from guess 1 and 2).
- L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).

Therefore, possible positions for A: 1 or 2 (since position 5 is T, and positions 3 and 4 are excluded for A).
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 4 (since position 5 is T and position 3 is excluded for L).

We need to form a word with T at the end, and containing A and L.

We also need three other letters (or possibly repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of repetition).

We must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.

If L in position 2: A L _ _ T
Missing two letters. What could fit? The third letter cannot be A or L again? We don't know if repetition is allowed, but avoid unless necessary.

Words like ""ALERT"" has E and R -> excluded.
""ALTIT"" not a word.
""ALBAT"" not a word, and has B - okay, but not common? ""ALBAT"" might not be a word. ""ABASE"" has S and E excluded.

Common words: ""ALOFT"" but O, and we haven't excluded O? But also F. However, we have L in position 3? In ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2? A-L-O-F-T -> positions: A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5).

But from feedback, L cannot be in position 3? Here L is in position 2, which is allowed. And A is in position 1, allowed. Now check letters: O and F. Are they excluded? No, we haven't guessed them. So ""ALOFT"" is a possibility.

But we need to see if it fits the constraints.

Another word: ""ADULT"" has D, U, L, but L is in position 4? A-D-U-L-T -> A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). Here L is in position 4, which is allowed. Also, A in 1.

But we don't know if D and U are in the word.

Case 2: A in position 2.
Then word: _ A _ _ T
And L could be in position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so L in 1 or 4.

If L in position 1: L A _ _ T
Now, words like ""LAITY"" has Y, I. ""LATT?"" not common. ""LAST"" is 4 letters? Need 5: ""LASTS"" has S excluded.

Other possibilities: ""DAILY"" but D, A, I, L, Y -> A in 2, L in 4? D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5). But Y at the end? But we have T at the end? Must end with T. So ""DAILY"" ends with Y, not T.

Must end with T, so ""LATT?"" or ""BALDT"" not words.

If L in position 4 and A in position 2: _ A _ L T
Now, words: Ex. ""HAILT"" not word. ""MALTS"" has S and M? ""MALTS"": M-A-L-T-S -> but S is excluded and we need T at the end? M-A-L-T-S ends with S, not T. We need the fifth letter to be T, so after L? The pattern is: _ A _ L T -> four letters before T? No: positions: 1, 2 is A, 3, 4 is L? 4 is L and 5 is T. So word like _ A _ L T.

What words? ""GAULT"" is a word? G-A-U-L-T? Or ""FAULT"" -> F-A-U-L-T. Both have U. ""VAULT"" similar.

Another: ""HALTS"" has S.

But ""FAULT"": letters F, A, U, L, T. Avoids excluded letters: C,R,N,E,S,P. And A in position 2, L in position 4.

We also have L in position 4: from feedback in guess 2, we placed L in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. Position 4 is different so it can be.

Similarly, A was not in pos 3 or 4, here in pos 2 is new.

Back to ""ALOFT"": A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5). This fits: A not in 3 or 4 (it's in 1), L not in 3 (it's in 2), T at 5. And letters: A,L,O,F,T. O and F not excluded.

Similarly, ""FAULT"": F(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). A in 2 (not 3 or 4), L in 4 (not 3), T at 5.

We have two candidates: ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"".

We need to choose one for the next guess.

We can also think if there are other letters we know? From feedback, we only know A, L, T are in the word, T in position 5.

We have tested O and U in ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"", but we don't have information on them.

We need to maximize new information.

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters?

For example, we know T is fixed at the end. We need to find the first four letters with A, L, and two other letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters are C, R, N, E, S, P. So available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but T and A,L are already in, so others).

Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

In ""ALOFT"", letters tested: A, L, O, F, T -> we already know A,L,T, so testing O and F.

In ""FAULT"", testing F, U.

We could test other letters? For example, ""HALT"" not 5 letters. ""BAULT"" not word? ""DAILY"" not ends with T.

Another candidate: ""DEALT"" -> but E is excluded? E not in word. ""DEALT"" has E -> excluded.

""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,S,P? Yes. A in position 1, D in 2, U in 3, L in 4, T in 5. Position for A: 1, which is allowed. Position for L: 4, allowed.

""ADULT"" tests D and U.

Similarly, ""OAKT"" not word.

Another possibility: ""MALTS"" but S excluded? S not in, so invalid.

Perhaps ""GALLT"" not word.

So main candidates: ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"".

We need to pick one. How about including a letter that hasn't been tested? We haven't tested B, D, H, I, M, O, U, F, etc.

Since we know T is fixed and A must be in 1 or 2, and L in 1,2,4 (but not 3), we can choose a word that uses a common consonant.

Another idea: let's put A in position 1 and L in position 2? Like ""ALIGHT"" too long. ""ALITE"" not word. ""ALIOT"" not word. ""ALBAT"" not word.

Earlier we thought of ""ALOFT"".

Similarly, A in position 2 and L in position 4: ""HAULT"" not common, ""JAULT"" not word, ""MAULT"" not word? But ""Vault"" is with V? ""VAULT"" is a word.

But ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. V is less common.

Perhaps ""DAULT"" not.

So among valid words: ""ADULT"" (A-D-U-L-T), ""ALOFT"" (A-L-O-F-T), ""FAULT"" (F-A-U-L-T).

All seem valid.

Now, which to choose? We want to test letters that are more common. 

- O is a common vowel, F is a common consonant?
- U is a vowel, less common than O?
- D is common.

But let's see frequency in English:

According to letter frequency in English words:
- O is high frequency (about 7.5%)
- U is less (about 2.8%)
- F is medium (about 2.2%)
- D is medium (about 4.3%)

So O is very common.

We should test O? So ""ALOFT"" might be good.

Also, in ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2, which we haven't tested for L. 

Similarly, we can test F.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has I? But no word ending with T with I and our positions.

For example, ""DELIST"" has E,S excluded.

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" has O,U,T but O in position 2, U in 3, T in 5? But ""ABOUT"": A-B-O-U-T -> A in 1, B in ? Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). Here A in 1, L not present? But we know L must be in the word, so ""ABOUT"" cannot be because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, any guess must include L because we know L is in the word.

So we must include L.

Similarly include A.

So among the candidates, ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"" all include A and L.

Perhaps ""ALOFT"" is the best because O is common.

Another word: ""BELTS"" has E,S excluded.

Or ""MULCT"" not common and has C excluded? C not in.

Anyway, let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But note: in ""ALOFT"", we have O and F.

Alternatively, if we use ""DOULT"" not word.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good guess.

So next guess: ALOFT

But let's confirm the positions:
- A in pos 1: new, might be correct?
- L in pos 2: new
- O in pos 3: we haven't tested before
- F in pos 4: new
- T in pos 5: already correct

This tests O and F, which could be in the word.

Even if not all correct, we get information.

Another candidate: ""THALM"" not word? Not ending with T.

I think ""ALOFT"" is fine.<thinking>
We have received feedback from two previous guesses:

- Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - This tells us:
    - Letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

- Guess 2: SPLAT → Feedback: S(x), P(x), L(-), A(-), T(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - Letters S and P are NOT in the secret word.
    - Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was misplaced again).
    - Letter T is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5).

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: A, L, T must be in the word.
  - T is fixed at position 5.
  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
  - L cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P (all marked ""x"").
- **Word structure**: The word ends with T (position 5). Positions 1 and 2 must accommodate A if it's not in position 1 or 2, but A must be in 1 or 2.
- **Available letters**: We must avoid excluded letters. Common unused letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a word that:
  - Ends with T (to test or confirm position 5).
  - Includes both A and L in valid positions:
    - A in position 1 or 2.
    - L in position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, S, P).
  - Maximizes new letter information: Introduce common unused letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

Candidate words:
- ""ALOFT"": A (position 1), L (position 2), O, F, T (position 5). This tests O and F (new letters), places A and L in previously untested positions, and adheres to constraints. A in 1 and L in 2 are allowed.
- ""FAULT"": F (position 1), A (position 2), U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests F and U, with A in pos 2 and L in pos 4.
- ""ADULT"": A (position 1), D, U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests D and U, with A in pos 1 and L in pos 4.

Selection rationale:
- ""ALOFT"" is preferred because:
  - It tests O (a high-frequency vowel) and F (common consonant).
  - Positions for A (1) and L (2) are both new and plausible.
  - Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters.
  - If incorrect, feedback will provide strong clues about the positions of A and L, as well as existence of O/F.

Next steps:
- After this guess, feedback will help confirm positions for A and L, reveal if O/F are in the word, and further narrow possibilities.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can give us a lot of information. 
 Common strategies suggest using words with a mix of common consonants and vowels, avoiding repeating letters.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", which has C, R, A, N, E. 
 Another one is ""SLATE"".

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers common letters.

 Let's choose: CRANE<thinking>
Step-by-step Thought Process:

1. **Initial Strategy**: For the first guess, I aim to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. I'll avoid repeating letters.

2. **Letter Selection**: Choose letters frequently used in English 5-letter words. Common vowels: A, E. Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L.

3. **Word Choice**: ""CRANE"" is a strong starting word because:
   - It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - All letters are unique (no repeats).
   - It's accepted in most word lists and has good coverage.

4. **Alternative Considerations**: Words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" are also effective, but ""CRANE"" has been proven statistically efficient.

Conclusion: I'll start with ""CRANE"". If this were a real game, I'd adjust subsequent guesses based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) for each letter position.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since we placed it there and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the 3rd position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 3rd position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.
3. Use a word that has other common letters to maximize information.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and know A is present. We can try to use other vowels or common consonants.

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, etc.

We should also consider the position of A. Since it's not in the 3rd position, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Possible starting letters for the next guess: We might try A in the first position? Or second? Let's see.

We can also try to use a word that has multiple common letters to test.

One common approach is to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words that:
- Include A (but not in the 3rd position)
- Exclude C, R, N, E
- Use other common letters.

For example:
- If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", etc. But note: we must avoid R (in ABOUT, R is present but we know R is not in the word). Similarly, E is in ABOUT and ABOVE, but E is excluded.

We must avoid R, so ABOUT is invalid because of R. Similarly, ABOVE has E and is invalid. AFTER has E and R? AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R, both excluded. ALONG: A, L, O, N, G -> N is excluded. APART: A, P, A, R, T -> has R and repeated A? Actually, APART has two A's? But the word is 5 letters: A-P-A-R-T. So two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word, but it might be only one. However, we can use words with repeated letters? But in this case, we are avoiding R and N, so APART has R -> invalid.

So, let's try A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Another idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try a word that has A in a different position and four new common letters.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with as many of the most common consonants and vowels as possible.

Common consonants in 5-letter words: S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.

Vowels: O, I, U (we already know A is present, but we don't know about others).

We can try to include O and I, for example.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: A in the first position. But we need to avoid C, R, N, E. So what words start with A and don't have those? 
- How about ""ALOFT""? A, L, O, F, T -> no C, R, N, E. But we have L, O, F, T. And A is in position 1 (which is different from position 3). This seems valid.

Option 2: A in the second position. Words like ""SALAD""? But SALAD has two A's and also S, L, D. But it has A in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? It might. But also, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so SALAD is acceptable? But let's see: S, A, L, A, D -> no R, N, E, C. However, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient if the word has only one A. But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's and avoids R, N, E, C. But we are repeating A.

To avoid repetition, we can try a word with A only once and in a new position.

Option 3: A in the fourth position. Words like ""PLAIT""? P, L, A, I, T -> avoids R, N, E, C. But I is a vowel. This is a valid word.

Option 4: A in the fifth position. Words like ""PIZZA""? But that has Z and Z, which are uncommon. Or ""JUMBA""? Not a word. ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> two A's? And A in second and fifth? Not ideal.

So, let's consider:

- ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and we test L, O, F, T.
- ""PLAIT"": A in position 4, and we test P, L, I, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But that has A in first position and tests U, D, I, O. However, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let me check: no R, N, E, C. Yes. And it has four vowels? But that might be good for information.

But the word ""AUDIO"" is a common test word because it has four vowels. However, we know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J.

Another word: ""SAULT""? But that might not be common. Or ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> A in third position? But we are not supposed to put A in third because we know it's misplaced there? Actually, we can put A in third again? But we already know it's not in third, so if we put it in third and get a '-' again, we don't learn anything new? Actually, we might get a '✓' if it is in third? But the feedback said it was misplaced, meaning it is not in third. So it cannot be in third. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the next guess, we must place A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Back to ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, which is acceptable. It tests A (which we know is present) and U, D, I, O.

But we are testing four new letters. That seems efficient.

Another option: ""STOMP"" -> but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit A.

So, we must include A.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.

But let me check if there are better words.

Another candidate: ""PAINT""? But N is excluded (we got N as x in the first guess). So PAINT has N -> invalid.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in second position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is good.

""MAILS"" vs ""AUDIO"": 
- ""MAILS"" has M, A, I, L, S. We test M, I, L, S (and A, which we know).
- ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O.

Which set of letters is more common? S, L, M are very common, while U and D are less common. So ""MAILS"" might be better.

But we also have to consider the positions. We know A is not in position 3, so in ""MAILS"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

Similarly, in ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

Another word: ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> A in third position? But we cannot put A in third because we know it's not there. So avoid.

""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is excluded.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> avoids R, N, E, C. A in second position.

""DAILY"" tests D, A, I, L, Y.

But Y is less common.

""SOLAR"": has R and A? But R is excluded.

After considering, I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, A, I, L, S.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's, which might not be efficient.

Or ""PASTA"" has two A's and P, S, T.

But let's avoid repetition if possible.

Another word: ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in fourth position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is a valid word.

""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A, T. All common letters.

We can also consider ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A in second position, and Y at the end.

But ""SPLAT"" seems better because it has no Y.

So, between ""MAILS"", ""AUDIO"", and ""SPLAT"", which one?

We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also position A in a new place.

In the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

In ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", A is in position 2.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.

All are new positions.

Now, the set of letters:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (A known)
- ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> tests S, P, L, T (A known) -> note that S and L are in both, but that's okay because we are testing them in different positions.
- ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> tests U, D, I, O

The most common letters among the remaining are S, T, L, P, M, etc. So ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"" are better than ""AUDIO"" in terms of letter frequency.

Between ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"", ""SPLAT"" has the advantage of having T, which is very common, and P, while ""MAILS"" has M and I.

But both are good.

I'll choose ""SPLAT"" because it has T and P, and A is in position 4, which we haven't tested.

So, next guess: SPLAT

But let me confirm: S, P, L, A, T. No C, R, N, E. And A is in position 4 (not 3). Valid word.

Alternatively, ""PLATS"": P, L, A, T, S -> same letters, but A in third position? We cannot put A in third. So ""PLATS"" is invalid for A position.

So ""SPLAT"" is good.

Another option: ""PASTY"" but Y is less common.

I think ""SPLAT"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the 3rd position (since it was misplaced there).
2. The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
3. Therefore, the next guess must:
   - Include ""A"" in a new position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
   - Avoid using C, R, N, or E.
   - Use common unused letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P, M, I, O, etc.).

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with ""A"" in a position not yet tested (avoiding 3rd) and include other high-frequency consonants/vowels.
- Avoid repeating letters from the first guess that were excluded (C, R, N, E).
- Prioritize words with unique, common letters to test more possibilities.

Selected word: ""SPLAT""
- Letters: S, P, L, A, T
- Why ""SPLAT""?
  - Includes ""A"" in the 4th position (a new position to test).
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests new common letters: S (very common), P, L, T (all high-frequency).
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Provides good coverage for feedback on multiple letter positions.

Alternatives considered:
- ""MAILS"" (A in 2nd position, tests M, I, L, S) – also strong, but ""SPLAT"" tests T and P, which are slightly more common than M and I.
- ""AUDIO"" (A in 1st position, tests U, D, I, O) – less ideal as U and D are less common, and we miss testing key consonants.
- ""PLAIT"" (A in 4th position, tests P, L, I, T) – similar to ""SPLAT"", but ""SPLAT"" includes S (more common than I).

This guess should help narrow down the possibilities significantly based on the feedback.

<guess>SPLAT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLAT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: SPLAT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- L: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: ✓ (in word and correct position)

Key information:
1. T is in the word and in the 5th position (since it was the last letter and got a check).
2. A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (from first guess) and not in the 4th position (from second guess).
3. L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (it was guessed there and got a dash, meaning wrong position).
4. The following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, P.
5. Since T is in the 5th position, the word ends with T.

We are looking for a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 5 is T).
- Contains A and L, but not in the positions we've tried.
- Avoids C, R, N, E, S, P.

Known positions for excluded placements:
- A cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from guess 1 and 2).
- L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).

Therefore, possible positions for A: 1 or 2 (since position 5 is T, and positions 3 and 4 are excluded for A).
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 4 (since position 5 is T and position 3 is excluded for L).

We need to form a word with T at the end, and containing A and L.

We also need three other letters (or possibly repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of repetition).

We must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Considering common English words ending with T:

Think of words fitting the constraints:
- Must have A and L somewhere in first four positions, with A not in 3 or 4, L not in 3, and T at position 5.

So, positions: 
- Let the word be _ _ _ _ T

A must be in position 1 or 2.
L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Case 1: A in position 1.
Then word: A _ _ _ T
L would be in position 2 or 4. (cannot be in 3).

If L in position 2: A L _ _ T
Missing two letters. What could fit? The third letter cannot be A or L again? We don't know if repetition is allowed, but avoid unless necessary.

Words like ""ALERT"" has E and R -> excluded.
""ALTIT"" not a word.
""ALBAT"" not a word, and has B - okay, but not common? ""ALBAT"" might not be a word. ""ABASE"" has S and E excluded.

Common words: ""ALOFT"" but O, and we haven't excluded O? But also F. However, we have L in position 3? In ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2? A-L-O-F-T -> positions: A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5).

But from feedback, L cannot be in position 3? Here L is in position 2, which is allowed. And A is in position 1, allowed. Now check letters: O and F. Are they excluded? No, we haven't guessed them. So ""ALOFT"" is a possibility.

But we need to see if it fits the constraints.

Another word: ""ADULT"" has D, U, L, but L is in position 4? A-D-U-L-T -> A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). Here L is in position 4, which is allowed. Also, A in 1.

But we don't know if D and U are in the word.

Case 2: A in position 2.
Then word: _ A _ _ T
And L could be in position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so L in 1 or 4.

If L in position 1: L A _ _ T
Now, words like ""LAITY"" has Y, I. ""LATT?"" not common. ""LAST"" is 4 letters? Need 5: ""LASTS"" has S excluded.

Other possibilities: ""DAILY"" but D, A, I, L, Y -> A in 2, L in 4? D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5). But Y at the end? But we have T at the end? Must end with T. So ""DAILY"" ends with Y, not T.

Must end with T, so ""LATT?"" or ""BALDT"" not words.

If L in position 4 and A in position 2: _ A _ L T
Now, words: Ex. ""HAILT"" not word. ""MALTS"" has S and M? ""MALTS"": M-A-L-T-S -> but S is excluded and we need T at the end? M-A-L-T-S ends with S, not T. We need the fifth letter to be T, so after L? The pattern is: _ A _ L T -> four letters before T? No: positions: 1, 2 is A, 3, 4 is L? 4 is L and 5 is T. So word like _ A _ L T.

What words? ""GAULT"" is a word? G-A-U-L-T? Or ""FAULT"" -> F-A-U-L-T. Both have U. ""VAULT"" similar.

Another: ""HALTS"" has S.

But ""FAULT"": letters F, A, U, L, T. Avoids excluded letters: C,R,N,E,S,P. And A in position 2, L in position 4.

We also have L in position 4: from feedback in guess 2, we placed L in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. Position 4 is different so it can be.

Similarly, A was not in pos 3 or 4, here in pos 2 is new.

Back to ""ALOFT"": A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5). This fits: A not in 3 or 4 (it's in 1), L not in 3 (it's in 2), T at 5. And letters: A,L,O,F,T. O and F not excluded.

Similarly, ""FAULT"": F(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). A in 2 (not 3 or 4), L in 4 (not 3), T at 5.

We have two candidates: ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"".

We need to choose one for the next guess.

We can also think if there are other letters we know? From feedback, we only know A, L, T are in the word, T in position 5.

We have tested O and U in ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"", but we don't have information on them.

We need to maximize new information.

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters?

For example, we know T is fixed at the end. We need to find the first four letters with A, L, and two other letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters are C, R, N, E, S, P. So available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but T and A,L are already in, so others).

Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, etc.

In ""ALOFT"", letters tested: A, L, O, F, T -> we already know A,L,T, so testing O and F.

In ""FAULT"", testing F, U.

We could test other letters? For example, ""HALT"" not 5 letters. ""BAULT"" not word? ""DAILY"" not ends with T.

Another candidate: ""DEALT"" -> but E is excluded? E not in word. ""DEALT"" has E -> excluded.

""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,S,P? Yes. A in position 1, D in 2, U in 3, L in 4, T in 5. Position for A: 1, which is allowed. Position for L: 4, allowed.

""ADULT"" tests D and U.

Similarly, ""OAKT"" not word.

Another possibility: ""MALTS"" but S excluded? S not in, so invalid.

Perhaps ""GALLT"" not word.

So main candidates: ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"".

We need to pick one. How about including a letter that hasn't been tested? We haven't tested B, D, H, I, M, O, U, F, etc.

Since we know T is fixed and A must be in 1 or 2, and L in 1,2,4 (but not 3), we can choose a word that uses a common consonant.

Another idea: let's put A in position 1 and L in position 2? Like ""ALIGHT"" too long. ""ALITE"" not word. ""ALIOT"" not word. ""ALBAT"" not word.

Earlier we thought of ""ALOFT"".

Similarly, A in position 2 and L in position 4: ""HAULT"" not common, ""JAULT"" not word, ""MAULT"" not word? But ""Vault"" is with V? ""VAULT"" is a word.

But ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. V is less common.

Perhaps ""DAULT"" not.

So among valid words: ""ADULT"" (A-D-U-L-T), ""ALOFT"" (A-L-O-F-T), ""FAULT"" (F-A-U-L-T).

All seem valid.

Now, which to choose? We want to test letters that are more common. 

- O is a common vowel, F is a common consonant?
- U is a vowel, less common than O?
- D is common.

But let's see frequency in English:

According to letter frequency in English words:
- O is high frequency (about 7.5%)
- U is less (about 2.8%)
- F is medium (about 2.2%)
- D is medium (about 4.3%)

So O is very common.

We should test O? So ""ALOFT"" might be good.

Also, in ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2, which we haven't tested for L. 

Similarly, we can test F.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has I? But no word ending with T with I and our positions.

For example, ""DELIST"" has E,S excluded.

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" has O,U,T but O in position 2, U in 3, T in 5? But ""ABOUT"": A-B-O-U-T -> A in 1, B in ? Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). Here A in 1, L not present? But we know L must be in the word, so ""ABOUT"" cannot be because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, any guess must include L because we know L is in the word.

So we must include L.

Similarly include A.

So among the candidates, ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"" all include A and L.

Perhaps ""ALOFT"" is the best because O is common.

Another word: ""BELTS"" has E,S excluded.

Or ""MULCT"" not common and has C excluded? C not in.

Anyway, let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But note: in ""ALOFT"", we have O and F.

Alternatively, if we use ""DOULT"" not word.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good guess.

So next guess: ALOFT

But let's confirm the positions:
- A in pos 1: new, might be correct?
- L in pos 2: new
- O in pos 3: we haven't tested before
- F in pos 4: new
- T in pos 5: already correct

This tests O and F, which could be in the word.

Even if not all correct, we get information.

Another candidate: ""THALM"" not word? Not ending with T.

I think ""ALOFT"" is fine.<thinking>
We have received feedback from two previous guesses:

- Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - This tells us:
    - Letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the secret word.
    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

- Guess 2: SPLAT → Feedback: S(x), P(x), L(-), A(-), T(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - Letters S and P are NOT in the secret word.
    - Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was misplaced again).
    - Letter T is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5).

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: A, L, T must be in the word.
  - T is fixed at position 5.
  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
  - L cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P (all marked ""x"").
- **Word structure**: The word ends with T (position 5). Positions 1 and 2 must accommodate A if it's not in position 1 or 2, but A must be in 1 or 2.
- **Available letters**: We must avoid excluded letters. Common unused letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a word that:
  - Ends with T (to test or confirm position 5).
  - Includes both A and L in valid positions:
    - A in position 1 or 2.
    - L in position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, S, P).
  - Maximizes new letter information: Introduce common unused letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

Candidate words:
- ""ALOFT"": A (position 1), L (position 2), O, F, T (position 5). This tests O and F (new letters), places A and L in previously untested positions, and adheres to constraints. A in 1 and L in 2 are allowed.
- ""FAULT"": F (position 1), A (position 2), U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests F and U, with A in pos 2 and L in pos 4.
- ""ADULT"": A (position 1), D, U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests D and U, with A in pos 1 and L in pos 4.

Selection rationale:
- ""ALOFT"" is preferred because:
  - It tests O (a high-frequency vowel) and F (common consonant).
  - Positions for A (1) and L (2) are both new and plausible.
  - Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters.
  - If incorrect, feedback will provide strong clues about the positions of A and L, as well as existence of O/F.

Next steps:
- After this guess, feedback will help confirm positions for A and L, reveal if O/F are in the word, and further narrow possibilities.

Also, the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to:\n1. Include the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the 3rd position.\n2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.\n3. Use a word that has other common letters to maximize information.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.

Since it\'s not in the 3rd position, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\nPossible starting letters for the next guess: We might try A in the first position? Or second? Let\'s see.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has multiple common letters to test.\n\nOne common approach is to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters.\n\nLet me list some candidate words that:\n- Include A (but not in the 3rd position)\n- Exclude C, R, N, E\n- Use other common letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", etc. But note: we must avoid R (in ABOUT, R is present but we know R is not in the word). Similarly, E is in ABOUT and ABOVE, but E is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid R, so ABOUT is invalid because of R. Similarly, ABOVE has E and is invalid. AFTER has E and R? AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R, both excluded. ALONG: A, L, O, N, G -> N is excluded. APART: A, P, A, R, T -> has R and repeated A? Actually, APART has two A\'s? But the word is 5 letters: A-P-A-R-T. So two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? The feedback only told us that A is in the word, but it might be only one. However, we can use words with repeated letters? But in this case, we are avoiding R and N, so APART has R -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s try A in the second position? Or fourth? \n\nAnother idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try a word that has A in a different position and four new common letters.\n\nLet me think of words without C, R, N, E.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with as many of the most common consonants and vowels as possible.\n\nCommon consonants in 5-letter words: S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.\n\nVowels: O, I, U (we already know A is present, but we don\'t know about others).\n\nWe can try to include O and I, for example.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption 1: A in the first position. But we need to avoid C, R, N, E. So what words start with A and don\'t have those? \n- How about ""ALOFT""? A, L, O, F, T -> no C, R, N, E. But we have L, O, F, T. And A is in position 1 (which is different from position 3). This seems valid.\n\nOption 2: A in the second position. Words like ""SALAD""? But SALAD has two A\'s and also S, L, D. But it has A in position 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? It might. But also, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so SALAD is acceptable? But let\'s see: S, A, L, A, D -> no R, N, E, C. However, we are using two A\'s, which might not be efficient if the word has only one A. But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> again two A\'s and avoids R, N, E, C. But we are repeating A.\n\nTo avoid repetition, we can try a word with A only once and in a new position.\n\nOption 3: A in the fourth position. Words like ""PLAIT""? P, L, A, I, T -> avoids R, N, E, C. But I is a vowel. This is a valid word.\n\nOption 4: A in the fifth position. Words like ""PIZZA""? But that has Z and Z, which are uncommon. Or ""JUMBA""? Not a word. ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> two A\'s? And A in second and fifth? Not ideal.\n\nSo, let\'s consider:\n\n- ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and we test L, O, F, T.\n- ""PLAIT"": A in position 4, and we test P, L, I, T.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But that has A in first position and tests U, D, I, O. However, we are avoiding R, N, E, C, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let me check: no R, N, E, C. Yes. And it has four vowels? But that might be good for information.\n\nBut the word ""AUDIO"" is a common test word because it has four vowels. However, we know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.\n\nAlternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J.\n\nAnother word: ""SAULT""? But that might not be common. Or ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> A in third position? But we are not supposed to put A in third because we know it\'s misplaced there? Actually, we can put A in third again? But we already know it\'s not in third, so if we put it in third and get a \'-\' again, we don\'t learn anything new? Actually, we might get a \'✓\' if it is in third? But the feedback said it was misplaced, meaning it is not in third. So it cannot be in third. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we must place A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBack to ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, which is acceptable. It tests A (which we know is present) and U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we are testing four new letters. That seems efficient.\n\nAnother option: ""STOMP"" -> but no A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit A.\n\nSo, we must include A.\n\nTherefore, ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me check if there are better words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT""? But N is excluded (we got N as x in the first guess). So PAINT has N -> invalid.\n\n""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in second position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is good.\n\n""MAILS"" vs ""AUDIO"": \n- ""MAILS"" has M, A, I, L, S. We test M, I, L, S (and A, which we know).\n- ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O.\n\nWhich set of letters is more common? S, L, M are very common, while U and D are less common. So ""MAILS"" might be better.\n\nBut we also have to consider the positions. We know A is not in position 3, so in ""MAILS"", A is in position 2. That\'s a new position.\n\nSimilarly, in ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> A in third position? But we cannot put A in third because we know it\'s not there. So avoid.\n\n""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is excluded.\n\n""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> avoids R, N, E, C. A in second position.\n\n""DAILY"" tests D, A, I, L, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""SOLAR"": has R and A? But R is excluded.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, A, I, L, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A\'s, which might not be efficient.\n\nOr ""PASTA"" has two A\'s and P, S, T.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repetition if possible.\n\nAnother word: ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in fourth position. Avoids R, N, E, C. This is a valid word.\n\n""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A, T. All common letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A in second position, and Y at the end.\n\nBut ""SPLAT"" seems better because it has no Y.\n\nSo, between ""MAILS"", ""AUDIO"", and ""SPLAT"", which one?\n\nWe want to cover as many common letters as possible and also position A in a new place.\n\nIn the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we can try position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nIn ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4.\n\nIn ""MAILS"", A is in position 2.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", A is in position 1.\n\nAll are new positions.\n\nNow, the set of letters:\n\n- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (A known)\n- ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> tests S, P, L, T (A known) -> note that S and L are in both, but that\'s okay because we are testing them in different positions.\n- ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> tests U, D, I, O\n\nThe most common letters among the remaining are S, T, L, P, M, etc. So ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"" are better than ""AUDIO"" in terms of letter frequency.\n\nBetween ""SPLAT"" and ""MAILS"", ""SPLAT"" has the advantage of having T, which is very common, and P, while ""MAILS"" has M and I.\n\nBut both are good.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SPLAT"" because it has T and P, and A is in position 4, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nSo, next guess: SPLAT\n\nBut let me confirm: S, P, L, A, T. No C, R, N, E. And A is in position 4 (not 3). Valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLATS"": P, L, A, T, S -> same letters, but A in third position? We cannot put A in third. So ""PLATS"" is invalid for A position.\n\nSo ""SPLAT"" is good.\n\nAnother option: ""PASTY"" but Y is less common.\n\nI think ""SPLAT"" is a good choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SPLAT"".<thinking>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the 3rd position (since it was misplaced there).\n2. The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n3. Therefore, the next guess must:\n   - Include ""A"" in a new position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).\n   - Avoid using C, R, N, or E.\n   - Use common unused letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P, M, I, O, etc.).\n\nStrategy for the second guess:\n- Choose a word with ""A"" in a position not yet tested (avoiding 3rd) and include other high-frequency consonants/vowels.\n- Avoid repeating letters from the first guess that were excluded (C, R, N, E).\n- Prioritize words with unique, common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nSelected word: ""SPLAT""\n- Letters: S, P, L, A, T\n- Why ""SPLAT""?\n  - Includes ""A"" in the 4th position (a new position to test).\n  - Avoids C, R, N, E.\n  - Tests new common letters: S (very common), P, L, T (all high-frequency).\n  - Valid 5-letter English word.\n  - Provides good coverage for feedback on multiple letter positions.\n\nAlternatives considered:\n- ""MAILS"" (A in 2nd position, tests M, I, L, S) – also strong, but ""SPLAT"" tests T and P, which are slightly more common than M and I.\n- ""AUDIO"" (A in 1st position, tests U, D, I, O) – less ideal as U and D are less common, and we miss testing key consonants.\n- ""PLAIT"" (A in 4th position, tests P, L, I, T) – similar to ""SPLAT"", but ""SPLAT"" includes S (more common than I).\n\nThis guess should help narrow down the possibilities significantly based on the feedback.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SPLAT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLAT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess: SPLAT\n- S: x (not in word)\n- P: x (not in word)\n- L: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position)\n- T: ✓ (in word and correct position)\n\nKey information:\n1.

A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (from first guess) and not in the 4th position (from second guess).\n3. L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (it was guessed there and got a dash, meaning wrong position).\n4. The following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, P.\n5.

(cannot be in 3).\n\nIf L in position 2: A L _ _ T\nMissing two letters. What could fit? The third letter cannot be A or L again? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed, but avoid unless necessary.\n\nWords like ""ALERT"" has E and R -> excluded.\n""ALTIT"" not a word.\n""ALBAT"" not a word, and has B - okay, but not common? ""ALBAT"" might not be a word. ""ABASE"" has S and E excluded.\n\nCommon words: ""ALOFT"" but O, and we haven\'t excluded O? But also F. However, we have L in position 3? In ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2? A-L-O-F-T -> positions: A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5).\n\nBut from feedback, L cannot be in position 3? Here L is in position 2, which is allowed. And A is in position 1, allowed. Now check letters: O and F. Are they excluded? No, we haven\'t guessed them. So ""ALOFT"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we need to see if it fits the constraints.\n\nAnother word: ""ADULT"" has D, U, L, but L is in position 4? A-D-U-L-T -> A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). Here L is in position 4, which is allowed. Also, A in 1.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D and U are in the word.\n\nCase 2: A in position 2.\nThen word: _ A _ _ T\nAnd L could be in position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so L in 1 or 4.\n\nIf L in position 1: L A _ _ T\nNow, words like ""LAITY"" has Y, I. ""LATT?"" not common. ""LAST"" is 4 letters? Need 5: ""LASTS"" has S excluded.\n\nOther possibilities: ""DAILY"" but D, A, I, L, Y -> A in 2, L in 4? D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5). But Y at the end? But we have T at the end? Must end with T. So ""DAILY"" ends with Y, not T.\n\nMust end with T, so ""LATT?"" or ""BALDT"" not words.\n\nIf L in position 4 and A in position 2: _ A _ L T\nNow, words: Ex. ""HAILT"" not word. ""MALTS"" has S and M? ""MALTS"": M-A-L-T-S -> but S is excluded and we need T at the end? M-A-L-T-S ends with S, not T. We need the fifth letter to be T, so after L? The pattern is: _ A _ L T -> four letters before T? No: positions: 1, 2 is A, 3, 4 is L? 4 is L and 5 is T. So word like _ A _ L T.\n\nWhat words? ""GAULT"" is a word? G-A-U-L-T? Or ""FAULT"" -> F-A-U-L-T. Both have U. ""VAULT"" similar.\n\nAnother: ""HALTS"" has S.\n\nBut ""FAULT"": letters F, A, U, L, T. Avoids excluded letters: C,R,N,E,S,P. And A in position 2, L in position 4.\n\nWe also have L in position 4: from feedback in guess 2, we placed L in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. Position 4 is different so it can be.\n\nSimilarly, A was not in pos 3 or 4, here in pos 2 is new.\n\nBack to ""ALOFT"": A(1), L(2), O(3), F(4), T(5). This fits: A not in 3 or 4 (it\'s in 1), L not in 3 (it\'s in 2), T at 5. And letters: A,L,O,F,T. O and F not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""FAULT"": F(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). A in 2 (not 3 or 4), L in 4 (not 3), T at 5.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"".\n\nWe need to choose one for the next guess.\n\nWe can also think if there are other letters we know? From feedback, we only know A, L, T are in the word, T in position 5.\n\nWe have tested O and U in ""ALOFT"" and ""FAULT"", but we don\'t have information on them.\n\nWe need to maximize new information.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters?\n\nFor example, we know T is fixed at the end. We need to find the first four letters with A, L, and two other letters that are not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters are C, R, N, E, S, P. So available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but T and A,L are already in, so others).\n\nCommon ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, etc.\n\nIn ""ALOFT"", letters tested: A, L, O, F, T -> we already know A,L,T, so testing O and F.\n\nIn ""FAULT"", testing F, U.\n\nWe could test other letters? For example, ""HALT"" not 5 letters. ""BAULT"" not word? ""DAILY"" not ends with T.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DEALT"" -> but E is excluded? E not in word. ""DEALT"" has E -> excluded.\n\n""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,S,P? Yes. A in position 1, D in 2, U in 3, L in 4, T in 5. Position for A: 1, which is allowed. Position for L: 4, allowed.\n\n""ADULT"" tests D and U.\n\nSimilarly, ""OAKT"" not word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MALTS"" but S excluded? S not in, so invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""GALLT"" not word.\n\nSo main candidates: ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"".\n\nWe need to pick one. How about including a letter that hasn\'t been tested? We haven\'t tested B, D, H, I, M, O, U, F, etc.\n\nSince we know T is fixed and A must be in 1 or 2, and L in 1,2,4 (but not 3), we can choose a word that uses a common consonant.\n\nAnother idea: let\'s put A in position 1 and L in position 2? Like ""ALIGHT"" too long. ""ALITE"" not word. ""ALIOT"" not word. ""ALBAT"" not word.\n\nEarlier we thought of ""ALOFT"".\n\nSimilarly, A in position 2 and L in position 4: ""HAULT"" not common, ""JAULT"" not word, ""MAULT"" not word? But ""Vault"" is with V? ""VAULT"" is a word.\n\nBut ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. V is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""DAULT"" not.\n\nSo among valid words: ""ADULT"" (A-D-U-L-T), ""ALOFT"" (A-L-O-F-T), ""FAULT"" (F-A-U-L-T).\n\nAll seem valid.\n\nNow, which to choose? We want to test letters that are more common. \n\n- O is a common vowel, F is a common consonant?\n- U is a vowel, less common than O?\n- D is common.\n\nBut let\'s see frequency in English:\n\nAccording to letter frequency in English words:\n- O is high frequency (about 7.5%)\n- U is less (about 2.8%)\n- F is medium (about 2.2%)\n- D is medium (about 4.3%)\n\nSo O is very common.\n\nWe should test O? So ""ALOFT"" might be good.\n\nAlso, in ""ALOFT"", L is in position 2, which we haven\'t tested for L. \n\nSimilarly, we can test F.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has I? But no word ending with T with I and our positions.\n\nFor example, ""DELIST"" has E,S excluded.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ABOUT"" has O,U,T but O in position 2, U in 3, T in 5? But ""ABOUT"": A-B-O-U-T -> A in 1, B in ? Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). Here A in 1, L not present? But we know L must be in the word, so ""ABOUT"" cannot be because it doesn\'t have L.\n\nSimilarly, any guess must include L because we know L is in the word.\n\nSo we must include L.\n\nSimilarly include A.\n\nSo among the candidates, ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"", ""ADULT"" all include A and L.\n\nPerhaps ""ALOFT"" is the best because O is common.\n\nAnother word: ""BELTS"" has E,S excluded.\n\nOr ""MULCT"" not common and has C excluded? C not in.\n\nAnyway, let\'s go with ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut note: in ""ALOFT"", we have O and F.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ""DOULT"" not word.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is a good guess.\n\nSo next guess: ALOFT\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n- A in pos 1: new, might be correct?\n- L in pos 2: new\n- O in pos 3: we haven\'t tested before\n- F in pos 4: new\n- T in pos 5: already correct\n\nThis tests O and F, which could be in the word.\n\nEven if not all correct, we get information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""THALM"" not word? Not ending with T.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is fine.<thinking>\nWe have received feedback from two previous guesses:\n\n- Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n  - This tells us:\n    - Letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the secret word.\n    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3.\n\n- Guess 2: SPLAT → Feedback: S(x), P(x), L(-), A(-), T(✓)\n  - This tells us:\n    - Letters S and P are NOT in the secret word.\n    - Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 3.\n    - Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was misplaced again).\n    - Letter T is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5).\n\nKey deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters**: A, L, T must be in the word.\n  - T is fixed at position 5.\n  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 1 or 2.\n  - L cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P (all marked ""x"").\n- **Word structure**: The word ends with T (position 5). Positions 1 and 2 must accommodate A if it\'s not in position 1 or 2, but A must be in 1 or 2.\n- **Available letters**: We must avoid excluded letters. Common unused letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n- We need a word that:\n  - Ends with T (to test or confirm position 5).\n  - Includes both A and L in valid positions:\n    - A in position 1 or 2.\n    - L in position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).\n  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, S, P).\n  - Maximizes new letter information: Introduce common unused letters to test as many possibilities as possible.\n\nCandidate words:\n- ""ALOFT"": A (position 1), L (position 2), O, F, T (position 5). This tests O and F (new letters), places A and L in previously untested positions, and adheres to constraints. A in 1 and L in 2 are allowed.\n- ""FAULT"": F (position 1), A (position 2), U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests F and U, with A in pos 2 and L in pos 4.\n- ""ADULT"": A (position 1), D, U, L (position 4), T (position 5). Tests D and U, with A in pos 1 and L in pos 4.\n\nSelection rationale:\n- ""ALOFT"" is preferred because:\n  - It tests O (a high-frequency vowel) and F (common consonant).\n  - Positions for A (1) and L (2) are both new and plausible.\n  - Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters.\n  - If incorrect, feedback will provide strong clues about the positions of A and L, as well as existence of O/F.\n\nNext steps:\n- After this guess, feedback will help confirm positions for A and L, reveal if O/F are in the word, and further narrow possibilities.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>ALOFT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLAT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓)\nGuess 3: ALOFT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) O(x) F(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are now on the fourth guess. We have feedback from three previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPLAT -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓)
  - L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was already known not in 3, now not in 4 either).
  - T is in the word and in position 5.
  - S and P are not in the word.

Guess 3: ALOFT -> A(-) L(-) O(x) F(x) T(✓)
  - A is still not in position 1 (since we got - meaning it's in the word but not position 1).
  - L is not in position 2 (we placed it in position 2 and got -).
  - O and F are not in the word.
  - T remains in position 5 (correct).

Summary of what we know:

1. The word ends with T (position 5 is T).

2. A and L are in the word, but:
   - A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from guesses 1, 3, and 2 respectively). 
     Therefore, the only remaining position for A is position 2.
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 3). 
     Since position 5 is T, L cannot be there either. 
     So L must be in position 1 or position 4.

3. Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, P, O, F.

4. We have tested A in positions 1,3,4 → all wrong, so A must be in position 2.

5. L has been tested in position 2 and 3 → both wrong, so L must be in position 1 or 4.

Now, the word structure is:

Position 1: Could be L? or another letter that we haven't excluded.
Position 2: Must be A (since A must be in position 2).
Position 3: Unknown (but not A or L, as we know their positions aren't here? Actually A is fixed in 2, and L can't be in 3, so position 3 is a new letter).
Position 4: Could be L? or another.
Position 5: T.

So two main cases:
Case 1: L in position 1 → then word is L A _ _ T
Case 2: L in position 4 → then word is _ A _ L T

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only available letters.

Available letters: We have to avoid C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F. So the alphabet minus these letters: 
A,B,D,G,H,I,J,K,M,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But A and L and T are already used, so position 3 and 4 (or 1 and 3 or 4) must be filled with other letters from the available set.

We also need to use letters that are common and valid.

Moreover, we must include L either at pos 1 or pos 4.

Let's try to find possible words.

First, if L is in position 1: word is L A * * T. The third and fourth positions need two letters that form a word.

What words: L A _ _ T?

Examples:
- L A U N T -> but N is excluded? So not N.
- L A I T T -> not a word? And repeated T? 
- L A M I T -> M and I: words? ""LIMIT"" is L-I-M-I-T → but we need L A so not.
Actually, L A followed by two letters and then T.

Common words: ""LATTE""? But that has E? And E is excluded. Also, T repeated? 
""LATTE"": L,A,T,T,E → but we have positions: pos1: L, pos2: A, pos3: T? But then T is in pos3 and pos5? But we know T is only at the end? Also E excluded.

""LARCH"" → but R and C excluded? And not ending with T.

Perhaps not many common words? 
""LARNT"" not word.
""LAKET"" not word? 
""LAITY"" -> L-A-I-T-Y → ends with Y? Not T.
""LAST"" only 4 letters.

Words ending with T: ""LAMBT""? Not word. 
""LAVAT""? Not word. 
""LAZYT""? Not.

How about ""DAILY""? But ends with Y.

Perhaps ""HAULT""? Not common? Or try ""MAULT"" not.

Another idea: ""VAULT"" → but that is V-A-U-L-T → which has A in 2, L in 4 → so that is case 2: L in position 4.

But for case 1: L in 1, that's difficult? Perhaps no common word? 

Consider: ""BALMY"" → not ending T. 

""BALDT""? Not a word.

So probably the word has L in position 4? That seems more plausible.

Now, case 2: L in position 4: word pattern is _ A _ L T.

So: position1: any letter (not excluded), position2: A, position3: any letter (not excluded), position4: L, position5: T.

We need two letters: one for position1 and one for position3.

Available letters: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,M,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: we want a word _ A _ L T.

Possibilities:

- Position1: B → B A _ L T → e.g., ""BAILT"" not word? ""BASLT"" not? ""BAGLT"" not? 
  Common word: ""BASALT"" too long? ""BALT""? 4 letters?
  ""BASILT"" not? I think ""BAULT"" is not a word.

- D: D A _ L T → ""DAILY"" ends Y? ""DAMLT"" not? ""DAULT"" not? 
  But ""DEALT"" has E? E excluded. ""DIALT"" not?

- G: G A _ L T → ""GAILY"" not? ""GAULT"" → G-A-U-L-T? That's valid? Yes, ""GAULT"" is a word? Let me check: Gault, like Gault Clay? Probably not common? 
  In Wordle, proper nouns? Usually not? But we need standard word? Perhaps not.

- H: H A _ L T → ""HALOT"" not? ""HALT"" 4 letters? ""HAULT"" → H-A-U-L-T? Which is an old spelling of ""vault"" or something? Probably not accepted? ""HAULT"": not standard?
  ""HALIT""? Not word.

- I: I A _ L T → ""I AL T"" not? Can't start with I? Words like ""IBALT"" not.

- J: J A _ L T → ""JAMLT""? Not?

- K: K A _ L T → ""KAILT"" not? ""KELT"" has E? ""KAULT"" not?

- M: M A _ L T → ""MALTO""? No? ""MALT"" 4 letters? ""MAULT"" → M-A-U-L-T? Not common, but? Similarly.

But ""MALT"" is 4 letters? What about ""MALTO""? Not? 

Wait: Perhaps ""SMALT"" → but S is excluded? And S is marked x.

Similarly, ""EXALT"" has E and X? Not.

So difficult? 

Another possibility: ""BALDT"" not? Or perhaps we need to consider different letters.

What about ""V A _ L T"" → ""VAULT"" is the only option? V-A-U-L-T? Which has U in position3. 

Similarly, ""W A _ L T"" → ""WAULT"" → same as vault? Or ""WALT"" 4 letters? ""WALTZ"" not ending T.

Or ""GAWLT"" not.

But ""VAULT"" is a common word? Yes, meaning a secure room? And it uses V and U.

Only other: ""J A I L T"" → But that would be J-A-I-L-T → JAI? Not a standard word? 

Another common word: ""FAULT"" → but F is excluded? From guess 3, F is x → not in word.

So ""FAULT"" invalid.

But in case 2, we have ""VAULT"", but what about other letters? 

Perhaps ""MAW T""? Not.

Another idea: ""A L T"" as in somethings? Position4 is L.

What about ""H A B L T""? Not? 

Perhaps I missed a word? 

Let's list known words: ""BASLT"" not? ""CALVT""? Not.

Maybe ""DELT"" is 4 letters? 

But we have the word ""ADULT"": A-D-U-L-T → 
Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) → 
But in our case, we have established that A must be in position 2? But in ""ADULT"", A is in position 1? That conflicts with our deduction that A must be in position 2.

Wait a minute! From the feedback of guess 3 (ALOFT): A was in position 1 and got '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, we already knew A not in 3 or 4. So the only position left is position 2.

But in ""ADULT"", A is in position 1, which would be invalid? So we cannot use it if A is not in 2.

Therefore, A must be in position 2. So words like ""ADULT"" are invalid because A is not in position 2.

Similarly, in ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T → A is in position 2 → that is correct.

In ""VAULT"": 
- Position1: V
- Position2: A
- Position3: U
- Position4: L
- Position5: T

Which fits: L is in position 4? And A in 2? 

We know L must be in position 1 or 4? Here it is in 4.

And letters: V, A, U, L, T. Avoids all excluded: C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F are excluded? V,U,T not excluded? T is in, A and L in, U and V are new.

Is ""VAULT"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, are there other words? Like ""HAULT""? Or is it standard? ""HAULT"" may not be common? But ""VAULT"" is acceptable.

What about ""DAUNT"" but N excluded? And not L.

Or ""BAULK"" not ending T.

So ""VAULT"" seems a strong candidate.

But let's check if we have tested V or U? We haven't, so if we choose it, we test them.

But we have only two possibilities: L in position 1 or L in position 4.

But case 1 with L in position 1: we couldn't find a common word? Maybe it's not the case.

Perhaps ""K A L T"" not? Or ""T A L I T"" not?

Another possibility: if L is in position 1, and say position 3 is I, position 4 is M? ""LAMIT"" not word? ""LIMIT"" without A.

Word must have A in position 2? So for case 1: L A * * T.

""L A M M T"" not word? 
""L A D I T"" → ""LADIT"" not word.
""L A G E T"" has E excluded.
""L A B I T"" → ""LABIT"" not? 
""L A U G T"" → ""LAUGT"" not? 
""L A U V T"" → ""LAUVT"" not.

So probably no common English word with L A _ _ T? 

Therefore, L must be in position 4? That leaves us with words of the form _ A _ L T.

Common words: 
- ""HA l T"" not? But ""HALT"" is 4 letters? What 5-letter words?
- ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T
- ""WAILS"" not ending T? ""WAULT"" → archaic? 
- ""JAILT"" not?

Or ""MAST"" 4 letters? ""MALT"" 4? 

But ""VAULT"" is the most common?

Also, ""TAIL"" not? 

Another word: ""GALLT"" not? 

But note: perhaps ""BAILS"" has S? 

I think ""VAULT"" is our best bet. But V is less common? However, it fits.

Perhaps ""HAULT"" is an obsolete form. But in Wordle, it might not be accepted? 

But let's confirm: we are required to have a valid English word.

Another word: ""BADLT"" not? 

""CAVLT"" not.

""DAV I T"" ends with T? D-A-V-I-T → but positions: D(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), T(5). But would L be in this word? No, unless position4 is L? Here it is I? So no L? But we must have L.

In ""DAVIT"", no L? So invalid.

Similarly, ""HABIT"" has B,I,T but no L? And position2 is A? But no L? Must have L.

So for case 2: must have L in position4? So only words like _ A _ L T.

Possible letters: for position1, we can have B,D,G,H,K,M,U,V,W,X,Y? But not C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F.

Position3 must be a vowel? Or consonant? What fits?

Look: words in English ending with ""ALT"": not? With L T at the end? 

Words: ""vault"", ""fault"" (but F excluded), ""gault"" (geological term), ""haunt"" not? ""daunt"" not? 

""VAULT"" and ""GAULT"" are the only ones? 

But ""GAULT"" is G-A-U-L-T? 

Now, in Wordle, is ""GAULT"" accepted? Possibly? But ""VAULT"" is more common? So we should use ""VAULT"" if we can.

But let's see if we haven't excluded V and U.

We haven't guessed V or U? So they are possible.

But we need to decide: perhaps try ""VAULT"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more letters? But we are limited.

Since we have two scenario? But only case 2 seems possible.

But wait, there might be another pattern? We said L must be in position 1 or 4? But position 1 or 4.

Word with L in position 1 and A in position 2: L A * * T → and the only possibility we have is to fill with D and I? But ""L A D I T"" not word? Or ""L A G Y T"" not.

So L must be in position 4? And A in position 2.

Therefore, we must guess a word of that pattern: _ A _ L T.

But if we guess ""VAULT"", and it's correct, we get it. If not, we get feedback.

Another word: ""TAIL T"" not? Or ""EMAIL T"" not? 

What about ""BALKY"" not ending T?

I think we have to go with ""VAULT"".

But let's see if we can guess a word that tests U? Or something else.

Perhaps ""GUILT"" → G-U-I-L-T → but positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5). But then position 2 is U? But we said position 2 must be A? So not ""GUILT"" because A is missing? No, we know A must be in the word and in position 2? So that word has U in 2 instead of A? So it wouldn't have A? Therefore, invalid.

All guesses must include A? And L? And T at the end.

Therefore, guess: VAULT

But note: we are guessing V and U as new letters.

If the word is ""VAULT"", all good.

Otherwise, feedback will help.

Perhaps ""MAUL T""? ""MAULT"" → M-A-U-L-T? That is word? It might be an archaic form? Or variant of malt? Not common. ""VAULT"" is more standard.

So I think ""VAULT"" is the best choice.<thinking>
Feedback summary:
- Guess 1: CRANE → A is misplaced, not in pos 3;
- Guess 2: SPLAT → L misplaced (not pos 3), A misplaced (not pos 4), T correct in pos 5;
- Guess 3: ALOFT → A misplaced (not pos 1), L misplaced (not pos 2), O and F not in word, T correct.

Deductions:
1. T is fixed in position 5.
2. A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → must be in position 2.
3. L cannot be in positions 2, 3 → must be in position 1 or 4 (position 5 is T, so not possible).
4. Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P, O, F.

Thus, secret word format:
- Pos 2: A
- Pos 5: T
- Pos 1: either L or another letter (not excluded)
- Pos 4: L (if pos 1 not L) or another letter
- Pos 3: must be a letter not excluded.

After evaluating possible words:
- If L is in pos 1: pattern L A _ _ T → no common English words found with available letters (avoiding C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F).
- Therefore, L must be in pos 4 → pattern _ A _ L T.

Candidate words matching _ A _ L T:
- ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T
- Other possibilities like ""GAULT"" exist but ""VAULT"" is the most common and valid word using available letters (V, U not excluded).

Conclusion: 
- ""VAULT"" uses V and U (new letters to test), positions A(2) and L(4) as required.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- Feedback will confirm/dent V and U, and fix positions.

Given the above, ""VAULT"" is the best next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>VAULT</guess>
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- The secret word must end with T (position 5 is confirmed).
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from deductions). Therefore, A must be in position 2.
- L is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, or 3. Since position 5 is T, L must be in position 1 or 4.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, P, O, F.

Given the constraints, the word pattern must be either:
1. L A _ _ T (if L is in position 1), or  
2. _ A _ L T (if L is in position 4).

Upon evaluation, no common English words fit pattern 1 (L A _ _ T) without using excluded letters. Thus, L must be in position 4, making the pattern _ A _ L T.

The only common valid English word fitting this pattern (avoiding excluded letters) is ""VAULT"" (V-A-U-L-T):
- Position 1: V (new letter to test)
- Position 3: U (new letter to test)
- Positions 2 (A) and 4 (L) match the requirements.
- Position 5: T (confirmed).

This guess tests V and U, which haven't been tested yet, and aligns with the deduced position constraints.
</thinking>

<guess>VAULT</guess>",VAULT,"We are now on the fourth guess. We have feedback from three previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPLAT -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓)
  - L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was already known not in 3, now not in 4 either).
  - T is in the word and in position 5.
  - S and P are not in the word.

Guess 3: ALOFT -> A(-) L(-) O(x) F(x) T(✓)
  - A is still not in position 1 (since we got - meaning it's in the word but not position 1).
  - L is not in position 2 (we placed it in position 2 and got -).
  - O and F are not in the word.
  - T remains in position 5 (correct).

Summary of what we know:

1. The word ends with T (position 5 is T).

2. A and L are in the word, but:
   - A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from guesses 1, 3, and 2 respectively). 
     Therefore, the only remaining position for A is position 2.
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 3). 
     Since position 5 is T, L cannot be there either. 
     So L must be in position 1 or position 4.

3. Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, P, O, F.

4. We have tested A in positions 1,3,4 → all wrong, so A must be in position 2.

5. L has been tested in position 2 and 3 → both wrong, so L must be in position 1 or 4.

Now, the word structure is:

Position 1: Could be L? or another letter that we haven't excluded.
Position 2: Must be A (since A must be in position 2).
Position 3: Unknown (but not A or L, as we know their positions aren't here? Actually A is fixed in 2, and L can't be in 3, so position 3 is a new letter).
Position 4: Could be L? or another.
Position 5: T.

So two main cases:
Case 1: L in position 1 → then word is L A _ _ T
Case 2: L in position 4 → then word is _ A _ L T

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only available letters.

Available letters: We have to avoid C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F. So the alphabet minus these letters: 
A,B,D,G,H,I,J,K,M,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But A and L and T are already used, so position 3 and 4 (or 1 and 3 or 4) must be filled with other letters from the available set.

We also need to use letters that are common and valid.

Moreover, we must include L either at pos 1 or pos 4.

Let's try to find possible words.

First, if L is in position 1: word is L A * * T. The third and fourth positions need two letters that form a word.

What words: L A _ _ T?

Examples:
- L A U N T -> but N is excluded? So not N.
- L A I T T -> not a word? And repeated T? 
- L A M I T -> M and I: words? ""LIMIT"" is L-I-M-I-T → but we need L A so not.
Actually, L A followed by two letters and then T.

Common words: ""LATTE""? But that has E? And E is excluded. Also, T repeated? 
""LATTE"": L,A,T,T,E → but we have positions: pos1: L, pos2: A, pos3: T? But then T is in pos3 and pos5? But we know T is only at the end? Also E excluded.

""LARCH"" → but R and C excluded? And not ending with T.

Perhaps not many common words? 
""LARNT"" not word.
""LAKET"" not word? 
""LAITY"" -> L-A-I-T-Y → ends with Y? Not T.
""LAST"" only 4 letters.

Words ending with T: ""LAMBT""? Not word. 
""LAVAT""? Not word. 
""LAZYT""? Not.

How about ""DAILY""? But ends with Y.

Perhaps ""HAULT""? Not common? Or try ""MAULT"" not.

Another idea: ""VAULT"" → but that is V-A-U-L-T → which has A in 2, L in 4 → so that is case 2: L in position 4.

But for case 1: L in 1, that's difficult? Perhaps no common word? 

Consider: ""BALMY"" → not ending T. 

""BALDT""? Not a word.

So probably the word has L in position 4? That seems more plausible.

Now, case 2: L in position 4: word pattern is _ A _ L T.

So: position1: any letter (not excluded), position2: A, position3: any letter (not excluded), position4: L, position5: T.

We need two letters: one for position1 and one for position3.

Available letters: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,M,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: we want a word _ A _ L T.

Possibilities:

- Position1: B → B A _ L T → e.g., ""BAILT"" not word? ""BASLT"" not? ""BAGLT"" not? 
  Common word: ""BASALT"" too long? ""BALT""? 4 letters?
  ""BASILT"" not? I think ""BAULT"" is not a word.

- D: D A _ L T → ""DAILY"" ends Y? ""DAMLT"" not? ""DAULT"" not? 
  But ""DEALT"" has E? E excluded. ""DIALT"" not?

- G: G A _ L T → ""GAILY"" not? ""GAULT"" → G-A-U-L-T? That's valid? Yes, ""GAULT"" is a word? Let me check: Gault, like Gault Clay? Probably not common? 
  In Wordle, proper nouns? Usually not? But we need standard word? Perhaps not.

- H: H A _ L T → ""HALOT"" not? ""HALT"" 4 letters? ""HAULT"" → H-A-U-L-T? Which is an old spelling of ""vault"" or something? Probably not accepted? ""HAULT"": not standard?
  ""HALIT""? Not word.

- I: I A _ L T → ""I AL T"" not? Can't start with I? Words like ""IBALT"" not.

- J: J A _ L T → ""JAMLT""? Not?

- K: K A _ L T → ""KAILT"" not? ""KELT"" has E? ""KAULT"" not?

- M: M A _ L T → ""MALTO""? No? ""MALT"" 4 letters? ""MAULT"" → M-A-U-L-T? Not common, but? Similarly.

But ""MALT"" is 4 letters? What about ""MALTO""? Not? 

Wait: Perhaps ""SMALT"" → but S is excluded? And S is marked x.

Similarly, ""EXALT"" has E and X? Not.

So difficult? 

Another possibility: ""BALDT"" not? Or perhaps we need to consider different letters.

What about ""V A _ L T"" → ""VAULT"" is the only option? V-A-U-L-T? Which has U in position3. 

Similarly, ""W A _ L T"" → ""WAULT"" → same as vault? Or ""WALT"" 4 letters? ""WALTZ"" not ending T.

Or ""GAWLT"" not.

But ""VAULT"" is a common word? Yes, meaning a secure room? And it uses V and U.

Only other: ""J A I L T"" → But that would be J-A-I-L-T → JAI? Not a standard word? 

Another common word: ""FAULT"" → but F is excluded? From guess 3, F is x → not in word.

So ""FAULT"" invalid.

But in case 2, we have ""VAULT"", but what about other letters? 

Perhaps ""MAW T""? Not.

Another idea: ""A L T"" as in somethings? Position4 is L.

What about ""H A B L T""? Not? 

Perhaps I missed a word? 

Let's list known words: ""BASLT"" not? ""CALVT""? Not.

Maybe ""DELT"" is 4 letters? 

But we have the word ""ADULT"": A-D-U-L-T → 
Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) → 
But in our case, we have established that A must be in position 2? But in ""ADULT"", A is in position 1? That conflicts with our deduction that A must be in position 2.

Wait a minute! From the feedback of guess 3 (ALOFT): A was in position 1 and got '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, we already knew A not in 3 or 4. So the only position left is position 2.

But in ""ADULT"", A is in position 1, which would be invalid? So we cannot use it if A is not in 2.

Therefore, A must be in position 2. So words like ""ADULT"" are invalid because A is not in position 2.

Similarly, in ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T → A is in position 2 → that is correct.

In ""VAULT"": 
- Position1: V
- Position2: A
- Position3: U
- Position4: L
- Position5: T

Which fits: L is in position 4? And A in 2? 

We know L must be in position 1 or 4? Here it is in 4.

And letters: V, A, U, L, T. Avoids all excluded: C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F are excluded? V,U,T not excluded? T is in, A and L in, U and V are new.

Is ""VAULT"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, are there other words? Like ""HAULT""? Or is it standard? ""HAULT"" may not be common? But ""VAULT"" is acceptable.

What about ""DAUNT"" but N excluded? And not L.

Or ""BAULK"" not ending T.

So ""VAULT"" seems a strong candidate.

But let's check if we have tested V or U? We haven't, so if we choose it, we test them.

But we have only two possibilities: L in position 1 or L in position 4.

But case 1 with L in position 1: we couldn't find a common word? Maybe it's not the case.

Perhaps ""K A L T"" not? Or ""T A L I T"" not?

Another possibility: if L is in position 1, and say position 3 is I, position 4 is M? ""LAMIT"" not word? ""LIMIT"" without A.

Word must have A in position 2? So for case 1: L A * * T.

""L A M M T"" not word? 
""L A D I T"" → ""LADIT"" not word.
""L A G E T"" has E excluded.
""L A B I T"" → ""LABIT"" not? 
""L A U G T"" → ""LAUGT"" not? 
""L A U V T"" → ""LAUVT"" not.

So probably no common English word with L A _ _ T? 

Therefore, L must be in position 4? That leaves us with words of the form _ A _ L T.

Common words: 
- ""HA l T"" not? But ""HALT"" is 4 letters? What 5-letter words?
- ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T
- ""WAILS"" not ending T? ""WAULT"" → archaic? 
- ""JAILT"" not?

Or ""MAST"" 4 letters? ""MALT"" 4? 

But ""VAULT"" is the most common?

Also, ""TAIL"" not? 

Another word: ""GALLT"" not? 

But note: perhaps ""BAILS"" has S? 

I think ""VAULT"" is our best bet. But V is less common? However, it fits.

Perhaps ""HAULT"" is an obsolete form. But in Wordle, it might not be accepted? 

But let's confirm: we are required to have a valid English word.

Another word: ""BADLT"" not? 

""CAVLT"" not.

""DAV I T"" ends with T? D-A-V-I-T → but positions: D(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), T(5). But would L be in this word? No, unless position4 is L? Here it is I? So no L? But we must have L.

In ""DAVIT"", no L? So invalid.

Similarly, ""HABIT"" has B,I,T but no L? And position2 is A? But no L? Must have L.

So for case 2: must have L in position4? So only words like _ A _ L T.

Possible letters: for position1, we can have B,D,G,H,K,M,U,V,W,X,Y? But not C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F.

Position3 must be a vowel? Or consonant? What fits?

Look: words in English ending with ""ALT"": not? With L T at the end? 

Words: ""vault"", ""fault"" (but F excluded), ""gault"" (geological term), ""haunt"" not? ""daunt"" not? 

""VAULT"" and ""GAULT"" are the only ones? 

But ""GAULT"" is G-A-U-L-T? 

Now, in Wordle, is ""GAULT"" accepted? Possibly? But ""VAULT"" is more common? So we should use ""VAULT"" if we can.

But let's see if we haven't excluded V and U.

We haven't guessed V or U? So they are possible.

But we need to decide: perhaps try ""VAULT"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more letters? But we are limited.

Since we have two scenario? But only case 2 seems possible.

But wait, there might be another pattern? We said L must be in position 1 or 4? But position 1 or 4.

Word with L in position 1 and A in position 2: L A * * T → and the only possibility we have is to fill with D and I? But ""L A D I T"" not word? Or ""L A G Y T"" not.

So L must be in position 4? And A in position 2.

Therefore, we must guess a word of that pattern: _ A _ L T.

But if we guess ""VAULT"", and it's correct, we get it. If not, we get feedback.

Another word: ""TAIL T"" not? Or ""EMAIL T"" not? 

What about ""BALKY"" not ending T?

I think we have to go with ""VAULT"".

But let's see if we can guess a word that tests U? Or something else.

Perhaps ""GUILT"" → G-U-I-L-T → but positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5). But then position 2 is U? But we said position 2 must be A? So not ""GUILT"" because A is missing? No, we know A must be in the word and in position 2? So that word has U in 2 instead of A? So it wouldn't have A? Therefore, invalid.

All guesses must include A? And L? And T at the end.

Therefore, guess: VAULT

But note: we are guessing V and U as new letters.

If the word is ""VAULT"", all good.

Otherwise, feedback will help.

Perhaps ""MAUL T""? ""MAULT"" → M-A-U-L-T? That is word? It might be an archaic form? Or variant of malt? Not common. ""VAULT"" is more standard.

So I think ""VAULT"" is the best choice.<thinking>
Feedback summary:
- Guess 1: CRANE → A is misplaced, not in pos 3;
- Guess 2: SPLAT → L misplaced (not pos 3), A misplaced (not pos 4), T correct in pos 5;
- Guess 3: ALOFT → A misplaced (not pos 1), L misplaced (not pos 2), O and F not in word, T correct.

Deductions:
1. T is fixed in position 5.
2. A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → must be in position 2.
3. L cannot be in positions 2, 3 → must be in position 1 or 4 (position 5 is T, so not possible).
4. Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P, O, F.

Thus, secret word format:
- Pos 2: A
- Pos 5: T
- Pos 1: either L or another letter (not excluded)
- Pos 4: L (if pos 1 not L) or another letter
- Pos 3: must be a letter not excluded.

After evaluating possible words:
- If L is in pos 1: pattern L A _ _ T → no common English words found with available letters (avoiding C,R,N,E,S,P,O,F).
- Therefore, L must be in pos 4 → pattern _ A _ L T.

Candidate words matching _ A _ L T:
- ""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T
- Other possibilities like ""GAULT"" exist but ""VAULT"" is the most common and valid word using available letters (V, U not excluded).

Conclusion: 
- ""VAULT"" uses V and U (new letters to test), positions A(2) and L(4) as required.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- Feedback will confirm/dent V and U, and fix positions.

Given the above, ""VAULT"" is the best next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>VAULT</guess><thinking>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- The secret word must end with T (position 5 is confirmed).
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from deductions). Therefore, A must be in position 2.
- L is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, or 3. Since position 5 is T, L must be in position 1 or 4.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, P, O, F.

Given the constraints, the word pattern must be either:
1. L A _ _ T (if L is in position 1), or  
2. _ A _ L T (if L is in position 4).

Upon evaluation, no common English words fit pattern 1 (L A _ _ T) without using excluded letters. Thus, L must be in position 4, making the pattern _ A _ L T.

The only common valid English word fitting this pattern (avoiding excluded letters) is ""VAULT"" (V-A-U-L-T):
- Position 1: V (new letter to test)
- Position 3: U (new letter to test)
- Positions 2 (A) and 4 (L) match the requirements.
- Position 5: T (confirmed).

This guess tests V and U, which haven't been tested yet, and aligns with the deduced position constraints.
