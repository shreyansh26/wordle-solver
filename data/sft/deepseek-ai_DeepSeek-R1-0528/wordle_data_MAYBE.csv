We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

Based on this, I'll select **""CRANE""** because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a balanced word that often reveals useful patterns

This will help me gather initial feedback about which letters are present and their positions, setting me up for efficient subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the correct position)

So we know:
- E is in the word and it is the 5th letter (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know the last letter is E. The word is: ? ? ? ? E

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word that ends with E.

Constraints from the previous feedback:
- Avoid C, R, N (because they are not in the word).
- The word must contain A, but not in position 3 (and of course, since E is in position 5, A cannot be there either).
- Also, avoid using C, R, N anywhere.

We can use other letters. Since A is present but not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain the letter A and do not contain C, R, N.

Common letters that can be used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also want to test other vowels or common consonants to gather more information.

Possible words ending in E that contain A:

- Option 1: ""SAUTE"" - Let's check the letters: S, A, U, T, E. But we don't know about S, U, T. However, if we choose this, note that A is at position 2? In ""saute"", positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And A is not at position 3, so that's okay. But we don't know if A is at position 2? Actually, we don't know where A is exactly, only that it is not at position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But we also have to consider that we want to maximize information. Since E is already fixed at the end, we might want to try other vowels or common letters.

Alternative: ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. Here A is at position 3? In ""plate"", A is at position 3. But wait, our previous feedback said A is not at position 3 (in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not position 3). So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, it would be incorrect because we know it's not in position 3.

We must avoid putting A at position 3.

In ""plate"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that word for A at position 3 because we know the correct position isn't 3.

We need a word that has A but not at position 3 and also not at position 5 because E is there.

So A must be at 1, 2, or 4.

Words ending with E having A at position 1: ""ABATE"", ""ABIDE"" (has B, I, D, E) -- but ""abide"" doesn't have A? A in ""abide"" is at position 1: A, B, I, D, E? Wait, ""abide"" is A-B-I-D-E. So A at position 1.

Similarly, words with A at position 2: ""BAKKE""? Not a word. ""BALDE""? Not a word. ""TABLE"": T-A-B-L-E -> A at position 2.

Or ""SAUCE"" but has C which is banned.

We must avoid C, R, N.

So let's think: 

- With A at position 1: ""ADOBE"" (A at 1, but D,O,B,E) -> valid? ""adobe"" is a word. Letters: A,D,O,B,E. We know E is at 5. So A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But A is at 1? Previous feedback doesn't forbid A at 1? It only said A is not at 3.

But note: in the previous guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. That means A is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, or 4.

So ""adobe"": A at 1 is allowed.

Similarly, words with A at 4: ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E) -> A at position 3? In ""blame"", positions: B1, L2, A3, M4, E5. Again, A at position 3, which we must avoid.

We cannot put A at position 3. So we need A at either 1, 2, or 4.

Examples:

- A at 1: ""ADOBE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ABATE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.

  ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> no C, R, N -> valid.
  ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> valid.

- A at 2: ""TASTE"", ""BASTE"", ""CAUSE"" but C banned -> ""HASTE"" -> H,A,S,T,E. Avoid? S,T,H not banned -> valid.

- A at 4: This is tricky because the last letter is E. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So position 4: the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4. For example, ""BLARE"" has R and is banned? ""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E -> A at position 3? P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> so position 3 again.

Actually, words having the fourth letter as A: for example, ""OILED"" does not have A? Words like ""PALED"": P,A,L,E,D -> A at position 2? Not at 4.

A one with A at position 4: ""LEAVE"": L,E,A,V,E -> but E repeated? We don't know about duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicates. But in this case, ""LEAVE"" has two E's. But our word might have duplicate? However, we don't have information. Also, A is at position 3? L1, E2, A3, V4, E5 -> A at 3 again.

Actually, it's hard to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E. So if A is at position 4, then the word would be ...A E.  For example, ""FALSE"": F1, A2, L3, S4, E5 -> A at 2? Not 4. ""PHASE"": P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> A at 3.

Perhaps ""IZBAL"" is not a word. Actually, let me think: ""MEDIA"": M,E,D,I,A -> but ends with A, not E. Words ending in E: ""PIXIE"" does not have A? ""DEUCE"" no A? 

It appears many words with A in the fourth position end with something else. How about ""LYASE""? That might be too obscure. Or ""KOIAE""? Not words.

Common words: ""ADEEM""? Not common. Actually, let me reconsider: position 4: the letter before E. So if A is at position 4, then the 5th is E: so the word ends in AE. For example, ""GRADE"": G,R,A,D,E -> but R is banned, and A is at position 3? G1, R2, A3, D4, E5. Again, position 3.

I see the pattern: in 5-letter words ending with E, the A is usually not at position 4. Because if you try to put A at position 4, then the word ends in ""AE"". Common words ending in ""AE"" are rare, like ""HYDRAE"" or something, but they are not common.

For example, ""TOLAE"" not a word? Actually, it's easier to have A at position 1 or 2.

So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

In the previous feedback, A was wrongly placed at position 3, so it might be at 1 or 2. Position 4 is unlikely because of word structure.

So for our next guess, we can pick a word that has A at position 1 or 2 and E at position 5, and without C,R,N.

We should also include new letters to test.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: ""ADOBE"": A,D,O,B,E -> tests A at 1, and letters D,O,B.
- ""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

- Position 2: ""TASTE"": T,A,S,T,E -> but T repeated? It has two T's. We might avoid repeats to test more letters? ""PLANE"" has N banned? Not. ""HATES"": H,A,T,E,S -> S and T? ""SHADE"" has H banned? Not. Let's avoid banned letters.

  ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.
  ""CAUSE"" not because C banned -> ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.

But we have S and T? Sure.

Now, we want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In ""crane"", we have used C,R,A,N,E -> so E is known correct, A known present, and C,R,N absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We might try a word that has several of these.

Also, we know E is fixed at end, so we can vary the beginning.

So let's consider:

Option 1: ""ADOBE"" - letters A,D,O,B,E. So we test A (at position 1), D, O, B, and E (which we know). If the secret word has A at position 1, we'll get A marked ✓. If not, but A is in word, we might get A marked - but at wrong position? Actually, if A is not at position 1 in the secret word, but the word has A, then in our guess ""adobe"" having A at 1, it would be marked ""-"" only if A is in the word but not at 1. Similarly for other positions.

However, we don't know the correct position of A, only that it's not position 3.

Option 2: ""ALIVE"" - A,L,I,V,E: tests A at position 1, and L,I,V.

We could also test vowels? U,O,I, etc.

But we have only one more vowel? The word has A and E, but could have others.

Since we have limited guesses, we should prioritize common letters.

Let me think: starting with S might be good? But we don't know S.

Word: ""SAUTE"" -> but A at position 2? S1,A2,U3,T4,E5 -> A at 2? Position 2 is allowed. But ""SAUTE"" has S,U,T, and E. However, we have to avoid banned letters: no C,R,N -> valid.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" has L,A,T,E -> but S at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 in ""slate"", we would get A marked as absent or wrong? Actually, if A is not at position 3, but we put it there, and if the word has A, it might be marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it is marked ""x"", that would tell us A is not at position 3? But we already know it's not at position 3.

But wait: in ""crane"" we had A at position 3 and it was ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. That means if we put A at position 3 again, the feedback will still be ""-"" (if the word has A), because the position is still wrong? Or will it be different if placed at another wrong position? No: ""-"" means letter in word but wrong position. So if we put A at position 3, even though we know it's wrong, we would still get ""-"" if the word has A, but not at 3. That doesn't give us new information about A's position.

So to save a guess, we shouldn't put A at position 3 again. We should put it at either 1, 2, or 4.

In ""ALIVE"": A at position 1 -> safe.

In ""HASTE"": A at position 2 -> safe.

Now, back to the feedback: ""ALIVE"" and ""HASTE"" are both valid options.

Let me also think of ""CAVIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""QUAKE"" but Q and K? And U,A,K,E -> A at position 2? But U and K available.

But Q is less common? We might avoid.

Let's list possible words to consider:

- ""ADOBE"" : A(D)O(B)E -> tests D,O,B
- ""ALIVE"": A(L)I(V)E -> tests L,I,V
- ""ABATE"": A(B)A(T)E -> has two A's? We don't know if there are duplicates. But it might be acceptable.
- ""AGAPE"": A(G)A(P)E -> two A's? Not ideal.

Perhaps words without repeated letters.

Another common word: ""PLATE"" but A at position 3 -> we must avoid, so no.

""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E -> A at position 3 -> avoid.

So ""HASTE"" seems good: H,A,S,T,E -> A at 2? Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5 -> A at position 2.

E is at position 5 already, so no issue.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> same positions: P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

But perhaps we can use ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"".

What about ""DATE""? Only 4 letters? 5-letter word required.

Must be 5 letters.

Another idea: ""AWAKE"": A,W,A,K,...E -> two A's -> A at position 1 and 3? Position 3 is banned? But we have A at position 1 also? In ""AWAKE"": A at 1? Then W at 2, A at 3, K at 4, E at 5. But we cannot have A at position 3 because we know it's not correct. So if we guess ""awake"", the A at position 3 will be marked ""-"" which is redundant? And the A at position 1: if not correct, it will be ""-"", but if correct, ""✓"".

But since we have duplicate, the feedback might be tricky? But it's allowed.

To avoid complication, let's choose words without duplicates for now.

So ""HASTE"": letters H,A,S,T,E -> no duplicates? H, A, S, T, E are all distinct.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> distinct.

""SAUTE"": S,A,U,T,E -> distinct? S,A,U,T,E? Letters: S, A, U, T, E -> distinct.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

In the first guess, we have already tested A and E (one present and correct? E is correct).

Now, for the second guess, we want to test S,H,T,U,P etc.

Perhaps include a vowel that hasn't been tested? We tested A,E (and E is fixed). Vowels left: I,O,U.

If we choose ""SAUTE"", we include U and T,S.

If ""HASTE"", we include H,S,T.

Or if ""ALIVE"", we get L,I,V.

I think ""SAUTE"" might be a good candidate because:

- It has S and T which are very common.

- It has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

- A is at position 2, which we can test.

So let's go with ""SAUTE"".

But we must ensure that U is not banned? We don't know.

Similarly, we can consider ""ALOES"" -> A,L,O,E,S? But E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""ALOES"": A,L,O,E,S -> positions: A1,L2,O3,E4,S5? Not ending with E? We need E at position 5, so words must end with E.

Therefore, ""ALOES"" is not valid because it ends with S.

We need words ending with E.

""HOUSE"" -> ends with E? H,O,U,S,E -> H1,O2,U3,S4,E5. But does it have A? No, but we must include A in our guess because we know A is in the word? Wait, no: we are not required to include A? We can guess without A? But that might be inefficient because we won't get information about A's position.

Actually, we can choose a word that doesn't contain A, but we know A is in the word. But if we don't include A, we might not learn about its position? That seems inefficient.

We should include A to maximize the chance of getting its position right and also test other letters.

So I think it's better to include A in the second guess.

Therefore, let's decide between:

- ""ADOBE"": A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> we test positions 1,2,3,4 with letters A,D,O,B. But O is at position 3? We can test O at position 3.

- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> letters S,A,U,T to test common letters.

- ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

"" SAUTE"" seems good because S and T are common, and U is a vowel.

But let's confirm: since we put A at position 2, and we do not know the correct position of A, but position 2 hasn't been tested.

Similarly, in the first, position 3 was wrong.

I think ""SAUTE"" is reasonable.

We can also think of theme words? But let's stick with common words.

Another: ""PAUSE"" -> P,A,U,S,E -> positions P1,A2,U3,S4,E5. Similar to ""SAUTE"", but replaces T with S? Wait, in ""SAUTE"" we have S,A,U,T,E -> positions S1,A2,U3,T4,E5.

In ""PAUSE"": P1,A2,U3,S4,E5 -> so we test P and S? But T is not tested.

We want to test T? It's common.

But both are fine.

Or ""HASTE"" which has T and S at 4 and 3? H1,A2,S3,T4,E5.

But U is not tested.

I think testing U might be less common than other letters? Maybe prioritize S and T.

In fact, ""SLATE"" would have been good but we cannot because of position 3 of A.

So perhap ""HASTE"" for H,A,S,T,E? Let's see.

With ""SAUTE"": S and T are tested? Also U.

But S and T are high-frequency.

Similarly, with ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> also S and T.

But in ""HASTE"", S is at position 3 and T at 4? And in ""SAUTE"", S at 1, T at 4? U at 3.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a valid word and suitable.

We'll go with ""SAUTE"".

But let me double-check the word: ""saute"" is a word? Yes, from French, meaning to cook quickly in oil.

In English, it is used as a cooking term.

So I'll use that.

Second guess: SAUTE

<guess>saute</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).
- A is present in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect, and position 5 is E).
- Avoid using C, R, or N in the guess.
- Include A in the guess to get more positional information and test other common letters.

For the second guess, I considered words ending in E that include A in position 1, 2, or 4, while introducing new untested letters. Options like ""adobe"" (A at position 1), ""haste"" (A at position 2), and ""saute"" (A at position 2) were evaluated. ""Saute"" was chosen because:
- A is at position 2, testing a new possible location.
- It tests three new common letters: S, U, and T.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (a cooking term).

The goal is to confirm or rule out A's position and gain feedback on S, U, and T.

<guess>saute</guess>",saute,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the correct position)

So we know:
- E is in the word and it is the 5th letter (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know the last letter is E. The word is: ? ? ? ? E

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word that ends with E.

Constraints from the previous feedback:
- Avoid C, R, N (because they are not in the word).
- The word must contain A, but not in position 3 (and of course, since E is in position 5, A cannot be there either).
- Also, avoid using C, R, N anywhere.

We can use other letters. Since A is present but not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain the letter A and do not contain C, R, N.

Common letters that can be used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also want to test other vowels or common consonants to gather more information.

Possible words ending in E that contain A:

- Option 1: ""SAUTE"" - Let's check the letters: S, A, U, T, E. But we don't know about S, U, T. However, if we choose this, note that A is at position 2? In ""saute"", positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And A is not at position 3, so that's okay. But we don't know if A is at position 2? Actually, we don't know where A is exactly, only that it is not at position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But we also have to consider that we want to maximize information. Since E is already fixed at the end, we might want to try other vowels or common letters.

Alternative: ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. Here A is at position 3? In ""plate"", A is at position 3. But wait, our previous feedback said A is not at position 3 (in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not position 3). So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, it would be incorrect because we know it's not in position 3.

We must avoid putting A at position 3.

In ""plate"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that word for A at position 3 because we know the correct position isn't 3.

We need a word that has A but not at position 3 and also not at position 5 because E is there.

So A must be at 1, 2, or 4.

Words ending with E having A at position 1: ""ABATE"", ""ABIDE"" (has B, I, D, E) -- but ""abide"" doesn't have A? A in ""abide"" is at position 1: A, B, I, D, E? Wait, ""abide"" is A-B-I-D-E. So A at position 1.

Similarly, words with A at position 2: ""BAKKE""? Not a word. ""BALDE""? Not a word. ""TABLE"": T-A-B-L-E -> A at position 2.

Or ""SAUCE"" but has C which is banned.

We must avoid C, R, N.

So let's think: 

- With A at position 1: ""ADOBE"" (A at 1, but D,O,B,E) -> valid? ""adobe"" is a word. Letters: A,D,O,B,E. We know E is at 5. So A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But A is at 1? Previous feedback doesn't forbid A at 1? It only said A is not at 3.

But note: in the previous guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. That means A is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, or 4.

So ""adobe"": A at 1 is allowed.

Similarly, words with A at 4: ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E) -> A at position 3? In ""blame"", positions: B1, L2, A3, M4, E5. Again, A at position 3, which we must avoid.

We cannot put A at position 3. So we need A at either 1, 2, or 4.

Examples:

- A at 1: ""ADOBE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ABATE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.

  ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> no C, R, N -> valid.
  ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> valid.

- A at 2: ""TASTE"", ""BASTE"", ""CAUSE"" but C banned -> ""HASTE"" -> H,A,S,T,E. Avoid? S,T,H not banned -> valid.

- A at 4: This is tricky because the last letter is E. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So position 4: the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4. For example, ""BLARE"" has R and is banned? ""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E -> A at position 3? P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> so position 3 again.

Actually, words having the fourth letter as A: for example, ""OILED"" does not have A? Words like ""PALED"": P,A,L,E,D -> A at position 2? Not at 4.

A one with A at position 4: ""LEAVE"": L,E,A,V,E -> but E repeated? We don't know about duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicates. But in this case, ""LEAVE"" has two E's. But our word might have duplicate? However, we don't have information. Also, A is at position 3? L1, E2, A3, V4, E5 -> A at 3 again.

Actually, it's hard to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E. So if A is at position 4, then the word would be ...A E.  For example, ""FALSE"": F1, A2, L3, S4, E5 -> A at 2? Not 4. ""PHASE"": P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> A at 3.

Perhaps ""IZBAL"" is not a word. Actually, let me think: ""MEDIA"": M,E,D,I,A -> but ends with A, not E. Words ending in E: ""PIXIE"" does not have A? ""DEUCE"" no A? 

It appears many words with A in the fourth position end with something else. How about ""LYASE""? That might be too obscure. Or ""KOIAE""? Not words.

Common words: ""ADEEM""? Not common. Actually, let me reconsider: position 4: the letter before E. So if A is at position 4, then the 5th is E: so the word ends in AE. For example, ""GRADE"": G,R,A,D,E -> but R is banned, and A is at position 3? G1, R2, A3, D4, E5. Again, position 3.

I see the pattern: in 5-letter words ending with E, the A is usually not at position 4. Because if you try to put A at position 4, then the word ends in ""AE"". Common words ending in ""AE"" are rare, like ""HYDRAE"" or something, but they are not common.

For example, ""TOLAE"" not a word? Actually, it's easier to have A at position 1 or 2.

So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

In the previous feedback, A was wrongly placed at position 3, so it might be at 1 or 2. Position 4 is unlikely because of word structure.

So for our next guess, we can pick a word that has A at position 1 or 2 and E at position 5, and without C,R,N.

We should also include new letters to test.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: ""ADOBE"": A,D,O,B,E -> tests A at 1, and letters D,O,B.
- ""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

- Position 2: ""TASTE"": T,A,S,T,E -> but T repeated? It has two T's. We might avoid repeats to test more letters? ""PLANE"" has N banned? Not. ""HATES"": H,A,T,E,S -> S and T? ""SHADE"" has H banned? Not. Let's avoid banned letters.

  ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.
  ""CAUSE"" not because C banned -> ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.

But we have S and T? Sure.

Now, we want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In ""crane"", we have used C,R,A,N,E -> so E is known correct, A known present, and C,R,N absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We might try a word that has several of these.

Also, we know E is fixed at end, so we can vary the beginning.

So let's consider:

Option 1: ""ADOBE"" - letters A,D,O,B,E. So we test A (at position 1), D, O, B, and E (which we know). If the secret word has A at position 1, we'll get A marked ✓. If not, but A is in word, we might get A marked - but at wrong position? Actually, if A is not at position 1 in the secret word, but the word has A, then in our guess ""adobe"" having A at 1, it would be marked ""-"" only if A is in the word but not at 1. Similarly for other positions.

However, we don't know the correct position of A, only that it's not position 3.

Option 2: ""ALIVE"" - A,L,I,V,E: tests A at position 1, and L,I,V.

We could also test vowels? U,O,I, etc.

But we have only one more vowel? The word has A and E, but could have others.

Since we have limited guesses, we should prioritize common letters.

Let me think: starting with S might be good? But we don't know S.

Word: ""SAUTE"" -> but A at position 2? S1,A2,U3,T4,E5 -> A at 2? Position 2 is allowed. But ""SAUTE"" has S,U,T, and E. However, we have to avoid banned letters: no C,R,N -> valid.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" has L,A,T,E -> but S at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 in ""slate"", we would get A marked as absent or wrong? Actually, if A is not at position 3, but we put it there, and if the word has A, it might be marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it is marked ""x"", that would tell us A is not at position 3? But we already know it's not at position 3.

But wait: in ""crane"" we had A at position 3 and it was ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. That means if we put A at position 3 again, the feedback will still be ""-"" (if the word has A), because the position is still wrong? Or will it be different if placed at another wrong position? No: ""-"" means letter in word but wrong position. So if we put A at position 3, even though we know it's wrong, we would still get ""-"" if the word has A, but not at 3. That doesn't give us new information about A's position.

So to save a guess, we shouldn't put A at position 3 again. We should put it at either 1, 2, or 4.

In ""ALIVE"": A at position 1 -> safe.

In ""HASTE"": A at position 2 -> safe.

Now, back to the feedback: ""ALIVE"" and ""HASTE"" are both valid options.

Let me also think of ""CAVIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""QUAKE"" but Q and K? And U,A,K,E -> A at position 2? But U and K available.

But Q is less common? We might avoid.

Let's list possible words to consider:

- ""ADOBE"" : A(D)O(B)E -> tests D,O,B
- ""ALIVE"": A(L)I(V)E -> tests L,I,V
- ""ABATE"": A(B)A(T)E -> has two A's? We don't know if there are duplicates. But it might be acceptable.
- ""AGAPE"": A(G)A(P)E -> two A's? Not ideal.

Perhaps words without repeated letters.

Another common word: ""PLATE"" but A at position 3 -> we must avoid, so no.

""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E -> A at position 3 -> avoid.

So ""HASTE"" seems good: H,A,S,T,E -> A at 2? Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5 -> A at position 2.

E is at position 5 already, so no issue.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> same positions: P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

But perhaps we can use ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"".

What about ""DATE""? Only 4 letters? 5-letter word required.

Must be 5 letters.

Another idea: ""AWAKE"": A,W,A,K,...E -> two A's -> A at position 1 and 3? Position 3 is banned? But we have A at position 1 also? In ""AWAKE"": A at 1? Then W at 2, A at 3, K at 4, E at 5. But we cannot have A at position 3 because we know it's not correct. So if we guess ""awake"", the A at position 3 will be marked ""-"" which is redundant? And the A at position 1: if not correct, it will be ""-"", but if correct, ""✓"".

But since we have duplicate, the feedback might be tricky? But it's allowed.

To avoid complication, let's choose words without duplicates for now.

So ""HASTE"": letters H,A,S,T,E -> no duplicates? H, A, S, T, E are all distinct.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> distinct.

""SAUTE"": S,A,U,T,E -> distinct? S,A,U,T,E? Letters: S, A, U, T, E -> distinct.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

In the first guess, we have already tested A and E (one present and correct? E is correct).

Now, for the second guess, we want to test S,H,T,U,P etc.

Perhaps include a vowel that hasn't been tested? We tested A,E (and E is fixed). Vowels left: I,O,U.

If we choose ""SAUTE"", we include U and T,S.

If ""HASTE"", we include H,S,T.

Or if ""ALIVE"", we get L,I,V.

I think ""SAUTE"" might be a good candidate because:

- It has S and T which are very common.

- It has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

- A is at position 2, which we can test.

So let's go with ""SAUTE"".

But we must ensure that U is not banned? We don't know.

Similarly, we can consider ""ALOES"" -> A,L,O,E,S? But E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""ALOES"": A,L,O,E,S -> positions: A1,L2,O3,E4,S5? Not ending with E? We need E at position 5, so words must end with E.

Therefore, ""ALOES"" is not valid because it ends with S.

We need words ending with E.

""HOUSE"" -> ends with E? H,O,U,S,E -> H1,O2,U3,S4,E5. But does it have A? No, but we must include A in our guess because we know A is in the word? Wait, no: we are not required to include A? We can guess without A? But that might be inefficient because we won't get information about A's position.

Actually, we can choose a word that doesn't contain A, but we know A is in the word. But if we don't include A, we might not learn about its position? That seems inefficient.

We should include A to maximize the chance of getting its position right and also test other letters.

So I think it's better to include A in the second guess.

Therefore, let's decide between:

- ""ADOBE"": A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> we test positions 1,2,3,4 with letters A,D,O,B. But O is at position 3? We can test O at position 3.

- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> letters S,A,U,T to test common letters.

- ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

"" SAUTE"" seems good because S and T are common, and U is a vowel.

But let's confirm: since we put A at position 2, and we do not know the correct position of A, but position 2 hasn't been tested.

Similarly, in the first, position 3 was wrong.

I think ""SAUTE"" is reasonable.

We can also think of theme words? But let's stick with common words.

Another: ""PAUSE"" -> P,A,U,S,E -> positions P1,A2,U3,S4,E5. Similar to ""SAUTE"", but replaces T with S? Wait, in ""SAUTE"" we have S,A,U,T,E -> positions S1,A2,U3,T4,E5.

In ""PAUSE"": P1,A2,U3,S4,E5 -> so we test P and S? But T is not tested.

We want to test T? It's common.

But both are fine.

Or ""HASTE"" which has T and S at 4 and 3? H1,A2,S3,T4,E5.

But U is not tested.

I think testing U might be less common than other letters? Maybe prioritize S and T.

In fact, ""SLATE"" would have been good but we cannot because of position 3 of A.

So perhap ""HASTE"" for H,A,S,T,E? Let's see.

With ""SAUTE"": S and T are tested? Also U.

But S and T are high-frequency.

Similarly, with ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> also S and T.

But in ""HASTE"", S is at position 3 and T at 4? And in ""SAUTE"", S at 1, T at 4? U at 3.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a valid word and suitable.

We'll go with ""SAUTE"".

But let me double-check the word: ""saute"" is a word? Yes, from French, meaning to cook quickly in oil.

In English, it is used as a cooking term.

So I'll use that.

Second guess: SAUTE

<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).
- A is present in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect, and position 5 is E).
- Avoid using C, R, or N in the guess.
- Include A in the guess to get more positional information and test other common letters.

For the second guess, I considered words ending in E that include A in position 1, 2, or 4, while introducing new untested letters. Options like ""adobe"" (A at position 1), ""haste"" (A at position 2), and ""saute"" (A at position 2) were evaluated. ""Saute"" was chosen because:
- A is at position 2, testing a new possible location.
- It tests three new common letters: S, U, and T.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (a cooking term).

The goal is to confirm or rule out A's position and gain feedback on S, U, and T.",Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

Based on this, I'll select **""CRANE""** because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a balanced word that often reveals useful patterns

This will help me gather initial feedback about which letters are present and their positions, setting me up for efficient subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the correct position)

So we know:
- E is in the word and it is the 5th letter (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know the last letter is E. The word is: ? ? ? ? E

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word that ends with E.

Constraints from the previous feedback:
- Avoid C, R, N (because they are not in the word).
- The word must contain A, but not in position 3 (and of course, since E is in position 5, A cannot be there either).
- Also, avoid using C, R, N anywhere.

We can use other letters. Since A is present but not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain the letter A and do not contain C, R, N.

Common letters that can be used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also want to test other vowels or common consonants to gather more information.

Possible words ending in E that contain A:

- Option 1: ""SAUTE"" - Let's check the letters: S, A, U, T, E. But we don't know about S, U, T. However, if we choose this, note that A is at position 2? In ""saute"", positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And A is not at position 3, so that's okay. But we don't know if A is at position 2? Actually, we don't know where A is exactly, only that it is not at position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But we also have to consider that we want to maximize information. Since E is already fixed at the end, we might want to try other vowels or common letters.

Alternative: ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. Here A is at position 3? In ""plate"", A is at position 3. But wait, our previous feedback said A is not at position 3 (in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not position 3). So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, it would be incorrect because we know it's not in position 3.

We must avoid putting A at position 3.

In ""plate"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that word for A at position 3 because we know the correct position isn't 3.

We need a word that has A but not at position 3 and also not at position 5 because E is there.

So A must be at 1, 2, or 4.

Words ending with E having A at position 1: ""ABATE"", ""ABIDE"" (has B, I, D, E) -- but ""abide"" doesn't have A? A in ""abide"" is at position 1: A, B, I, D, E? Wait, ""abide"" is A-B-I-D-E. So A at position 1.

Similarly, words with A at position 2: ""BAKKE""? Not a word. ""BALDE""? Not a word. ""TABLE"": T-A-B-L-E -> A at position 2.

Or ""SAUCE"" but has C which is banned.

We must avoid C, R, N.

So let's think: 

- With A at position 1: ""ADOBE"" (A at 1, but D,O,B,E) -> valid? ""adobe"" is a word. Letters: A,D,O,B,E. We know E is at 5. So A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But A is at 1? Previous feedback doesn't forbid A at 1? It only said A is not at 3.

But note: in the previous guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. That means A is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, or 4.

So ""adobe"": A at 1 is allowed.

Similarly, words with A at 4: ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E) -> A at position 3? In ""blame"", positions: B1, L2, A3, M4, E5. Again, A at position 3, which we must avoid.

We cannot put A at position 3. So we need A at either 1, 2, or 4.

Examples:

- A at 1: ""ADOBE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ABATE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.

  ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> no C, R, N -> valid.
  ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> valid.

- A at 2: ""TASTE"", ""BASTE"", ""CAUSE"" but C banned -> ""HASTE"" -> H,A,S,T,E. Avoid? S,T,H not banned -> valid.

- A at 4: This is tricky because the last letter is E. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So position 4: the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4. For example, ""BLARE"" has R and is banned? ""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E -> A at position 3? P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> so position 3 again.

Actually, words having the fourth letter as A: for example, ""OILED"" does not have A? Words like ""PALED"": P,A,L,E,D -> A at position 2? Not at 4.

A one with A at position 4: ""LEAVE"": L,E,A,V,E -> but E repeated? We don't know about duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicates. But in this case, ""LEAVE"" has two E's. But our word might have duplicate? However, we don't have information. Also, A is at position 3? L1, E2, A3, V4, E5 -> A at 3 again.

Actually, it's hard to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E. So if A is at position 4, then the word would be ...A E.  For example, ""FALSE"": F1, A2, L3, S4, E5 -> A at 2? Not 4. ""PHASE"": P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> A at 3.

Perhaps ""IZBAL"" is not a word. Actually, let me think: ""MEDIA"": M,E,D,I,A -> but ends with A, not E. Words ending in E: ""PIXIE"" does not have A? ""DEUCE"" no A? 

It appears many words with A in the fourth position end with something else. How about ""LYASE""? That might be too obscure. Or ""KOIAE""? Not words.

Common words: ""ADEEM""? Not common. Actually, let me reconsider: position 4: the letter before E. So if A is at position 4, then the 5th is E: so the word ends in AE. For example, ""GRADE"": G,R,A,D,E -> but R is banned, and A is at position 3? G1, R2, A3, D4, E5. Again, position 3.

I see the pattern: in 5-letter words ending with E, the A is usually not at position 4. Because if you try to put A at position 4, then the word ends in ""AE"". Common words ending in ""AE"" are rare, like ""HYDRAE"" or something, but they are not common.

For example, ""TOLAE"" not a word? Actually, it's easier to have A at position 1 or 2.

So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

In the previous feedback, A was wrongly placed at position 3, so it might be at 1 or 2. Position 4 is unlikely because of word structure.

So for our next guess, we can pick a word that has A at position 1 or 2 and E at position 5, and without C,R,N.

We should also include new letters to test.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: ""ADOBE"": A,D,O,B,E -> tests A at 1, and letters D,O,B.
- ""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

- Position 2: ""TASTE"": T,A,S,T,E -> but T repeated? It has two T's. We might avoid repeats to test more letters? ""PLANE"" has N banned? Not. ""HATES"": H,A,T,E,S -> S and T? ""SHADE"" has H banned? Not. Let's avoid banned letters.

  ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.
  ""CAUSE"" not because C banned -> ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.

But we have S and T? Sure.

Now, we want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In ""crane"", we have used C,R,A,N,E -> so E is known correct, A known present, and C,R,N absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We might try a word that has several of these.

Also, we know E is fixed at end, so we can vary the beginning.

So let's consider:

Option 1: ""ADOBE"" - letters A,D,O,B,E. So we test A (at position 1), D, O, B, and E (which we know). If the secret word has A at position 1, we'll get A marked ✓. If not, but A is in word, we might get A marked - but at wrong position? Actually, if A is not at position 1 in the secret word, but the word has A, then in our guess ""adobe"" having A at 1, it would be marked ""-"" only if A is in the word but not at 1. Similarly for other positions.

However, we don't know the correct position of A, only that it's not position 3.

Option 2: ""ALIVE"" - A,L,I,V,E: tests A at position 1, and L,I,V.

We could also test vowels? U,O,I, etc.

But we have only one more vowel? The word has A and E, but could have others.

Since we have limited guesses, we should prioritize common letters.

Let me think: starting with S might be good? But we don't know S.

Word: ""SAUTE"" -> but A at position 2? S1,A2,U3,T4,E5 -> A at 2? Position 2 is allowed. But ""SAUTE"" has S,U,T, and E. However, we have to avoid banned letters: no C,R,N -> valid.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" has L,A,T,E -> but S at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 in ""slate"", we would get A marked as absent or wrong? Actually, if A is not at position 3, but we put it there, and if the word has A, it might be marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it is marked ""x"", that would tell us A is not at position 3? But we already know it's not at position 3.

But wait: in ""crane"" we had A at position 3 and it was ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. That means if we put A at position 3 again, the feedback will still be ""-"" (if the word has A), because the position is still wrong? Or will it be different if placed at another wrong position? No: ""-"" means letter in word but wrong position. So if we put A at position 3, even though we know it's wrong, we would still get ""-"" if the word has A, but not at 3. That doesn't give us new information about A's position.

So to save a guess, we shouldn't put A at position 3 again. We should put it at either 1, 2, or 4.

In ""ALIVE"": A at position 1 -> safe.

In ""HASTE"": A at position 2 -> safe.

Now, back to the feedback: ""ALIVE"" and ""HASTE"" are both valid options.

Let me also think of ""CAVIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""QUAKE"" but Q and K? And U,A,K,E -> A at position 2? But U and K available.

But Q is less common? We might avoid.

Let's list possible words to consider:

- ""ADOBE"" : A(D)O(B)E -> tests D,O,B
- ""ALIVE"": A(L)I(V)E -> tests L,I,V
- ""ABATE"": A(B)A(T)E -> has two A's? We don't know if there are duplicates. But it might be acceptable.
- ""AGAPE"": A(G)A(P)E -> two A's? Not ideal.

Perhaps words without repeated letters.

Another common word: ""PLATE"" but A at position 3 -> we must avoid, so no.

""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E -> A at position 3 -> avoid.

So ""HASTE"" seems good: H,A,S,T,E -> A at 2? Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5 -> A at position 2.

E is at position 5 already, so no issue.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> same positions: P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

But perhaps we can use ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"".

What about ""DATE""? Only 4 letters? 5-letter word required.

Must be 5 letters.

Another idea: ""AWAKE"": A,W,A,K,...E -> two A's -> A at position 1 and 3? Position 3 is banned? But we have A at position 1 also? In ""AWAKE"": A at 1? Then W at 2, A at 3, K at 4, E at 5. But we cannot have A at position 3 because we know it's not correct. So if we guess ""awake"", the A at position 3 will be marked ""-"" which is redundant? And the A at position 1: if not correct, it will be ""-"", but if correct, ""✓"".

But since we have duplicate, the feedback might be tricky? But it's allowed.

To avoid complication, let's choose words without duplicates for now.

So ""HASTE"": letters H,A,S,T,E -> no duplicates? H, A, S, T, E are all distinct.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> distinct.

""SAUTE"": S,A,U,T,E -> distinct? S,A,U,T,E? Letters: S, A, U, T, E -> distinct.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

In the first guess, we have already tested A and E (one present and correct? E is correct).

Now, for the second guess, we want to test S,H,T,U,P etc.

Perhaps include a vowel that hasn't been tested? We tested A,E (and E is fixed). Vowels left: I,O,U.

If we choose ""SAUTE"", we include U and T,S.

If ""HASTE"", we include H,S,T.

Or if ""ALIVE"", we get L,I,V.

I think ""SAUTE"" might be a good candidate because:

- It has S and T which are very common.

- It has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

- A is at position 2, which we can test.

So let's go with ""SAUTE"".

But we must ensure that U is not banned? We don't know.

Similarly, we can consider ""ALOES"" -> A,L,O,E,S? But E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""ALOES"": A,L,O,E,S -> positions: A1,L2,O3,E4,S5? Not ending with E? We need E at position 5, so words must end with E.

Therefore, ""ALOES"" is not valid because it ends with S.

We need words ending with E.

""HOUSE"" -> ends with E? H,O,U,S,E -> H1,O2,U3,S4,E5. But does it have A? No, but we must include A in our guess because we know A is in the word? Wait, no: we are not required to include A? We can guess without A? But that might be inefficient because we won't get information about A's position.

Actually, we can choose a word that doesn't contain A, but we know A is in the word. But if we don't include A, we might not learn about its position? That seems inefficient.

We should include A to maximize the chance of getting its position right and also test other letters.

So I think it's better to include A in the second guess.

Therefore, let's decide between:

- ""ADOBE"": A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> we test positions 1,2,3,4 with letters A,D,O,B. But O is at position 3? We can test O at position 3.

- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> letters S,A,U,T to test common letters.

- ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

"" SAUTE"" seems good because S and T are common, and U is a vowel.

But let's confirm: since we put A at position 2, and we do not know the correct position of A, but position 2 hasn't been tested.

Similarly, in the first, position 3 was wrong.

I think ""SAUTE"" is reasonable.

We can also think of theme words? But let's stick with common words.

Another: ""PAUSE"" -> P,A,U,S,E -> positions P1,A2,U3,S4,E5. Similar to ""SAUTE"", but replaces T with S? Wait, in ""SAUTE"" we have S,A,U,T,E -> positions S1,A2,U3,T4,E5.

In ""PAUSE"": P1,A2,U3,S4,E5 -> so we test P and S? But T is not tested.

We want to test T? It's common.

But both are fine.

Or ""HASTE"" which has T and S at 4 and 3? H1,A2,S3,T4,E5.

But U is not tested.

I think testing U might be less common than other letters? Maybe prioritize S and T.

In fact, ""SLATE"" would have been good but we cannot because of position 3 of A.

So perhap ""HASTE"" for H,A,S,T,E? Let's see.

With ""SAUTE"": S and T are tested? Also U.

But S and T are high-frequency.

Similarly, with ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> also S and T.

But in ""HASTE"", S is at position 3 and T at 4? And in ""SAUTE"", S at 1, T at 4? U at 3.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a valid word and suitable.

We'll go with ""SAUTE"".

But let me double-check the word: ""saute"" is a word? Yes, from French, meaning to cook quickly in oil.

In English, it is used as a cooking term.

So I'll use that.

Second guess: SAUTE

<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).
- A is present in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect, and position 5 is E).
- Avoid using C, R, or N in the guess.
- Include A in the guess to get more positional information and test other common letters.

For the second guess, I considered words ending in E that include A in position 1, 2, or 4, while introducing new untested letters. Options like ""adobe"" (A at position 1), ""haste"" (A at position 2), and ""saute"" (A at position 2) were evaluated. ""Saute"" was chosen because:
- A is at position 2, testing a new possible location.
- It tests three new common letters: S, U, and T.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (a cooking term).

The goal is to confirm or rule out A's position and gain feedback on S, U, and T.

So position 2 is possible.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we want to maximize information. Since E is already fixed at the end, we might want to try other vowels or common letters.\n\nAlternative: ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. Here A is at position 3? In ""plate"", A is at position 3.

So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, it would be incorrect because we know it\'s not in position 3.\n\nWe must avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nIn ""plate"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that word for A at position 3 because we know the correct position isn\'t 3.\n\nWe need a word that has A but not at position 3 and also not at position 5 because E is there.\n\nSo A must be at 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWords ending with E having A at position 1: ""ABATE"", ""ABIDE"" (has B, I, D, E) -- but ""abide"" doesn\'t have A? A in ""abide"" is at position 1: A, B, I, D, E? Wait, ""abide"" is A-B-I-D-E. So A at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, words with A at position 2: ""BAKKE""? Not a word. ""BALDE""? Not a word. ""TABLE"": T-A-B-L-E -> A at position 2.\n\nOr ""SAUCE"" but has C which is banned.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo let\'s think: \n\n- With A at position 1: ""ADOBE"" (A at 1, but D,O,B,E) -> valid? ""adobe"" is a word. Letters: A,D,O,B,E. We know E is at 5. So A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But A is at 1? Previous feedback doesn\'t forbid A at 1? It only said A is not at 3.\n\nBut note: in the previous guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. That means A is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSo ""adobe"": A at 1 is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, words with A at 4: ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E) -> A at position 3? In ""blame"", positions: B1, L2, A3, M4, E5. Again, A at position 3, which we must avoid.\n\nWe cannot put A at position 3. So we need A at either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nExamples:\n\n- A at 1: ""ADOBE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ABATE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.\n\n  ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> no C, R, N -> valid.\n  ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> valid.\n\n- A at 2: ""TASTE"", ""BASTE"", ""CAUSE"" but C banned -> ""HASTE"" -> H,A,S,T,E. Avoid? S,T,H not banned -> valid.\n\n- A at 4: This is tricky because the last letter is E. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So position 4: the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4. For example, ""BLARE"" has R and is banned? ""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E -> A at position 3? P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> so position 3 again.\n\nActually, words having the fourth letter as A: for example, ""OILED"" does not have A? Words like ""PALED"": P,A,L,E,D -> A at position 2? Not at 4.\n\nA one with A at position 4: ""LEAVE"": L,E,A,V,E -> but E repeated? We don\'t know about duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say anything about duplicates. But in this case, ""LEAVE"" has two E\'s. But our word might have duplicate? However, we don\'t have information. Also, A is at position 3? L1, E2, A3, V4, E5 -> A at 3 again.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E. So if A is at position 4, then the word would be ...A E.  For example, ""FALSE"": F1, A2, L3, S4, E5 -> A at 2? Not 4. ""PHASE"": P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> A at 3.\n\nPerhaps ""IZBAL"" is not a word. Actually, let me think: ""MEDIA"": M,E,D,I,A -> but ends with A, not E. Words ending in E: ""PIXIE"" does not have A? ""DEUCE"" no A? \n\nIt appears many words with A in the fourth position end with something else. How about ""LYASE""? That might be too obscure. Or ""KOIAE""? Not words.\n\nCommon words: ""ADEEM""? Not common. Actually, let me reconsider: position 4: the letter before E. So if A is at position 4, then the 5th is E: so the word ends in AE. For example, ""GRADE"": G,R,A,D,E -> but R is banned, and A is at position 3? G1, R2, A3, D4, E5. Again, position 3.\n\nI see the pattern: in 5-letter words ending with E, the A is usually not at position 4. Because if you try to put A at position 4, then the word ends in ""AE"".

It has two T\'s. We might avoid repeats to test more letters? ""PLANE"" has N banned? Not. ""HATES"": H,A,T,E,S -> S and T? ""SHADE"" has H banned? Not. Let\'s avoid banned letters.\n\n  ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.\n  ""CAUSE"" not because C banned -> ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.\n\nBut we have S and T? Sure.\n\nNow, we want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nIn ""crane"", we have used C,R,A,N,E -> so E is known correct, A known present, and C,R,N absent.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nWe might try a word that has several of these.\n\nAlso, we know E is fixed at end, so we can vary the beginning.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n\nOption 1: ""ADOBE"" - letters A,D,O,B,E.

Similarly for other positions.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know the correct position of A, only that it\'s not position 3.\n\nOption 2: ""ALIVE"" - A,L,I,V,E: tests A at position 1, and L,I,V.\n\nWe could also test vowels? U,O,I, etc.\n\nBut we have only one more vowel? The word has A and E, but could have others.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should prioritize common letters.\n\nLet me think: starting with S might be good? But we don\'t know S.\n\nWord: ""SAUTE"" -> but A at position 2? S1,A2,U3,T4,E5 -> A at 2? Position 2 is allowed. But ""SAUTE"" has S,U,T, and E. However, we have to avoid banned letters: no C,R,N -> valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"" has L,A,T,E -> but S at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 in ""slate"", we would get A marked as absent or wrong? Actually, if A is not at position 3, but we put it there, and if the word has A, it might be marked ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position? Or if it is marked ""x"", that would tell us A is not at position 3? But we already know it\'s not at position 3.\n\nBut wait: in ""crane"" we had A at position 3 and it was ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. That means if we put A at position 3 again, the feedback will still be ""-"" (if the word has A), because the position is still wrong? Or will it be different if placed at another wrong position? No: ""-"" means letter in word but wrong position. So if we put A at position 3, even though we know it\'s wrong, we would still get ""-"" if the word has A, but not at 3. That doesn\'t give us new information about A\'s position.\n\nSo to save a guess, we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again. We should put it at either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nIn ""ALIVE"": A at position 1 -> safe.\n\nIn ""HASTE"": A at position 2 -> safe.\n\nNow, back to the feedback: ""ALIVE"" and ""HASTE"" are both valid options.\n\nLet me also think of ""CAVIE"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""QUAKE"" but Q and K? And U,A,K,E -> A at position 2? But U and K available.\n\nBut Q is less common? We might avoid.\n\nLet\'s list possible words to consider:\n\n- ""ADOBE"" : A(D)O(B)E -> tests D,O,B\n- ""ALIVE"": A(L)I(V)E -> tests L,I,V\n- ""ABATE"": A(B)A(T)E -> has two A\'s?

Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5 -> A at position 2.\n\nE is at position 5 already, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> same positions: P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.\n\nBut perhaps we can use ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"".\n\nWhat about ""DATE""? Only 4 letters? 5-letter word required.\n\nMust be 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""AWAKE"": A,W,A,K,...E -> two A\'s -> A at position 1 and 3? Position 3 is banned? But we have A at position 1 also? In ""AWAKE"": A at 1? Then W at 2, A at 3, K at 4, E at 5. But we cannot have A at position 3 because we know it\'s not correct. So if we guess ""awake"", the A at position 3 will be marked ""-"" which is redundant? And the A at position 1: if not correct, it will be ""-"", but if correct, ""✓"".\n\nBut since we have duplicate, the feedback might be tricky? But it\'s allowed.\n\nTo avoid complication, let\'s choose words without duplicates for now.\n\nSo ""HASTE"": letters H,A,S,T,E -> no duplicates? H, A, S, T, E are all distinct.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> distinct.\n\n""SAUTE"": S,A,U,T,E -> distinct? S,A,U,T,E? Letters: S, A, U, T, E -> distinct.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.\n\nIn the first guess, we have already tested A and E (one present and correct? E is correct).\n\nNow, for the second guess, we want to test S,H,T,U,P etc.\n\nPerhaps include a vowel that hasn\'t been tested? We tested A,E (and E is fixed). Vowels left: I,O,U.\n\nIf we choose ""SAUTE"", we include U and T,S.\n\nIf ""HASTE"", we include H,S,T.\n\nOr if ""ALIVE"", we get L,I,V.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" might be a good candidate because:\n\n- It has S and T which are very common.\n\n- It has U, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n- A is at position 2, which we can test.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SAUTE"".\n\nBut we must ensure that U is not banned? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider ""ALOES"" -> A,L,O,E,S? But E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""ALOES"": A,L,O,E,S -> positions: A1,L2,O3,E4,S5? Not ending with E? We need E at position 5, so words must end with E.\n\nTherefore, ""ALOES"" is not valid because it ends with S.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\n""HOUSE"" -> ends with E? H,O,U,S,E -> H1,O2,U3,S4,E5. But does it have A? No, but we must include A in our guess because we know A is in the word? Wait, no: we are not required to include A? We can guess without A? But that might be inefficient because we won\'t get information about A\'s position.\n\nActually, we can choose a word that doesn\'t contain A, but we know A is in the word. But if we don\'t include A, we might not learn about its position? That seems inefficient.\n\nWe should include A to maximize the chance of getting its position right and also test other letters.\n\nSo I think it\'s better to include A in the second guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s decide between:\n\n- ""ADOBE"": A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> we test positions 1,2,3,4 with letters A,D,O,B. But O is at position 3? We can test O at position 3.\n\n- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> letters S,A,U,T to test common letters.\n\n- ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.\n\n"" SAUTE"" seems good because S and T are common, and U is a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: since we put A at position 2, and we do not know the correct position of A, but position 2 hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSimilarly, in the first, position 3 was wrong.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is reasonable.\n\nWe can also think of theme words? But let\'s stick with common words.\n\nAnother: ""PAUSE"" -> P,A,U,S,E -> positions P1,A2,U3,S4,E5. Similar to ""SAUTE"", but replaces T with S? Wait, in ""SAUTE"" we have S,A,U,T,E -> positions S1,A2,U3,T4,E5.\n\nIn ""PAUSE"": P1,A2,U3,S4,E5 -> so we test P and S? But T is not tested.\n\nWe want to test T? It\'s common.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nOr ""HASTE"" which has T and S at 4 and 3? H1,A2,S3,T4,E5.\n\nBut U is not tested.\n\nI think testing U might be less common than other letters? Maybe prioritize S and T.\n\nIn fact, ""SLATE"" would have been good but we cannot because of position 3 of A.\n\nSo perhap ""HASTE"" for H,A,S,T,E? Let\'s see.\n\nWith ""SAUTE"": S and T are tested? Also U.\n\nBut S and T are high-frequency.\n\nSimilarly, with ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> also S and T.\n\nBut in ""HASTE"", S is at position 3 and T at 4? And in ""SAUTE"", S at 1, T at 4? U at 3.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is a valid word and suitable.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""SAUTE"".\n\nBut let me double-check the word: ""saute"" is a word? Yes, from French, meaning to cook quickly in oil.\n\nIn English, it is used as a cooking term.\n\nSo I\'ll use that.\n\nSecond guess: SAUTE\n\n<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).\n- A is present in the word but not at position 3 (-).\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect, and position 5 is E).\n- Avoid using C, R, or N in the guess.\n- Include A in the guess to get more positional information and test other common letters.\n\nFor the second guess, I considered words ending in E that include A in position 1, 2, or 4, while introducing new untested letters. Options like ""adobe"" (A at position 1), ""haste"" (A at position 2), and ""saute"" (A at position 2) were evaluated. ""Saute"" was chosen because:\n- A is at position 2, testing a new possible location.\n- It tests three new common letters: S, U, and T.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word (a cooking term).\n\nThe goal is to confirm or rule out A\'s position and gain feedback on S, U, and T.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)
- U: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E
- We have confirmed that A is at position 2 (from the second guess).
- We know that C, R, N, S, U, T are not in the word (from the x's in both guesses).
- The only letter that is in the word but not in the correct position from the first guess was A, but now we know A is at position 2, so that is resolved.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ E

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We must avoid these letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now A is at position 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses only the remaining possible letters.

We have to consider what letters are still available. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have eliminated 6: C, R, N, S, U, T.

So available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and E are already in the word, so they can appear again? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are duplicate letters. We have to consider the possibility of duplicates, but since we don't have evidence, we might assume no duplicates for now to simplify.

In the pattern, we have A at position 2 and E at position 5. So positions 1, 3, and 4 are open.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters from the available set, avoiding the banned letters.

We should choose a word that tests common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters: L, I, O, P, M, B, D, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

Examples:
- ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> but E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. So ""BAKED"" is B1,A2,K3,E4,D5 -> but position 5 is D, not E. So no.
- ""BALED"": B A L E D -> positions: B1, A2, L3, E4, D5 -> again, E at 4, not 5.
- ""BAKEE"" not a word.

We need the word to end with E, so the last letter must be E.

So pattern: _ A _ _ E

Words:
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> M1, A2, P3, L4, E5 -> this fits. Letters: M, A, P, L, E. Check banned: M, P, L are not in the banned list (C,R,N,S,U,T). So valid.
- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T is banned (from second guess, T is x). So invalid.
- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> G1, A2, B3, L4, E5. Banned? G, B, L not banned? T is banned, but not used. So valid.
- ""HALVE"": H A L V E -> H1, A2, L3, V4, E5. Valid.
- ""PALME"" not common? ""PALME"" might not be a word; ""PALM"" is 4 letters. ""PALED"" has E at 4? No.

Other words: ""DANCE"" but C and N banned? C and N are banned.

""LANCE"" similarly banned.

""FABLE"": F A B L E -> F1, A2, B3, L4, E5. Valid.

""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> M1, A2, Y3, B4, E5. Valid.

We need to choose one that tests common letters and might give us more information.

We have positions 1, 3, and 4 to fill.

We should try to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

In the first two guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

So tested letters: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, U.

A and E are in the word, the others are not.

So untested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common untested letters as possible.

For the third guess, we can choose a word that has several of these.

For example, ""MAPLE"" has M, P, L.

""GABLE"" has G, B, L.

""HALVE"" has H, L, V.

""MAYBE"" has M, Y, B.

""FABLE"" has F, B, L.

""BAYLE"" not a word.

""JAZZE"" not a word.

""VALVE"" has V, A, L, V, E -> but V repeated? And A is already at position 2, so if we put V at position 3 and 4? But we don't know about duplicates.

But ""VALVE"" has two V's, which might not be efficient for testing.

Similarly, ""MAJOR"" does not end with E.

We need to end with E.

Another word: ""AMPLE"" -> A M P L E -> but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. ""AMPLE"" is A1,M2,P3,L4,E5 -> not matching pattern.

We need A at position 2.

So back to the pattern.

Let me list possible words:

- MAPLE: M A P L E
- GABLE: G A B L E
- FABLE: F A B L E
- HALVE: H A L V E
- MAIZE: M A I Z E -> M1, A2, I3, Z4, E5. Z is less common? But valid.
- PASTE: but S and T banned? S and T are banned, so no.
- WAIVE: W A I V E -> W1, A2, I3, V4, E5. Valid.

Now, we need to choose one that has common letters and might help us narrow down.

Since we have three positions to fill, and we have limited guesses, we should aim for a word that, based on feedback, can lead us to the solution.

But we don't have much information about the remaining letters.

Perhaps we can choose a word that includes vowels or common consonants.

For example, ""MAPLE"" tests M, P, L.

""GABLE"" tests G, B, L.

""FABLE"" tests F, B, L.

""HALVE"" tests H, L, V.

""WAIVE"" tests W, I, V.

""MAYBE"" tests M, Y, B.

I think ""MAPLE"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, P, L.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" is also common.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that in position 1, common letters are consonants like B, H, M, P, etc.

In position 3, common letters could be vowels or consonants.

In position 4, common letters for ending.

But let's pick ""MAPLE"" as the next guess.

So guess: MAPLE

But we must ensure that we are not using banned letters. M, A, P, L, E. A and E are known, M, P, L are not banned. So yes.

If we guess ""MAPLE"", and the word is ""MAPLE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on M, P, L.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"", we test G, B, L.

But ""MAPLE"" might be more common? Both are valid.

Another word: ""BAYLE"" not a word.

""KAPOK"" not ending with E.

I think ""MAPLE"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more vowels. For example, ""HAZEL"" but H A Z E L -> positions: H1, A2, Z3, E4, L5 -> but we need E at position 5, so L5? Not E. So no.

""HASTE"" but S and T banned.

So I think ""MAPLE"" is a good choice.

We'll go with ""MAPLE"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  
    - A is in the word but not at position 3.  
    - C, R, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""saute""**  
  - S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.  
    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  
    - S, U, and T are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Position 2 is A.  
   - Position 5 is E.  
   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ A _ _ E`.  
   - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, N (from Guess 1), and S, U, T (from Guess 2) are not in the word.  
   - Total excluded: C, R, N, S, U, T.  

3. **Included Letters**:  
   - A and E are confirmed in the word (A at position 2, E at position 5).  
   - No duplicates are indicated yet, but we cannot rule them out.  

4. **Available Letters**:  
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Remaining vowels: I, O (since A and E are already placed).  

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Focus on words matching `_ A _ _ E`.  
   - Test high-frequency letters not yet used (e.g., L, M, P, B, D, G, I, O) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).  
   - Prioritize common words to increase the chance of hitting correct letters/positions.  

### Evaluation of Possible Words:
- **Good candidates** must fit `_ A _ _ E` and use available letters. Examples:  
  - ""MAPLE"" (M A P L E): Tests M, P, L—common letters.  
  - ""GABLE"" (G A B L E): Tests G, B, L.  
  - ""HALVE"" (H A L V E): Tests H, L, V.  
  - ""FABLE"" (F A B L E): Tests F, B, L.  
- **Why ""MAPLE"" is a strong choice**:  
  - Uses M, P, L—all high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on M (position 1), P (position 3), and L (position 4) will significantly narrow possibilities.  
  - Common word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

### Next Guess: ""MAPLE""
This guess tests three new letters in key positions and aligns with the known pattern. If correct, we solve the puzzle; if not, feedback will provide critical clues for the next guess.

<guess>maple</guess>",maple,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""

- ""HALVE"": H A L V E -> H1, A2, L3, V4, E5. Valid.
- ""PALME"" not common? ""PALME"" might not be a word; ""PALM"" is 4 letters. ""PALED"" has E at 4? No.

""FABLE"": F A B L E -> F1, A2, B3, L4, E5. Valid.

""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> M1, A2, Y3, B4, E5. Valid.

We should try to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

In the first two guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

So tested letters: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, U.

So untested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to end with E.

Another word: ""AMPLE"" -> A M P L E -> but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. ""AMPLE"" is A1,M2,P3,L4,E5 -> not matching pattern.

We need A at position 2.

So back to the pattern.

Let me list possible words:

- MAPLE: M A P L E
- GABLE: G A B L E
- FABLE: F A B L E
- HALVE: H A L V E

We'll go with ""MAPLE"".

   - C, R, N (from Guess 1), and S, U, T (from Guess 2) are not in the word.  
   - Total excluded: C, R, N, S, U, T.  

3. **Included Letters**:  
   - A and E are confirmed in the word (A at position 2, E at position 5).  
   - No duplicates are indicated yet, but we cannot rule them out.  

4. **Available Letters**:  
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Remaining vowels: I, O (since A and E are already placed).  

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Focus on words matching `_ A _ _ E`.  
   - Test high-frequency letters not yet used (e.g., L, M, P, B, D, G, I, O) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).  
   - Prioritize common words to increase the chance of hitting correct letters/positions.  

### Evaluation of Possible Words:
- **Good candidates** must fit `_ A _ _ E` and use available letters. Examples:  
  - ""MAPLE"" (M A P L E): Tests M, P, L—common letters.  
  - ""GABLE"" (G A B L E): Tests G, B, L.  
  - ""HALVE"" (H A L V E): Tests H, L, V.  
  - ""FABLE"" (F A B L E): Tests F, B, L.  
- **Why ""MAPLE"" is a strong choice**:  
  - Uses M, P, L—all high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on M (position 1), P (position 3), and L (position 4) will significantly narrow possibilities.  
  - Common word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

### Next Guess: ""MAPLE""
This guess tests three new letters in key positions and aligns with the known pattern. If correct, we solve the puzzle; if not, feedback will provide critical clues for the next guess.",Guess 3: maple -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) P(x) L(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,MAYBE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

Based on this, I'll select **""CRANE""** because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a balanced word that often reveals useful patterns

This will help me gather initial feedback about which letters are present and their positions, setting me up for efficient subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the correct position)

So we know:
- E is in the word and it is the 5th letter (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know the last letter is E. The word is: ? ? ? ? E

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word that ends with E.

Constraints from the previous feedback:
- Avoid C, R, N (because they are not in the word).
- The word must contain A, but not in position 3 (and of course, since E is in position 5, A cannot be there either).
- Also, avoid using C, R, N anywhere.

We can use other letters. Since A is present but not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain the letter A and do not contain C, R, N.

Common letters that can be used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also want to test other vowels or common consonants to gather more information.

Possible words ending in E that contain A:

- Option 1: ""SAUTE"" - Let's check the letters: S, A, U, T, E. But we don't know about S, U, T. However, if we choose this, note that A is at position 2? In ""saute"", positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And A is not at position 3, so that's okay. But we don't know if A is at position 2? Actually, we don't know where A is exactly, only that it is not at position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But we also have to consider that we want to maximize information. Since E is already fixed at the end, we might want to try other vowels or common letters.

Alternative: ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. Here A is at position 3? In ""plate"", A is at position 3. But wait, our previous feedback said A is not at position 3 (in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not position 3). So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, it would be incorrect because we know it's not in position 3.

We must avoid putting A at position 3.

In ""plate"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that word for A at position 3 because we know the correct position isn't 3.

We need a word that has A but not at position 3 and also not at position 5 because E is there.

So A must be at 1, 2, or 4.

Words ending with E having A at position 1: ""ABATE"", ""ABIDE"" (has B, I, D, E) -- but ""abide"" doesn't have A? A in ""abide"" is at position 1: A, B, I, D, E? Wait, ""abide"" is A-B-I-D-E. So A at position 1.

Similarly, words with A at position 2: ""BAKKE""? Not a word. ""BALDE""? Not a word. ""TABLE"": T-A-B-L-E -> A at position 2.

Or ""SAUCE"" but has C which is banned.

We must avoid C, R, N.

So let's think: 

- With A at position 1: ""ADOBE"" (A at 1, but D,O,B,E) -> valid? ""adobe"" is a word. Letters: A,D,O,B,E. We know E is at 5. So A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But A is at 1? Previous feedback doesn't forbid A at 1? It only said A is not at 3.

But note: in the previous guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. That means A is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, or 4.

So ""adobe"": A at 1 is allowed.

Similarly, words with A at 4: ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E) -> A at position 3? In ""blame"", positions: B1, L2, A3, M4, E5. Again, A at position 3, which we must avoid.

We cannot put A at position 3. So we need A at either 1, 2, or 4.

Examples:

- A at 1: ""ADOBE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ABATE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.

  ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> no C, R, N -> valid.
  ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> valid.

- A at 2: ""TASTE"", ""BASTE"", ""CAUSE"" but C banned -> ""HASTE"" -> H,A,S,T,E. Avoid? S,T,H not banned -> valid.

- A at 4: This is tricky because the last letter is E. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So position 4: the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4. For example, ""BLARE"" has R and is banned? ""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E -> A at position 3? P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> so position 3 again.

Actually, words having the fourth letter as A: for example, ""OILED"" does not have A? Words like ""PALED"": P,A,L,E,D -> A at position 2? Not at 4.

A one with A at position 4: ""LEAVE"": L,E,A,V,E -> but E repeated? We don't know about duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicates. But in this case, ""LEAVE"" has two E's. But our word might have duplicate? However, we don't have information. Also, A is at position 3? L1, E2, A3, V4, E5 -> A at 3 again.

Actually, it's hard to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E. So if A is at position 4, then the word would be ...A E.  For example, ""FALSE"": F1, A2, L3, S4, E5 -> A at 2? Not 4. ""PHASE"": P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> A at 3.

Perhaps ""IZBAL"" is not a word. Actually, let me think: ""MEDIA"": M,E,D,I,A -> but ends with A, not E. Words ending in E: ""PIXIE"" does not have A? ""DEUCE"" no A? 

It appears many words with A in the fourth position end with something else. How about ""LYASE""? That might be too obscure. Or ""KOIAE""? Not words.

Common words: ""ADEEM""? Not common. Actually, let me reconsider: position 4: the letter before E. So if A is at position 4, then the 5th is E: so the word ends in AE. For example, ""GRADE"": G,R,A,D,E -> but R is banned, and A is at position 3? G1, R2, A3, D4, E5. Again, position 3.

I see the pattern: in 5-letter words ending with E, the A is usually not at position 4. Because if you try to put A at position 4, then the word ends in ""AE"". Common words ending in ""AE"" are rare, like ""HYDRAE"" or something, but they are not common.

For example, ""TOLAE"" not a word? Actually, it's easier to have A at position 1 or 2.

So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

In the previous feedback, A was wrongly placed at position 3, so it might be at 1 or 2. Position 4 is unlikely because of word structure.

So for our next guess, we can pick a word that has A at position 1 or 2 and E at position 5, and without C,R,N.

We should also include new letters to test.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: ""ADOBE"": A,D,O,B,E -> tests A at 1, and letters D,O,B.
- ""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

- Position 2: ""TASTE"": T,A,S,T,E -> but T repeated? It has two T's. We might avoid repeats to test more letters? ""PLANE"" has N banned? Not. ""HATES"": H,A,T,E,S -> S and T? ""SHADE"" has H banned? Not. Let's avoid banned letters.

  ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.
  ""CAUSE"" not because C banned -> ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.

But we have S and T? Sure.

Now, we want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In ""crane"", we have used C,R,A,N,E -> so E is known correct, A known present, and C,R,N absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We might try a word that has several of these.

Also, we know E is fixed at end, so we can vary the beginning.

So let's consider:

Option 1: ""ADOBE"" - letters A,D,O,B,E. So we test A (at position 1), D, O, B, and E (which we know). If the secret word has A at position 1, we'll get A marked ✓. If not, but A is in word, we might get A marked - but at wrong position? Actually, if A is not at position 1 in the secret word, but the word has A, then in our guess ""adobe"" having A at 1, it would be marked ""-"" only if A is in the word but not at 1. Similarly for other positions.

However, we don't know the correct position of A, only that it's not position 3.

Option 2: ""ALIVE"" - A,L,I,V,E: tests A at position 1, and L,I,V.

We could also test vowels? U,O,I, etc.

But we have only one more vowel? The word has A and E, but could have others.

Since we have limited guesses, we should prioritize common letters.

Let me think: starting with S might be good? But we don't know S.

Word: ""SAUTE"" -> but A at position 2? S1,A2,U3,T4,E5 -> A at 2? Position 2 is allowed. But ""SAUTE"" has S,U,T, and E. However, we have to avoid banned letters: no C,R,N -> valid.

Similarly, ""SLATE"" has L,A,T,E -> but S at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 in ""slate"", we would get A marked as absent or wrong? Actually, if A is not at position 3, but we put it there, and if the word has A, it might be marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it is marked ""x"", that would tell us A is not at position 3? But we already know it's not at position 3.

But wait: in ""crane"" we had A at position 3 and it was ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. That means if we put A at position 3 again, the feedback will still be ""-"" (if the word has A), because the position is still wrong? Or will it be different if placed at another wrong position? No: ""-"" means letter in word but wrong position. So if we put A at position 3, even though we know it's wrong, we would still get ""-"" if the word has A, but not at 3. That doesn't give us new information about A's position.

So to save a guess, we shouldn't put A at position 3 again. We should put it at either 1, 2, or 4.

In ""ALIVE"": A at position 1 -> safe.

In ""HASTE"": A at position 2 -> safe.

Now, back to the feedback: ""ALIVE"" and ""HASTE"" are both valid options.

Let me also think of ""CAVIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""QUAKE"" but Q and K? And U,A,K,E -> A at position 2? But U and K available.

But Q is less common? We might avoid.

Let's list possible words to consider:

- ""ADOBE"" : A(D)O(B)E -> tests D,O,B
- ""ALIVE"": A(L)I(V)E -> tests L,I,V
- ""ABATE"": A(B)A(T)E -> has two A's? We don't know if there are duplicates. But it might be acceptable.
- ""AGAPE"": A(G)A(P)E -> two A's? Not ideal.

Perhaps words without repeated letters.

Another common word: ""PLATE"" but A at position 3 -> we must avoid, so no.

""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E -> A at position 3 -> avoid.

So ""HASTE"" seems good: H,A,S,T,E -> A at 2? Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5 -> A at position 2.

E is at position 5 already, so no issue.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> same positions: P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

But perhaps we can use ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"".

What about ""DATE""? Only 4 letters? 5-letter word required.

Must be 5 letters.

Another idea: ""AWAKE"": A,W,A,K,...E -> two A's -> A at position 1 and 3? Position 3 is banned? But we have A at position 1 also? In ""AWAKE"": A at 1? Then W at 2, A at 3, K at 4, E at 5. But we cannot have A at position 3 because we know it's not correct. So if we guess ""awake"", the A at position 3 will be marked ""-"" which is redundant? And the A at position 1: if not correct, it will be ""-"", but if correct, ""✓"".

But since we have duplicate, the feedback might be tricky? But it's allowed.

To avoid complication, let's choose words without duplicates for now.

So ""HASTE"": letters H,A,S,T,E -> no duplicates? H, A, S, T, E are all distinct.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> distinct.

""SAUTE"": S,A,U,T,E -> distinct? S,A,U,T,E? Letters: S, A, U, T, E -> distinct.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

In the first guess, we have already tested A and E (one present and correct? E is correct).

Now, for the second guess, we want to test S,H,T,U,P etc.

Perhaps include a vowel that hasn't been tested? We tested A,E (and E is fixed). Vowels left: I,O,U.

If we choose ""SAUTE"", we include U and T,S.

If ""HASTE"", we include H,S,T.

Or if ""ALIVE"", we get L,I,V.

I think ""SAUTE"" might be a good candidate because:

- It has S and T which are very common.

- It has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

- A is at position 2, which we can test.

So let's go with ""SAUTE"".

But we must ensure that U is not banned? We don't know.

Similarly, we can consider ""ALOES"" -> A,L,O,E,S? But E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""ALOES"": A,L,O,E,S -> positions: A1,L2,O3,E4,S5? Not ending with E? We need E at position 5, so words must end with E.

Therefore, ""ALOES"" is not valid because it ends with S.

We need words ending with E.

""HOUSE"" -> ends with E? H,O,U,S,E -> H1,O2,U3,S4,E5. But does it have A? No, but we must include A in our guess because we know A is in the word? Wait, no: we are not required to include A? We can guess without A? But that might be inefficient because we won't get information about A's position.

Actually, we can choose a word that doesn't contain A, but we know A is in the word. But if we don't include A, we might not learn about its position? That seems inefficient.

We should include A to maximize the chance of getting its position right and also test other letters.

So I think it's better to include A in the second guess.

Therefore, let's decide between:

- ""ADOBE"": A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> we test positions 1,2,3,4 with letters A,D,O,B. But O is at position 3? We can test O at position 3.

- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> letters S,A,U,T to test common letters.

- ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.

"" SAUTE"" seems good because S and T are common, and U is a vowel.

But let's confirm: since we put A at position 2, and we do not know the correct position of A, but position 2 hasn't been tested.

Similarly, in the first, position 3 was wrong.

I think ""SAUTE"" is reasonable.

We can also think of theme words? But let's stick with common words.

Another: ""PAUSE"" -> P,A,U,S,E -> positions P1,A2,U3,S4,E5. Similar to ""SAUTE"", but replaces T with S? Wait, in ""SAUTE"" we have S,A,U,T,E -> positions S1,A2,U3,T4,E5.

In ""PAUSE"": P1,A2,U3,S4,E5 -> so we test P and S? But T is not tested.

We want to test T? It's common.

But both are fine.

Or ""HASTE"" which has T and S at 4 and 3? H1,A2,S3,T4,E5.

But U is not tested.

I think testing U might be less common than other letters? Maybe prioritize S and T.

In fact, ""SLATE"" would have been good but we cannot because of position 3 of A.

So perhap ""HASTE"" for H,A,S,T,E? Let's see.

With ""SAUTE"": S and T are tested? Also U.

But S and T are high-frequency.

Similarly, with ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> also S and T.

But in ""HASTE"", S is at position 3 and T at 4? And in ""SAUTE"", S at 1, T at 4? U at 3.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a valid word and suitable.

We'll go with ""SAUTE"".

But let me double-check the word: ""saute"" is a word? Yes, from French, meaning to cook quickly in oil.

In English, it is used as a cooking term.

So I'll use that.

Second guess: SAUTE

<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).
- A is present in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect, and position 5 is E).
- Avoid using C, R, or N in the guess.
- Include A in the guess to get more positional information and test other common letters.

For the second guess, I considered words ending in E that include A in position 1, 2, or 4, while introducing new untested letters. Options like ""adobe"" (A at position 1), ""haste"" (A at position 2), and ""saute"" (A at position 2) were evaluated. ""Saute"" was chosen because:
- A is at position 2, testing a new possible location.
- It tests three new common letters: S, U, and T.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (a cooking term).

The goal is to confirm or rule out A's position and gain feedback on S, U, and T.

<guess>saute</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)
- U: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E
- We have confirmed that A is at position 2 (from the second guess).
- We know that C, R, N, S, U, T are not in the word (from the x's in both guesses).
- The only letter that is in the word but not in the correct position from the first guess was A, but now we know A is at position 2, so that is resolved.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ E

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We must avoid these letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now A is at position 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses only the remaining possible letters.

We have to consider what letters are still available. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have eliminated 6: C, R, N, S, U, T.

So available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and E are already in the word, so they can appear again? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are duplicate letters. We have to consider the possibility of duplicates, but since we don't have evidence, we might assume no duplicates for now to simplify.

In the pattern, we have A at position 2 and E at position 5. So positions 1, 3, and 4 are open.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters from the available set, avoiding the banned letters.

We should choose a word that tests common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters: L, I, O, P, M, B, D, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

Examples:
- ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> but E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. So ""BAKED"" is B1,A2,K3,E4,D5 -> but position 5 is D, not E. So no.
- ""BALED"": B A L E D -> positions: B1, A2, L3, E4, D5 -> again, E at 4, not 5.
- ""BAKEE"" not a word.

We need the word to end with E, so the last letter must be E.

So pattern: _ A _ _ E

Words:
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> M1, A2, P3, L4, E5 -> this fits. Letters: M, A, P, L, E. Check banned: M, P, L are not in the banned list (C,R,N,S,U,T). So valid.
- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T is banned (from second guess, T is x). So invalid.
- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> G1, A2, B3, L4, E5. Banned? G, B, L not banned? T is banned, but not used. So valid.
- ""HALVE"": H A L V E -> H1, A2, L3, V4, E5. Valid.
- ""PALME"" not common? ""PALME"" might not be a word; ""PALM"" is 4 letters. ""PALED"" has E at 4? No.

Other words: ""DANCE"" but C and N banned? C and N are banned.

""LANCE"" similarly banned.

""FABLE"": F A B L E -> F1, A2, B3, L4, E5. Valid.

""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> M1, A2, Y3, B4, E5. Valid.

We need to choose one that tests common letters and might give us more information.

We have positions 1, 3, and 4 to fill.

We should try to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

In the first two guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

So tested letters: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, U.

A and E are in the word, the others are not.

So untested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common untested letters as possible.

For the third guess, we can choose a word that has several of these.

For example, ""MAPLE"" has M, P, L.

""GABLE"" has G, B, L.

""HALVE"" has H, L, V.

""MAYBE"" has M, Y, B.

""FABLE"" has F, B, L.

""BAYLE"" not a word.

""JAZZE"" not a word.

""VALVE"" has V, A, L, V, E -> but V repeated? And A is already at position 2, so if we put V at position 3 and 4? But we don't know about duplicates.

But ""VALVE"" has two V's, which might not be efficient for testing.

Similarly, ""MAJOR"" does not end with E.

We need to end with E.

Another word: ""AMPLE"" -> A M P L E -> but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. ""AMPLE"" is A1,M2,P3,L4,E5 -> not matching pattern.

We need A at position 2.

So back to the pattern.

Let me list possible words:

- MAPLE: M A P L E
- GABLE: G A B L E
- FABLE: F A B L E
- HALVE: H A L V E
- MAIZE: M A I Z E -> M1, A2, I3, Z4, E5. Z is less common? But valid.
- PASTE: but S and T banned? S and T are banned, so no.
- WAIVE: W A I V E -> W1, A2, I3, V4, E5. Valid.

Now, we need to choose one that has common letters and might help us narrow down.

Since we have three positions to fill, and we have limited guesses, we should aim for a word that, based on feedback, can lead us to the solution.

But we don't have much information about the remaining letters.

Perhaps we can choose a word that includes vowels or common consonants.

For example, ""MAPLE"" tests M, P, L.

""GABLE"" tests G, B, L.

""FABLE"" tests F, B, L.

""HALVE"" tests H, L, V.

""WAIVE"" tests W, I, V.

""MAYBE"" tests M, Y, B.

I think ""MAPLE"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, P, L.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" is also common.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that in position 1, common letters are consonants like B, H, M, P, etc.

In position 3, common letters could be vowels or consonants.

In position 4, common letters for ending.

But let's pick ""MAPLE"" as the next guess.

So guess: MAPLE

But we must ensure that we are not using banned letters. M, A, P, L, E. A and E are known, M, P, L are not banned. So yes.

If we guess ""MAPLE"", and the word is ""MAPLE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on M, P, L.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"", we test G, B, L.

But ""MAPLE"" might be more common? Both are valid.

Another word: ""BAYLE"" not a word.

""KAPOK"" not ending with E.

I think ""MAPLE"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more vowels. For example, ""HAZEL"" but H A Z E L -> positions: H1, A2, Z3, E4, L5 -> but we need E at position 5, so L5? Not E. So no.

""HASTE"" but S and T banned.

So I think ""MAPLE"" is a good choice.

We'll go with ""MAPLE"".

<guess>maple</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  
    - A is in the word but not at position 3.  
    - C, R, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""saute""**  
  - S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.  
    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  
    - S, U, and T are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Position 2 is A.  
   - Position 5 is E.  
   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ A _ _ E`.  
   - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, N (from Guess 1), and S, U, T (from Guess 2) are not in the word.  
   - Total excluded: C, R, N, S, U, T.  

3. **Included Letters**:  
   - A and E are confirmed in the word (A at position 2, E at position 5).  
   - No duplicates are indicated yet, but we cannot rule them out.  

4. **Available Letters**:  
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Remaining vowels: I, O (since A and E are already placed).  

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Focus on words matching `_ A _ _ E`.  
   - Test high-frequency letters not yet used (e.g., L, M, P, B, D, G, I, O) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).  
   - Prioritize common words to increase the chance of hitting correct letters/positions.  

### Evaluation of Possible Words:
- **Good candidates** must fit `_ A _ _ E` and use available letters. Examples:  
  - ""MAPLE"" (M A P L E): Tests M, P, L—common letters.  
  - ""GABLE"" (G A B L E): Tests G, B, L.  
  - ""HALVE"" (H A L V E): Tests H, L, V.  
  - ""FABLE"" (F A B L E): Tests F, B, L.  
- **Why ""MAPLE"" is a strong choice**:  
  - Uses M, P, L—all high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on M (position 1), P (position 3), and L (position 4) will significantly narrow possibilities.  
  - Common word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

### Next Guess: ""MAPLE""
This guess tests three new letters in key positions and aligns with the known pattern. If correct, we solve the puzzle; if not, feedback will provide critical clues for the next guess.

We know the last letter is E. The word is: ? ? ? ? E\n\nWe need to make a second guess. The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word that ends with E.\n\nConstraints from the previous feedback:\n- Avoid C, R, N (because they are not in the word).\n- The word must contain A, but not in position 3 (and of course, since E is in position 5, A cannot be there either).\n- Also, avoid using C, R, N anywhere.\n\nWe can use other letters. Since A is present but not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that contain the letter A and do not contain C, R, N.\n\nCommon letters that can be used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also want to test other vowels or common consonants to gather more information.\n\nPossible words ending in E that contain A:\n\n- Option 1: ""SAUTE"" - Let\'s check the letters: S, A, U, T, E. But we don\'t know about S, U, T. However, if we choose this, note that A is at position 2? In ""saute"", positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). And A is not at position 3, so that\'s okay. But we don\'t know if A is at position 2? Actually, we don\'t know where A is exactly, only that it is not at position 3. So position 2 is possible.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we want to maximize information. Since E is already fixed at the end, we might want to try other vowels or common letters.\n\nAlternative: ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. Here A is at position 3? In ""plate"", A is at position 3. But wait, our previous feedback said A is not at position 3 (in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not position 3). So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, it would be incorrect because we know it\'s not in position 3.\n\nWe must avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nIn ""plate"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that word for A at position 3 because we know the correct position isn\'t 3.\n\nWe need a word that has A but not at position 3 and also not at position 5 because E is there.\n\nSo A must be at 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWords ending with E having A at position 1: ""ABATE"", ""ABIDE"" (has B, I, D, E) -- but ""abide"" doesn\'t have A? A in ""abide"" is at position 1: A, B, I, D, E? Wait, ""abide"" is A-B-I-D-E. So A at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, words with A at position 2: ""BAKKE""? Not a word. ""BALDE""? Not a word. ""TABLE"": T-A-B-L-E -> A at position 2.\n\nOr ""SAUCE"" but has C which is banned.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo let\'s think: \n\n- With A at position 1: ""ADOBE"" (A at 1, but D,O,B,E) -> valid? ""adobe"" is a word. Letters: A,D,O,B,E. We know E is at 5. So A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But A is at 1? Previous feedback doesn\'t forbid A at 1? It only said A is not at 3.\n\nBut note: in the previous guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. That means A is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSo ""adobe"": A at 1 is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, words with A at 4: ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E) -> A at position 3? In ""blame"", positions: B1, L2, A3, M4, E5. Again, A at position 3, which we must avoid.\n\nWe cannot put A at position 3. So we need A at either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nExamples:\n\n- A at 1: ""ADOBE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ABATE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.\n\n  ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> no C, R, N -> valid.\n  ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> valid.\n\n- A at 2: ""TASTE"", ""BASTE"", ""CAUSE"" but C banned -> ""HASTE"" -> H,A,S,T,E. Avoid? S,T,H not banned -> valid.\n\n- A at 4: This is tricky because the last letter is E. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So position 4: the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4. For example, ""BLARE"" has R and is banned? ""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E -> A at position 3? P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> so position 3 again.\n\nActually, words having the fourth letter as A: for example, ""OILED"" does not have A? Words like ""PALED"": P,A,L,E,D -> A at position 2? Not at 4.\n\nA one with A at position 4: ""LEAVE"": L,E,A,V,E -> but E repeated? We don\'t know about duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say anything about duplicates. But in this case, ""LEAVE"" has two E\'s. But our word might have duplicate? However, we don\'t have information. Also, A is at position 3? L1, E2, A3, V4, E5 -> A at 3 again.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E. So if A is at position 4, then the word would be ...A E.  For example, ""FALSE"": F1, A2, L3, S4, E5 -> A at 2? Not 4. ""PHASE"": P1, H2, A3, S4, E5 -> A at 3.\n\nPerhaps ""IZBAL"" is not a word. Actually, let me think: ""MEDIA"": M,E,D,I,A -> but ends with A, not E. Words ending in E: ""PIXIE"" does not have A? ""DEUCE"" no A? \n\nIt appears many words with A in the fourth position end with something else. How about ""LYASE""? That might be too obscure. Or ""KOIAE""? Not words.\n\nCommon words: ""ADEEM""? Not common. Actually, let me reconsider: position 4: the letter before E. So if A is at position 4, then the 5th is E: so the word ends in AE. For example, ""GRADE"": G,R,A,D,E -> but R is banned, and A is at position 3? G1, R2, A3, D4, E5. Again, position 3.\n\nI see the pattern: in 5-letter words ending with E, the A is usually not at position 4. Because if you try to put A at position 4, then the word ends in ""AE"". Common words ending in ""AE"" are rare, like ""HYDRAE"" or something, but they are not common.\n\nFor example, ""TOLAE"" not a word? Actually, it\'s easier to have A at position 1 or 2.\n\nSo probably, A is at position 1 or 2.\n\nIn the previous feedback, A was wrongly placed at position 3, so it might be at 1 or 2. Position 4 is unlikely because of word structure.\n\nSo for our next guess, we can pick a word that has A at position 1 or 2 and E at position 5, and without C,R,N.\n\nWe should also include new letters to test.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- Position 1: ""ADOBE"": A,D,O,B,E -> tests A at 1, and letters D,O,B.\n- ""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.\n\n- Position 2: ""TASTE"": T,A,S,T,E -> but T repeated? It has two T\'s. We might avoid repeats to test more letters? ""PLANE"" has N banned? Not. ""HATES"": H,A,T,E,S -> S and T? ""SHADE"" has H banned? Not. Let\'s avoid banned letters.\n\n  ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.\n  ""CAUSE"" not because C banned -> ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2.\n\nBut we have S and T? Sure.\n\nNow, we want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nIn ""crane"", we have used C,R,A,N,E -> so E is known correct, A known present, and C,R,N absent.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nWe might try a word that has several of these.\n\nAlso, we know E is fixed at end, so we can vary the beginning.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n\nOption 1: ""ADOBE"" - letters A,D,O,B,E. So we test A (at position 1), D, O, B, and E (which we know). If the secret word has A at position 1, we\'ll get A marked ✓. If not, but A is in word, we might get A marked - but at wrong position? Actually, if A is not at position 1 in the secret word, but the word has A, then in our guess ""adobe"" having A at 1, it would be marked ""-"" only if A is in the word but not at 1. Similarly for other positions.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know the correct position of A, only that it\'s not position 3.\n\nOption 2: ""ALIVE"" - A,L,I,V,E: tests A at position 1, and L,I,V.\n\nWe could also test vowels? U,O,I, etc.\n\nBut we have only one more vowel? The word has A and E, but could have others.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should prioritize common letters.\n\nLet me think: starting with S might be good? But we don\'t know S.\n\nWord: ""SAUTE"" -> but A at position 2? S1,A2,U3,T4,E5 -> A at 2? Position 2 is allowed. But ""SAUTE"" has S,U,T, and E. However, we have to avoid banned letters: no C,R,N -> valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"" has L,A,T,E -> but S at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 in ""slate"", we would get A marked as absent or wrong? Actually, if A is not at position 3, but we put it there, and if the word has A, it might be marked ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position? Or if it is marked ""x"", that would tell us A is not at position 3? But we already know it\'s not at position 3.\n\nBut wait: in ""crane"" we had A at position 3 and it was ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. That means if we put A at position 3 again, the feedback will still be ""-"" (if the word has A), because the position is still wrong? Or will it be different if placed at another wrong position? No: ""-"" means letter in word but wrong position. So if we put A at position 3, even though we know it\'s wrong, we would still get ""-"" if the word has A, but not at 3. That doesn\'t give us new information about A\'s position.\n\nSo to save a guess, we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again. We should put it at either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nIn ""ALIVE"": A at position 1 -> safe.\n\nIn ""HASTE"": A at position 2 -> safe.\n\nNow, back to the feedback: ""ALIVE"" and ""HASTE"" are both valid options.\n\nLet me also think of ""CAVIE"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""QUAKE"" but Q and K? And U,A,K,E -> A at position 2? But U and K available.\n\nBut Q is less common? We might avoid.\n\nLet\'s list possible words to consider:\n\n- ""ADOBE"" : A(D)O(B)E -> tests D,O,B\n- ""ALIVE"": A(L)I(V)E -> tests L,I,V\n- ""ABATE"": A(B)A(T)E -> has two A\'s? We don\'t know if there are duplicates. But it might be acceptable.\n- ""AGAPE"": A(G)A(P)E -> two A\'s? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps words without repeated letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLATE"" but A at position 3 -> we must avoid, so no.\n\n""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E -> A at position 3 -> avoid.\n\nSo ""HASTE"" seems good: H,A,S,T,E -> A at 2? Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5 -> A at position 2.\n\nE is at position 5 already, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> same positions: P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.\n\nBut perhaps we can use ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"".\n\nWhat about ""DATE""? Only 4 letters? 5-letter word required.\n\nMust be 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""AWAKE"": A,W,A,K,...E -> two A\'s -> A at position 1 and 3? Position 3 is banned? But we have A at position 1 also? In ""AWAKE"": A at 1? Then W at 2, A at 3, K at 4, E at 5. But we cannot have A at position 3 because we know it\'s not correct. So if we guess ""awake"", the A at position 3 will be marked ""-"" which is redundant? And the A at position 1: if not correct, it will be ""-"", but if correct, ""✓"".\n\nBut since we have duplicate, the feedback might be tricky? But it\'s allowed.\n\nTo avoid complication, let\'s choose words without duplicates for now.\n\nSo ""HASTE"": letters H,A,S,T,E -> no duplicates? H, A, S, T, E are all distinct.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> distinct.\n\n""SAUTE"": S,A,U,T,E -> distinct? S,A,U,T,E? Letters: S, A, U, T, E -> distinct.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.\n\nIn the first guess, we have already tested A and E (one present and correct? E is correct).\n\nNow, for the second guess, we want to test S,H,T,U,P etc.\n\nPerhaps include a vowel that hasn\'t been tested? We tested A,E (and E is fixed). Vowels left: I,O,U.\n\nIf we choose ""SAUTE"", we include U and T,S.\n\nIf ""HASTE"", we include H,S,T.\n\nOr if ""ALIVE"", we get L,I,V.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" might be a good candidate because:\n\n- It has S and T which are very common.\n\n- It has U, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n- A is at position 2, which we can test.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SAUTE"".\n\nBut we must ensure that U is not banned? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider ""ALOES"" -> A,L,O,E,S? But E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""ALOES"": A,L,O,E,S -> positions: A1,L2,O3,E4,S5? Not ending with E? We need E at position 5, so words must end with E.\n\nTherefore, ""ALOES"" is not valid because it ends with S.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\n""HOUSE"" -> ends with E? H,O,U,S,E -> H1,O2,U3,S4,E5. But does it have A? No, but we must include A in our guess because we know A is in the word? Wait, no: we are not required to include A? We can guess without A? But that might be inefficient because we won\'t get information about A\'s position.\n\nActually, we can choose a word that doesn\'t contain A, but we know A is in the word. But if we don\'t include A, we might not learn about its position? That seems inefficient.\n\nWe should include A to maximize the chance of getting its position right and also test other letters.\n\nSo I think it\'s better to include A in the second guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s decide between:\n\n- ""ADOBE"": A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> we test positions 1,2,3,4 with letters A,D,O,B. But O is at position 3? We can test O at position 3.\n\n- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> letters S,A,U,T to test common letters.\n\n- ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> tests A at 1, and L,I,V.\n\n"" SAUTE"" seems good because S and T are common, and U is a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: since we put A at position 2, and we do not know the correct position of A, but position 2 hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSimilarly, in the first, position 3 was wrong.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is reasonable.\n\nWe can also think of theme words? But let\'s stick with common words.\n\nAnother: ""PAUSE"" -> P,A,U,S,E -> positions P1,A2,U3,S4,E5. Similar to ""SAUTE"", but replaces T with S? Wait, in ""SAUTE"" we have S,A,U,T,E -> positions S1,A2,U3,T4,E5.\n\nIn ""PAUSE"": P1,A2,U3,S4,E5 -> so we test P and S? But T is not tested.\n\nWe want to test T? It\'s common.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nOr ""HASTE"" which has T and S at 4 and 3? H1,A2,S3,T4,E5.\n\nBut U is not tested.\n\nI think testing U might be less common than other letters? Maybe prioritize S and T.\n\nIn fact, ""SLATE"" would have been good but we cannot because of position 3 of A.\n\nSo perhap ""HASTE"" for H,A,S,T,E? Let\'s see.\n\nWith ""SAUTE"": S and T are tested? Also U.\n\nBut S and T are high-frequency.\n\nSimilarly, with ""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> also S and T.\n\nBut in ""HASTE"", S is at position 3 and T at 4? And in ""SAUTE"", S at 1, T at 4? U at 3.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is a valid word and suitable.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""SAUTE"".\n\nBut let me double-check the word: ""saute"" is a word? Yes, from French, meaning to cook quickly in oil.\n\nIn English, it is used as a cooking term.\n\nSo I\'ll use that.\n\nSecond guess: SAUTE\n\n<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).\n- A is present in the word but not at position 3 (-).\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect, and position 5 is E).\n- Avoid using C, R, or N in the guess.\n- Include A in the guess to get more positional information and test other common letters.\n\nFor the second guess, I considered words ending in E that include A in position 1, 2, or 4, while introducing new untested letters. Options like ""adobe"" (A at position 1), ""haste"" (A at position 2), and ""saute"" (A at position 2) were evaluated. ""Saute"" was chosen because:\n- A is at position 2, testing a new possible location.\n- It tests three new common letters: S, U, and T.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word (a cooking term).\n\nThe goal is to confirm or rule out A\'s position and gain feedback on S, U, and T.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)\n\nGuess 2: ""saute""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E\n- We have confirmed that A is at position 2 (from the second guess).\n- We know that C, R, N, S, U, T are not in the word (from the x\'s in both guesses).\n- The only letter that is in the word but not in the correct position from the first guess was A, but now we know A is at position 2, so that is resolved.\n\nNow, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ E\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E\n\nWe also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, S, U, T.\n\nWe must avoid these letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now A is at position 2.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses only the remaining possible letters.\n\nWe have to consider what letters are still available.

The feedback doesn\'t indicate if there are duplicate letters. We have to consider the possibility of duplicates, but since we don\'t have evidence, we might assume no duplicates for now to simplify.\n\nIn the pattern, we have A at position 2 and E at position 5.

We need E at position 5. So ""BAKED"" is B1,A2,K3,E4,D5 -> but position 5 is D, not E. So no.\n- ""BALED"": B A L E D -> positions: B1, A2, L3, E4, D5 -> again, E at 4, not 5.\n- ""BAKEE"" not a word.\n\nWe need the word to end with E, so the last letter must be E.\n\nSo pattern: _ A _ _ E\n\nWords:\n- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> M1, A2, P3, L4, E5 -> this fits. Letters: M, A, P, L, E. Check banned: M, P, L are not in the banned list (C,R,N,S,U,T). So valid.\n- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T is banned (from second guess, T is x). So invalid.\n- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> G1, A2, B3, L4, E5. Banned? G, B, L not banned? T is banned, but not used. So valid.\n- ""HALVE"": H A L V E -> H1, A2, L3, V4, E5. Valid.\n- ""PALME"" not common? ""PALME"" might not be a word; ""PALM"" is 4 letters. ""PALED"" has E at 4? No.\n\nOther words: ""DANCE"" but C and N banned?

And A is already at position 2, so if we put V at position 3 and 4? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nBut ""VALVE"" has two V\'s, which might not be efficient for testing.\n\nSimilarly, ""MAJOR"" does not end with E.\n\nWe need to end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""AMPLE"" -> A M P L E -> but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. ""AMPLE"" is A1,M2,P3,L4,E5 -> not matching pattern.\n\nWe need A at position 2.\n\nSo back to the pattern.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- MAPLE: M A P L E\n- GABLE: G A B L E\n- FABLE: F A B L E\n- HALVE: H A L V E\n- MAIZE: M A I Z E -> M1, A2, I3, Z4, E5. Z is less common? But valid.\n- PASTE: but S and T banned? S and T are banned, so no.\n- WAIVE: W A I V E -> W1, A2, I3, V4, E5. Valid.\n\nNow, we need to choose one that has common letters and might help us narrow down.\n\nSince we have three positions to fill, and we have limited guesses, we should aim for a word that, based on feedback, can lead us to the solution.\n\nBut we don\'t have much information about the remaining letters.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that includes vowels or common consonants.\n\nFor example, ""MAPLE"" tests M, P, L.\n\n""GABLE"" tests G, B, L.\n\n""FABLE"" tests F, B, L.\n\n""HALVE"" tests H, L, V.\n\n""WAIVE"" tests W, I, V.\n\n""MAYBE"" tests M, Y, B.\n\nI think ""MAPLE"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, P, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""GABLE"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe can also consider that in position 1, common letters are consonants like B, H, M, P, etc.\n\nIn position 3, common letters could be vowels or consonants.\n\nIn position 4, common letters for ending.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""MAPLE"" as the next guess.\n\nSo guess: MAPLE\n\nBut we must ensure that we are not using banned letters. M, A, P, L, E. A and E are known, M, P, L are not banned. So yes.\n\nIf we guess ""MAPLE"", and the word is ""MAPLE"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on M, P, L.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""GABLE"", we test G, B, L.\n\nBut ""MAPLE"" might be more common? Both are valid.\n\nAnother word: ""BAYLE"" not a word.\n\n""KAPOK"" not ending with E.\n\nI think ""MAPLE"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that tests more vowels. For example, ""HAZEL"" but H A Z E L -> positions: H1, A2, Z3, E4, L5 -> but we need E at position 5, so L5? Not E. So no.\n\n""HASTE"" but S and T banned.\n\nSo I think ""MAPLE"" is a good choice.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""MAPLE"".\n\n<guess>maple</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  \n  - Interpretation:  \n    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  \n    - A is in the word but not at position 3.  \n    - C, R, and N are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""saute""**  \n  - S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)  \n  - Interpretation:  \n    - A is correctly placed at position 2.  \n    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  \n    - S, U, and T are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Word Structure**:  \n   - Position 2 is A.  \n   - Position 5 is E.  \n   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ A _ _ E`.  \n   - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.  \n\n2. **Excluded Letters**:  \n   - C, R, N (from Guess 1), and S, U, T (from Guess 2) are not in the word.  \n   - Total excluded: C, R, N, S, U, T.  \n\n3. **Included Letters**:  \n   - A and E are confirmed in the word (A at position 2, E at position 5).  \n   - No duplicates are indicated yet, but we cannot rule them out.  \n\n4. **Available Letters**:  \n   - Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n   - Remaining vowels: I, O (since A and E are already placed).  \n\n5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - Focus on words matching `_ A _ _ E`.  \n   - Test high-frequency letters not yet used (e.g., L, M, P, B, D, G, I, O) to maximize information.  \n   - Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).  \n   - Prioritize common words to increase the chance of hitting correct letters/positions.  \n\n### Evaluation of Possible Words:\n- **Good candidates** must fit `_ A _ _ E` and use available letters.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)
- E is correct and in position 5.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""saute"" -> S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
- A is correct and in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked correct).
- E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).
- S, U, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""maple"" -> M(✓), A(✓), P(x), L(x), E(✓)
- M is correct and in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked correct).
- A is correct and in position 2 (reaffirmed).
- E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).
- P and L are not in the word.

Now, putting it all together:

- Position 1: M (correct, from guess 3)
- Position 2: A (correct, from guess 2)
- Position 5: E (correct, from guess 1 and 2)

So the word is: M A _ _ E

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L.

Additionally, from the first guess, A was in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now we know A is at position 2.

Now, we need to find the missing letters for positions 3 and 4.

The word structure: M A ? ? E

We know that the letters at positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned letters.

Banned letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L.

Available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M, A, E are already in the word. However, duplicates are possible? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far, but we cannot rule it out. However, since we have three positions filled and two open, and no feedback suggesting duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now to keep it simple.

So positions 3 and 4 should be filled with two distinct letters from the available set, excluding M, A, E (if no duplicates).

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form M A _ _ E.

Possible words:

- M A D E ? -> ""MADGE"" (a name, but valid word? Sometimes accepted) or ""MADRE"" (Spanish for mother, but in English? Not common). 
- M A G E -> ""MAGEE"" (a surname) or ""MAGLE"" not a word. But we need 5 letters: M A G _ E? ""MAGMA"" doesn't end with E. ""IMAGE"" has I at position 1, not M.

Let's think of common words:

- ""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> but E is at position 5? M1, A2, Y3, B4, E5. This fits. And Y and B are available? Y and B are in the available list. Banned letters don't include Y or B. So ""MAYBE"" is a candidate.

- ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> M1, A2, I3, Z4, E5. I and Z are available? Z is available, I is available.

- ""MAKER"": but R is banned? R is in the banned list.

- ""MAVEN"": N is banned? N is banned.

- ""MAPLE"": we already tried, and P and L are banned.

- ""MATEY"": but T is banned? T is banned.

- ""MAYOR"": but O at position 4? M A Y O R -> R is banned and also ends with R, not E.

- ""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"" are possibilities.

But we need to check if they are valid.

Also, ""MADGE"": M A D G E -> positions: M1, A2, D3, G4, E5. D and G are available.

""MAFIA"": doesn't end with E.

""MANGA"": no E.

""MANGE"": but N is banned.

""MARGE"": R banned.

So possible words: ""MAYBE"", ""MAIZE"", ""MADGE"", ""MAJOR"" but R banned, so no.

""MAJOR"" ends with R.

""MAKAR"": not common and K and R? R banned.

Another: ""MAIRE"" (a type of tree? or French for mayor) - M A I R E -> but R is banned.

""MAILE"" - M A I L E -> but L is banned? L is in the banned list from guess 3.

L is banned, so ""MAILE"" has L, not allowed.

""MAIRE"" has R, banned.

""MAISE"" not a word? ""MAIZE"" is the word.

""MAYDE"" not common.

""MAVIN"" N banned.

So the main candidates are:

1. ""MAYBE"" - M, A, Y, B, E
2. ""MAIZE"" - M, A, I, Z, E
3. ""MADGE"" - M, A, D, G, E

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have two positions to fill, and we want to maximize information, but we are at the fourth guess, we might as well try to solve.

But let's see which one is more common.

""MAYBE"" is a very common word.

""MAIZE"" is also common (corn).

""MADGE"" is less common, a name.

We can also consider ""MAZED"" but ends with D? M A Z E D -> E at position 4? Not E at 5.

No.

""MAZER"" R banned.

So between ""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"".

We can also think of ""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"" both have unique letters.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have no information about the middle letters, we might choose one arbitrarily.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and A was misplaced, but now we know it's at position 2.

We can look for other words.

What about ""MAUVE""? But U is banned? U is in the banned list from guess 2.

""MAYBE"" seems a good choice.

But let's check the feedback: in guess 3, we had ""maple"" and P and L were marked x, so not in the word.

Now, for ""MAYBE"": it has Y and B, which are new.

Similarly, ""MAIZE"" has I and Z.

We might choose ""MAYBE"" because Y is a semi-vowel and common.

But let's see if there is a word that can test more possibilities? But we only have two positions.

Another word: ""MAYED"" not a word? ""MAYED"" is not standard.

""MAYBE"" is the word.

We can also consider ""MAYST"" not a word.

I think ""MAYBE"" is a valid and common word.

Similarly, ""MAIZE"" is also valid.

But to decide, let's think about the frequency.

Since we are at the fourth guess, and we have three letters correct, we can guess one of them.

But if we guess ""MAYBE"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on Y and B.

Similarly for ""MAIZE"".

But there might be other possibilities.

What about ""MAWED""? M A W E D -> E at position 4? Not 5.

No.

""MAXED"": M A X E D -> E at 4, D at 5? Not E at 5.

""MAZED"": same issue.

""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"" are the only common ones I can think of.

Another one: ""MAIRE"" but R banned.

""MAJOR"" R banned.

""MANAS"" no E.

So I think ""MAYBE"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the banned letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L.

Y and B are not in the banned list.

Similarly for I and Z.

We can also consider ""MAYBE"" because it has B, which is more common than Z.

But ""MAIZE"" is also common.

Perhaps we can look for words that have vowels in position 3? Like I in ""MAIZE"".

But let's choose ""MAYBE"".

I recall that in Wordle, ""MAYBE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MAIZE"" is valid.

But to be safe, let's go with ""MAYBE"".

So the next guess is ""MAYBE"".

But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""MAGEE"" is a proper name, but sometimes accepted? But ""MAYBE"" is better.

""MAYBE"" is a common word.

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  
    - A is in the word but not at position 3.  
    - C, R, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""saute""**  
  - S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.  
    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  
    - S, U, and T are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""maple""**  
  - M(✓), A(✓), P(x), L(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - M is correctly placed at position 1.  
    - A is correctly placed at position 2 (reaffirmed).  
    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  
    - P and L are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Position 1: M (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 2: A (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5: E (confirmed ✓).  
   - The word pattern is: **M A _ _ E**.  
   - Positions 3 and 4 are unknown.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L are not in the word.  
   - Total excluded: 8 letters.  

3. **Included Letters**:  
   - Confirmed: M, A, E (all placed correctly).  
   - No duplicates are indicated, but we cannot rule them out entirely.  

4. **Available Letters for Positions 3 and 4**:  
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Remaining vowels: I, O (A and E are already placed).  
   - High-frequency letters to test: B, D, G, I, O, Y (prioritized for information gain).  

5. **Possible Words Matching `M A _ _ E`**:  
   - Common options:  
     - ""MAYBE"" (tests Y at position 3, B at position 4).  
     - ""MAIZE"" (tests I at position 3, Z at position 4).  
     - ""MADGE"" (tests D at position 3, G at position 4).  
   - ""MAYBE"" is selected because:  
     - It uses high-frequency letters (Y and B) not yet tested.  
     - It is a very common English word (reducing invalid guess risk).  
     - If incorrect, feedback on Y and B will quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., ""MAIZE"" or ""MADGE"").  

### Next Guess: ""MAYBE""
This guess tests the unknown positions with new letters and could solve the puzzle if correct. If not, the feedback will isolate the solution.

<guess>maybe</guess>",maybe,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)
- E is correct and in position 5.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""saute"" -> S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
- A is correct and in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked correct).
- E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).
- S, U, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""maple"" -> M(✓), A(✓), P(x), L(x), E(✓)
- M is correct and in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked correct).
- A is correct and in position 2 (reaffirmed).
- E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).
- P and L are not in the word.

Now, putting it all together:

- Position 1: M (correct, from guess 3)
- Position 2: A (correct, from guess 2)
- Position 5: E (correct, from guess 1 and 2)

So the word is: M A _ _ E

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L.

Additionally, from the first guess, A was in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now we know A is at position 2.

Now, we need to find the missing letters for positions 3 and 4.

The word structure: M A ? ? E

We know that the letters at positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned letters.

Banned letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L.

Available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M, A, E are already in the word. However, duplicates are possible? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far, but we cannot rule it out. However, since we have three positions filled and two open, and no feedback suggesting duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now to keep it simple.

So positions 3 and 4 should be filled with two distinct letters from the available set, excluding M, A, E (if no duplicates).

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form M A _ _ E.

Possible words:

- M A D E ? -> ""MADGE"" (a name, but valid word? Sometimes accepted) or ""MADRE"" (Spanish for mother, but in English? Not common). 
- M A G E -> ""MAGEE"" (a surname) or ""MAGLE"" not a word. But we need 5 letters: M A G _ E? ""MAGMA"" doesn't end with E. ""IMAGE"" has I at position 1, not M.

Let's think of common words:

- ""MAYBE"": M A Y B E -> but E is at position 5? M1, A2, Y3, B4, E5. This fits. And Y and B are available? Y and B are in the available list. Banned letters don't include Y or B. So ""MAYBE"" is a candidate.

- ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> M1, A2, I3, Z4, E5. I and Z are available? Z is available, I is available.

- ""MAKER"": but R is banned? R is in the banned list.

- ""MAVEN"": N is banned? N is banned.

- ""MAPLE"": we already tried, and P and L are banned.

- ""MATEY"": but T is banned? T is banned.

- ""MAYOR"": but O at position 4? M A Y O R -> R is banned and also ends with R, not E.

- ""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"" are possibilities.

But we need to check if they are valid.

Also, ""MADGE"": M A D G E -> positions: M1, A2, D3, G4, E5. D and G are available.

""MAFIA"": doesn't end with E.

""MANGA"": no E.

""MANGE"": but N is banned.

""MARGE"": R banned.

So possible words: ""MAYBE"", ""MAIZE"", ""MADGE"", ""MAJOR"" but R banned, so no.

""MAJOR"" ends with R.

""MAKAR"": not common and K and R? R banned.

Another: ""MAIRE"" (a type of tree? or French for mayor) - M A I R E -> but R is banned.

""MAILE"" - M A I L E -> but L is banned? L is in the banned list from guess 3.

L is banned, so ""MAILE"" has L, not allowed.

""MAIRE"" has R, banned.

""MAISE"" not a word? ""MAIZE"" is the word.

""MAYDE"" not common.

""MAVIN"" N banned.

So the main candidates are:

1. ""MAYBE"" - M, A, Y, B, E
2. ""MAIZE"" - M, A, I, Z, E
3. ""MADGE"" - M, A, D, G, E

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have two positions to fill, and we want to maximize information, but we are at the fourth guess, we might as well try to solve.

But let's see which one is more common.

""MAYBE"" is a very common word.

""MAIZE"" is also common (corn).

""MADGE"" is less common, a name.

We can also consider ""MAZED"" but ends with D? M A Z E D -> E at position 4? Not E at 5.

No.

""MAZER"" R banned.

So between ""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"".

We can also think of ""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"" both have unique letters.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have no information about the middle letters, we might choose one arbitrarily.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and A was misplaced, but now we know it's at position 2.

We can look for other words.

What about ""MAUVE""? But U is banned? U is in the banned list from guess 2.

""MAYBE"" seems a good choice.

But let's check the feedback: in guess 3, we had ""maple"" and P and L were marked x, so not in the word.

Now, for ""MAYBE"": it has Y and B, which are new.

Similarly, ""MAIZE"" has I and Z.

We might choose ""MAYBE"" because Y is a semi-vowel and common.

But let's see if there is a word that can test more possibilities? But we only have two positions.

Another word: ""MAYED"" not a word? ""MAYED"" is not standard.

""MAYBE"" is the word.

We can also consider ""MAYST"" not a word.

I think ""MAYBE"" is a valid and common word.

Similarly, ""MAIZE"" is also valid.

But to decide, let's think about the frequency.

Since we are at the fourth guess, and we have three letters correct, we can guess one of them.

But if we guess ""MAYBE"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on Y and B.

Similarly for ""MAIZE"".

But there might be other possibilities.

What about ""MAWED""? M A W E D -> E at position 4? Not 5.

No.

""MAXED"": M A X E D -> E at 4, D at 5? Not E at 5.

""MAZED"": same issue.

""MAYBE"" and ""MAIZE"" are the only common ones I can think of.

Another one: ""MAIRE"" but R banned.

""MAJOR"" R banned.

""MANAS"" no E.

So I think ""MAYBE"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the banned letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L.

Y and B are not in the banned list.

Similarly for I and Z.

We can also consider ""MAYBE"" because it has B, which is more common than Z.

But ""MAIZE"" is also common.

Perhaps we can look for words that have vowels in position 3? Like I in ""MAIZE"".

But let's choose ""MAYBE"".

I recall that in Wordle, ""MAYBE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MAIZE"" is valid.

But to be safe, let's go with ""MAYBE"".

So the next guess is ""MAYBE"".

But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""MAGEE"" is a proper name, but sometimes accepted? But ""MAYBE"" is better.

""MAYBE"" is a common word.

So I'll go with that.

<guess>maybe</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  
    - A is in the word but not at position 3.  
    - C, R, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""saute""**  
  - S(x), A(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.  
    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  
    - S, U, and T are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""maple""**  
  - M(✓), A(✓), P(x), L(x), E(✓)  
  - Interpretation:  
    - M is correctly placed at position 1.  
    - A is correctly placed at position 2 (reaffirmed).  
    - E is correctly placed at position 5 (reaffirmed).  
    - P and L are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Position 1: M (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 2: A (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5: E (confirmed ✓).  
   - The word pattern is: **M A _ _ E**.  
   - Positions 3 and 4 are unknown.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: C, R, N, S, U, T, P, L are not in the word.  
   - Total excluded: 8 letters.  

3. **Included Letters**:  
   - Confirmed: M, A, E (all placed correctly).  
   - No duplicates are indicated, but we cannot rule them out entirely.  

4. **Available Letters for Positions 3 and 4**:  
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Remaining vowels: I, O (A and E are already placed).  
   - High-frequency letters to test: B, D, G, I, O, Y (prioritized for information gain).  

5. **Possible Words Matching `M A _ _ E`**:  
   - Common options:  
     - ""MAYBE"" (tests Y at position 3, B at position 4).  
     - ""MAIZE"" (tests I at position 3, Z at position 4).  
     - ""MADGE"" (tests D at position 3, G at position 4).  
   - ""MAYBE"" is selected because:  
     - It uses high-frequency letters (Y and B) not yet tested.  
     - It is a very common English word (reducing invalid guess risk).  
     - If incorrect, feedback on Y and B will quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., ""MAIZE"" or ""MADGE"").  

### Next Guess: ""MAYBE""
This guess tests the unknown positions with new letters and could solve the puzzle if correct. If not, the feedback will isolate the solution.",Guess 4: maybe -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) B(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
