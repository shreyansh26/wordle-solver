We are at the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we need to choose a starting word.
 The goal is to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I'll choose a word that has common letters and distinct letters. ""CRANE"" is a popular start because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

<thinking>
For the first guess, without any prior information, I should select a word that maximizes the amount of potential information. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants and avoids repeating letters. 

Considerations:
- High-frequency letters in English: E, A, R, T, O, I, etc.
- ""CRANE"" covers 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E. These include common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). 
- Alternatively, words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also work well. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced starting word with high-information potential.

Based on the feedback from Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Feedback interpretation:**
   - R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _
   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got '-'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all 'x'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.

2. **What we know so far:**
   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _
   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got '-', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).
   - Letters C, N, E are absent.
   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.

3. **Strategy for next guess:**
   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).
   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.
   - Avoid using C, N, E since they're ruled out.
   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.

4. **Possible choices:**
   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.
   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _
     - But we don't know last two letters.
   - Need to guess a valid English word.
   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.

5. **Criteria:**
   - Must have R in position 2.
   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I'll try position 3 for A.
   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.
   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.
     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.
     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.
     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P
     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.
     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.

6. **Selecting a word:**
   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H
     - Why TRASH?
        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn't been tested yet.
        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).
        - Tests S and H, common letters.
        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.

7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**
   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn't satisfy _ R _ _ _.

   Correction: Must have R in second position.

8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**
   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.
     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? 

   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.

   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.

   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.

9. **Confirming word validity:**
   - TRASH is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""TRASH"".
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback:  
- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  
- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  

Strategy for the next guess:  
1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  
2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can't be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  
3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  
4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  
   - T in position 1 (new),  
   - R in position 2 (fixed),  
   - A in position 3 (under test),  
   - S in position 4 (new),  
   - H in position 5 (new).  
This covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.

So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _\n   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got \'-\'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all \'x\'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.\n\n2. **What we know so far:**\n   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _\n   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got \'-\', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).\n   - Letters C, N, E are absent.\n   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\n3. **Strategy for next guess:**\n   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).\n   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.\n   - Avoid using C, N, E since they\'re ruled out.\n   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.\n\n4. **Possible choices:**\n   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.\n   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _\n     - But we don\'t know last two letters.\n   - Need to guess a valid English word.\n   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.\n\n5. **Criteria:**\n   - Must have R in position 2.\n   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I\'ll try position 3 for A.\n   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.\n   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.\n     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.\n     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.\n     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P\n     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.\n     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.\n\n6. **Selecting a word:**\n   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H\n     - Why TRASH?\n        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn\'t been tested yet.\n        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).\n        - Tests S and H, common letters.\n        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.\n\n7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**\n   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn\'t satisfy _ R _ _ _.\n\n   Correction: Must have R in second position.\n\n8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**\n   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.\n     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? \n\n   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.\n\n   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.\n\n   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.\n\n9. **Confirming word validity:**\n   - TRASH is a valid English word.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""TRASH"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback:  \n- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  \n- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  \n- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  \n\nStrategy for the next guess:  \n1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  \n2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can\'t be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  \n3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  \n4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  \n   - T in position 1 (new),  \n   - R in position 2 (fixed),  \n   - A in position 3 (under test),  \n   - S in position 4 (new),  \n   - H in position 5 (new).  \nThis covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>trash</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong, and R is fixed at 2, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""trash""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so second letter remains R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; note that in ""trash"", A is in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5)
- S: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)

So, what we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- The letter A is present, but not in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H (all marked as 'x' in both guesses). Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, and from the second, not in position 3.

Remaining possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes A in either position 4 or 5 (we can try to test one of these positions to get more information).
- Uses new letters that haven't been eliminated (so avoid C, N, E, T, S, H).

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to test the position of A. Since we don't know if it's in 4 or 5, we can try putting it in position 4 and use a word that has a new set of letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has A in position 4 and then use other letters to test for the remaining spots.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and then either 4 or 5 (if A is in 4, then 5 is free; if A is in 5, then 4 is free). Actually, positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 are open, but A is in one of 4 or 5.

Let me denote the word as: [1] R [3] [4] [5]

We know:
- [2] = R
- A is either in [4] or [5]

We need to test:
- Position 1: we haven't tested any letter there (except T in guess2 which was wrong, and A in guess1 which was wrong and not there). So we need to try a new letter in position 1.
- Position 3: we haven't had any feedback for position 3 (in guess1, A was in position 1 and was wrong, in guess2, A was in position 3 and was wrong because it's not in the right position? Wait, no: the feedback for A in guess2 was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not A, and we haven't tested any other letter in position 3.

Actually, in guess2, we had T in position 1 (wrong), R in 2 (correct), A in 3 (wrong position, so A is not in 3, but present elsewhere). So position 3 is open and we don't know what is there.

So we have:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H}
- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H} and not A (because if A were in position 3, it would have been correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so A is not in 3). But note: A is in the word, just not in 3.
- Position 4 and 5: one of them is A, the other is unknown.

So the word has the form: [1] R [3] [4] [5] with A being either in [4] or [5].

We need to design a guess that can help us narrow down the possibilities.

Option 1: Assume A is in position 4 and then choose a word that has A in 4, and then use new letters for 1, 3, and 5.

Option 2: Assume A is in position 5 and choose a word with A in 5, and new letters for 1,3,4.

But we don't know which one, so we should choose a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can only put A in one position per guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in it? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A to get more information about its position. Since we know it's in 4 or 5, we can try one of them.

Let me try to put A in position 4. Then the word would be: [1] R [3] A [5]

We need to choose [1], [3], and [5] from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and distinct ones.

Common letters: O, L, I, P, etc.

Possible words: 
- BROAD: B R O A D -> but O and D are new. But we have A in position 4? BROAD: positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This seems good.

But let's check if B, O, D are available? We haven't used them, so yes.

Another: DROPS -> D R O P S -> but S is eliminated (from guess2: S is x). So not allowed.

GROAN -> G R O A N -> but N is eliminated (from guess1: N is x). Not allowed.

PROUD -> P R O U D -> but no A? We need to have A in the word. We are trying to put A in position 4.

So BROAD: B R O A D -> valid? Let me check: B, R, O, A, D. All distinct and not eliminated.

Another: FROAD? Not a word.

GROAN is invalid because of N.

So BROAD is a candidate.

What about putting A in position 5? Then the word would be: [1] R [3] [4] A

Possible words: 
- OPERA -> O P E R A -> but E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ULTRA -> U L T R A -> T is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ZEBRA -> Z E B R A -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- BRAVA -> B R A V A -> duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically Wordle allows duplicates. However, in this case, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But let's see: BRAVA is not common. Also, we have A in position 3 and 5? But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don't know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn't, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A's. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as '-' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it's not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.

So for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.

Possible: 
- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.

Another: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don't want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid for our purpose.

So PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.

Other options: 
- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.
- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.

So we have two candidate words: 
1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D
2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A

Which one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.

In BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.
In PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.

But note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as '-' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it's in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it's in 5, else if '-' then it must be in 4.

But we can get information about the other letters as well.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it's in the word. And we need to find its position.

I think we have to commit to one.

Let me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.

But we can also consider other words.

What about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.

""GROWL"" -> no A.

We need to include A.

Another word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.

""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.

So BROAD seems a good choice.

But let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.

""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.

""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.

So PRIMA might be one of the few.

But PRIMA is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.

I think BROAD is a solid choice.

But wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as '-' (because it's in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as '-'.

So either way, we get the position of A.

But we also get information about the other letters.

I'll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.

So the guess is ""broad"".

But let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.

So it's valid.

Another candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.

""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.

So BROAD it is.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, I choose ""broad"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  
  - C, N, and E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  
  - T, S, and H are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
- **A's Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 3).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn't (4 or 5).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it's in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  
- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H). Good options: B, O, D (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
- **Word Choice**: ""BROAD"" fits perfectly:  
  - B (position 1, new),  
  - R (position 2, fixed),  
  - O (position 3, new),  
  - A (position 4, testing A's location),  
  - D (position 5, new).  
- **Why ""BROAD""?** It maximizes information by testing A in a new position and covers three new common letters.

But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as '-' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it's not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.

So for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.

Possible: 
- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.

Another: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don't want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid for our purpose.

So PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.

Other options: 
- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.
- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.

So we have two candidate words: 
1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D
2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A

Which one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.

In BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.
In PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.

But note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as '-' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it's in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it's in 5, else if '-' then it must be in 4.

But we can get information about the other letters as well.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it's in the word. And we need to find its position.

I think we have to commit to one.

Let me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.

But we can also consider other words.

What about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.

""GROWL"" -> no A.

We need to include A.

Another word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.

""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.

So BROAD seems a good choice.

But let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.

""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.

""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.

So PRIMA might be one of the few.

But PRIMA is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.

I think BROAD is a solid choice.

But wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as '-' (because it's in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as '-'.

So either way, we get the position of A.

But we also get information about the other letters.

I'll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.

So the guess is ""broad"".

But let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.

So it's valid.

Another candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.

""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.

So BROAD it is.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  
  - C, N, and E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  
  - T, S, and H are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
- **A's Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 3).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn't (4 or 5).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it's in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  
- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H). Good options: B, O, D (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
- **Word Choice**: ""BROAD"" fits perfectly:  
  - B (position 1, new),  
  - R (position 2, fixed),  
  - O (position 3, new),  
  - A (position 4, testing A's location),  
  - D (position 5, new).  
- **Why ""BROAD""?** It maximizes information by testing A in a new position and covers three new common letters.",Guess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(-) R(✓) O(-) A(-) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ARBOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we need to choose a starting word.
 The goal is to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I'll choose a word that has common letters and distinct letters. ""CRANE"" is a popular start because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.<thinking>
For the first guess, without any prior information, I should select a word that maximizes the amount of potential information. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants and avoids repeating letters. 

Considerations:
- High-frequency letters in English: E, A, R, T, O, I, etc.
- ""CRANE"" covers 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E. These include common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). 
- Alternatively, words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also work well. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced starting word with high-information potential.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Feedback interpretation:**
   - R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _
   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got '-'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all 'x'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.

2. **What we know so far:**
   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _
   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got '-', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).
   - Letters C, N, E are absent.
   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.

3. **Strategy for next guess:**
   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).
   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.
   - Avoid using C, N, E since they're ruled out.
   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.

4. **Possible choices:**
   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.
   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _
     - But we don't know last two letters.
   - Need to guess a valid English word.
   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.

5. **Criteria:**
   - Must have R in position 2.
   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I'll try position 3 for A.
   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.
   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.
     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.
     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.
     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P
     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.
     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.

6. **Selecting a word:**
   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H
     - Why TRASH?
        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn't been tested yet.
        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).
        - Tests S and H, common letters.
        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.

7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**
   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn't satisfy _ R _ _ _.

   Correction: Must have R in second position.

8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**
   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.
     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? 

   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.

   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.

   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.

9. **Confirming word validity:**
   - TRASH is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""TRASH"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback:  
- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  
- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  

Strategy for the next guess:  
1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  
2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can't be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  
3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  
4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  
   - T in position 1 (new),  
   - R in position 2 (fixed),  
   - A in position 3 (under test),  
   - S in position 4 (new),  
   - H in position 5 (new).  
This covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.

<guess>trash</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong, and R is fixed at 2, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""trash""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so second letter remains R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; note that in ""trash"", A is in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5)
- S: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)

So, what we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- The letter A is present, but not in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H (all marked as 'x' in both guesses). Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, and from the second, not in position 3.

Remaining possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes A in either position 4 or 5 (we can try to test one of these positions to get more information).
- Uses new letters that haven't been eliminated (so avoid C, N, E, T, S, H).

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to test the position of A. Since we don't know if it's in 4 or 5, we can try putting it in position 4 and use a word that has a new set of letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has A in position 4 and then use other letters to test for the remaining spots.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and then either 4 or 5 (if A is in 4, then 5 is free; if A is in 5, then 4 is free). Actually, positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 are open, but A is in one of 4 or 5.

Let me denote the word as: [1] R [3] [4] [5]

We know:
- [2] = R
- A is either in [4] or [5]

We need to test:
- Position 1: we haven't tested any letter there (except T in guess2 which was wrong, and A in guess1 which was wrong and not there). So we need to try a new letter in position 1.
- Position 3: we haven't had any feedback for position 3 (in guess1, A was in position 1 and was wrong, in guess2, A was in position 3 and was wrong because it's not in the right position? Wait, no: the feedback for A in guess2 was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not A, and we haven't tested any other letter in position 3.

Actually, in guess2, we had T in position 1 (wrong), R in 2 (correct), A in 3 (wrong position, so A is not in 3, but present elsewhere). So position 3 is open and we don't know what is there.

So we have:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H}
- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H} and not A (because if A were in position 3, it would have been correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so A is not in 3). But note: A is in the word, just not in 3.
- Position 4 and 5: one of them is A, the other is unknown.

So the word has the form: [1] R [3] [4] [5] with A being either in [4] or [5].

We need to design a guess that can help us narrow down the possibilities.

Option 1: Assume A is in position 4 and then choose a word that has A in 4, and then use new letters for 1, 3, and 5.

Option 2: Assume A is in position 5 and choose a word with A in 5, and new letters for 1,3,4.

But we don't know which one, so we should choose a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can only put A in one position per guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in it? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A to get more information about its position. Since we know it's in 4 or 5, we can try one of them.

Let me try to put A in position 4. Then the word would be: [1] R [3] A [5]

We need to choose [1], [3], and [5] from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and distinct ones.

Common letters: O, L, I, P, etc.

Possible words: 
- BROAD: B R O A D -> but O and D are new. But we have A in position 4? BROAD: positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This seems good.

But let's check if B, O, D are available? We haven't used them, so yes.

Another: DROPS -> D R O P S -> but S is eliminated (from guess2: S is x). So not allowed.

GROAN -> G R O A N -> but N is eliminated (from guess1: N is x). Not allowed.

PROUD -> P R O U D -> but no A? We need to have A in the word. We are trying to put A in position 4.

So BROAD: B R O A D -> valid? Let me check: B, R, O, A, D. All distinct and not eliminated.

Another: FROAD? Not a word.

GROAN is invalid because of N.

So BROAD is a candidate.

What about putting A in position 5? Then the word would be: [1] R [3] [4] A

Possible words: 
- OPERA -> O P E R A -> but E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ULTRA -> U L T R A -> T is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ZEBRA -> Z E B R A -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- BRAVA -> B R A V A -> duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically Wordle allows duplicates. However, in this case, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But let's see: BRAVA is not common. Also, we have A in position 3 and 5? But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don't know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn't, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A's. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as '-' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it's not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.

So for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.

Possible: 
- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.

Another: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don't want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid for our purpose.

So PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.

Other options: 
- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.
- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.

So we have two candidate words: 
1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D
2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A

Which one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.

In BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.
In PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.

But note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as '-' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it's in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it's in 5, else if '-' then it must be in 4.

But we can get information about the other letters as well.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it's in the word. And we need to find its position.

I think we have to commit to one.

Let me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.

But we can also consider other words.

What about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.

""GROWL"" -> no A.

We need to include A.

Another word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.

""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.

So BROAD seems a good choice.

But let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.

""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.

""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.

So PRIMA might be one of the few.

But PRIMA is acceptable.

I think BROAD is a solid choice.

But wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as '-' (because it's in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as '-'.

So either way, we get the position of A.

But we also get information about the other letters.

I'll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.

So the guess is ""broad"".

But let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.

So it's valid.

Another candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.

""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.

So BROAD it is.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _\n   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got \'-\'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all \'x\'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.\n\n2. **What we know so far:**\n   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _\n   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got \'-\', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).\n   - Letters C, N, E are absent.\n   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\n3. **Strategy for next guess:**\n   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).\n   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.\n   - Avoid using C, N, E since they\'re ruled out.\n   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.\n\n4. **Possible choices:**\n   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.\n   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _\n     - But we don\'t know last two letters.\n   - Need to guess a valid English word.\n   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.\n\n5. **Criteria:**\n   - Must have R in position 2.\n   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I\'ll try position 3 for A.\n   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.\n   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.\n     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.\n     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.\n     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P\n     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.\n     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.\n\n6. **Selecting a word:**\n   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H\n     - Why TRASH?\n        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn\'t been tested yet.\n        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).\n        - Tests S and H, common letters.\n        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.\n\n7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**\n   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn\'t satisfy _ R _ _ _.\n\n   Correction: Must have R in second position.\n\n8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**\n   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.\n     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? \n\n   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.\n\n   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.\n\n   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.\n\n9. **Confirming word validity:**\n   - TRASH is a valid English word.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""TRASH"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback:  \n- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  \n- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  \n- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  \n\nStrategy for the next guess:  \n1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  \n2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can\'t be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  \n3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  \n4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  \n   - T in position 1 (new),  \n   - R in position 2 (fixed),  \n   - A in position 3 (under test),  \n   - S in position 4 (new),  \n   - H in position 5 (new).  \nThis covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>trash</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong, and R is fixed at 2, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""trash""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so second letter remains R)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; note that in ""trash"", A is in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3.

Since we don\'t know if it\'s in 4 or 5, we can try putting it in position 4 and use a word that has a new set of letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has A in position 4 and then use other letters to test for the remaining spots.\n\nBut note: we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and then either 4 or 5 (if A is in 4, then 5 is free; if A is in 5, then 4 is free). Actually, positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 are open, but A is in one of 4 or 5.\n\nLet me denote the word as: [1] R [3] [4] [5]\n\nWe know:\n- [2] = R\n- A is either in [4] or [5]\n\nWe need to test:\n- Position 1: we haven\'t tested any letter there (except T in guess2 which was wrong, and A in guess1 which was wrong and not there). So we need to try a new letter in position 1.\n- Position 3: we haven\'t had any feedback for position 3 (in guess1, A was in position 1 and was wrong, in guess2, A was in position 3 and was wrong because it\'s not in the right position? Wait, no: the feedback for A in guess2 was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not A, and we haven\'t tested any other letter in position 3.\n\nActually, in guess2, we had T in position 1 (wrong), R in 2 (correct), A in 3 (wrong position, so A is not in 3, but present elsewhere). So position 3 is open and we don\'t know what is there.\n\nSo we have:\n- Position 1: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H}\n- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H} and not A (because if A were in position 3, it would have been correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so A is not in 3). But note: A is in the word, just not in 3.\n- Position 4 and 5: one of them is A, the other is unknown.\n\nSo the word has the form: [1] R [3] [4] [5] with A being either in [4] or [5].\n\nWe need to design a guess that can help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Assume A is in position 4 and then choose a word that has A in 4, and then use new letters for 1, 3, and 5.\n\nOption 2: Assume A is in position 5 and choose a word with A in 5, and new letters for 1,3,4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we should choose a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can only put A in one position per guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A in it? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A to get more information about its position. Since we know it\'s in 4 or 5, we can try one of them.\n\nLet me try to put A in position 4. Then the word would be: [1] R [3] A [5]\n\nWe need to choose [1], [3], and [5] from the remaining letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information by using common letters and distinct ones.\n\nCommon letters: O, L, I, P, etc.\n\nPossible words: \n- BROAD: B R O A D -> but O and D are new. But we have A in position 4? BROAD: positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This seems good.\n\nBut let\'s check if B, O, D are available? We haven\'t used them, so yes.\n\nAnother: DROPS -> D R O P S -> but S is eliminated (from guess2: S is x). So not allowed.\n\nGROAN -> G R O A N -> but N is eliminated (from guess1: N is x). Not allowed.\n\nPROUD -> P R O U D -> but no A? We need to have A in the word. We are trying to put A in position 4.\n\nSo BROAD: B R O A D -> valid? Let me check: B, R, O, A, D. All distinct and not eliminated.\n\nAnother: FROAD? Not a word.\n\nGROAN is invalid because of N.\n\nSo BROAD is a candidate.\n\nWhat about putting A in position 5? Then the word would be: [1] R [3] [4] A\n\nPossible words: \n- OPERA -> O P E R A -> but E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n- ULTRA -> U L T R A -> T is eliminated. Not allowed.\n- ZEBRA -> Z E B R A -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n- BRAVA -> B R A V A -> duplicate A? And we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically Wordle allows duplicates. However, in this case, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. But let\'s see: BRAVA is not common. Also, we have A in position 3 and 5? But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don\'t know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn\'t, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A\'s. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as \'-\' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it\'s not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.\n\nSo for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.\n\nPossible: \n- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.\n\nAnother: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don\'t want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So invalid for our purpose.\n\nSo PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.\n\nOther options: \n- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.\n- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.\n\nSo we have two candidate words: \n1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D\n2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A\n\nWhich one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.\n\nIn BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.\nIn PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.\n\nWe have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.\n\nBut note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as \'-\' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it\'s in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it\'s in 5, else if \'-\' then it must be in 4.\n\nBut we can get information about the other letters as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it\'s in the word. And we need to find its position.\n\nI think we have to commit to one.\n\nLet me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nWhat about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n\n""GROWL"" -> no A.\n\nWe need to include A.\n\nAnother word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.\n\n""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.\n\nSo BROAD seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.\n\n""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.\n\n""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.\n\nSo PRIMA might be one of the few.\n\nBut PRIMA is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.\n\nI think BROAD is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as \'-\' (because it\'s in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as \'-\'.\n\nSo either way, we get the position of A.\n\nBut we also get information about the other letters.\n\nI\'ll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.\n\nSo the guess is ""broad"".\n\nBut let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.\n\n""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.\n\nSo BROAD it is.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  \n  - C, N, and E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  \n  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  \n  - T, S, and H are absent.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  \n- **A\'s Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can\'t be in 1, 2, or 3).  \n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn\'t (4 or 5).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it\'s in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  \n- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H).

We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C: x (absent)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R)
- A: - (present, but wrong position; cannot be position 1)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

**Guess 2: trash**
- T: x (absent)
- R: ✓ (confirmed position 2)
- A: - (present, still wrong position; cannot be in position 3 because it was guessed there and marked wrong)
- S: x (absent)
- H: x (absent)

**Guess 3: broad**
- B: - (present but wrong position; cannot be in position 1)
- R: ✓ (confirmed position 2)
- O: - (present but wrong position; cannot match position 3)
- A: - (present but wrong position; now, since guessed position 4, cannot be in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

### Summary of known information:
1. **Fixed Position**: Position 2 is R → Pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. **Present Letters**: A, B, O are in the word. (From A, - in crane/trash/broad; B, - in broad; O, - in broad)
3. **Absent Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H, D (from x in all guesses)
4. **Position Constraints**:
   - A: Cannot be in pos 1, 3 (from crane and trash), and now also not pos 4 (from broad). Since A must be in the word and we only have positions 1-5, the only possibility left is **position 5**.
   - B: Cannot be in pos 1 (from broad), so it must be in pos 3 or 4? (Positions available: 1, 3, 4, 5 but position 1 is not A or B, and A is now determined to be in pos 5).
   - O: Cannot be in pos 3 (from broad), so it must be in pos 1 or 4.
   - Pattern constraints: We have positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 with A fixed in position 5: _ R _ ? A

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 and must be present, A must be in position 5. So now the pattern is: _ R _ _ A

Then we have:
- Position 1: must be O? Or could be other? We know O is present and cannot be in position 3, so it could be in pos 1 or 4.
- B is present and not in position 1 (from guess3), so B must be in position 3 or 4?
- Positions: 
  - Pos 1: Not B (eliminated), not A (already placed elsewhere), could be O or other?
  - Pos 3: Possible B or O? But O cannot be in pos 3 (from broad), so pos 3 cannot be O. So pos 3 must be B or a new letter?
  - Pos 4: Where O or B can be? Or a new letter?
  - Pos 5: A (fixed)

We have three positions: 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters including B and O (which are both present) and possibly one new letter? We know that B and O are present, so two letters in the word: B and O are included, and A and R.

The word must contain R, A, B, O (because B and O are marked as present).

But we have positions for them: 
- Pos2: R
- Pos5: A
- Then B and O must be in positions 1,3,4 but only three positions? Positions 1,3,4 need three letters? But we only have two additional known letters? That implies one more letter must be used.

Actually, the word has five distinct letters? Or duplicates? We haven't encountered duplicates yet.

Given that A is fixed in pos5, R in pos2, now positions 1,3,4 must be filled with two letters (B and O) but that would require one duplicate? Wait, we don't know. The word might have duplicate letters.

But from the feedback, we know:

- In guess3: broad -> B(-), O(-), A(-) meaning B, O, A are in the word but not in positions guessed (B not pos1, O not pos3, A not pos4).

So B, O, A are all present and moving.

But we now know A is in pos5. O and B must be placed in positions 1,3,4. Since there are three positions and two letters, we must have one letter duplicated? Or we have a fourth distinct letter? 

This depends. Let me list constraints:

- Letters in the word: R (pos2), A (pos5), B (somewhere), O (somewhere), and possibly another letter? Because we don't know if there are duplicates.

But we have not encountered duplicates, so let's suppose the word has four distinct letters? That doesn't make sense because we have five positions.

The word must have at least the letters R, A, B, O. Since B and O are present, and no duplicates indicated, we need to find a fourth letter for one of the spots? But that would mean the word might have five distinct letters?

Actually, the word could have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence. For example, it could have two O's? But not necessarily.

However, with A fixed in pos5, R in pos2, we have positions 1,3,4 to fill. We know B and O must be in these three positions, but since there are three spots, we need one more letter. Therefore, there must be a fourth distinct letter besides R, A, B, O.

So the letters: R, A, B, O, and one unknown letter (say X) must be present.

We need to guess a word of the form: [1] R [3] [4] A

Constraints:

- Position 1: Cannot be B (because in guess3, B in pos1 was marked as wrong position), cannot be A (already used). Could it be O? Yes, O is allowed. Or another letter.
- Position 3: Cannot be O (from guess3), also cannot be R or A (they are fixed). Could it be B? Possibly. Or another letter.
- Position 4: Cannot be A (fixed elsewhere), and also cannot be B? Or O? Actually, from guess3, when we put A in pos4, it was marked wrong position, so pos4 cannot be A. But for B and O, their wrong position marks don't directly forbid position 4? 

Actually, for position 4: In guess3, we had A in pos4 marked '-', meaning A is not in pos4. But B and O were in other positions: B in pos1 was wrong, O in pos3 was wrong. So we don't have information about position 4 for B or O. So B or O could be in position 4.

We know:
- B cannot be in pos1 (from guess3)
- O cannot be in pos3 (from guess3)

So:
- Position 1: Allowed letters: O (since O can be here), or new letters (but B forbidden). Actually, position 1 could be O or another letter Y, as long as Y not eliminated.
- Position 3: Cannot be O; could be B or new letters (but not eliminated ones).
- Position 4: Could be B, O, or new letter.

We also must include both B and O in the word. So the remaining letter can be new.

Now, what letters are available? Eliminated: C, E, T, N, H, S, D.

So available: F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: L, M, P, U, etc.

We need to form a word: [1] R [3] [4] A

Possible candidates:

- Since B and O must be placed, let's try to put O in position 1? Then word: O R [3] [4] A, with O in pos1.

Position 3 cannot be O (since O cannot be in pos3). So position 3 must be B or new? And position 4 must be the other or B/O.

But B must be somewhere: so either position 3 or 4.

Example: ORB? Not 5 letters; ORBIT is 6 letters. So 5-letter words: ""ORGMA""? Not a word. 

Words with OR? : ""ORBIT"" too long; other? ""ORGAN"" -> has G and N, but N eliminated? N is eliminated. So not allowed.

""ORVAL""? Not common.

""OCTAN"" -> has C and T eliminated? And N.

Hard to find. 

Instead, put B in position 3? Then word: [1] R B [4] A

Since B cannot be in pos1, but can be in pos3.

Then position 1 can be O? Then word: O R B [4] A -> ORB?A? Need letter in pos4.

Common word: ""ORBIT"" too long; ""ORBED"" -> E eliminated; not allowed.

""GRBAA"" not a word.

Another: ""ARBOR"" -> but A would be in pos1? But A cannot be in pos1 (from guess1). And also, A is fixed at pos5. So no A in pos1.

So try word: O R B I A? Not a real word? ""ORBIA"" not common.

Alternative: Position 1 not O? So another letter.

Put O in position 4? Then word: [1] R [3] O A

Position 3 cannot be O? So position 3 must be B or new letter.

If position 3 is B, then word: [1] R B O A

What words fit this pattern? E.g., ""URBOA""? Not a word. ""URBAN"" -> has N? N eliminated? Urban has U, R, B, A, N? Not good.

""CARBO"" has C eliminated.

""HERBO"" has E and H eliminated.

Possible: ""CRWTH"" not applicable.

Maybe we need to use a different letter.

List all possible English words ending with ...RA: or pattern _R_ _A.

And containing B and O.

But given the constraints: positions 3 and 4 must contain B and O? Or one of them.

Actually, we have the word: [1] R [3] [4] A

Letters: [1], [3], [4] are distinct? Since no duplicates found.

Letters required: B and O must be in positions 1,3,4 (with exceptions). And [1] cannot be B, [3] cannot be O.

So:
Pos1: Cannot be B; must be O or a new letter, say Z.
Pos3: Cannot be O; must be B or new.
Pos4: No constraint? Could be O or B or new.

But we must have B and O placed.

Case 1: Let O be in position 1.
Then word: O R [3] [4] A
Pos3: cannot be O, so must be B or new letter, say X.
Pos4: must be the other? Or also Y? 
But we need both B and O, O is fixed at pos1, so we need B somewhere. So either pos3 or pos4 must be B.

So possibilities:
- O R B [4] A → [4] must be a letter? We must have a word: ORB?A? That's five letters: ORB + a letter + A? ORB_x_A? Not standard.
Actually, ""OR"" in beginning, then a letter, then A? Like ""ORCHA""? Not 5 letters? Well, ""ORCIN"" has N? ""ORGAN"" has N eliminated.

I know ""ORTHO"" but doesn't end with A.

Not many common words starting with ORA? ORA ends, but we need middle.

Perhaps ""OPERA"" but E eliminated; earlier.

Case 2: O in position 4.
Then word: [1] R [3] O A
Pos3 cannot be O? So pos3 must be B or new letter.

If pos3 is B: then [1] R B O A → 4 letters? So [1] is one letter.

Words: C R B O A? C eliminated. T R B O A? T eliminated. No.

Without B: then if O is in pos4, and we need B somewhere? Then pos1 must be B? But position 1 cannot be B (from guess3). Contradiction? So we must have B in pos3.

But if O is in pos4 and B in pos3, then we have [1] R B O A → what word has that pattern? ""URBAN"" has U R B A N? Not A at end. ""TURBO"" ends with O, not A.

Perhaps ""TABOR"" but T eliminated and pattern different.

Alternative: We need to include a new letter.

Since position 1 cannot be B, and we need B in the word, B must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, O must be in position 1 or 4.

If O is in position 4, then B cannot be in position 4? But we don't have a constraint against B in position 4? So possible.

Then word: [1] R [3] O A? But [1] and [3] to be filled, with B being one of them? But [1] cannot be B. So B must be in position 3.

But position 3 cannot be O? But we are putting O in 4, so position 3 can be B.

So pattern: [1] R B O A

Required: [1] is a letter not B, not eliminated.

What words fit ""?RB A""? With O at position 4? Pattern: [1] R B O A → as five letters, it should be words with four letters before A? Not ""?RBOA"" but ""?R B O A"", so the last two are O and A? So it's [1]RB, then O at 4, A at 5? So positions:
1: ?, 2: R, 3: B, 4: O, 5: A → word: X R B O A

What 5-letter word ends with ""RBOA""? None common? ""CARBOA"" not word.

Perhaps not? The pattern is [1] R [3] [4] A? And [4] is O, then [3] could be B? Positions: 1:X, 2:R, 3:B, 4:O, 5:A → XRBOA.

I cannot think of any English word fitting that.

Perhaps O in position 1 and B in position 4?

Then word: O R [3] B A

Position 3 cannot be O? But O is at 1, so position 3 could be a new letter.

So pattern: O R X B A, where X is a new letter not O, not B? But B is at position 4.

Word: O R ? B A

Example: ""ORUBA"" not English; ""ORABA"" not; ""ORTHA"" not a word; ""ORIBA"" not common.

""ORGAN"" invalid due to N.

Perhaps we missed something: it could be duplicate letters? For example, the word might have two O's? But not common.

Another: position 1 can be a new letter, O in position 4, B in position 3? But we already saw that.

Let's list the possibilities:

Since A is at 5, R at 2, we have positions 1,3,4.

B and O must occupy two of these, and the third is another letter Y.

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be B (from guess3), so it must be O or Y.
- Position 3: cannot be O (from guess3), so it must be B or Y.
- Position 4: no constraints directly? But could be any.

Now, if position 1 is O, then position 3 cannot be O (but O is at 1) so position 3 must be B or Y.
If position 3 is B, then position 4 must be Y? Then word: O R B Y A
If position 3 is Y, then position 4 must be B? Then O R Y B A

Similarly, if position 1 is Y, then position 3: cannot be O, so B or Y? But if Y at position 1 and position 3, that might be duplicate? Possible, but we avoid for now.
Position 3 could be B.

But let's first try to have all distinct.

Candidate: O R B [4] A -> We need a word like ""ORBAA"" not, or ""ORBAL""? Not common words.

What about ""ORBLE"" E eliminated.

Perhaps ""ROBIN"" N eliminated.

Another: ""OCTAD"" T and D eliminated? D eliminated? From guess3, D is x, so eliminated.

So available letters: F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common ones: G, L, M, P, U, I, etc.

Put O in pos1 and B in pos4? Then pattern: O R [3] B A

Position 3 must be a new letter.

So ""OR?BA"" words: In English, there is ""OR ABA"" not; ""ORUBA"" not; ""ORFEA"" not.

In fact, no common English words end with ""BA"" except like ""TORBA"" which may not be common or ""KARBA"" not.

Perhaps ""CERBA"" not.

Maybe ""AR DE"" not.

I think we need to consider O in position 4.

Or perhaps B in position 4 and O in position 1? But then position 3 must be a new letter.

But we have the same problem.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""BARON"", but N eliminated, pattern not: B would be in pos1, but B cannot be in pos1.

""ABHOR"" A not in pos1.

We know A is at 5, so perhaps ""LABRA""
 has L A B R A, but A at pos2? We need R at pos2, so pattern: to have R at pos2, e.g., ""LRABA"" not a word.

So let's list words that meet: _ R _ _ A, with letters including B and O.

For example:
- URB A N (6 letters)
- ""URBAN"" is 5 but ends with N eliminated.
- ""HEROD A"" too long.
- ""PROA"" 4 letters.

Perhaps ""FRO A M"" not.

""GROAN"" N eliminated.

"" BROAD"" already tried, but it had O and B, but in that guess, O was in pos3 which we know it's not, so that's why not correct.

But now we have an additional constraint.

Let's think of common words ending with ""A"" and pattern.
e.g., ""OPERA"" E eliminated.
""ULTRA"" T and U? U is available? U R L T A, but T eliminated.
""EXTRA"" E and T eliminated.

""BRAVA"" B R A V A -> positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we know A cannot be in position 3 (from feedback of trash and broad) because in trash we had A in pos3 and it was marked wrong position. So if the actual word had A in pos3, it should have been marked as correct? But it was not, so this word is invalid.

So ""BRAVA"" has A in pos3, not allowed.

Similarly, ""ORGAN"" not allowed.

Another: ""VIRGA"" not ending with A?

Words like: ""PIZZA"" not relevant.

""PARKA"" R not at pos2.

Perhaps ""KARMA"" R at pos2? K A R M A -> pos2 is A, but we need R at pos2. So not.

To have R at pos2: J R ? ? A, e.g., ""J R E W A"" not; ""CR  I S A"" C eliminated.

Perhaps ""GRAMA"" G R A M A -> positions: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But A is in position 3, but A cannot be in pos3! So this would be invalid a> Why? Because from previous feedback, when we guessed ""trash"" with A in pos3, if the actual word had A in pos3, it should have been marked as correct. But it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position, so A is not in pos3. Therefore, ""GRAMA"" has A in pos3, impossible.

Similarly, we cannot have any word with A in pos3.

Therefore, only position 5 for A.

Back to the pattern: _ R _ _ A

With B and O in the word, not in forbidden positions.

And one more letter.

Common words: let's think of any.

- ""B R O W A"" ""BROWA"" not a word? ""BROW"" is 4 letters.
- ""B R I D A"" ""BRIDA"" not English.

""ORIEL"" not ending with A.

Perhaps ""ORIKS"" not and S eliminated.

Another: ""M  R  B O A"" not.

Perhaps we try ""GARDA"" G A R D A -> A must be at 5? But pattern has R at position 3 in ""GARDA""? 
G(1) A(2) R(3) D(4) A(5) -> pos2 is A, not R. But we need pos2 to be R.

So must be: X R Y Z A.

With Y and Z including B and O.

Perhaps the word is ""c R Y P T A"" too long.

I recall that ""BER oA"" not.

Let's give up and try a word that has B and O and the pattern.

For example, ""ROBOT"" not ending with A.

Another: ""ABOUT"" no R pos2.

Perhaps ""B R A V O"" V and O available? But is it ending with O? B R A V O, not A at end.

We have A at end.

Perhaps ""PAREO"" not ending with A.

Limited options.

What common English words fit _ R _ _ A? 
- U R A E A? not.
- H R Y A A? not.
- With O and B: ""B R O O A"" not.

Duplicate letters are possible. For example, two O's? And no B? But we have B present, so must include B.

Perhaps the word has B and O in the same position? No.

Another feedback insight: in guess3, when we guessed ""broad"", we had O in position 3 and it was marked '-', meaning O is in the word but not at position 3. So O must be in position 1 or 4 or have duplicate? But we have position 1 and 4 available.

Similarly for B: cannot be in position 1, so in position 3 or 4.

But then if O is in position 1, B in position 4, then position 3 is new letter: O R ? B A

Searching: ""ORIBA"" is a proper noun? Not common.
""ORIYA"" is a language, Oriya. Is that accepted? 5-letter word: O-R-I-Y-A. So pattern: O R I Y A.

Positions: O(1), R(2), I(3), Y(4), A(5).

In this word, does it have B? No. But we must have B present? From feedback in guess3, B is in the word, so ""ORIYA"" does not have B, so not possible.

Similarly, if O in position 1 and B in position 3: O R B ? A -> ""ORB aA"" ""ORBA A"" not. ""OR BIA"" ""ORBIA"" not a word.

B in position 3 and O in position 4: word: ? R B O A, as above.

e.g., ""URBOA"" not.
""ERB O A"" not.

Perhaps ""TURBO"" not with A at end.

So perhaps a word like ""BARONA"" too long.

I think we need to consider the possibility that our reasoning is wrong.

Perhaps the word has duplicate letters? For example, two B's? Then B could be in position 1? But guess3 had B in position1 marked ""-"", meaning B is in the word but not at position 1. So it can be elsewhere.

But in the actual word, B might be at positions 3 and 4? But then in guess3, when we put B at position1, it was marked present in the word but not at position1, which is consistent if the word has B elsewhere.

Similarly for O, we have only one O marked.

So let's not assume distinct letters.

The word has: R at pos2, A at pos5, and must have B and O somewhere in the other positions.

Positions 1,3,4 are for B and O and possibly duplicates or a new letter.

Since B is in the word (but not at pos1), and O is in the word (but not at pos3).

So possible configurations:
1. B at pos3, O at pos4:  R B O ...?  [1] R B O A
2. B at pos4, O at pos1: O R [3] B A
3. O at pos1, O at pos4, but then only one O mentioned? No, the feedback doesn't show duplicates but if there are two O's, it might show only one '-' but we have only one - for O in guess3, so it could be.

But generally, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, feedback only indicates the presence based on the actual occurrences.

But to simplify, let's assume for now we can have duplicates.

Then, for example, position 1: O, position 3: X (new), position 4: B; or position 1: O, position 3: B, position 4: X.

 etc.

With that in mind.

Try ""ORALS"", but S eliminated.

""ORVAL"", not common? But S and H eliminated, but VAL? V, A, L available? But A is at pos5, not in middle.

Pattern: for ORVAL: O R V A L -> but A should be at pos5, here A is at pos4.

Not.

Position 1: U, then U R ? ? A, and need B and O.

For example, ""URBAN"" not allowed.

""UMBER"" E eliminated.

""UMBRA"" B R A? Umbra: U M B R A -> positions: U(1), M(2), B(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R should be in pos2, here R is in pos4.

Incorrect pattern.

For it to be _ R _ _ A, the letters pos1, pos3, pos4 must be U, M, B for example but not forming a word.

Another common word: ""PARIS"" S eliminated.

""MERIT"" E and T eliminated.

We need to guess a word.

Perhaps "" P R O B L A"" too long.

Let's think: ""BRAWL"" no R at pos2 with A at end.

Perhaps are there words like ""CRAWL"" C eliminated.

""GRAAL"" G R A A L -> not, A at pos3.

But A cannot be at pos3.

So  also not.

Another: ""KARAT"" T eliminated.

 so running out of options.

Perhaps "" O R W W A"" not.

Let's list of common 5-letter words ending with 'A':

- PIZZA -> positions: P I Z Z A, pos2 must be R? No.
- PAGER E eliminated.
- etc.

Perhaps ""DERby"" not ending with A.

It's difficult.

Alternatively, we might have missed that in guess3, the feedback for B and O was '-', which means they are in the word, but perhaps they are duplicated? Or we made a mistake.

Another possibility: position 3 in the actual word could be O, but with duplicates. For example, if there is another O in the word? We only have one O marked, but it could be that it was not revealed.

But in guess3, when we put O in position 3, if the actual word has an O in position 3, it would be marked as correct if correct, or '-' if there's an O but it should be correct if in position. But we got '-', so the O in position 3 is not correct, meaning there is no O in position 3. So it cannot be O in position 3.

Similarly for B in position 1.

So, the only solution is to use a new letter.

Try "" U R G B A"" not a word.

Or "" M R B O A"" ""MRBOA"" not.

 let's try a word like ""PRO a"" not.

Perhaps ""BROMO"" B R O M O -> not ending with A.

So I think we have to choose a word that satisfies the constraints.

One possibility is ""ORIXA"" or ""ORYXA"", which is a genus, but not common English. But for the purpose, we can try.

Another: ""BORAX"" B O R A X -> positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5) -> but R must be at position 2, here it is at position 3. Not matching pattern.

For pattern _ R _ _ A: borax has R at position 3, not 2.

So not.

""AR Deb"" not.

Perhaps the word is "" KAR MA"" R at pos2? K A R M A -> pos2 is A, not R.

To have R at pos2: for example, ""GRAV A"" G R A V A -> but then A at pos3? Not allowed.

""TRADE"" T and E eliminated.

I think we may have to renege.

Another idea: perhaps in guess3, the feedback for A being '-' in position 4 doesn't preclude a later position for a different A? But since we know A is in position 5, and not in 4, that's fine.

For the guess, we can try a word where we put O in position 1, B in position 4, and a new letter in position 3.

So word: O R ? B A

With ? being a new letter, say L or M.

For example, ""ORLBA"" not a word.

""ORMBA"" not.

""ORUBA"" not common.

But there is ""ORBAL"" not English.

Perhaps ""ORIEL"" not ending with A.

So let's try ""ORIB A"" then.

Or perhaps ""ORTHA"" not and T eliminated.

I found a word: ""ORTHO"" does not end with A.

But we have to have ending with A.

So only choice is to try a word like ""URBEA"" not.

Perhaps ""Pueblo"" too long.

I think for the sake of the game, I'll try ""ORiel"" not.

Another candidate: "" DO R  I S"" not.

We have to use the available letters.

Perhaps ""FROMAN"" too long.

Guess: ""URBAN"" is not allowed due to N.
""URBMA"" not.

So to progress, we can choose a word that has the pattern and includes B and O, or test the position.

Let's give up and guess "" O R G B A"" not, but in desperation, try a word like ""ORGAN"" but N eliminated, not.

Perhaps ""ORGIA"" O R G I A -> pattern: O(1) R(2) G(3) I(4) A(5)

In this word, does it have B? No. But we must have B, because from guess3, B is in the word.

So not.

Similarly, BROWN no A at end.

Therefore, the fourth letter must be B or O or both with a new letter.

Let's try "" B R O T H"" but H eliminated and no A at end.

Not.

Perhaps ""BAR I A"" but A not at end.

""LORD"" not.

I think I have to consult a list or something.

Perhaps "" R O B IN"" not for A.

Another: ""ABHOR"" A not at pos1? A B H O R -> pattern: A(1) B(2) H(3) O(4) R(5) -> but R should be at pos2, not pos5. Also, A is at pos1, but already eliminated.

Not.

Maybe ""OCTAD"" C and T and D eliminated.

So available letters: G, I, P, U, etc.

Try ""GROUP"" P O at end.

Not.

Then ""GRIPE"" E eliminated.

Perhaps ""PRIM"" not.

""PRIMA"" P R I M A -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5)

In this word, does it have B? No. But we must have B, so not.

This is frustrating.

Perhaps our earlier deduction that A must be in position 5 is incorrect? Let's review.

In guess3: broad -> feedback: A in position 4 was marked '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 4.

Previously, from crane and trash, A cannot be in position 1 or 3.

Position 2 is R, taken.

So the only position left for A is position 5.

Therefore, it must be position 5.

So I think we have to find a word with the pattern. Let's try "" U R B O A"" not a word.

Another: ""V R B O A"" not.

 Or ""W R B O A"" not.

Perhaps ""BUR OA"" not.

 or ""CURIA"" R at pos2? C U R I A -> positions: C(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) A(5)، so R at pos3, not 2.

 not.

Then "" R a I s S"" not ending with A.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" A then R at pos2? A R I S E, but not ending with A, and E eliminated.

At this point, to make progress, i'll guess ""ORZBA"" not, but we can try ""ORIB "" not.

Perhaps the word is ""ORINO"" not.

We know and O must be in, let's include O and B in the guess.

So for the guess, put O in position 4 not position 1. Then pattern: [1] R [3] O A

And include B in position 3? then [1] R B O A

With [1] as a letter, say G: ""GRBOA"" not a word.

L: ""LRBOA"" not.

Maybe P: ""PRBOA"" not.

U: ""URBOA"" not.

I: ""IRBOA"" not.

M: ""MRBOA"" not.

V: ""VRBOA"" not.

W: ""WRBOA"" not.

X: ""XRBOA"" not.

No words.

Perhaps O in position 1 and B in position 3, and position 4 as L: ORBLA not.

Only ""OR"" then ""BLEA"" not.

I think we have to choose a word even if it's not perfect.

Let's try ""ORIEL"" not ending with A.

 or "" PRIed"" not.

Another common word: ""BER or A"" not.

Perhaps ""B e R L A"" Berlin not.

""BERME"" not.

I think the only common word that might fit is ""ULTRA"" but T is in it and eliminated.

Or ""EXTRA"" eliminated.

So perhaps the word is ""OPERA"" but E eliminated.

Therefore, for the sake of guessing, I will try "" PR a M A"" but ""PRAMA"" not a word.

""PRIMA"" we tried that.

Then ""BOREE"" not.

Perhaps the word has duplicates: for example, ""BOOK"" not.

Let's guess ""GROUP"" and change pattern, but not.

Conclusion: based on the constraints, the word might be ""BROME"" but E eliminated and not ending with A.

So I think I have to pass and choose a word that at least tests common letters.

Guess ""PIOLA"" not.

 or ""LOVEA"" L O V E A, E eliminated.

So available letters: G, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.

Guess a word like ""GLOAT"" T eliminated.

 ""LOGIA"" L O G I A -> pattern: L(1) O(2) G(3) I(4) A(5)

Here, position 2 is O, not R, but we need R at position 2, so not.

The pattern must have R at position 2.

So guess with R at position 2: _ R _ _ A.

 include B and O.

Then ""CRWTH"" not.

So my final guess: let's try ""URBAN"" even though N is eliminated? No, we cannot.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we need to choose a starting word.
 The goal is to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I'll choose a word that has common letters and distinct letters. ""CRANE"" is a popular start because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.<thinking>
For the first guess, without any prior information, I should select a word that maximizes the amount of potential information. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants and avoids repeating letters. 

Considerations:
- High-frequency letters in English: E, A, R, T, O, I, etc.
- ""CRANE"" covers 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E. These include common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). 
- Alternatively, words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also work well. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced starting word with high-information potential.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Feedback interpretation:**
   - R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _
   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got '-'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all 'x'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.

2. **What we know so far:**
   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _
   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got '-', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).
   - Letters C, N, E are absent.
   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.

3. **Strategy for next guess:**
   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).
   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.
   - Avoid using C, N, E since they're ruled out.
   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.

4. **Possible choices:**
   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.
   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _
     - But we don't know last two letters.
   - Need to guess a valid English word.
   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.

5. **Criteria:**
   - Must have R in position 2.
   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I'll try position 3 for A.
   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.
   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.
     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.
     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.
     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P
     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.
     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.

6. **Selecting a word:**
   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H
     - Why TRASH?
        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn't been tested yet.
        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).
        - Tests S and H, common letters.
        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.

7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**
   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn't satisfy _ R _ _ _.

   Correction: Must have R in second position.

8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**
   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.
     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? 

   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.

   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.

   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.

9. **Confirming word validity:**
   - TRASH is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""TRASH"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback:  
- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  
- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  

Strategy for the next guess:  
1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  
2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can't be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  
3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  
4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  
   - T in position 1 (new),  
   - R in position 2 (fixed),  
   - A in position 3 (under test),  
   - S in position 4 (new),  
   - H in position 5 (new).  
This covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.

<guess>trash</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong, and R is fixed at 2, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""trash""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so second letter remains R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; note that in ""trash"", A is in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5)
- S: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)

So, what we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- The letter A is present, but not in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H (all marked as 'x' in both guesses). Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, and from the second, not in position 3.

Remaining possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes A in either position 4 or 5 (we can try to test one of these positions to get more information).
- Uses new letters that haven't been eliminated (so avoid C, N, E, T, S, H).

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to test the position of A. Since we don't know if it's in 4 or 5, we can try putting it in position 4 and use a word that has a new set of letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has A in position 4 and then use other letters to test for the remaining spots.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and then either 4 or 5 (if A is in 4, then 5 is free; if A is in 5, then 4 is free). Actually, positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 are open, but A is in one of 4 or 5.

Let me denote the word as: [1] R [3] [4] [5]

We know:
- [2] = R
- A is either in [4] or [5]

We need to test:
- Position 1: we haven't tested any letter there (except T in guess2 which was wrong, and A in guess1 which was wrong and not there). So we need to try a new letter in position 1.
- Position 3: we haven't had any feedback for position 3 (in guess1, A was in position 1 and was wrong, in guess2, A was in position 3 and was wrong because it's not in the right position? Wait, no: the feedback for A in guess2 was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not A, and we haven't tested any other letter in position 3.

Actually, in guess2, we had T in position 1 (wrong), R in 2 (correct), A in 3 (wrong position, so A is not in 3, but present elsewhere). So position 3 is open and we don't know what is there.

So we have:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H}
- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H} and not A (because if A were in position 3, it would have been correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so A is not in 3). But note: A is in the word, just not in 3.
- Position 4 and 5: one of them is A, the other is unknown.

So the word has the form: [1] R [3] [4] [5] with A being either in [4] or [5].

We need to design a guess that can help us narrow down the possibilities.

Option 1: Assume A is in position 4 and then choose a word that has A in 4, and then use new letters for 1, 3, and 5.

Option 2: Assume A is in position 5 and choose a word with A in 5, and new letters for 1,3,4.

But we don't know which one, so we should choose a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can only put A in one position per guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in it? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A to get more information about its position. Since we know it's in 4 or 5, we can try one of them.

Let me try to put A in position 4. Then the word would be: [1] R [3] A [5]

We need to choose [1], [3], and [5] from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and distinct ones.

Common letters: O, L, I, P, etc.

Possible words: 
- BROAD: B R O A D -> but O and D are new. But we have A in position 4? BROAD: positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This seems good.

But let's check if B, O, D are available? We haven't used them, so yes.

Another: DROPS -> D R O P S -> but S is eliminated (from guess2: S is x). So not allowed.

GROAN -> G R O A N -> but N is eliminated (from guess1: N is x). Not allowed.

PROUD -> P R O U D -> but no A? We need to have A in the word. We are trying to put A in position 4.

So BROAD: B R O A D -> valid? Let me check: B, R, O, A, D. All distinct and not eliminated.

Another: FROAD? Not a word.

GROAN is invalid because of N.

So BROAD is a candidate.

What about putting A in position 5? Then the word would be: [1] R [3] [4] A

Possible words: 
- OPERA -> O P E R A -> but E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ULTRA -> U L T R A -> T is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ZEBRA -> Z E B R A -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- BRAVA -> B R A V A -> duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically Wordle allows duplicates. However, in this case, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But let's see: BRAVA is not common. Also, we have A in position 3 and 5? But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don't know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn't, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A's. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as '-' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it's not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.

So for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.

Possible: 
- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.

Another: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don't want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid for our purpose.

So PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.

Other options: 
- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.
- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.

So we have two candidate words: 
1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D
2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A

Which one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.

In BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.
In PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.

But note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as '-' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it's in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it's in 5, else if '-' then it must be in 4.

But we can get information about the other letters as well.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it's in the word. And we need to find its position.

I think we have to commit to one.

Let me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.

But we can also consider other words.

What about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.

""GROWL"" -> no A.

We need to include A.

Another word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.

""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.

So BROAD seems a good choice.

But let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.

""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.

""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.

So PRIMA might be one of the few.

But PRIMA is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.

I think BROAD is a solid choice.

But wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as '-' (because it's in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as '-'.

So either way, we get the position of A.

But we also get information about the other letters.

I'll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.

So the guess is ""broad"".

But let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.

So it's valid.

Another candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.

""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.

So BROAD it is.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  
  - C, N, and E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  
  - T, S, and H are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
- **A's Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 3).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn't (4 or 5).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it's in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  
- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H). Good options: B, O, D (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
- **Word Choice**: ""BROAD"" fits perfectly:  
  - B (position 1, new),  
  - R (position 2, fixed),  
  - O (position 3, new),  
  - A (position 4, testing A's location),  
  - D (position 5, new).  
- **Why ""BROAD""?** It maximizes information by testing A in a new position and covers three new common letters.

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, and from the second, not in position 3.\n\nRemaining possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Has R in the second position.\n- Includes A in either position 4 or 5 (we can try to test one of these positions to get more information).\n- Uses new letters that haven\'t been eliminated (so avoid C, N, E, T, S, H).\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also want to test the position of A. Since we don\'t know if it\'s in 4 or 5, we can try putting it in position 4 and use a word that has a new set of letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has A in position 4 and then use other letters to test for the remaining spots.\n\nBut note: we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and then either 4 or 5 (if A is in 4, then 5 is free; if A is in 5, then 4 is free). Actually, positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 are open, but A is in one of 4 or 5.\n\nLet me denote the word as: [1] R [3] [4] [5]\n\nWe know:\n- [2] = R\n- A is either in [4] or [5]\n\nWe need to test:\n- Position 1: we haven\'t tested any letter there (except T in guess2 which was wrong, and A in guess1 which was wrong and not there). So we need to try a new letter in position 1.\n- Position 3: we haven\'t had any feedback for position 3 (in guess1, A was in position 1 and was wrong, in guess2, A was in position 3 and was wrong because it\'s not in the right position? Wait, no: the feedback for A in guess2 was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not A, and we haven\'t tested any other letter in position 3.\n\nActually, in guess2, we had T in position 1 (wrong), R in 2 (correct), A in 3 (wrong position, so A is not in 3, but present elsewhere). So position 3 is open and we don\'t know what is there.\n\nSo we have:\n- Position 1: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H}\n- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H} and not A (because if A were in position 3, it would have been correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so A is not in 3). But note: A is in the word, just not in 3.\n- Position 4 and 5: one of them is A, the other is unknown.\n\nSo the word has the form: [1] R [3] [4] [5] with A being either in [4] or [5].\n\nWe need to design a guess that can help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Assume A is in position 4 and then choose a word that has A in 4, and then use new letters for 1, 3, and 5.\n\nOption 2: Assume A is in position 5 and choose a word with A in 5, and new letters for 1,3,4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we should choose a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can only put A in one position per guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A in it? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A to get more information about its position. Since we know it\'s in 4 or 5, we can try one of them.\n\nLet me try to put A in position 4. Then the word would be: [1] R [3] A [5]\n\nWe need to choose [1], [3], and [5] from the remaining letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information by using common letters and distinct ones.\n\nCommon letters: O, L, I, P, etc.\n\nPossible words: \n- BROAD: B R O A D -> but O and D are new. But we have A in position 4? BROAD: positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This seems good.\n\nBut let\'s check if B, O, D are available? We haven\'t used them, so yes.\n\nAnother: DROPS -> D R O P S -> but S is eliminated (from guess2: S is x). So not allowed.\n\nGROAN -> G R O A N -> but N is eliminated (from guess1: N is x). Not allowed.\n\nPROUD -> P R O U D -> but no A? We need to have A in the word. We are trying to put A in position 4.\n\nSo BROAD: B R O A D -> valid? Let me check: B, R, O, A, D. All distinct and not eliminated.\n\nAnother: FROAD? Not a word.\n\nGROAN is invalid because of N.\n\nSo BROAD is a candidate.\n\nWhat about putting A in position 5? Then the word would be: [1] R [3] [4] A\n\nPossible words: \n- OPERA -> O P E R A -> but E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n- ULTRA -> U L T R A -> T is eliminated. Not allowed.\n- ZEBRA -> Z E B R A -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n- BRAVA -> B R A V A -> duplicate A? And we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically Wordle allows duplicates. However, in this case, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. But let\'s see: BRAVA is not common. Also, we have A in position 3 and 5? But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don\'t know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn\'t, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A\'s. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as \'-\' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it\'s not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.\n\nSo for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.\n\nPossible: \n- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.\n\nAnother: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don\'t want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So invalid for our purpose.\n\nSo PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.\n\nOther options: \n- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.\n- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.\n\nSo we have two candidate words: \n1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D\n2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A\n\nWhich one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.\n\nIn BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.\nIn PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.\n\nWe have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.\n\nBut note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as \'-\' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it\'s in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it\'s in 5, else if \'-\' then it must be in 4.\n\nBut we can get information about the other letters as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it\'s in the word. And we need to find its position.\n\nI think we have to commit to one.\n\nLet me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nWhat about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n\n""GROWL"" -> no A.\n\nWe need to include A.\n\nAnother word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.\n\n""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.\n\nSo BROAD seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.\n\n""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.\n\n""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.\n\nSo PRIMA might be one of the few.\n\nBut PRIMA is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.\n\nI think BROAD is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as \'-\' (because it\'s in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as \'-\'.\n\nSo either way, we get the position of A.\n\nBut we also get information about the other letters.\n\nI\'ll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.\n\nSo the guess is ""broad"".\n\nBut let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.\n\n""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.\n\nSo BROAD it is.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  \n  - C, N, and E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  \n  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  \n  - T, S, and H are absent.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  \n- **A\'s Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can\'t be in 1, 2, or 3).  \n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn\'t (4 or 5).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it\'s in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  \n- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H). Good options: B, O, D (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  \n- **Word Choice**: ""BROAD"" fits perfectly:  \n  - B (position 1, new),  \n  - R (position 2, fixed),  \n  - O (position 3, new),  \n  - A (position 4, testing A\'s location),  \n  - D (position 5, new).  \n- **Why ""BROAD""?** It maximizes information by testing A in a new position and covers three new common letters.\n\n<guess>broad</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(-) R(✓) O(-) A(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(-) R(✓) O(-) A(-) D(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trash -> T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)
Guess 3: broad -> B(-) R(✓) O(-) A(-) D(x)

Analysis:

From all feedback:
- R is in position 2 and correct (so word has R as the second letter).

For A:
- In guess 1, A was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- In guess 2, A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position (so A is not in position 3).
- In guess 3, A was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position (so A is not in position 4).

Therefore, A must be in position 5 (since it has to be somewhere and positions 1,2,3,4 are eliminated). Position 2 is taken by R so it cannot be A. Thus, A must be in position 5.

Also, for the feedback of guess 3: 
- B is marked as present but wrong position. Since we had B in position 1 and it's wrong position, and we know the word doesn't have a letter at position 1 yet, B must be in the word but not in position 1. Possible positions: 3? (since 2 is R and 5 is A, so only positions 1,3,4 left? But position 1 is wrong, so B must be in position 3? But let's see: positions available for B: not 1, and not 4? Wait, what are the positions? The word is [1][2=R][3][4][5=A]. So B is in the word, but not in position 1. Therefore, B must be in position 3? Because position 2 is R (fixed) and position 5 is A (now deduced). Position 4 is free? Or is it? We don't know yet. But the feedback says B is present but wrong position, and since it was guessed in position 1, it could be in any of the other positions except those eliminated? But we know position 1 is eliminated for B. So B could be in 3 or 4? But we don't have information about other positions.

Clarifying:

The word pattern: Pos1 - ? , Pos2 - R, Pos3 - ?, Pos4 - ?, Pos5 - A (now confirmed because A must be there).

In guess 3, B was in position 1 and marked as '-', meaning B is in the word but not in position 1. So B can be in position 3 or position 4 (since position 2 is R and position 5 is A, so B cannot be there).

Similarly, O in guess 3 was in position 3 and marked as '-', meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. So O must be in position 1 or position 4? Because position 2 is R and position 5 is A. So possibilities: O in 1 or 4.

Also, D is absent (D(x)).

Eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H, D (from all feedback: D(x) in guess3). And letters that are present: R, A (confirmed), and B, O (from feedback in guess3).

We also have from feedback: 
- B(-) means B is present but not in pos1. 
- O(-) means O is present but not in pos3.

And A is in pos5.

So the word has: 
- R in pos2
- A in pos5
- B in either pos3 or pos4
- O in either pos1 or pos4

But note: if B is in pos3, then O must be in pos1 or pos4? And if B is in pos4, then O must be in pos1? Because if O were in pos4, that would conflict if B is also in pos4? But each position is separate.

So possible placements:

Case 1: B in pos3 and O in pos1 or pos4? Not necessarily: there could be two positions.

The word: [1] R [3] [4] A

We have B and O both in the word, and also we don't know if there are other letters? And the feedback might show more.

Also, we must consider that there might be duplicate letters? But no evidence.

Now, positions:
- B cannot be in pos1, so it must be in pos3 or pos4.
- O cannot be in pos3, so it must be in pos1 or pos4.

Also, note that if O is in pos4 and B is in pos3, that's possible. Or if O is in pos1 and B in pos3, that's possible. Or O in pos1 and B in pos4, also possible. Or O in pos4 and B in pos4? That would be same position, not possible. So O and B cannot both be in pos4.

Therefore, possible configurations:

1. O in pos1, B in pos3: then what about pos4? Some letter.
2. O in pos1, B in pos4
3. O in pos4, B in pos3

But not: O in pos4 and B in pos4 (conflict).

Now, we also know that in guess3, we had: B in pos1 (marked wrong), R in pos2 (correct), O in pos3 (marked wrong), A in pos4 (marked wrong), D in pos5 (absent). 

But we now know A is in pos5, so in guess3, we had A in pos4? But actual A is in pos5. So when we put A in pos4, it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in pos4, which is consistent because A is in pos5.

Similarly, O was in pos3 and marked '-', meaning O is not in pos3.

Now, we have to assign pos1, pos3, pos4, but we have B and O to place and one more letter? Because with B, O, R, A, and one other.

The word has five letters: we know R, A are in, and B, O are in, but so far only four: so there must be an additional letter for the fifth position? Because we only have R, A, B, O so far? No, wait: we have four letters, but the word is five positions: [1] R [3] [4] A.

So there must be another letter. Which one? We haven't been informed about any other letter.

From eliminated letters: we know C, N, E, T, S, H, D are absent. So we have to choose from other letters.

But we don't know what that fifth letter is? So we need to include both the known letters (B and O) and an unknown letter? Actually, in our guess, we have to include R and A in fixed positions? And then assign B and O appropriately and choose another letter.

But we need to guess a word.

So let's list possible words given the pattern.

First, the word must be: [1] R [3] [4] A

And it must contain B and O.

Also, since B cannot be in pos1 and O not in pos3.

Possible cases:

Case 1: O in pos1, then the word is O R _ _ A
Then B must be in pos3 or pos4? B is in the word. So if O is in pos1, then B can be in pos3 or pos4.

But also, there is a fifth letter? Actually, if B is in pos3, then pos4 is another letter. If B in pos4, then pos3 is another letter.

Case 2: O in pos4, then word is _ R _ O A
Then B must be in pos3? Because if B were in pos4, conflict with O. But pos4 is O. So B could be in pos3? Then pos1 is another letter.

Similarly, case 3: O cannot be in pos3? Already eliminated.

Also, we have case 3 from earlier: O in pos4 and B in pos3? Which is covered in case 2? Case 2 is when O is in pos4: then word: [1] R [3] O A, and B must be in pos3? But B cannot be in pos3? Pos3 is available? But then [3] would be B? But O is in pos4.

If O is in pos4, then B must be in another position: either pos1 or pos3? But B cannot be in pos1 (because in guess3, B was in pos1 and was wrong position? But that doesn't mean it cannot be in other positions? But B is in the word and can be in pos3? Yes.

In case 2: word pattern: [1] R [3] O A

B must be in the word: so either [1] is B or [3] is B? But [1] cannot be B? Because B cannot be in pos1? So must be [3] = B? Then the word is [1] R B O A.

With [1] being a letter not eliminated.

Similarly, for case 1: O in pos1 -> O R [3] [4] A, and B must be either in [3] or [4]. Also, the other position is filled by a fifth letter.

But let's enumerate:

First, we know the word has exactly these five letters? No, letters are: R, A, B, O, and one more? But we don't know the fifth. So we must guess a word that satisfies the pattern.

Potential words:

From case: O in pos1, B in pos3 -> word: O R B _ A -> O R B ? A

What can be in pos4? Must be a letter not eliminated, and form a word.

Possible words: ORB A? Not 5 letters? ORB is three letters. So ORB?A? Like ORBAA? No.

With O in position 1: O R ? ? A

And B in position 3: so O R B ? A

Possible? Words: ORB A? Not matching. ORBED? 5 letters but ED? E eliminated. ORBIA? Not a word. Do valid words exist? Like ORBAL? No.

Alternatively, O in pos1 and B in pos4: then word: O R ? B A

What can be in position 3? A letter L? ORBLA? No. ORDBA? No. Valid: maybe ORDBA? Not a word. Known words: ORGAN? O R G A N -> but N eliminated. ORDAL? Not common. Perhaps ORBEA? But E eliminated.

So hard to find.

Now, case 2: O in pos4, then word: [1] R [3] O A

And B must be in [3] because cannot be in [1]? So: [1] R B O A

Now, [1] must be a letter: what letters can it be? Not eliminated: available: F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we need a valid English word.

Examples: ARBOA? But A is at the end? Words: PROBA? Not common. CROBA? C eliminated. GROBA? Not a word. BROOA? No. What about ""FROB A""? No.

I think ""BRAVO"" comes to mind? But not matching: B R A V O -> but positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But we need pos5 as A? And O in pos4? Not matching.

Let me think: word with pattern [1] R B O A

Possible? Like URBOA? No. Perhaps ARBOA? Not a word. I recall ""turbo"" but T is eliminated and ends with O.

Another thought: since we need pos5=A, and pos4=O, and pos3=B? Then word like ? R B O A

Known: URB O A? Not a word. CR B O A? C eliminated. GR B O A -> ""GRBOA"" not recognized.

Perhaps ""carbo"" but C eliminated and pos5 O not A.

I think I made a mistake: we also have the possibility that B is not in pos3? Earlier I said if O is in pos4 then B must be in pos3? But why? Actually, B could be in pos3 but also it could be in other positions? But wait, only pos1,3,4? But pos1 is forbidden for B? So pos3 is the only choice? Also, note that pos4 is taken by O? So yes, B must be in pos3? Because if O is in pos4, and B is in the word and cannot be in pos1, then B must be in pos3? Then [1] is a new letter.

So pattern: [1] R B O A

But is there a word? Let me try: ""GRBOA"" doesn't exist. ""ARBOA"" won't. Think of common words: Maybe ""PROBE"" but E eliminated and ends with E.

Perhaps non-English? But must be English word.

Another idea: perhaps the fifth letter is one we haven't considered? Or duplicate letters? But unlikely.

Now, recall that case 3: O in pos4 and B in pos3? But we are covering that.

But let's go back: feedback of guess3: broad: B(-) R(✓) O(-) A(-) D(x)

We concluded A must be in pos5.

But also, note that in broad, O was in pos3 and was marked as wrong position, meaning O is in the word but not pos3. And since the word has O, it must be in either pos1 or pos4? Similarly for B, not pos1 so in pos3 or pos4? But now if we fix A to pos5, and R to pos2, the positions are:

Pos1: could be O?
Pos3: could be B?
Pos4: could be B or O?

But if we place both, we need an arrangement.

Moreover, we haven't considered that there might be another letter? Actually, the word consists of five letters: we have R, A, B, O confirmed, and one more letter? Because in broad, we only got B, R, O, A, D? But D was absent? So the letters B, R, O, A are the only ones? Or are there more? We have exactly four letters from those symbols? And D is out, so yes, the word has at least B, R, O, A. But since there are five positions, either one of these is duplicated or there is a fifth letter? But from feedback, we don't know duplicates.

For example, it could have two B's or two O's? But not indicated so far.

First, assume no duplicates. Then the word has exactly four distinct letters? But five positions? That means one of the letters is duplicated.

So possible duplicated letter: R? But R is fixed. Or A, or B, or O? No, R is already placed, and in one position. So duplication must be in B or O or A? But A is fixed in pos5, so if duplicated, could be elsewhere? But we know A is not in pos1,3,4? From feedback. So A can only be in pos5? So duplication must be of B or O.

So possibilities:

1. B is duplicated: then B must appear in another position.
2. O is duplicated: then O must appear in another position.
3. Or both? But let's see with the feedback.

But first, let's list known: the word has R (pos2), A (pos5), B (somewhere not pos1), O (somewhere not pos3).

And we have five positions.

So for positions 1,3,4, they must be filled by B and O and possibly a duplication.

Case 1: no duplication, then we must have a fifth letter, say L, but then L must be in one of pos1,3,4, and B and O in the other two? But we have only three positions: 1,3,4.

Positions 1,3,4 are open.

We need to assign three values? But we only have two letters: B and O? And one more position, so must be a fifth letter.

But the fifth letter is unknown.

However, in our guesses, we haven't been told about any other letter being present? Only these are present: B, R, O, A.

But that means the word has only four distinct letters? Then one is repeated.

So duplication: either B or O repeated.

Now, feedback from guess3: in ""broad"", we had B and O, but they were in wrong positions. If there were duplicates, we might have gotten different feedback? But we didn't.

But let's check: if the actual word has two B's, for example, and we put B only in pos1, then it would be marked as present but wrong position, and the other positions where B exists could be affected, but since we didn't guess them, we don't know.

Similarly for O.

We have to consider duplication.

But to simplify, let's first try the case with a fifth letter. But what letter? We eliminate many.

Available letters: F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common: L, M, P, etc.

But also, from feedback, all other letters we've guessed are not in the word.

Now, back to pos of A: we know it's in pos5.

So the word is: [1] R [3] [4] A

Now, B is in the word: so in one of [1], [3], [4], but not [1] (because feedback), so in [3] or [4].

Similarly, O is in the word: in [1] or [4] (because not in [3]).

Now, assume no duplication, then there is a fifth letter, which is in the remaining position.

So possible arrangements:

1. B in [3], O in [1], then [4] = fifth letter. So word: O R B [X] A, where X is a letter.

2. B in [3], O in [4], then [1] = fifth letter. Word: [Y] R B O A

3. B in [4], O in [1], then [3] = fifth letter. Word: O R [Z] B A

4. B in [4], O in [4]? But conflict, same position. Impossible.

Note: case3: B in [4], O in [1]: then position! [3] is available: so O in [1], R in [2], [3] = ?, B in [4], A in [5].

Similarly, case2: B in [3], O in [4]: then [1] = ?, R, B, O, A.

Now, let's find if there are valid words.

First, case1: O on 1, B on 3, then [4] is X: word like ORB X A. Is there such a word? For example, with X=G? ""ORBGA"" not word. X=L? ""ORBLA"" not. X=P? ""ORBPA"" not. I don't know any English word with this pattern.

Case2: word: [Y] R B O A.

Possible Y to make a word. Y=F? ""FRBOA"" not. Y=G? ""GRBOA"" not a word. Y=K? ""KRBOA"" not. Y=L? ""LRBOA"" not. Y=M? ""MRBOA"" not. Y=P? ""PRBOA"" not. Y=U? ""URBOA"" not. Etc. No common words.

Case3: O in [1], [3] is Z, B in [4], A in [5]: so O R [Z] B A

Now, Z is a letter. What word? For example, OR Z B A.

Possible: with Z=A? But A is already in pos5? But duplication possible? But A is not in another position? We know A is only in pos5, because in guess1 and2 and3, when A was not in pos5, it was marked wrong position, but if it were in another position, it would have shown as duplicate? But in feedback, for guess3, when we put A in pos4, it was marked wrong position, so there is no A in pos4. Similarly, if there were A in pos3 or 1, it would have been caught. So the word has only one A, in pos5.

Similarly for other letters.

So Z cannot be A.

What words fit O R _ B A?

Examples: ""ORUBA"" — not English. ""ORMBA"" — not. ""OR CBA"" — C eliminated. Perhaps ""GORBA"" — not standard. I can't think of any.

Therefore, duplication may be there.

Suppose we have duplication.

For example, B is duplicated. Then B appears twice: once in [3] or [4], and once in another position. Similarly for O.

Now, from feedback, B cannot be in pos1. The positions available are only 3 and 4? And also, O must be placed.

Also, we need five letters.

Possible:

Say B is duplicated. Then the word has B in at least two positions. For example, B in pos3 and another B in pos4? But that's two B's.

Then O must be in pos1? Because O not in pos3, so if pos3 is B, O can be in pos1.

Similarly, pos4 could be B, but we have pos4: if we put B in pos3 and pos4, then word: [1] R B B A

But [1] must be O? Because O is in the word and must be somewhere. So O in [1]: word: O R B B A

Is that a word? ""ORBBA"" — not a valid English word.

If B is only in one of them, we need another position for B.

But positions are only 1,3,4 but 1 is forbidden for B? So if B is in [3], then another B must be in [4]? Or in [5]? But [5] is A, fixed.

So the only positions for second B are [4]? But then we have O R B B A, with [1] = O, like above.

But ""ORBBA"" is not a word.

If B is in [4], then another B must be in [3] or [1], but [1] not allowed, so only [3], same as above.

Now, for O duplicated. Then O must appear twice.

Positions for O: not pos3, so pos1 and pos4? Or pos1 and pos4.

And B must be in pos3 or pos4? But if O is in pos4, then pos4 is O, so B can only be in pos3.

Similarly, if O is in pos1 and pos4, then B must be in pos3.

So pattern: O in pos1, R in pos2, B in pos3, O in pos4, A in pos5: word: O R B O A

Is that a word? ""ORBOA"" — not a standard English word. Or ""ORB O A"" — no.

Perhaps the fifth letter is implied.

Another possibility: the letter fback is not giving us all. Perhaps I missed something.

Guess3: broad, positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5)

Feedback: B(-), R(✓), O(-), A(-), D(x)

So for positions:
- Pos1: B is present but not here (so in another position)
- Pos2: R correct
- Pos3: O not here, but present elsewhere
- Pos4: A not here, but present elsewhere (we know pos5)
- Pos5: D not in word

Now, with R at 2 and A at 5, the orrect word is [1] R [3] [4] A

B is in the word but not in [1], so in [3] or [4].

O is in the word but not in [3], so in [1] or [4].

Also, no information about [4] for B or O yet.

Now, we need to choose a word that includes both B and O, and satisfies the pattern.

Perhaps ""ROBIN"" but N eliminated and doesn't have A.

Or ""RABID"" but D eliminated.

Let's list of common words ending with A and having R at position 2.

For example, ""PUPPA"" but no R at 2? P U P P A.

Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] A

Common words: ULTRA - but T eliminated.
ZEBRA - E eliminated.
EXTRA - E and T eliminated.
 OPERA - E eliminated.
 HYDRA - H eliminated.
 KARMA - not ending with A? K A R M A -> but pos2 is R? K(1) A(2) R(3) M(4) A(5) -> but pos2 is A, not R. Here pos2 is A.

We need pos2=R.

Words like: ARRAY - but A at beginning? A R R A Y -> pos2=R, but pos5 not A.
 ERRATA - too long.

Perhaps ""BERRA"" - not a word.

""FURLA"" - not.

 Another idea: ""TORAH"" but T and H eliminated.

Perhaps ""MORAY"" - M O R A Y -> pos2= O? Not R.

 M(1) O(2) R(3) A(4) Y(5) — pos2 is O, not R.

We need something like: . R . . A

Words: ""GRAPA"" — not common.
""TRUFA"" — not.
 ""GRAMA"" — G R A M A -> but we know A is not in pos3? In guess2, when we had A in pos3 for ""trash"", it was marked as '-' , meaning that the A is in the word but not in pos3, so the word cannot have A in pos3. But in ""GRAMA"", A is in pos3 and pos5, but pos3 has A, so it should have been marked as correct for that A? But it wasn't in previous feedback, so word cannot have A in pos3. Therefore, ""GRAMA"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""URBAN"" - N eliminated.

 ""VROOM"" - no A.

Another: ""BREAD"" — but E and D eliminated.

 ""BROOD"" — no A, and D eliminated.

 ""BROIL"" — no A.

 ""ORAIS"" — S eliminated.

Perhaps ""BRAWL"" — but A in pos3 is not allowed.

We are stuck.

In guess3, feedback for A: broad had A in pos4 and was marked as '-', meaning A is in the word but not in pos4. But we have deduced that A must be in pos5. So why is this a problem? It's not.

Perhaps O can be in pos1, and B in pos4, and the fifth letter in pos3.

So word: O R [X] B A

What X? What 5-letter word like O R ? B A?

Examples: ""ORUBA"" is not standard. ""ORIBA"" — not common.

Perhaps it's ""ORBIT"" but T eliminated and ends with T, not A.

""FORUM"" — ends with M.

""VORM A"" — no.

Another possibilitiesi: but I think there is a word: ""U R A B A"" — U ra ba? Not English.

Perhaps "" Arab"" is five letters? A R A B ? But starts with A, and we know A not in pos1? wait ""ARABY"" A R A B Y -> positions: A(1), R(2), A(3), B(4), Y(5)  . But A is in pos1 and pos3? But in guess1 we had A in pos1 and it was marked as '-' , correct? Because at that time we didn't know, but we now know A i in pos5,  so this word 'ARAby' has A at pos1,3,5? But feedback from guess1: crane had A in pos1 and marked as '-', which is consistent if A is in the word but not in pos1? But and here it has A in pos1? Contradiction.

In 'ARABY', if secret word, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in pos1, it would be marked as '✓' if A is in pos1, or '-' if in another position. But since it has A in pos1, it should be '✓'. But in feedback, it was '-' for A, so secret word does not have A in pos1. Therefore, 'ARABY' is invalid.

Similarly, any word with A not in pos5 would conflict with our deduction.

Back to the feedback of guess2: trash with A in pos3, marked as '-', and now we know A in pos5, so it's consistent.

But for guess3, we have broad, with O in pos3 and marked as '-', so O is not in pos3.

And we have to guess.

Perhaps the word is ""PROSA"" but P R O S A -> S eliminated and A in pos5? P(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), A(5), but S is eliminated and O in pos3 is not allowed? According to feedback, O not in pos3? But here O is in pos3, so it should be marked as '✓' if in correct position, but in broad, when we put O in pos3, it was marked as '-', menacing it is not in pos3. Therefore, ""PROSA"" has O in pos3, so conflict.

What if the secret word is ""BROMA""? B R O M A -> positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5)

But in guess3, broad: we had O in pos3? If secret is ""BROMA"", then in feedback for broad, for position 3: O in guess vs O in secret? Should be '✓' if same letter and position. But it was marked as '-', meaning the O is not in pos3. So it cannot be ""BROMA"".

Similarly, my earlier candidate ""BROAD"" has O in pos3, conflict.

So what word could it be?

Perhaps ""BARON"" but N eliminated and A at pos2 but R is at pos2.

Another: word with O at beginning: ""OGRES"" — not ending with A.

""OCTAD"" — no A.

We need to include A at pos5.

Common words: ""INDIA"" - no R at2.
 RUSSIA - S eliminated.
 ARRIA - A at1 not allowed.
 ERICA - E eliminated.
Perhaps European words, but let's think.

Perhaps ""VIRGA"" - V I R G A ->, but pos2 is I, not R.

Unless it starts with: example have R at2:  this is hard.

 word:  R at2 and A at5: and includes B and O.

Known words: ""DROPS"" — no A and S eliminated.
 ""PROWL"" — no A.

Perhaps ""favor"" English but ends with R.

 another: ""rumor"" no A.

I think of ""MORRO"" — not.
 Perhaps ""BORAX"" - B O R A X -> positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5) -> pos2=O, not R.

Not.

What about ""BRAVO"" - B R A V O - pos3=A, but we know A not in pos3? because in feedback for guess2, when we put A in pos3, it was marked as '-' , but if secret has A in pos3, it should be '✓'. So no.

Unless the secret word has only A at pos5.

So the only position for A is pos5.

Therefore, let's assume the word is ""? R ? ? A"" and has B and O, with B not in pos1, O not in pos3.

Possible words from dictionary? Few candidates.

Candidates: 
- If O in pos1, B in pos4: OR ? B A
- If O in pos1, B in pos3: but not found earlier.
- If O in pos4, B in pos3: ? R B O A
- etc.

After searching, one possibility: ""ORTHO"" no A.
 ""OLEIC"" no A or R.

Perhaps ""OPERA"" but E eliminated.

I think I found a possibility: ""GROUP"" - no A.

 to ' FORAY' - F O R A Y -> pos2=O, not R.

Not.

 ""TROY"" - too short.

5-letter: ""TROIS"" no A.

 Perhaps ""BRIAR"" - B R I A R -> pos4=A? B(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), R(5) -> but pos5 not A, and we need pos5=A.

So not.

 Another: ""BARRE"" - no A ( ) and E eliminated.

Perhaps accepting that duplication is necessary, and the word is ""ABBOT"" but not matching.

 Maybe the feedback allows that.

But let's look for a word that fits the feedback.

From guess3 broad: B and O are present, both in wrong positions, and A in wrong position.

And we know R correct.

And D absent.

Also, secret has R at2, A at5.

So one word that comes to mind is ""broma"", but O in pos3, conflicting with feedback.

 unless for ""broma"", when we look at guess2 trash: t r a s h -> secret ""b ontains A at pos4? But ""broma"" has A at pos4: B R O M A: pos4=M, not A. For guess2 trash, which has A at pos3? secret has O at pos3, so for pos3: guess A vs secret O -> different, and since A is at pos5, it will be marked as '-' for A because A is in the word but not in pos3. Similarly for guess3 broad: pos3: O in guess vs secret O, same, so it should be '✓'? But in feedback, O was marked as '-', meaning it is not in the correct position? But if it is, then it should be '✓'. Contradiction.

For secret ""BROMA"" ( B R O M A), and guess ""broad"" ( B R O A D )

Feedback:
- B in pos1: secret has B in pos1? Should be '✓', but it was marked as '-'? Problem.

For pos1: Guess B, secret B -> should be '✓' if correct. But 'B(-)' means it is present but not in pos1? So contradiction.

So ""BROMA"" is not possible.

Secret must not have B in pos1.

Similarly, we know the secret has B, but not in pos1.

 so secret word like? for example, R at2, A at5, B at pos3 or4.

 and O at pos1 or4.

 and no other letters from eliminated list.

Let's try ""URBAN"" but we have U R B A N -> but N eliminated. And pos5=N, not A? Not.

 "" ROUND"" - no A and D eliminated.

 ' ROBOT' - no A.

 ' ALOHA' - A in pos1 not allowed.

 ' BRASS' - S eliminated.

 ' CRASS' - C and S eliminated.

 ' BLARE' - E eliminated.

 ' FLORA' - L, F available? Word: F L O R A -> but pos2=L, not R. Not matching the pattern.

 must be pos2=R.

 try ""GRAMA"" again: G R A M A -> but A in pos3, which should not be, but also for guess1: If secret ""GRAMA"", guess1 crane: pos1 C vs G -> x, pos2 R vs R -> ✓, pos3 A vs R -> no, but wait secret has A in pos3 and pos5, but guess has A in pos1, so for feedback: A in guess pos1, but secret has A in pos3 and5, so A is in the word, so marked as '-' for A in pos1. Then for guess2 trash: secret ""GRAMA"", guess ""trash"": pos1 T vs G -> x, pos2 R vs R -> ✓, pos3 A vs A -> should be '✓' because same letter and position, but in feedback it was marked as '-' for A, which is contradiction.

Therefore, ""GRAMA"" is invalid because A in pos3 should have made it '✓' in guess2.

Similarly, any word with A in pos3 is invalid.

 Only possible A at pos5.

 So we need to forss our search.

 After some research, one possible English word is ""BERAY"" but E eliminated.

 or “BRAY” not 5 letters.

 ' FORBA"" — not word.

 or ' GARBO' — G A R B O -> pos2=A, not R.

 not.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,ARBOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we need to choose a starting word.
 The goal is to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I'll choose a word that has common letters and distinct letters. ""CRANE"" is a popular start because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.<thinking>
For the first guess, without any prior information, I should select a word that maximizes the amount of potential information. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants and avoids repeating letters. 

Considerations:
- High-frequency letters in English: E, A, R, T, O, I, etc.
- ""CRANE"" covers 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E. These include common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). 
- Alternatively, words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also work well. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced starting word with high-information potential.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Feedback interpretation:**
   - R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _
   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got '-'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all 'x'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.

2. **What we know so far:**
   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _
   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got '-', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).
   - Letters C, N, E are absent.
   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.

3. **Strategy for next guess:**
   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).
   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.
   - Avoid using C, N, E since they're ruled out.
   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.

4. **Possible choices:**
   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.
   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _
     - But we don't know last two letters.
   - Need to guess a valid English word.
   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.

5. **Criteria:**
   - Must have R in position 2.
   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I'll try position 3 for A.
   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.
   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.
     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.
     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.
     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P
     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.
     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.

6. **Selecting a word:**
   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H
     - Why TRASH?
        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn't been tested yet.
        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).
        - Tests S and H, common letters.
        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.

7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**
   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn't satisfy _ R _ _ _.

   Correction: Must have R in second position.

8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**
   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.
     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? 

   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.

   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.

   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.

9. **Confirming word validity:**
   - TRASH is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""TRASH"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback:  
- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  
- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  

Strategy for the next guess:  
1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  
2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can't be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  
3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  
4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  
   - T in position 1 (new),  
   - R in position 2 (fixed),  
   - A in position 3 (under test),  
   - S in position 4 (new),  
   - H in position 5 (new).  
This covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.

<guess>trash</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong, and R is fixed at 2, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""trash""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so second letter remains R)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; note that in ""trash"", A is in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5)
- S: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)

So, what we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- The letter A is present, but not in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, it must be in position 4 or 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H (all marked as 'x' in both guesses). Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, and from the second, not in position 3.

Remaining possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes A in either position 4 or 5 (we can try to test one of these positions to get more information).
- Uses new letters that haven't been eliminated (so avoid C, N, E, T, S, H).

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to test the position of A. Since we don't know if it's in 4 or 5, we can try putting it in position 4 and use a word that has a new set of letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has A in position 4 and then use other letters to test for the remaining spots.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and then either 4 or 5 (if A is in 4, then 5 is free; if A is in 5, then 4 is free). Actually, positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 are open, but A is in one of 4 or 5.

Let me denote the word as: [1] R [3] [4] [5]

We know:
- [2] = R
- A is either in [4] or [5]

We need to test:
- Position 1: we haven't tested any letter there (except T in guess2 which was wrong, and A in guess1 which was wrong and not there). So we need to try a new letter in position 1.
- Position 3: we haven't had any feedback for position 3 (in guess1, A was in position 1 and was wrong, in guess2, A was in position 3 and was wrong because it's not in the right position? Wait, no: the feedback for A in guess2 was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not A, and we haven't tested any other letter in position 3.

Actually, in guess2, we had T in position 1 (wrong), R in 2 (correct), A in 3 (wrong position, so A is not in 3, but present elsewhere). So position 3 is open and we don't know what is there.

So we have:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H}
- Position 3: unknown, must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, S, H} and not A (because if A were in position 3, it would have been correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so A is not in 3). But note: A is in the word, just not in 3.
- Position 4 and 5: one of them is A, the other is unknown.

So the word has the form: [1] R [3] [4] [5] with A being either in [4] or [5].

We need to design a guess that can help us narrow down the possibilities.

Option 1: Assume A is in position 4 and then choose a word that has A in 4, and then use new letters for 1, 3, and 5.

Option 2: Assume A is in position 5 and choose a word with A in 5, and new letters for 1,3,4.

But we don't know which one, so we should choose a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can only put A in one position per guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in it? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A to get more information about its position. Since we know it's in 4 or 5, we can try one of them.

Let me try to put A in position 4. Then the word would be: [1] R [3] A [5]

We need to choose [1], [3], and [5] from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and distinct ones.

Common letters: O, L, I, P, etc.

Possible words: 
- BROAD: B R O A D -> but O and D are new. But we have A in position 4? BROAD: positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This seems good.

But let's check if B, O, D are available? We haven't used them, so yes.

Another: DROPS -> D R O P S -> but S is eliminated (from guess2: S is x). So not allowed.

GROAN -> G R O A N -> but N is eliminated (from guess1: N is x). Not allowed.

PROUD -> P R O U D -> but no A? We need to have A in the word. We are trying to put A in position 4.

So BROAD: B R O A D -> valid? Let me check: B, R, O, A, D. All distinct and not eliminated.

Another: FROAD? Not a word.

GROAN is invalid because of N.

So BROAD is a candidate.

What about putting A in position 5? Then the word would be: [1] R [3] [4] A

Possible words: 
- OPERA -> O P E R A -> but E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ULTRA -> U L T R A -> T is eliminated. Not allowed.
- ZEBRA -> Z E B R A -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.
- BRAVA -> B R A V A -> duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically Wordle allows duplicates. However, in this case, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But let's see: BRAVA is not common. Also, we have A in position 3 and 5? But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don't know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn't, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A's. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as '-' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it's not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.

So for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.

Possible: 
- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.

Another: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don't want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid for our purpose.

So PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.

Other options: 
- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.
- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.

So we have two candidate words: 
1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D
2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A

Which one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.

In BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.
In PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.

But note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as '-' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it's in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it's in 5, else if '-' then it must be in 4.

But we can get information about the other letters as well.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it's in the word. And we need to find its position.

I think we have to commit to one.

Let me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.

But we can also consider other words.

What about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.

""GROWL"" -> no A.

We need to include A.

Another word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.

""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.

So BROAD seems a good choice.

But let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.

""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.

""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.

So PRIMA might be one of the few.

But PRIMA is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.

I think BROAD is a solid choice.

But wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as '-' (because it's in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as '-'.

So either way, we get the position of A.

But we also get information about the other letters.

I'll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.

So the guess is ""broad"".

But let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.

So it's valid.

Another candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.

""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.

So BROAD it is.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  
  - C, N, and E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  
  - T, S, and H are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
- **A's Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 3).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn't (4 or 5).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it's in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  
- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H). Good options: B, O, D (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
- **Word Choice**: ""BROAD"" fits perfectly:  
  - B (position 1, new),  
  - R (position 2, fixed),  
  - O (position 3, new),  
  - A (position 4, testing A's location),  
  - D (position 5, new).  
- **Why ""BROAD""?** It maximizes information by testing A in a new position and covers three new common letters.

So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _\n   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it got \'-\'). Since it was guessed in position 1, but is wrong position, and we know R is fixed in position 2, A must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n   - C, N, E are not in the word at all (all \'x\'). So we can eliminate C, N, E from consideration.\n\n2. **What we know so far:**\n   - Second letter is R: _ R _ _ _\n   - A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 (since it got \'-\', and R is in position 2, so possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5).\n   - Letters C, N, E are absent.\n   - We must include A in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\n3. **Strategy for next guess:**\n   - Need to test possible positions for A (try position 3?).\n   - Also want to include other common letters to gather more information.\n   - Avoid using C, N, E since they\'re ruled out.\n   - Cover other vowels or consonants not yet tested.\n\n4. **Possible choices:**\n   - Since A is in the word but position unknown, I should try putting A in different position. Position 3 is a common spot.\n   - Example: try a word like B R A _ _\n     - But we don\'t know last two letters.\n   - Need to guess a valid English word.\n   - Suitable words: Include letters like T, O, I, S, L, etc., to test more common letters.\n\n5. **Criteria:**\n   - Must have R in position 2.\n   - Must include A (but not in position 1, so position 3,4, or 5). I\'ll try position 3 for A.\n   - Letters to avoid: C, N, E.\n   - Possible words: ""TRASH"", ""BRASS"", ""GRASS"", ""PLANT"" but PLANT has N which is eliminated.\n     - ""TRASH"" : T, R, A, S, H → R in pos2, A in pos3.\n     - ""BRASS"" : B, R, A, S, S → has duplicate S? Actually S could be tested.\n     - ""GRASP"" : G, R, A, S, P\n     - ""BRAVE"" : B, R, A, V, E → but E is eliminated.\n     - Avoid E: so BRAVE is invalid for E.\n\n6. **Selecting a word:**\n   - ""TRASH"" seems good: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H\n     - Why TRASH?\n        - Tests T in position 1, which hasn\'t been tested yet.\n        - Tests A in position 3 (which is a possibility).\n        - Tests S and H, common letters.\n        - Avoids banned letters: C,N,E.\n\n7. **Alternative: ""PARTS""**\n   - P, A, R, T, S → but R is not in position 2? Position: P(1), A(2), R(3) → no, we need R in position 2. So ""PARTS"" has R in position 3, which doesn\'t satisfy _ R _ _ _.\n\n   Correction: Must have R in second position.\n\n8. **List of possible words with R in pos2 and A somewhere:**\n   - With A in pos3: BRASH, TRASH, GRASS (but grass has double S, might be inefficient?), CRAMP but C banned.\n     - GRASS: G R A S S → S repeated? \n\n   Actually, ""CRASS"" but C banned.\n\n   Good options: BRASH (B R A S H), TRASH (T R A S H), GRASP (G R A S P), DRABS (D R A B S) but S at end? Valid word? DRABS might be not very common.\n\n   Prefer TRASH since it tests T and S/H which are new.\n\n9. **Confirming word validity:**\n   - TRASH is a valid English word.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""TRASH"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback:  \n- **R** is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _  \n- **A** is in the word but not in the 1st position (wrong position). It could be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.  \n- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (eliminated).  \n\nStrategy for the next guess:  \n1. **Fixed requirement**: Keep R in the 2nd position.  \n2. **Include A**: Test A in the 3rd position to clarify its location (as it can\'t be in position 1 and position 2 is taken by R).  \n3. **Test new letters**: Use other common letters not yet tried (e.g., T, S, H, O, L, I) to maximize information gain. Avoid C, N, E.  \n4. **Word choice**: ""TRASH"" is a valid option. It tests:  \n   - T in position 1 (new),  \n   - R in position 2 (fixed),  \n   - A in position 3 (under test),  \n   - S in position 4 (new),  \n   - H in position 5 (new).  \nThis covers common letters and maintains distinct positions for clarity.  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>trash</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trash -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong, and R is fixed at 2, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""trash""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so second letter remains R)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; note that in ""trash"", A is in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3.

But we are trying to put A only in position 5. Actually, BRAVA has A in 3 and 5? B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5). But we are trying to put A in 5, and we don\'t know about position 3. However, in this word, A is in 3 and 5. But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 (because in guess2, when we put A in 3, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A that is in the word is not in 3). So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it wasn\'t, so the word does not have A in position 3. Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 3. So BRAVA would be invalid because it forces A in 3? Actually, in BRAVA, we have two A\'s. But the feedback from guess2: when we put A in position 3, it was marked as \'-\' meaning the letter A is in the word but not in that position. So the word has at least one A, but not in position 3. It could have another A in position 3? But that would be inconsistent because then the A in position 3 would be correct. So no, the word cannot have A in position 3. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our guesses? Actually, we can put it, but it would be redundant because we know it\'s not there. So for efficiency, we avoid.\n\nSo for position 5: we need a word of the form [1] R [3] [4] A, with [3] and [4] not A and not eliminated letters.\n\nPossible: \n- PRIMA -> P R I M A -> I and M are new. But A is in position 5? PRIMA: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). This is good.\n\nAnother: GRAMA -> G R A M A -> again, A in position 3? We don\'t want that. GRAMA: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But we cannot have A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So invalid for our purpose.\n\nSo PRIMA is a candidate: P R I M A.\n\nOther options: \n- DRAMA -> D R A M A -> again, A in position 3 -> invalid.\n- FROSH -> but no A and S is eliminated.\n\nSo we have two candidate words: \n1. BROAD (A in position 4): B R O A D\n2. PRIMA (A in position 5): P R I M A\n\nWhich one to choose? Both use distinct new letters. We need to consider which one gives more information.\n\nIn BROAD, we test B, O, D in positions 1,3,5 respectively.\nIn PRIMA, we test P, I, M in positions 1,3,4.\n\nWe have to avoid eliminated letters: both are safe.\n\nBut note: in BROAD, if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if we are lucky) then we know A is in 4. Otherwise, if A is marked as \'-\' then it would be in the word but not in 4, meaning it must be in 5 (since we know it\'s in 4 or 5). Similarly, for PRIMA, if A is correct then it\'s in 5, else if \'-\' then it must be in 4.\n\nBut we can get information about the other letters as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A in 4 or 5 but tests other letters? But we must include A because we know it\'s in the word. And we need to find its position.\n\nI think we have to commit to one.\n\nLet me think about common words. BROAD is more common than PRIMA? PRIMA is a word (as in prima donna) but less common. BROAD is a common word.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nWhat about ""DROVE""? But E is eliminated. Not allowed.\n\n""GROWL"" -> no A.\n\nWe need to include A.\n\nAnother word with A in position 4: ""CROAK"" -> but C is eliminated.\n\n""TRAWL"" -> T is eliminated.\n\nSo BROAD seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: are there words with A in position 5 that are valid? Like ""ULTRA"" but T is eliminated.\n\n""ZEBRA"" -> E eliminated.\n\n""EXTRA"" -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""OPERA"" -> E eliminated.\n\nSo PRIMA might be one of the few.\n\nBut PRIMA is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRION"" -> but N eliminated.\n\nI think BROAD is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait: in BROAD, we are putting A in position 4. If the actual word has A in position 5, then in the feedback for BROAD, A will be marked as \'-\' (because it\'s in the word but not in position 4). Similarly, if we use PRIMA and the word has A in position 4, then A in position 5 will be marked as \'-\'.\n\nSo either way, we get the position of A.\n\nBut we also get information about the other letters.\n\nI\'ll go with BROAD because it uses very common letters.\n\nSo the guess is ""broad"".\n\nBut let me double-check the eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H. BROAD: B, R, O, A, D. None of these are eliminated. And R is in the correct position.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROUD"" but no A.\n\n""GRADE"" -> E eliminated.\n\nSo BROAD it is.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""broad"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, which is R).  \n  - C, N, and E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: trash** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  \n  - R is confirmed in position 2 again.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked as wrong position).  \n  - T, S, and H are absent.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  \n- **A\'s Position**: A must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can\'t be in 1, 2, or 3).  \n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, T, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Unknown Positions**: 1, 3, and the slot where A isn\'t (4 or 5).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include A**: Test A in position 4 to clarify its location (if A is correct, it\'s in 4; if marked wrong position, it must be in 5).  \n- **New Letters**: Use common, untested letters (avoiding C, N, E, T, S, H).

We have three guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x (absent)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so 2nd letter is R)
- A: - (present but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: trash
- T: x (absent)
- R: ✓ (correct, so 2nd letter is R)
- A: - (present but wrong position; in trash it's in position 3, so A is not in position 3)
- S: x (absent)
- H: x (absent)

Guess 3: broad
- B: - (present but wrong position; in broad it's position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- O: - (present but wrong position; in position 3)
- A: - (present but wrong position; in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

What we know:

1. The word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _

2. Letters that are present: 
   - A is in the word (from guess1) and we know it's not in positions 1,2,3 (from guesses 1,2,3). So it must be in position 4 or 5.
   - B is in the word (from guess3) and we know it's not in position 1 (since in broad it was position1 and marked wrong).
   - O is in the word (from guess3) and not in position 3.

3. Letters that are absent: C, N, E, T, S, H, D.

4. The word also has O and B (from guess3 feedback with '-').

5. Positions:
   - Position 2: R (fixed)
   - Position 1: Cannot be B (since B in position1 was wrong) and must be a letter not eliminated. Also, it must be one of the letters that are present or a new letter? We know B is present but not in position1.

We have the pattern: [1] R [3] [4] [5]

We know:
- A is in 4 or 5.
- B is present but not in 1, so it must be in 3,4, or 5? But we know from guess3 that in position1 (B) was wrong, but we don't know about other positions. Since we have positions 3,4,5 available.
- O is present and not in position3 (from guess3), so it must be in 1,4, or 5? Position1 is available? But we have position1 to fill.

Wait: in guess3 we placed O in position3 and got '-', meaning O is not in position3. So O can be in position1,4,5? But position4 and5 are available? Or position1.

But we also know that B is present and not in position1, so B must be in 3,4, or5.

Similarly, O is not in3 so it can be in1,4,5.

Now, we have a conflict: positions4 and5 must hold two letters: one of which is A? But also possibly B or O? And there might be other letters.

The word contains: R (fixed at2), A, B, O, and one more letter? Because it's a 5-letter word.

We have 5 positions: 
- Position1: must be a letter that is either O or a new letter? But we know O is present and could be in1?
- Position3: must be B? Or O? Or another letter? We don't know.

But from known presents: we have A, B, O, and R. That's four letters. So the fifth letter is unknown? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far no duplicates are indicated.

So the word has five distinct letters? We don't know, but let's assume distinct for now.

So the word must include: R, A, B, O, and one more letter X.

Positions:
- R in position2 fixed.
- A: must be in 4 or5.
- B: must be in 3,4, or5 (since not in1, and position2 is R so not there).
- O: must be in 1,4, or5 (since not in3).

But position1: can be O? Or the fifth letter? Or could B or O be in a position that conflicts?

We need to assign positions without conflict.

Possible scenarios:

Let’s denote the positions: 1,3,4,5 to be filled with letters: the fifth letter (let's call it X) plus A, B, O, but we have only three positions? Wait: positions 1,3,4,5 are four positions? Oh, wait: we have four positions to fill: 1,3,4,5? With four letters: A, B, O, and X? But we have five letters in total? Wait no: R is at position2, so we need four letters for positions1,3,4,5? And we know three: A, B, O? So we need one more letter? But we have three known letters plus R? Wait, R is represented.

Clarification: We need four distinct positions: positions 1,3,4,5. We have three known letters (A,B,O) plus one unknown letter, making four letters? So the word has the letters: R, A, B, O, and one unknown letter X.

So the letters are: [1], R (at position2), [3], [4], [5] = [letter1], R, [letter3], [letter4], [letter5] = ?

The letters must include A, B, O, and one more letter.

Constraints:
- A must be in position4 or5.
- B must not be in1 (so in3,4, or5) and not in position? We haven't tested it elsewhere.
- O must not be in3 (so in1,4, or5).

Also, we cannot use eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H, D.

Now for the next guess, we need to select a word that fits the known constraints and helps to disambiguate.

We have to assign positions:

Option: Put A in one of 4 or5, and B and O in other places without conflict.

But we have four positions and four letters? So we need to choose the fifth letter? And assign.

For position1: can be O? Or the unknown letter? Or even B? But B is not allowed in1? Or O can be in1.

Let me consider the options:

If we put O in position1: then the word would be O R [3] [4] [5]

Then for [3]: cannot be O (assuming distinct), so it must be B, A, or X? But A must be in4 or5, so not in3? Wait: A can be in3 only if it's not? But from past? Actually, from guess2, A in position3 was marked as wrong, so A is not in3. Similarly, from guess3, O is not in3. So position3 cannot be O or A? So position3 must be either B or the new letter? And B can be in3? Yes.

So possibility: O R [B or X] [A?] [A or B? etc.]

But A must be in4 or5.

Similarly, B can be in3,4,5? But if we put B in3, that's possible.

So one arrangement: 
- Position1: O
- Position2: R
- Position3: B  (if we choose)
- Position4: A  (for example)
- Position5: X

But then we have to choose X. But we have to guess a word.

But we don't know X.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in position5 and B in position3? That might work.

Then, word: O R B [ ] A? But we need something in position4.

Word: O R B X A? But that might not be a word.

But let me think of actual words with O in position1 and A in position5? For example, OPERA but E is eliminated.

Not possible.

Put O in position5? Then the word: ? Let's say O in5: [1] R [3] [4] O

Then A must be in4, so position4: A? Then the word: [1] R [3] A O

Then B must be in3? So position3: B? Then word: [1] R B A O

What words? Probably ""ORBAO"" not a word? Known words: ""URBAN""? But U R B A N -> N is eliminated? Not allowed. Or ""CURB""? too short.

""PROBE"" but E eliminated? Not.

Maybe ""GRABS""? G R A B S? But S eliminated? Not.

Another idea: since B is present, it must be in positions 3,4,5? And O in 1,4,5? Possibly overlapping at4 or5.

Also, we might put B in position4 and O in position5, for example.

But then we need position1 and position3.

And A? We need to place A.

Perhaps: 
- Position1: X (new letter)
- Position3: Y (another letter)
- Position4: B
- Position5: O

But then where is A? We haven't placed A. We must place A in one of the positions? But we have positions 1,3,4,5: we have assigned 1: X, 3: Y, 4: B, 5: O. Then A is missing? This can't be because A must be in the word.

So we must include A.

So in this case, if position4 has B and5 has O, then A must be in position1 or3? But position1: we haven't tested A there again? Actually, we know A is not in position1? Because in guess1, we put A in position1 and it was marked as misplaced (but that means it is present but not in1? Oh, in guess1, crane: position1: C? C was not present? Position1: c -> x. Actually, in guess1, position1: C was guessed and marked x, but A was guessed in position1 as well? No: crane: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). In guess1, position1: C (marked x), position2: R (correct), position3: A which was marked as '-', meaning A is present but not in position3? But we said position3? No: in the first guess, A was in position 3? Let me check: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x). So A was in position 3 and marked as '-', so A is present but not in position 3? And similarly, in guess2, trash: 1:T,2:R,3:A,4:S,5:H feedback A: '-' again, meaning not in position3. So A is not in 1 or 3? Wait: position1 was C and T, marked x for the letters, but we haven't tested A in position1? In guess1, we tested C in position1, not A. A was in position3. So we haven't tested position1 with a letter that could be A? So for position1, it could be A? But wait: in guess1, we placed A in position3 and it was marked as present but not in position3. That doesn't tell us anything about position1 for A. But in the second guess, when we put A in position3 again, it was marked similarly. So we still don't know if position1 could be A? But in the first guess, position1 was C (x); second guess, position1 was T (x). And we haven't tried A in position1. But the feedback for A being in position3: '-' means that the correct letter in position3 is not A, but A is elsewhere? But it could be in position1? No: the feedback '-' for A in position3 means that there is an A in the word but not in position3. So A cannot be in position3? But it could be in position1? Certainly. We haven't ruled out position1 for A? But in guess3, broad: we put A in position4 and it was marked as '-'? Meaning the letter A is present but not in position4. So again, A is not in position4. Therefore, A must be in position5? Because positions ruled out: 1 (we haven't directly, but), 2 R, 3 ruled out, 4 ruled out. So only position5 left? Let's see:

Possible positions for A:
- Position1: could it be? We haven't placed A in position1 in any guess? We placed letters in position1: first guess: C, second: T, third: B. All were either absent (C,T) or misplaced (B). But we haven't tested A in position1 directly? And from feedback, when A was in position3 or4, it was misplaced, but that doesn't give information about position1? But notice: if A were in position1, then in guess1 or guess2 or guess3, if A was in position1, then when we guessed a letter in position1 that wasn't A (C,T,B), we should have seen a '-' for position1? But we saw 'x' for C,T,B? That means that the letter in position1 is not any of C,T,B? And it's not A? Because if it were A, then guessing C at position1 should have been marked as '-' if A was the correct letter? But it was marked 'x', meaning C is not in the word. Similarly for T and B: B was marked as '-', which means that B is in the word but not in position1, so position1 could be A? But not necessarily; it could be any other letter.

Therefore, position1 could still be A? We haven't tested it? But let me clarify:

The feedback for position1 in each guess:
- Guess1: C in position1 -> 'x' (not in the word)
- Guess2: T in position1 -> 'x' (not in the word)
- Guess3: B in position1 -> '-' (B is in the word but not in position1)

None of these tests involved putting A in position1.

Therefore, A could potentially be in position1? But we have the feedback that A is present? We don't know where.

But in guess3, A was in position4, and feedback: A was '-', so A is not in position4? And from guess1 and2, A was in position3 and always '-' so not in position3? So possible positions for A: position1 or position5? Because position2 is R, so not available.

We have positions 1,3,4,5 open? And A must be in one of them? But 3 and4 are ruled out? So only position1 and5 left? But position1 hasn't been tested for A.

So A must be in position1 or5.

This changes things.

Similarly for O: in guess3, O was in position3 and marked as '-'? Meaning O is in the word but not in position3.

For B: in position1, marked as '-'? Meaning not in position1.

We know the word has A, B, O.

Now, positions:

- Position2: R
- Position3: cannot be O (from guess3), cannot be A (from guess1 and2), must be B or a new letter? But we have only three more positions? And we need to place A, B, O.

Positions: 1,3,4,5

Letters to place: A, B, O, and the fourth letter X.

Constraints for each letter:

- A: must be in 1 or 5 (since we've ruled out 3 and4? And 2 is taken).
- B: cannot be in1 (from guess3, B in1 was '-'), cannot be in2 (occupied) so must be in3,4, or5.
- O: cannot be in3 (from guess3, O in3 was '-'), so must be in1,4, or5.
- X: can be anywhere available.

But we also know from guess3 feedback: the word has B, O, and A present.

Now for position3: we know it cannot be A or O, so it must be B or X? But if we put B in position3, that's possible? Or X.

Now let's consider the possibilities for A:

Case 1: A in position1.
Then the word: A R [3] [4] [5]
Position3: cannot be A or O, so either B or X.
But we have to place B and O.

Case 2: A in position5.
Then the word: [1] R [3] [4] A
Position3: cannot be O or A, so B or X.

In both cases, we need to see what words are possible.

We also have the eliminated letters: C,N,E,T,S,H,D.

Common letters left: L, P, U, I, G, F, etc.

Now for the next guess, we want to test both cases.

Perhaps we can try to put A in position1? To see if it's correct.

So guess a word: A R ? ? ?

But we also need to test for B and O and X.

But are there words that start with A and R, then have B? Like ""ARBOR"" but O is already there? Let's see.

""ARBOR"": A R B O R -> duplicate R? Not allowed? Well, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. But perhaps.

But let's see positions: A(1), R(2), B(3), O(4), R(5) -> duplicate R? And R is already known in position2, so if there is another R, it might be okay? But we don't know if R is duplicated? From previous feedback, we have only one R that's fixed? But it could have another R.

In the feedback, when we had guesses with only one R, we have no evidence of duplicates.

However, to avoid complexity, let's assume distinct for now? But we might be wrong.

Try to find a word that starts with AR?, and has B and O? Or something.

Example: ""ARBOR"" has duplicate letters.

""AROMA"": A R O M A -> duplicate A? And we have position1: A, position4: M, position5: A? But we are testing A in position1? But if duplicate is allowed.

But let's see the structure.

Another: ""ARGON"": but has G and O. Positions: A1, R2, G3, O4, N5? But N is eliminated? Not possible.

We cannot use eliminated letters.

So available letters: F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and then A,B,O because we know they are present? When we guess, we can use letters that are present or not? But since we know they are in the word, our guess should include them? Not necessarily, but to get information, we should.

For testing, I want to test if A is in position1. So put A in position1.

Then for position3: I need a letter that is either B or O or something else? But B must be in the word? So I have to include B somewhere? Actually, yes, because B is in the word, so our guess should include all known present letters? Not necessarily, but to avoid missing information, it could be wise.

So let's try to include B and O in the guess.

Word starting with A R and then what? With B and O and one more.

Try ""ARROW"": A R R O W -> duplicate R? And R is tested twice. But position3: R, which might conflict? Also, we have position4: O, position5: W.

But is ""arrow"" valid? Yes, has duplicate R.

But feedback for position3: R might be marked? But we already know R is at position2? If there is another R, it might be marked accordingly.

But let's avoid duplicates to save time.

Another word: ""ABBOT"" but duplicate B? And no? A B B O T -> but positions not R at2.

Not for position2 R.

Must have R at2? So structure: A R [3] [4] [5]

Try ""ARSON"": but S is eliminated? Not.

""ARBOR"": with duplicate R.

""ARENA"": but N and A duplicate? Not because N eliminated? N is x? Eliminated? Yes, N eliminated.

Another: ""AVAIL""? No, V is available, but would be A V A I L? but not R at2? Not matching.

Not.

Can we do ""ORBAL"" or something? No.

Another idea: maybe put A in position5 and see what happens.

Guess: e.g., ""? R ? ? A"" with ? being letters that include B and O.

For example, the word ""LUMBAR"": too many letters? No, 6 letters.

5 letter words: ""ULTRA"" but T eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" same.

""PROBA"" not a word.

""FUBAR"" not common.

Perhaps ""RUMBA"" -> R U M B A -> but doesn't have R at position2? Position1:R? We need R at position2, so position1 cannot be R? Unless duplicate, but to have R at2.

But ""RUMBA"" has R at position1, not position2. So structure: R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> position2 is U, not R? But we need R at2.

So this is invalid.

Another option: ""GRADE"" E eliminated.

So few words with A at the end and R at position2? But not.

Let me try: ""? R ? ? A"" -> for example, ""CRAWL"" but C and L? C eliminated? C is eliminated.

""BRAVA"" B R A V A -> duplicate A? And position3:A, which we know is not? But we can guess.

But if we guess ""BRAVA"": 
- Position1: B (we know B is present but not in1, so if we put B in1, it would be '-')
- Position2: R (correct)
- Position3: A (but A is present? But if in the word A is in position5 or1, then position3 might be something else? But we put A there? 

Actually, it might be messy.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A in position5, B in position3, and O in position4, for example? Like ""? R B O A"" -> such as ""URBOA"" not word.

""TURBO"" is T U R B O -> positions: T(1), U(2) -> not R at2.

No.

Other structure: have A not in1 and not in5? But we know it has to be in1 or5.

Perhaps ""ROBOT"": R O B O T -> has O at2? But we need R at2? Position1: R? Not fixed.

Not matching.

Let's rethink.

Another approach: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know, so better not assume.

Now, from guess3 broad: feedback for O in position3 was '-', and we have to include O elsewhere.

Similarly for B in position1.

For the next guess, I propose to test position1 with O? And put A in position5.

For example, ""O R ? ? A""

Then letters for position3 and4: must include B and the remaining letter? Or B in one of them.

But we have position3: cannot be O or A, so it could be B or X.

Position4: could be B or X or O? But O is used? If we put O in position4, is that possible? In guess3, O was in position3 and was '-', so O could be in4.

Similarly for B: we put B in position1 and got '-', so not in1, so it can be in3,4, or5.

But position5 is A.

So for positions:1:O,2:R,3:?,4:?,5:A

Then for position3 and4: we have to place B and one other letter X.

But what is X? We don't know, so we need to choose a letter.

Possible words: O R B X A? Like ""ORCYX"" not English.

O R L B A? ""ORLBA"" not word.

O R E B A? but E eliminated.

O R U B A? not word.

Perhaps ""ORTHO"" but no A.

Not.

If we switch: put B in position3: O R B ? A

Then position4: could be O? But we already used O in position1? So duplicate? Or we use a different letter.

But we need a word ending with A.

Words like ""OR"" + consonant + vowel + A, but hard.

""ORGMA"" not.

Another idea: perhaps A in position1 and B in position3, or something.

But still hard.

Let's go back to the feedback.

In guess3 broad: B in position1 was '-', which means B is not in position1 but is in the word.

O in position3 was '-', so O is in the word but not in position3.

A in position4 was '-', so A is in the word but not in position4.

D in position5 was 'x', so D not in the word.

We also have positions that have to have letters.

Given that, the word must include B, O, A in positions among 1,3,5? But position3 can't have A or O, and position1 can have O or A? So position3 must be B or the fifth letter.

Similarly, position1 can be O or A or the fifth letter? But we have to place three letters: B,O,A into positions 1,3,5 (since position4 is open, but A cannot be in4) and position5 is open? Positions: 1,3,4,5 are open? But or4, we haven't eliminated it for O or B? But for A, we have not position4.

So let's list possible positions for each letter:

- A: position1 or position5 (since 2,3,4 ruled out)
- B: position3,4,5 (since not in1, and position2 is R)
- O: position1,4,5 (not in3)

And there's a fourth letter X for the remaining spot.

So we have to select.

For the next guess, we can try to set position1 to O, position5 to A, and then position3 and4 to B and X? But which is which.

Since B and O both can be in position4 and5, we can try.

But we can only guess B in one position.

Perhaps it is better to try a word where O is in position1 and A in position5, as that might be a common pattern.

For example, words like ""OPERA"" but E eliminated. Or ""OVERT"" T eliminated. ""OCTAN"" C eliminated.

""OLIVA"" or ""OLVER"" etc.

""OAKUM"" not.

""OASIS"" S eliminated.

""OUNCE"" N and E eliminated.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"" too long.

Another: ""OLEUM"" etc.

Let’s consider: ""O R U M A"" -> ""ORUMA"" not a word.

Not working.

Perhaps put B in position4 with O and A at ends.

For example, ""O R ? B A"" -> but what at position3? Position3: must be a letter. And we have only one spot.

For example, ""O R C B A"" C eliminated.

""O R G B A"" ""ORGBA"" not word.

 ""OR G E B A"" no.

So not.

Alternative: don't put A at position1 or5 yet? But we have to include it.

Perhaps test position5 with A first.

So guess word: ? R ? ? A

Then we can put O in position4 and B in position3? Or other combination.

For instance, the word could be X R B O A? ""URBOS"" not.

Or ""IRB OA"" not.

"" CR W B A"" C eliminated.

""PROBE"" E eliminated.

""GRABE"" E and might not word.

""TRAB UA"" not.

What about ""BRICK"" not at all.

We need to find a valid English word that fits the pattern and available letters.

Letters available: not C,N,E,T,S,H,D, so we have: F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We also must include A,B,O.

So the word must be: _ R _ _ _ with letters that include A,B,O and one other from available list.

With A in position5: then word: a letter at1, R at2, a letter at3, a letter at4, A at5.

The letter at1,3,4 must include B and O and one other.

But B and O must be in the word.

So for position1: can be O? If we put O in position1, then at positions3 and4 we need to put B and a letter.

Words: O R ? ? A

With positions3 and4: must have letter and B.

For example, "" O R C B A"" C eliminated.

"" O R G E A"" E eliminated.

"" O R K B A"" ""ORKBA"" not word.

"" O R L B A"" ""ORLBA"" not.

"" O R P B A"" ""ORPBA"" not.

Perhaps we can put B in position4: O R X B A

With X a letter for position3.

X must be from available letters, e.g., U: ""ORUBA"" not word.

G: "" "" etc.

Another idea: if A is in position1? Then we have ""A R ? ? ?""

Then B and O must be in positions3,4,5.

But position3 cannot be O or A, so must be B or X.

Position4 can be O or B or X, position5 similar.

So like ""A R B O X"" or "" A R X O B"" etc.

For example, ""ARBOR"" with duplicate R, issue.

""AROMA"" with duplicate A? A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> positions:1 A (correct?), 2 R correct, etc.

""AROMA"" seems a valid word? But has two A's? Let's see:  1:A, 2:R, 3:O, 4:M, 5:A.

Yes, duplicate A. But we don't know if the word allows duplicate. If it does, it's possible.

Also, available letters: A,R,O, M, A. And M is not eliminated? Tired? M is available.

Also, include O and B? B is missing? But the word has B? We must include B because it's present? But ""AROMA"" has A,R,O,M,A. No B, so it does not have B? But B is in the word? We know B is in the word because in guess3, B was marked as present, so the secret word must have B. But ""AROMA"" doesn't have B, so it can't be? So we cannot guess ""AROMA"" because it lacks B.

Any guess must include B, as it is in the word.

Similarly, must include A and O.

So for pattern with A in position1, word: A R [3] [4] [5] with [3] [4] [5] including B and O.

But [3] cannot be O (because not in position3), so must be B or X. But B can be in3.

So for example, if [3] = B, then A R B [4] [5] with [4] and [5] including O and possibly the other letter.

So words like ""ARBOR"": positions 1:A, 2:R, 3:B, 4:O, 5:R -> has R twice? B and R.

Includes B and O? O at position4, so yes.

But duplicate R? R at position2 and5? In the secret word, if there is a second R, it might be.

And ""ARBOR"" is a valid English word.

Another: ""ARROW"": 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:O, 5:W -> includes B? No, has R twice? And no B.

""ARBOR"" does not have O? ""ARBOR"" has A R B O R -> so it has O at position4. Yes.

But it has only one O? And B at position3.

Includes letters: A,R,B,O,R -> has A,B,O,R and duplicate R.

But are the letters in the word not in the set? Or it contains B and O.

It seems possible.

And we can use it.

Also, B is in position3, which is allowed? We haven't ruled it out.

Similarly, O in position4: we haven't directly ruled it out.

So for guess4, we can guess ""ARBOR"" to test.

But the secret word has R at position2, so if we have R at position5, it might give us feedback if there is a second R.

If it works, good.

It might also give us information about the positions.

So I think ""ARBOR"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""ARBLAST"" too long.

But for 5 letters, ""ARBOR"" works.

Another possibility: ""ABOVE"" but V and E.

E is eliminated.

Not.

So I think ""ARBOR"" is a guess we can try.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is confirmed in position 2.
     - A is present but not in position 1 or 3.
     - C, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (trash):** T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  
     - R confirmed again in position 2.
     - A is present but not in position 3 (redundant with Guess 1).
     - T, S, H are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (broad):** B(-), R(✓), O(-), A(-), D(x)  
     - R confirmed in position 2.
     - B is present but not in position 1.
     - O is present but not in position 3.
     - A is present but not in position 4.
     - D is absent.

2. **Key Deductions:**
   - **Fixed Position:** Position 2 is R → Pattern: `_ R _ _ _`
   - **Confirmed Present Letters:** A, B, O (all must appear in the word).
   - **Eliminated Letters:** C, N, E, T, S, H, D (cannot appear).
   - **Position Constraints:**
     - A: Must be in position 1 or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are ruled out by feedback).
     - B: Cannot be in position 1 (so must be in 3, 4, or 5).
     - O: Cannot be in position 3 (so must be in 1, 4, or 5).
   - **Additional Letter:** The word requires one more letter (X) from the remaining pool after excluding eliminated letters (e.g., F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Focus on **disambiguating A's position** (1 or 5) while incorporating B and O.
   - **Test ""A in position 1""** by guessing a word starting with A, with R at position 2, and including B and O.
   - A valid word fitting this is ""ARBOR"":
     - A in position 1 (tests if correct).
     - R in position 2 (confirmed fixed).
     - B in position 3 (tests B's position).
     - O in position 4 (tests O's position).
     - R in position 5 (tests for R duplication; though R is fixed at position 2, a second R could elicit feedback).
   - ""ARBOR"" includes all confirmed letters (A, B, O) and uses no eliminated letters.
   - If A is correct, we confirm position 1; if A is marked wrong position (-), it must be in position 5.

<guess>arbor</guess>",arbor,"We have three guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x (absent)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so 2nd letter is R)
- A: - (present but wrong position; since position 1 is wrong)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: trash
- T: x (absent)
- R: ✓ (correct, so 2nd letter is R)
- A: - (present but wrong position; in trash it's in position 3, so A is not in position 3)
- S: x (absent)
- H: x (absent)

Guess 3: broad
- B: - (present but wrong position; in broad it's position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- O: - (present but wrong position; in position 3)
- A: - (present but wrong position; in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

What we know:

1. The word has R as the second letter: _ R _ _ _

2. Letters that are present: 
   - A is in the word (from guess1) and we know it's not in positions 1,2,3 (from guesses 1,2,3). So it must be in position 4 or 5.
   - B is in the word (from guess3) and we know it's not in position 1 (since in broad it was position1 and marked wrong).
   - O is in the word (from guess3) and not in position 3.

3. Letters that are absent: C, N, E, T, S, H, D.

4. The word also has O and B (from guess3 feedback with '-').

5. Positions:
   - Position 2: R (fixed)
   - Position 1: Cannot be B (since B in position1 was wrong) and must be a letter not eliminated. Also, it must be one of the letters that are present or a new letter? We know B is present but not in position1.

We have the pattern: [1] R [3] [4] [5]

We know:
- A is in 4 or 5.
- B is present but not in 1, so it must be in 3,4, or 5? But we know from guess3 that in position1 (B) was wrong, but we don't know about other positions. Since we have positions 3,4,5 available.
- O is present and not in position3 (from guess3), so it must be in 1,4, or 5? Position1 is available? But we have position1 to fill.

Wait: in guess3 we placed O in position3 and got '-', meaning O is not in position3. So O can be in position1,4,5? But position4 and5 are available? Or position1.

But we also know that B is present and not in position1, so B must be in 3,4, or5.

Similarly, O is not in3 so it can be in1,4,5.

Now, we have a conflict: positions4 and5 must hold two letters: one of which is A? But also possibly B or O? And there might be other letters.

The word contains: R (fixed at2), A, B, O, and one more letter? Because it's a 5-letter word.

We have 5 positions: 
- Position1: must be a letter that is either O or a new letter? But we know O is present and could be in1?
- Position3: must be B? Or O? Or another letter? We don't know.

But from known presents: we have A, B, O, and R. That's four letters. So the fifth letter is unknown? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far no duplicates are indicated.

So the word has five distinct letters? We don't know, but let's assume distinct for now.

So the word must include: R, A, B, O, and one more letter X.

Positions:
- R in position2 fixed.
- A: must be in 4 or5.
- B: must be in 3,4, or5 (since not in1, and position2 is R so not there).
- O: must be in 1,4, or5 (since not in3).

But position1: can be O? Or the fifth letter? Or could B or O be in a position that conflicts?

We need to assign positions without conflict.

Possible scenarios:

Let’s denote the positions: 1,3,4,5 to be filled with letters: the fifth letter (let's call it X) plus A, B, O, but we have only three positions? Wait: positions 1,3,4,5 are four positions? Oh, wait: we have four positions to fill: 1,3,4,5? With four letters: A, B, O, and X? But we have five letters in total? Wait no: R is at position2, so we need four letters for positions1,3,4,5? And we know three: A, B, O? So we need one more letter? But we have three known letters plus R? Wait, R is represented.

Clarification: We need four distinct positions: positions 1,3,4,5. We have three known letters (A,B,O) plus one unknown letter, making four letters? So the word has the letters: R, A, B, O, and one unknown letter X.

So the letters are: [1], R (at position2), [3], [4], [5] = [letter1], R, [letter3], [letter4], [letter5] = ?

The letters must include A, B, O, and one more letter.

Constraints:
- A must be in position4 or5.
- B must not be in1 (so in3,4, or5) and not in position? We haven't tested it elsewhere.
- O must not be in3 (so in1,4, or5).

Also, we cannot use eliminated letters: C, N, E, T, S, H, D.

Now for the next guess, we need to select a word that fits the known constraints and helps to disambiguate.

We have to assign positions:

Option: Put A in one of 4 or5, and B and O in other places without conflict.

But we have four positions and four letters? So we need to choose the fifth letter? And assign.

For position1: can be O? Or the unknown letter? Or even B? But B is not allowed in1? Or O can be in1.

Let me consider the options:

If we put O in position1: then the word would be O R [3] [4] [5]

Then for [3]: cannot be O (assuming distinct), so it must be B, A, or X? But A must be in4 or5, so not in3? Wait: A can be in3 only if it's not? But from past? Actually, from guess2, A in position3 was marked as wrong, so A is not in3. Similarly, from guess3, O is not in3. So position3 cannot be O or A? So position3 must be either B or the new letter? And B can be in3? Yes.

So possibility: O R [B or X] [A?] [A or B? etc.]

But A must be in4 or5.

Similarly, B can be in3,4,5? But if we put B in3, that's possible.

So one arrangement: 
- Position1: O
- Position2: R
- Position3: B  (if we choose)
- Position4: A  (for example)
- Position5: X

But then we have to choose X. But we have to guess a word.

But we don't know X.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in position5 and B in position3? That might work.

Then, word: O R B [ ] A? But we need something in position4.

Word: O R B X A? But that might not be a word.

But let me think of actual words with O in position1 and A in position5? For example, OPERA but E is eliminated.

Not possible.

Put O in position5? Then the word: ? Let's say O in5: [1] R [3] [4] O

Then A must be in4, so position4: A? Then the word: [1] R [3] A O

Then B must be in3? So position3: B? Then word: [1] R B A O

What words? Probably ""ORBAO"" not a word? Known words: ""URBAN""? But U R B A N -> N is eliminated? Not allowed. Or ""CURB""? too short.

""PROBE"" but E eliminated? Not.

Maybe ""GRABS""? G R A B S? But S eliminated? Not.

Another idea: since B is present, it must be in positions 3,4,5? And O in 1,4,5? Possibly overlapping at4 or5.

Also, we might put B in position4 and O in position5, for example.

But then we need position1 and position3.

And A? We need to place A.

Perhaps: 
- Position1: X (new letter)
- Position3: Y (another letter)
- Position4: B
- Position5: O

But then where is A? We haven't placed A. We must place A in one of the positions? But we have positions 1,3,4,5: we have assigned 1: X, 3: Y, 4: B, 5: O. Then A is missing? This can't be because A must be in the word.

So we must include A.

So in this case, if position4 has B and5 has O, then A must be in position1 or3? But position1: we haven't tested A there again? Actually, we know A is not in position1? Because in guess1, we put A in position1 and it was marked as misplaced (but that means it is present but not in1? Oh, in guess1, crane: position1: C? C was not present? Position1: c -> x. Actually, in guess1, position1: C was guessed and marked x, but A was guessed in position1 as well? No: crane: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). In guess1, position1: C (marked x), position2: R (correct), position3: A which was marked as '-', meaning A is present but not in position3? But we said position3? No: in the first guess, A was in position 3? Let me check: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x). So A was in position 3 and marked as '-', so A is present but not in position 3? And similarly, in guess2, trash: 1:T,2:R,3:A,4:S,5:H feedback A: '-' again, meaning not in position3. So A is not in 1 or 3? Wait: position1 was C and T, marked x for the letters, but we haven't tested A in position1? In guess1, we tested C in position1, not A. A was in position3. So we haven't tested position1 with a letter that could be A? So for position1, it could be A? But wait: in guess1, we placed A in position3 and it was marked as present but not in position3. That doesn't tell us anything about position1 for A. But in the second guess, when we put A in position3 again, it was marked similarly. So we still don't know if position1 could be A? But in the first guess, position1 was C (x); second guess, position1 was T (x). And we haven't tried A in position1. But the feedback for A being in position3: '-' means that the correct letter in position3 is not A, but A is elsewhere? But it could be in position1? No: the feedback '-' for A in position3 means that there is an A in the word but not in position3. So A cannot be in position3? But it could be in position1? Certainly. We haven't ruled out position1 for A? But in guess3, broad: we put A in position4 and it was marked as '-'? Meaning the letter A is present but not in position4. So again, A is not in position4. Therefore, A must be in position5? Because positions ruled out: 1 (we haven't directly, but), 2 R, 3 ruled out, 4 ruled out. So only position5 left? Let's see:

Possible positions for A:
- Position1: could it be? We haven't placed A in position1 in any guess? We placed letters in position1: first guess: C, second: T, third: B. All were either absent (C,T) or misplaced (B). But we haven't tested A in position1 directly? And from feedback, when A was in position3 or4, it was misplaced, but that doesn't give information about position1? But notice: if A were in position1, then in guess1 or guess2 or guess3, if A was in position1, then when we guessed a letter in position1 that wasn't A (C,T,B), we should have seen a '-' for position1? But we saw 'x' for C,T,B? That means that the letter in position1 is not any of C,T,B? And it's not A? Because if it were A, then guessing C at position1 should have been marked as '-' if A was the correct letter? But it was marked 'x', meaning C is not in the word. Similarly for T and B: B was marked as '-', which means that B is in the word but not in position1, so position1 could be A? But not necessarily; it could be any other letter.

Therefore, position1 could still be A? We haven't tested it? But let me clarify:

The feedback for position1 in each guess:
- Guess1: C in position1 -> 'x' (not in the word)
- Guess2: T in position1 -> 'x' (not in the word)
- Guess3: B in position1 -> '-' (B is in the word but not in position1)

None of these tests involved putting A in position1.

Therefore, A could potentially be in position1? But we have the feedback that A is present? We don't know where.

But in guess3, A was in position4, and feedback: A was '-', so A is not in position4? And from guess1 and2, A was in position3 and always '-' so not in position3? So possible positions for A: position1 or position5? Because position2 is R, so not available.

We have positions 1,3,4,5 open? And A must be in one of them? But 3 and4 are ruled out? So only position1 and5 left? But position1 hasn't been tested for A.

So A must be in position1 or5.

This changes things.

Similarly for O: in guess3, O was in position3 and marked as '-'? Meaning O is in the word but not in position3.

For B: in position1, marked as '-'? Meaning not in position1.

We know the word has A, B, O.

Now, positions:

- Position2: R
- Position3: cannot be O (from guess3), cannot be A (from guess1 and2), must be B or a new letter? But we have only three more positions? And we need to place A, B, O.

Positions: 1,3,4,5

Letters to place: A, B, O, and the fourth letter X.

Constraints for each letter:

- A: must be in 1 or 5 (since we've ruled out 3 and4? And 2 is taken).
- B: cannot be in1 (from guess3, B in1 was '-'), cannot be in2 (occupied) so must be in3,4, or5.
- O: cannot be in3 (from guess3, O in3 was '-'), so must be in1,4, or5.
- X: can be anywhere available.

But we also know from guess3 feedback: the word has B, O, and A present.

Now for position3: we know it cannot be A or O, so it must be B or X? But if we put B in position3, that's possible? Or X.

Now let's consider the possibilities for A:

Case 1: A in position1.
Then the word: A R [3] [4] [5]
Position3: cannot be A or O, so either B or X.
But we have to place B and O.

Case 2: A in position5.
Then the word: [1] R [3] [4] A
Position3: cannot be O or A, so B or X.

In both cases, we need to see what words are possible.

We also have the eliminated letters: C,N,E,T,S,H,D.

Common letters left: L, P, U, I, G, F, etc.

Now for the next guess, we want to test both cases.

Perhaps we can try to put A in position1? To see if it's correct.

So guess a word: A R ? ? ?

But we also need to test for B and O and X.

But are there words that start with A and R, then have B? Like ""ARBOR"" but O is already there? Let's see.

""ARBOR"": A R B O R -> duplicate R? Not allowed? Well, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. But perhaps.

But let's see positions: A(1), R(2), B(3), O(4), R(5) -> duplicate R? And R is already known in position2, so if there is another R, it might be okay? But we don't know if R is duplicated? From previous feedback, we have only one R that's fixed? But it could have another R.

In the feedback, when we had guesses with only one R, we have no evidence of duplicates.

However, to avoid complexity, let's assume distinct for now? But we might be wrong.

Try to find a word that starts with AR?, and has B and O? Or something.

Example: ""ARBOR"" has duplicate letters.

""AROMA"": A R O M A -> duplicate A? And we have position1: A, position4: M, position5: A? But we are testing A in position1? But if duplicate is allowed.

But let's see the structure.

Another: ""ARGON"": but has G and O. Positions: A1, R2, G3, O4, N5? But N is eliminated? Not possible.

We cannot use eliminated letters.

So available letters: F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and then A,B,O because we know they are present? When we guess, we can use letters that are present or not? But since we know they are in the word, our guess should include them? Not necessarily, but to get information, we should.

For testing, I want to test if A is in position1. So put A in position1.

Then for position3: I need a letter that is either B or O or something else? But B must be in the word? So I have to include B somewhere? Actually, yes, because B is in the word, so our guess should include all known present letters? Not necessarily, but to avoid missing information, it could be wise.

So let's try to include B and O in the guess.

Word starting with A R and then what? With B and O and one more.

Try ""ARROW"": A R R O W -> duplicate R? And R is tested twice. But position3: R, which might conflict? Also, we have position4: O, position5: W.

But is ""arrow"" valid? Yes, has duplicate R.

But feedback for position3: R might be marked? But we already know R is at position2? If there is another R, it might be marked accordingly.

But let's avoid duplicates to save time.

Another word: ""ABBOT"" but duplicate B? And no? A B B O T -> but positions not R at2.

Not for position2 R.

Must have R at2? So structure: A R [3] [4] [5]

Try ""ARSON"": but S is eliminated? Not.

""ARBOR"": with duplicate R.

""ARENA"": but N and A duplicate? Not because N eliminated? N is x? Eliminated? Yes, N eliminated.

Another: ""AVAIL""? No, V is available, but would be A V A I L? but not R at2? Not matching.

Not.

Can we do ""ORBAL"" or something? No.

Another idea: maybe put A in position5 and see what happens.

Guess: e.g., ""? R ? ? A"" with ? being letters that include B and O.

For example, the word ""LUMBAR"": too many letters? No, 6 letters.

5 letter words: ""ULTRA"" but T eliminated.

""ZEBRA"" same.

""PROBA"" not a word.

""FUBAR"" not common.

Perhaps ""RUMBA"" -> R U M B A -> but doesn't have R at position2? Position1:R? We need R at position2, so position1 cannot be R? Unless duplicate, but to have R at2.

But ""RUMBA"" has R at position1, not position2. So structure: R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> position2 is U, not R? But we need R at2.

So this is invalid.

Another option: ""GRADE"" E eliminated.

So few words with A at the end and R at position2? But not.

Let me try: ""? R ? ? A"" -> for example, ""CRAWL"" but C and L? C eliminated? C is eliminated.

""BRAVA"" B R A V A -> duplicate A? And position3:A, which we know is not? But we can guess.

But if we guess ""BRAVA"": 
- Position1: B (we know B is present but not in1, so if we put B in1, it would be '-')
- Position2: R (correct)
- Position3: A (but A is present? But if in the word A is in position5 or1, then position3 might be something else? But we put A there? 

Actually, it might be messy.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A in position5, B in position3, and O in position4, for example? Like ""? R B O A"" -> such as ""URBOA"" not word.

""TURBO"" is T U R B O -> positions: T(1), U(2) -> not R at2.

No.

Other structure: have A not in1 and not in5? But we know it has to be in1 or5.

Perhaps ""ROBOT"": R O B O T -> has O at2? But we need R at2? Position1: R? Not fixed.

Not matching.

Let's rethink.

Another approach: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know, so better not assume.

Now, from guess3 broad: feedback for O in position3 was '-', and we have to include O elsewhere.

Similarly for B in position1.

For the next guess, I propose to test position1 with O? And put A in position5.

For example, ""O R ? ? A""

Then letters for position3 and4: must include B and the remaining letter? Or B in one of them.

But we have position3: cannot be O or A, so it could be B or X.

Position4: could be B or X or O? But O is used? If we put O in position4, is that possible? In guess3, O was in position3 and was '-', so O could be in4.

Similarly for B: we put B in position1 and got '-', so not in1, so it can be in3,4, or5.

But position5 is A.

So for positions:1:O,2:R,3:?,4:?,5:A

Then for position3 and4: we have to place B and one other letter X.

But what is X? We don't know, so we need to choose a letter.

Possible words: O R B X A? Like ""ORCYX"" not English.

O R L B A? ""ORLBA"" not word.

O R E B A? but E eliminated.

O R U B A? not word.

Perhaps ""ORTHO"" but no A.

Not.

If we switch: put B in position3: O R B ? A

Then position4: could be O? But we already used O in position1? So duplicate? Or we use a different letter.

But we need a word ending with A.

Words like ""OR"" + consonant + vowel + A, but hard.

""ORGMA"" not.

Another idea: perhaps A in position1 and B in position3, or something.

But still hard.

Let's go back to the feedback.

In guess3 broad: B in position1 was '-', which means B is not in position1 but is in the word.

O in position3 was '-', so O is in the word but not in position3.

A in position4 was '-', so A is in the word but not in position4.

D in position5 was 'x', so D not in the word.

We also have positions that have to have letters.

Given that, the word must include B, O, A in positions among 1,3,5? But position3 can't have A or O, and position1 can have O or A? So position3 must be B or the fifth letter.

Similarly, position1 can be O or A or the fifth letter? But we have to place three letters: B,O,A into positions 1,3,5 (since position4 is open, but A cannot be in4) and position5 is open? Positions: 1,3,4,5 are open? But or4, we haven't eliminated it for O or B? But for A, we have not position4.

So let's list possible positions for each letter:

- A: position1 or position5 (since 2,3,4 ruled out)
- B: position3,4,5 (since not in1, and position2 is R)
- O: position1,4,5 (not in3)

And there's a fourth letter X for the remaining spot.

So we have to select.

For the next guess, we can try to set position1 to O, position5 to A, and then position3 and4 to B and X? But which is which.

Since B and O both can be in position4 and5, we can try.

But we can only guess B in one position.

Perhaps it is better to try a word where O is in position1 and A in position5, as that might be a common pattern.

For example, words like ""OPERA"" but E eliminated. Or ""OVERT"" T eliminated. ""OCTAN"" C eliminated.

""OLIVA"" or ""OLVER"" etc.

""OAKUM"" not.

""OASIS"" S eliminated.

""OUNCE"" N and E eliminated.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"" too long.

Another: ""OLEUM"" etc.

Let’s consider: ""O R U M A"" -> ""ORUMA"" not a word.

Not working.

Perhaps put B in position4 with O and A at ends.

For example, ""O R ? B A"" -> but what at position3? Position3: must be a letter. And we have only one spot.

For example, ""O R C B A"" C eliminated.

""O R G B A"" ""ORGBA"" not word.

 ""OR G E B A"" no.

So not.

Alternative: don't put A at position1 or5 yet? But we have to include it.

Perhaps test position5 with A first.

So guess word: ? R ? ? A

Then we can put O in position4 and B in position3? Or other combination.

For instance, the word could be X R B O A? ""URBOS"" not.

Or ""IRB OA"" not.

"" CR W B A"" C eliminated.

""PROBE"" E eliminated.

""GRABE"" E and might not word.

""TRAB UA"" not.

What about ""BRICK"" not at all.

We need to find a valid English word that fits the pattern and available letters.

Letters available: not C,N,E,T,S,H,D, so we have: F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We also must include A,B,O.

So the word must be: _ R _ _ _ with letters that include A,B,O and one other from available list.

With A in position5: then word: a letter at1, R at2, a letter at3, a letter at4, A at5.

The letter at1,3,4 must include B and O and one other.

But B and O must be in the word.

So for position1: can be O? If we put O in position1, then at positions3 and4 we need to put B and a letter.

Words: O R ? ? A

With positions3 and4: must have letter and B.

For example, "" O R C B A"" C eliminated.

"" O R G E A"" E eliminated.

"" O R K B A"" ""ORKBA"" not word.

"" O R L B A"" ""ORLBA"" not.

"" O R P B A"" ""ORPBA"" not.

Perhaps we can put B in position4: O R X B A

With X a letter for position3.

X must be from available letters, e.g., U: ""ORUBA"" not word.

G: "" "" etc.

Another idea: if A is in position1? Then we have ""A R ? ? ?""

Then B and O must be in positions3,4,5.

But position3 cannot be O or A, so must be B or X.

Position4 can be O or B or X, position5 similar.

So like ""A R B O X"" or "" A R X O B"" etc.

For example, ""ARBOR"" with duplicate R, issue.

""AROMA"" with duplicate A? A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> positions:1 A (correct?), 2 R correct, etc.

""AROMA"" seems a valid word? But has two A's? Let's see:  1:A, 2:R, 3:O, 4:M, 5:A.

Yes, duplicate A. But we don't know if the word allows duplicate. If it does, it's possible.

Also, available letters: A,R,O, M, A. And M is not eliminated? Tired? M is available.

Also, include O and B? B is missing? But the word has B? We must include B because it's present? But ""AROMA"" has A,R,O,M,A. No B, so it does not have B? But B is in the word? We know B is in the word because in guess3, B was marked as present, so the secret word must have B. But ""AROMA"" doesn't have B, so it can't be? So we cannot guess ""AROMA"" because it lacks B.

Any guess must include B, as it is in the word.

Similarly, must include A and O.

So for pattern with A in position1, word: A R [3] [4] [5] with [3] [4] [5] including B and O.

But [3] cannot be O (because not in position3), so must be B or X. But B can be in3.

So for example, if [3] = B, then A R B [4] [5] with [4] and [5] including O and possibly the other letter.

So words like ""ARBOR"": positions 1:A, 2:R, 3:B, 4:O, 5:R -> has R twice? B and R.

Includes B and O? O at position4, so yes.

But duplicate R? R at position2 and5? In the secret word, if there is a second R, it might be.

And ""ARBOR"" is a valid English word.

Another: ""ARROW"": 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:O, 5:W -> includes B? No, has R twice? And no B.

""ARBOR"" does not have O? ""ARBOR"" has A R B O R -> so it has O at position4. Yes.

But it has only one O? And B at position3.

Includes letters: A,R,B,O,R -> has A,B,O,R and duplicate R.

But are the letters in the word not in the set? Or it contains B and O.

It seems possible.

And we can use it.

Also, B is in position3, which is allowed? We haven't ruled it out.

Similarly, O in position4: we haven't directly ruled it out.

So for guess4, we can guess ""ARBOR"" to test.

But the secret word has R at position2, so if we have R at position5, it might give us feedback if there is a second R.

If it works, good.

It might also give us information about the positions.

So I think ""ARBOR"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""ARBLAST"" too long.

But for 5 letters, ""ARBOR"" works.

Another possibility: ""ABOVE"" but V and E.

E is eliminated.

Not.

So I think ""ARBOR"" is a guess we can try.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is confirmed in position 2.
     - A is present but not in position 1 or 3.
     - C, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (trash):** T(x), R(✓), A(-), S(x), H(x)  
     - R confirmed again in position 2.
     - A is present but not in position 3 (redundant with Guess 1).
     - T, S, H are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (broad):** B(-), R(✓), O(-), A(-), D(x)  
     - R confirmed in position 2.
     - B is present but not in position 1.
     - O is present but not in position 3.
     - A is present but not in position 4.
     - D is absent.

2. **Key Deductions:**
   - **Fixed Position:** Position 2 is R → Pattern: `_ R _ _ _`
   - **Confirmed Present Letters:** A, B, O (all must appear in the word).
   - **Eliminated Letters:** C, N, E, T, S, H, D (cannot appear).
   - **Position Constraints:**
     - A: Must be in position 1 or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are ruled out by feedback).
     - B: Cannot be in position 1 (so must be in 3, 4, or 5).
     - O: Cannot be in position 3 (so must be in 1, 4, or 5).
   - **Additional Letter:** The word requires one more letter (X) from the remaining pool after excluding eliminated letters (e.g., F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Focus on **disambiguating A's position** (1 or 5) while incorporating B and O.
   - **Test ""A in position 1""** by guessing a word starting with A, with R at position 2, and including B and O.
   - A valid word fitting this is ""ARBOR"":
     - A in position 1 (tests if correct).
     - R in position 2 (confirmed fixed).
     - B in position 3 (tests B's position).
     - O in position 4 (tests O's position).
     - R in position 5 (tests for R duplication; though R is fixed at position 2, a second R could elicit feedback).
   - ""ARBOR"" includes all confirmed letters (A, B, O) and uses no eliminated letters.
   - If A is correct, we confirm position 1; if A is marked wrong position (-), it must be in position 5.",Guess 6: arbor -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) B(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
