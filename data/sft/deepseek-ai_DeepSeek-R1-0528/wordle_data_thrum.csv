We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) -> R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since the feedback is for the first letter? Actually, note: the feedback is for each letter in the position it was guessed. So R was in the second position of ""crane"", but in the secret word it is present but not in the second position).
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, we can eliminate words that have C, A, N, E and also words that have R in the second position.

 We also note that the first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was in the first position and got an 'x'), and the second letter is not R (because we got '-' for R meaning it's present but not in that position).

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N, E (the absent letters).
 - Contains R, but not in the second position.
 - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, H, M, P, U, etc.

 We also know that the R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that the first letter was C and we got an 'x', so the first letter is not C and also not R? Actually, we don't know about the first letter being R because we haven't tested R in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was C(x) meaning the first letter is not C, but it could be R? But wait, we have R in the second position and we know R is in the word but not in the second position. So if the first letter were R, then that would be a possibility. But we haven't tested R in the first position.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about the first letter being R or not. We only know that the first letter is not C, and that R is in the word but not in the second position.

 So for the next guess, we can try to put R in a different position, and also test other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has R in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
 - Uses other common consonants and vowels that we haven't eliminated. We have eliminated A and E (vowels) so we are left with I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we haven't tried O, I, U, etc.

 However, we must avoid: C, A, N, E.

 Let's consider using the letter R in the first position? That might be a good idea to check if R is the first letter.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. A good second guess might be ""ROUST"" or ""ROTLS"" but we need a valid word.

 Another idea: since we know R is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

 But note: we don't have any information about the first letter. We know it's not C, but it could be any other letter.

 Let's try to pick a word that has R in the first position and then uses other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Example: ""ROBOT"" -> but that has O and T, and also B. However, we have two O's? We want to avoid duplicates if possible to get more information? But the secret word might have duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROILS"" or ""ROOMY"" but we are limited to 5 letters.

 But note: we have to avoid A and E, and also C, N.

 Let me think of words that start with R and have other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""ROAST"" -> but has A (which we know is absent) -> invalid for our guess because we know A is not in the word.
 - ""ROBOT"" -> has O and B, T. But we don't know about O, B, T. However, we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? No: R-O-B-O-T -> that's two O's? Actually, it's R, O, B, O, T -> so two O's. We might get less information if we use duplicate letters.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 How about ""ROWDY""? 
 - R in first position, then O, W, D, Y. 
 - But we haven't tried O, W, D, Y.

 However, we are missing testing some other common letters like S, T, L.

 Another idea: ""SPRIT"" -> but we know that the word must contain R, and we are putting R in the third position. Also, we haven't tried S, P, R, I, T. But note: we are avoiding A, E, C, N. However, we have to be cautious: we are using R again, which we know is present, but we are testing it in a new position (third). Also, we are testing S, P, I, T.

 But wait, we are not allowed to use letters we know are absent? We can, but it would be inefficient. We know that the word has R, so we should use R. But we are free to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, A, N, E). So S, P, I, T are all allowed.

 However, we must form a valid English word.

 Let me check: ""SPRIT"" is a word? It means a type of sail or a shoot of a plant. Alternatively, we can use ""SPRIT"" or ""STRIP"" but note that ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P. 

 But we want to test the first position? We don't have information about the first position. We know it's not C, but it could be S, T, R, etc.

 Since we have R to place, and we want to test if R is in the first position, we might try a word that starts with R.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the third or fourth position to see if we can locate it.

 Considering the feedback from the first guess: 
   We had ""crane"" -> the second letter was R and we got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not in the second position.

 So if we put R in the first position and it is correct, we get a check. If we put it in the first and it's not correct, then we get a '-' and we know R is in the word but not in the first or second (if we get a '-' for first position then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3,4,5).

 So to maximize information, we can try R in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think a good candidate is ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" means to make (a liquid) turbid or muddy by disturbing the sediment. It's a valid word.

 But note: we haven't tried O, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, ""ROUST"" (to rouse or drive out) is a word: R-O-U-S-T.

 But we haven't tried O, U, S, T.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROILS"" -> R (position 1), O (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)
 Option 2: ""ROUST"" -> R (1), O (2), U (3), S (4), T (5)

 We know that the second letter is not R (from the first feedback), but we don't know about the first letter. If we put R in the first position and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is not in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3,4,5.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Both words use 4 new letters (since R is repeated, but we are testing it in a new position).

 However, we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. Both words avoid these.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: R, O, U, S, T.

 But note: we are testing two vowels: O and U. We don't have any vowel information yet (since A and E are out, and we haven't tested I, O, U). The secret word must have at least one vowel? Probably, but not necessarily (e.g., ""CRWTH"" is a word without vowels, but it's rare). We'll assume it has at least one vowel.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"": 
   S, P, O, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the bad letters.

 But we are not testing the first position for R? We are testing S in the first position. This might be good too.

 However, we are trying to locate R. We know R is in the word, so we want to try it in a position we haven't tried (so not position 2). We tried position 2 in the first guess. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no information about the first letter, I think it's important to test the first letter. So I prefer to put R in the first position.

 Therefore, I choose ""ROUST"".

 Let me write it: R O U S T.

 We are guessing: R in position 1, O in 2, U in 3, S in 4, T in 5.

 If we get:
   R(✓) then we know the first letter is R.
   R(-) then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess) so it must be in 3,4,5.
   R(x) would be impossible because we know R is in the word.

 But note: the feedback for R in the first guess was '-' meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1 and it is not the first letter, we will get a '-' again. We cannot get an 'x' for R because we know it's in the word.

 So we are safe.

 Let's go with ""roust"".

<guess>roust</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (marked with ""-"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word **contains R**, but it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).
2. The first letter is **not C** (eliminated), and the secret word avoids A, N, E entirely.
3. New guess should:
   - Include **R** in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
   - Introduce **new common letters** (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to gather more information.
   - Avoid eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

Selected guess: **ROUST**  
- Tests R in **position 1** (if correct, reveals first letter; if ""-"", confirms R is in 3/4/5).
- Tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (S, T), covering high-frequency letters.
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding eliminated characters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) -> R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since the feedback is for the first letter? Actually, note: the feedback is for each letter in the position it was guessed. So R was in the second position of ""crane"", but in the secret word it is present but not in the second position).
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, we can eliminate words that have C, A, N, E and also words that have R in the second position.

 We also note that the first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was in the first position and got an 'x'), and the second letter is not R (because we got '-' for R meaning it's present but not in that position).

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N, E (the absent letters).
 - Contains R, but not in the second position.
 - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, H, M, P, U, etc.

 We also know that the R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that the first letter was C and we got an 'x', so the first letter is not C and also not R? Actually, we don't know about the first letter being R because we haven't tested R in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was C(x) meaning the first letter is not C, but it could be R? But wait, we have R in the second position and we know R is in the word but not in the second position. So if the first letter were R, then that would be a possibility. But we haven't tested R in the first position.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about the first letter being R or not. We only know that the first letter is not C, and that R is in the word but not in the second position.

 So for the next guess, we can try to put R in a different position, and also test other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has R in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
 - Uses other common consonants and vowels that we haven't eliminated. We have eliminated A and E (vowels) so we are left with I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we haven't tried O, I, U, etc.

 However, we must avoid: C, A, N, E.

 Let's consider using the letter R in the first position? That might be a good idea to check if R is the first letter.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. A good second guess might be ""ROUST"" or ""ROTLS"" but we need a valid word.

 Another idea: since we know R is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

 But note: we don't have any information about the first letter. We know it's not C, but it could be any other letter.

 Let's try to pick a word that has R in the first position and then uses other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Example: ""ROBOT"" -> but that has O and T, and also B. However, we have two O's? We want to avoid duplicates if possible to get more information? But the secret word might have duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROILS"" or ""ROOMY"" but we are limited to 5 letters.

 But note: we have to avoid A and E, and also C, N.

 Let me think of words that start with R and have other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""ROAST"" -> but has A (which we know is absent) -> invalid for our guess because we know A is not in the word.
 - ""ROBOT"" -> has O and B, T. But we don't know about O, B, T. However, we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? No: R-O-B-O-T -> that's two O's? Actually, it's R, O, B, O, T -> so two O's. We might get less information if we use duplicate letters.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 How about ""ROWDY""? 
 - R in first position, then O, W, D, Y. 
 - But we haven't tried O, W, D, Y.

 However, we are missing testing some other common letters like S, T, L.

 Another idea: ""SPRIT"" -> but we know that the word must contain R, and we are putting R in the third position. Also, we haven't tried S, P, R, I, T. But note: we are avoiding A, E, C, N. However, we have to be cautious: we are using R again, which we know is present, but we are testing it in a new position (third). Also, we are testing S, P, I, T.

 But wait, we are not allowed to use letters we know are absent? We can, but it would be inefficient. We know that the word has R, so we should use R. But we are free to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, A, N, E). So S, P, I, T are all allowed.

 However, we must form a valid English word.

 Let me check: ""SPRIT"" is a word? It means a type of sail or a shoot of a plant. Alternatively, we can use ""SPRIT"" or ""STRIP"" but note that ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P. 

 But we want to test the first position? We don't have information about the first position. We know it's not C, but it could be S, T, R, etc.

 Since we have R to place, and we want to test if R is in the first position, we might try a word that starts with R.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the third or fourth position to see if we can locate it.

 Considering the feedback from the first guess: 
   We had ""crane"" -> the second letter was R and we got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not in the second position.

 So if we put R in the first position and it is correct, we get a check. If we put it in the first and it's not correct, then we get a '-' and we know R is in the word but not in the first or second (if we get a '-' for first position then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3,4,5).

 So to maximize information, we can try R in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think a good candidate is ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" means to make (a liquid) turbid or muddy by disturbing the sediment. It's a valid word.

 But note: we haven't tried O, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, ""ROUST"" (to rouse or drive out) is a word: R-O-U-S-T.

 But we haven't tried O, U, S, T.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROILS"" -> R (position 1), O (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)
 Option 2: ""ROUST"" -> R (1), O (2), U (3), S (4), T (5)

 We know that the second letter is not R (from the first feedback), but we don't know about the first letter. If we put R in the first position and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is not in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3,4,5.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Both words use 4 new letters (since R is repeated, but we are testing it in a new position).

 However, we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. Both words avoid these.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: R, O, U, S, T.

 But note: we are testing two vowels: O and U. We don't have any vowel information yet (since A and E are out, and we haven't tested I, O, U). The secret word must have at least one vowel? Probably, but not necessarily (e.g., ""CRWTH"" is a word without vowels, but it's rare). We'll assume it has at least one vowel.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"": 
   S, P, O, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the bad letters.

 But we are not testing the first position for R? We are testing S in the first position. This might be good too.

 However, we are trying to locate R. We know R is in the word, so we want to try it in a position we haven't tried (so not position 2). We tried position 2 in the first guess. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no information about the first letter, I think it's important to test the first letter. So I prefer to put R in the first position.

 Therefore, I choose ""ROUST"".

 Let me write it: R O U S T.

 We are guessing: R in position 1, O in 2, U in 3, S in 4, T in 5.

 If we get:
   R(✓) then we know the first letter is R.
   R(-) then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess) so it must be in 3,4,5.
   R(x) would be impossible because we know R is in the word.

 But note: the feedback for R in the first guess was '-' meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1 and it is not the first letter, we will get a '-' again. We cannot get an 'x' for R because we know it's in the word.

 So we are safe.

 Let's go with ""roust"".

<guess>roust</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (marked with ""-"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word **contains R**, but it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).
2. The first letter is **not C** (eliminated), and the secret word avoids A, N, E entirely.
3. New guess should:
   - Include **R** in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
   - Introduce **new common letters** (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to gather more information.
   - Avoid eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

Selected guess: **ROUST**  
- Tests R in **position 1** (if correct, reveals first letter; if ""-"", confirms R is in 3/4/5).
- Tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (S, T), covering high-frequency letters.
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding eliminated characters.

We are given feedback for the second guess ""roust"":
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the first position (since we guessed it in position 1).
 O(x) -> O is not in the word.
 U(-) -> U is in the word but not in the third position.
 S(x) -> S is not in the word.
 T(-) -> T is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 Now, combining with the first guess:
 From guess 1: We know R is in the word but not in position 2, and C, A, N, E are absent.
 From guess 2: We know O and S are absent, and U and T are present but not in the positions we guessed (U not in 3, T not in 5). Also, R is not in position 1 (and we already knew not in position 2).

 So now we know:
 Present letters: R, U, T
 Absent letters: C, A, N, E, O, S

 And we know the positions for the present letters that are incorrect:
 - R is not in position 1 or 2 -> so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
 - U is not in position 3 -> but we don't know where it is, only that it's in the word and not in 3.
 - T is not in position 5 -> and we don't know where it is.

 Also, we have two positions that we have no information about? Actually, we have 5 positions and we know some letters are absent and some are present.

 We need to form a word that:
 - Contains R, U, T (since they are present) and two new letters that we haven't eliminated.
 - Avoids C, A, N, E, O, S.
 - Places R in either position 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 2).
 - Places U not in position 3, and T not in position 5.

 Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information. The remaining common letters we haven't tried include: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

 We have 3 known letters to include: R, U, T.

 We need to choose two more letters from the remaining untried letters (avoiding the absent ones).

 Also, we have to form a valid English word.

 Let's think about possible positions for R, U, T.

 Since R must be in 3,4,5, we can try to put R in position 3, for example, and then place U and T in other positions.

 But note: we have constraints on U and T: U cannot be in position 3 (but if we put R in 3, then U can go elsewhere) and T cannot be in position 5.

 So T must be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But we are putting R in 3, so T cannot be in 3? Then T must be in 1,2, or 4.

 Similarly, U cannot be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5.

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's try to form a word:

 Example: We put R in position 3. Then we have:
   _ _ R _ _

 We need to place U and T and two new letters.

 We can try to put T in position 1: T _ R _ _
 Then U in position 2: T U R _ _ -> but then we have two more letters to fill. And we know T is in the word, but we have it in position 1. The feedback for T in the second guess was that it's not in position 5, but it could be in position 1? We don't know. So that's possible.

 But we need a word: T U R _ _ 
 Possible words: TURFY, TURPS, TURMS, TURNS, but note we have eliminated letters: N and S are out, so TURNS is invalid. TURFS? But S is out. TURFY? That's a word (resembling turf). But we have to check the letters: T, U, R, F, Y. F and Y are new.

 But we have to avoid O and S? Yes, and F and Y are not eliminated.

 Alternatively, we can try TURBO? But O is eliminated.

 How about TURDS? But S is eliminated.

 So TURFY might be acceptable? But let's see if there are better options.

 Alternatively, we can put R in position 4.

 Then: _ _ _ R _

 We can put T in position 1: T _ _ R _
 And U in position 2: T U _ R _ -> then we have two more letters. Example: TUMOR? But O is out. TUTOR? O is out. TUBER? But E is out. TUDOR? O is out.

 How about TULIP? But we have I and P, but we are putting R in position 4? T U L I P -> that doesn't have R. So we need to include R in position 4.

 So: T U _ R _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can try T U B R A? But A is out. T U M R Y? That might be a word? ""Tumry"" is not a word.

 Alternatively, put U in position 1 and T in position 2: U T _ R _ -> but we know U is not in position 3, but we are putting it in 1, which is allowed. And T is not in 5, but we are putting it in 2, which is allowed. Then we have U T _ R _. Example: UTTER? But we have two T's? And E is out. UTMOST? O and S are out. UTERI? E is out.

 This is getting difficult.

 Let me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, W, Y, and we must include R, U, T.

 We know R must be in 3,4,5. Let's try R in position 5? Then we have: _ _ _ _ R

 We need to place U and T and two new letters.

 We can put T in position 1: T _ _ _ R
 And U in position 2: T U _ _ R -> then we have two letters in the middle. Example: TUMOR? O out. TUNER? E and N out. TUTOR? O out. TUBER? E out.

 How about TULIP? But then we don't have R? We need R at the end. TULIP doesn't end with R.

 Alternatively, we can put U in position 1 and T in position 4: U _ _ T R -> but T is in position 4? Then we have U _ _ T R. Example: UNTIE? But N and E are out. UMPTY? Not a word. ULTRA? That's a word: U L T R A -> but A is out. ULTRA has A? U-L-T-R-A -> A is the last letter? But we are putting R in position 5? Actually, in ULTRA, R is in position 4 and A in 5. But we need R in 5. So that doesn't work.

 How about U _ _ T R: words like UMTYR? Not a word. UPTRY? Not a word.

 This is challenging.

 Let me try R in position 4: _ _ _ R _

 We can try to put U in position 1 and T in position 2: U T _ R _ -> then we need two letters for position 3 and 5. We can use I and L? U T I R L -> ""UTIRL"" is not a word. U T B R K -> not a word.

 How about U in position 1 and T in position 5? But we know T cannot be in position 5? The feedback for T was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put T in position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put U in position 3.

 So let's go back to R in position 3: _ _ R _ _

 We can try:
   Position 1: T (so T _ R _ _)
   Position 2: U (so T U R _ _) -> then we need two letters for 4 and 5.

 We have to choose two letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, W, Y) that form a valid word.

 Possible words:
   TURFY (F and Y) -> valid.
   TURPS (P and S) -> S is out, invalid.
   TURDS (D and S) -> S out, invalid.
   TURFS (F and S) -> S out, invalid.
   TURGY? Not a word.
   TURLY? Not a word.
   TURMY? Not a word.

 TURBY? Not a word.

 How about TURF? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

 Another idea: T U R B I -> TURBI? Not a word.
 T U R G I -> TURGI? Not a word.

 T U R P I -> TURPI? Not a word.

 T U R M P -> TURMP? Not a word.

 T U R L I -> TURLI? Not a word.

 T U R D Y -> TURDY? That's a word (resembling excrement). But we have D and Y.

 But we haven't tried D and Y. So TURDY is a valid word? It's in the dictionary as an adjective.

 However, we might avoid it for being obscure? But if it's in the word list, it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try without T in the first position.

 How about putting U in position 1 and T in position 4? Then: U _ R T _

 We know U is not in position 3, but we are putting it in 1, which is fine. T is not in 5, but we are putting it in 4, which is fine.

 Then we have: U _ R T _

 We need two letters for position 2 and 5.

 Example: U R R T ? -> but we have two R's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate so far, but it's possible.

 However, we know R is in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 and 3? That would be two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's. We only know one R so far.

 We should avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

 So let's avoid two R's.

 Then: U _ R T _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

 Words: UPRT? Not 5 letters. UART? Not 5.

 How about U B R T H -> UBRTH? Not a word.

 U M R T H -> UMRTH? Not a word.

 U L R T H -> ULTRH? Not a word.

 U P R T Y -> UPRTY? Not a word.

 This is difficult.

 Another idea: put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R

 Then we can put U in position 1 and T in position 2: U T _ _ R -> then we need two letters for 3 and 4.

 Example: U T I L R -> UTILR? Not a word.
 U T O P R -> but O is out.
 U T E R R -> E is out and duplicate R.

 U T B Y R -> UTBYR? Not a word.

 How about U T M P R -> UTMPR? Not a word.

 We are struggling.

 Let me try a different approach: we know the word has R, U, T and two other letters from the available set.

 We also know R is in 3,4,5.

 Let's list possible words that contain R, U, T and avoid C,A,N,E,O,S.

 We can use a word list? But we don't have one, so we have to think.

 Common words: 
   BRUNT -> but B is new, but we have B? But BRUNT: B, R, U, N, T -> but N is out.
   TRUCK -> C is out.
   GRUNT -> N out.
   DRUGS -> S out.
   FRUIT -> F, R, U, I, T -> this has F, I, T, R, U. And avoids the bad letters. And R is in position 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from the first guess). So if we use FRUIT, R is in position 2, which is invalid for R? But wait, the feedback for R in the first guess was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we already know that. However, we are trying to find the word, so we can use it? But it would be inefficient because we know R is not in position 2.

 So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In FRUIT, R is in position 2, so we cannot use it.

 How about ""TRUTH"": T, R, U, T, H -> has two T's. And R is in position 2 -> again, position 2 for R is invalid.

 How about ""THRUM"": T, H, R, U, M -> R is in position 3. This is good. And it has T, H, R, U, M. And avoids the bad letters.

 Let's check: 
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T can be in position 1? The feedback for T was that it is not in position 5, but it could be in 1.
   H is new.
   R in position 3 -> we are testing R in 3.
   U in position 4 -> we know U is not in 3, but 4 is allowed.
   M in position 5.

 So ""THRUM"" is a valid word.

 Let me confirm: THRUM means to strum or a thrumming sound.

 So we can guess ""THRUM"".

 This tests:
   T in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get '-' or 'x'? But we know T is in the word, so we won't get 'x'. If it's not in 1, we get '-'.
   H is new: if it's in the word, we get information.
   R in position 3: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get '-' (since we know R is present) and then we know R is not in 3 (so must be in 4 or 5).
   U in position 4: if correct, check; if not, then we get '-' (since U is present) and we know U is not in 4 (so it must be in 1,2, or 5? But we have it in 4, and if it's not there, then it's in 1,2,5. But we have T in 1 and M in 5, so if U is in 1 or 5, then we would have a conflict? Not necessarily, because we are guessing and the word might have U in 1 or 5, but we are testing 4. So if we get a '-' for U, then U is not in 4, so it must be in 1,2, or 5. But we are also testing T in 1 and M in 5, so if U is in 1, then T cannot be in 1? But we'll see from feedback.
   M in position 5: we know T is not in 5, but M might be. If M is in the word, we get information.

 This seems a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BRUTY"": B, R, U, T, Y -> but R is in position 2, which we know is invalid for R? We know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid that.

 Another word: ""GRUFT""? Not common.

 I think ""THRUM"" is a good choice.

 So let's go with ""thrum"".

<guess>thrum</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)`  
  → **C, A, N, E** are **absent**. **R** is **present** but **not in position 2**.

- **Guess 2: ROUST**  
  Feedback: `R(-) O(x) U(-) S(x) T(-)`  
  → **O, S** are **absent**. **R, U, T** are **present** but **not in positions 1, 3, or 5** respectively.  
  - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from both guesses).  
  - U is not in position 3.  
  - T is not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: **R, U, T**.
2. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, O, S.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R must be in **position 3, 4, or 5** (cannot be in 1 or 2).
   - U cannot be in position 3.
   - T cannot be in position 5.
4. **New letters to test**: Focus on high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, Y).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include R, U, T** while respecting position constraints.
- **Test new letters** (H, M) to maximize information.
- **Place R in position 3** (a valid position) to check if it fits there.
- **Place T in position 1** (allowed, since T isn’t forbidden there) and **U in position 4** (allowed, since U isn’t forbidden there).
- **Avoid absent letters**.

Selected guess: **THRUM** (T-H-R-U-M).  
- Tests T in position 1, H (new) in position 2, R in position 3, U in position 4, M (new) in position 5.  
- Valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints.

<guess>thrum</guess>",thrum,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""roust"":
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the first position (since we guessed it in position 1).
 O(x) -> O is not in the word.
 U(-) -> U is in the word but not in the third position.
 S(x) -> S is not in the word.
 T(-) -> T is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 Now, combining with the first guess:
 From guess 1: We know R is in the word but not in position 2, and C, A, N, E are absent.
 From guess 2: We know O and S are absent, and U and T are present but not in the positions we guessed (U not in 3, T not in 5). Also, R is not in position 1 (and we already knew not in position 2).

 So now we know:
 Present letters: R, U, T
 Absent letters: C, A, N, E, O, S

 And we know the positions for the present letters that are incorrect:
 - R is not in position 1 or 2 -> so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
 - U is not in position 3 -> but we don't know where it is, only that it's in the word and not in 3.
 - T is not in position 5 -> and we don't know where it is.

 Also, we have two positions that we have no information about? Actually, we have 5 positions and we know some letters are absent and some are present.

 We need to form a word that:
 - Contains R, U, T (since they are present) and two new letters that we haven't eliminated.
 - Avoids C, A, N, E, O, S.
 - Places R in either position 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 2).
 - Places U not in position 3, and T not in position 5.

 Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information. The remaining common letters we haven't tried include: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

 We have 3 known letters to include: R, U, T.

 We need to choose two more letters from the remaining untried letters (avoiding the absent ones).

 Also, we have to form a valid English word.

 Let's think about possible positions for R, U, T.

 Since R must be in 3,4,5, we can try to put R in position 3, for example, and then place U and T in other positions.

 But note: we have constraints on U and T: U cannot be in position 3 (but if we put R in 3, then U can go elsewhere) and T cannot be in position 5.

 So T must be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But we are putting R in 3, so T cannot be in 3? Then T must be in 1,2, or 4.

 Similarly, U cannot be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5.

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's try to form a word:

 Example: We put R in position 3. Then we have:
   _ _ R _ _

 We need to place U and T and two new letters.

 We can try to put T in position 1: T _ R _ _
 Then U in position 2: T U R _ _ -> but then we have two more letters to fill. And we know T is in the word, but we have it in position 1. The feedback for T in the second guess was that it's not in position 5, but it could be in position 1? We don't know. So that's possible.

 But we need a word: T U R _ _ 
 Possible words: TURFY, TURPS, TURMS, TURNS, but note we have eliminated letters: N and S are out, so TURNS is invalid. TURFS? But S is out. TURFY? That's a word (resembling turf). But we have to check the letters: T, U, R, F, Y. F and Y are new.

 But we have to avoid O and S? Yes, and F and Y are not eliminated.

 Alternatively, we can try TURBO? But O is eliminated.

 How about TURDS? But S is eliminated.

 So TURFY might be acceptable? But let's see if there are better options.

 Alternatively, we can put R in position 4.

 Then: _ _ _ R _

 We can put T in position 1: T _ _ R _
 And U in position 2: T U _ R _ -> then we have two more letters. Example: TUMOR? But O is out. TUTOR? O is out. TUBER? But E is out. TUDOR? O is out.

 How about TULIP? But we have I and P, but we are putting R in position 4? T U L I P -> that doesn't have R. So we need to include R in position 4.

 So: T U _ R _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can try T U B R A? But A is out. T U M R Y? That might be a word? ""Tumry"" is not a word.

 Alternatively, put U in position 1 and T in position 2: U T _ R _ -> but we know U is not in position 3, but we are putting it in 1, which is allowed. And T is not in 5, but we are putting it in 2, which is allowed. Then we have U T _ R _. Example: UTTER? But we have two T's? And E is out. UTMOST? O and S are out. UTERI? E is out.

 This is getting difficult.

 Let me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, W, Y, and we must include R, U, T.

 We know R must be in 3,4,5. Let's try R in position 5? Then we have: _ _ _ _ R

 We need to place U and T and two new letters.

 We can put T in position 1: T _ _ _ R
 And U in position 2: T U _ _ R -> then we have two letters in the middle. Example: TUMOR? O out. TUNER? E and N out. TUTOR? O out. TUBER? E out.

 How about TULIP? But then we don't have R? We need R at the end. TULIP doesn't end with R.

 Alternatively, we can put U in position 1 and T in position 4: U _ _ T R -> but T is in position 4? Then we have U _ _ T R. Example: UNTIE? But N and E are out. UMPTY? Not a word. ULTRA? That's a word: U L T R A -> but A is out. ULTRA has A? U-L-T-R-A -> A is the last letter? But we are putting R in position 5? Actually, in ULTRA, R is in position 4 and A in 5. But we need R in 5. So that doesn't work.

 How about U _ _ T R: words like UMTYR? Not a word. UPTRY? Not a word.

 This is challenging.

 Let me try R in position 4: _ _ _ R _

 We can try to put U in position 1 and T in position 2: U T _ R _ -> then we need two letters for position 3 and 5. We can use I and L? U T I R L -> ""UTIRL"" is not a word. U T B R K -> not a word.

 How about U in position 1 and T in position 5? But we know T cannot be in position 5? The feedback for T was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put T in position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put U in position 3.

 So let's go back to R in position 3: _ _ R _ _

 We can try:
   Position 1: T (so T _ R _ _)
   Position 2: U (so T U R _ _) -> then we need two letters for 4 and 5.

 We have to choose two letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, W, Y) that form a valid word.

 Possible words:
   TURFY (F and Y) -> valid.
   TURPS (P and S) -> S is out, invalid.
   TURDS (D and S) -> S out, invalid.
   TURFS (F and S) -> S out, invalid.
   TURGY? Not a word.
   TURLY? Not a word.
   TURMY? Not a word.

 TURBY? Not a word.

 How about TURF? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

 Another idea: T U R B I -> TURBI? Not a word.
 T U R G I -> TURGI? Not a word.

 T U R P I -> TURPI? Not a word.

 T U R M P -> TURMP? Not a word.

 T U R L I -> TURLI? Not a word.

 T U R D Y -> TURDY? That's a word (resembling excrement). But we have D and Y.

 But we haven't tried D and Y. So TURDY is a valid word? It's in the dictionary as an adjective.

 However, we might avoid it for being obscure? But if it's in the word list, it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try without T in the first position.

 How about putting U in position 1 and T in position 4? Then: U _ R T _

 We know U is not in position 3, but we are putting it in 1, which is fine. T is not in 5, but we are putting it in 4, which is fine.

 Then we have: U _ R T _

 We need two letters for position 2 and 5.

 Example: U R R T ? -> but we have two R's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate so far, but it's possible.

 However, we know R is in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 and 3? That would be two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's. We only know one R so far.

 We should avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

 So let's avoid two R's.

 Then: U _ R T _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

 Words: UPRT? Not 5 letters. UART? Not 5.

 How about U B R T H -> UBRTH? Not a word.

 U M R T H -> UMRTH? Not a word.

 U L R T H -> ULTRH? Not a word.

 U P R T Y -> UPRTY? Not a word.

 This is difficult.

 Another idea: put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R

 Then we can put U in position 1 and T in position 2: U T _ _ R -> then we need two letters for 3 and 4.

 Example: U T I L R -> UTILR? Not a word.
 U T O P R -> but O is out.
 U T E R R -> E is out and duplicate R.

 U T B Y R -> UTBYR? Not a word.

 How about U T M P R -> UTMPR? Not a word.

 We are struggling.

 Let me try a different approach: we know the word has R, U, T and two other letters from the available set.

 We also know R is in 3,4,5.

 Let's list possible words that contain R, U, T and avoid C,A,N,E,O,S.

 We can use a word list? But we don't have one, so we have to think.

 Common words: 
   BRUNT -> but B is new, but we have B? But BRUNT: B, R, U, N, T -> but N is out.
   TRUCK -> C is out.
   GRUNT -> N out.
   DRUGS -> S out.
   FRUIT -> F, R, U, I, T -> this has F, I, T, R, U. And avoids the bad letters. And R is in position 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from the first guess). So if we use FRUIT, R is in position 2, which is invalid for R? But wait, the feedback for R in the first guess was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we already know that. However, we are trying to find the word, so we can use it? But it would be inefficient because we know R is not in position 2.

 So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In FRUIT, R is in position 2, so we cannot use it.

 How about ""TRUTH"": T, R, U, T, H -> has two T's. And R is in position 2 -> again, position 2 for R is invalid.

 How about ""THRUM"": T, H, R, U, M -> R is in position 3. This is good. And it has T, H, R, U, M. And avoids the bad letters.

 Let's check: 
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T can be in position 1? The feedback for T was that it is not in position 5, but it could be in 1.
   H is new.
   R in position 3 -> we are testing R in 3.
   U in position 4 -> we know U is not in 3, but 4 is allowed.
   M in position 5.

 So ""THRUM"" is a valid word.

 Let me confirm: THRUM means to strum or a thrumming sound.

 So we can guess ""THRUM"".

 This tests:
   T in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get '-' or 'x'? But we know T is in the word, so we won't get 'x'. If it's not in 1, we get '-'.
   H is new: if it's in the word, we get information.
   R in position 3: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get '-' (since we know R is present) and then we know R is not in 3 (so must be in 4 or 5).
   U in position 4: if correct, check; if not, then we get '-' (since U is present) and we know U is not in 4 (so it must be in 1,2, or 5? But we have it in 4, and if it's not there, then it's in 1,2,5. But we have T in 1 and M in 5, so if U is in 1 or 5, then we would have a conflict? Not necessarily, because we are guessing and the word might have U in 1 or 5, but we are testing 4. So if we get a '-' for U, then U is not in 4, so it must be in 1,2, or 5. But we are also testing T in 1 and M in 5, so if U is in 1, then T cannot be in 1? But we'll see from feedback.
   M in position 5: we know T is not in 5, but M might be. If M is in the word, we get information.

 This seems a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BRUTY"": B, R, U, T, Y -> but R is in position 2, which we know is invalid for R? We know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid that.

 Another word: ""GRUFT""? Not common.

 I think ""THRUM"" is a good choice.

 So let's go with ""thrum"".
