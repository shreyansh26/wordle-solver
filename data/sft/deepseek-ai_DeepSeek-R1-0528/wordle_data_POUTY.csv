We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, ROAST, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are making the second guess. The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 That means the secret word has none of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.
 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to gain more information.

 Let's recall common consonants and vowels. Since vowels are limited, but in this case we've ruled out A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 However, U and Y might be less common. O is a good vowel to try.

 Some good starting letters: We can try a word with O, and then common consonants like S, T, L, P, M, etc.

 Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible word: ""SPOIL"" - but contains I and O. But let's see if it has any excluded letter? No, S, P, O, I, L are none of C,R,A,N,E.

 However, we want to maximize new information. We haven't tried S, P, O, I, L.

 Alternative: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. Also clear.

 Another: ""POUND"" - but we have U and D, but N is excluded so we can't use N. So POUND has N -> invalid.

 Also, avoid using letters we already know are absent.

 Let's list available letters: We've used C,R,A,N,E. So avoid these.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to use frequent letters: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Words that fit: 
   ""SPOIL"" - letters: S, P, O, I, L.
   ""MOIST"" - letters: M, O, I, S, T. This has S, T and two vowels O, I. 
   ""LUMPS"" - L, U, M, P, S. U is less common.
   ""GHOUL"" - less common letters.

 Since we have no information, we can choose ""MOIST"" or ""SPOIL"".

Words like **""moist""** or **""spoil""** are strong options since they use common consonants (S, T, M, P, L) and explore new vowels (O, I). Choosing **""moist""** covers five new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all high-frequency, helping to quickly rule in/out critical components of the secret word.

We have two guesses so far:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter of the secret word is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) -> T is in the word but not the last letter.

So, from this we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The word contains T, but not in the fifth position (since T was guessed at the fifth and got -).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We can also note: since the second letter is O, we can represent the word as: _ O _ _ _

T is in the word but not fifth position. So T must be in one of positions: 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Has O as the second letter (since it's fixed there).
- Includes T somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the end because we know it's not fifth).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We also want to test other new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Available letters: We've used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T (O and T are present, others are absent). So avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover common letters: L, P, U, D, B, G, etc.

The word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is present and not at end. So let's try to place T in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a valid English word that fits: position2=O, and contains T (but not at position5).

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T O _ _ _
- Position 3: _ O T _ _
- Position 4: _ O _ T _

We also have three other slots to fill with letters not excluded.

Let's think of words:

Option: Position 1 = T
Word: T O _ _ _
Need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S, and already O, T.

Try:
- ""TOUGH"" -> T, O, U, G, H -> U, G, H are available? Yes. But wait, we have position2=O (correct), and T at position1 (we hope). We don't know about others. But note: we haven't tried U,G,H.

But is ""TOUGH"" a word? Yes.

But note: we have T at position1. We don't know yet if T is there. We know T is in the word, but we don't know where.

Alternatively, we might avoid placing T at position1 until we confirm? But we need to guess and get feedback.

We could try a word that puts T in a different slot to test.

But note: if we put T in position1 and it's wrong, we get feedback that T is not at position1 and then we know it must be at 3 or 4.

We have limited guesses (only 4 left), so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: Since we know the second letter is O, and T is present, but we don't know where, let's form a word that uses T in a different position and introduces three new letters.

For example, let's put T in position3: _ O T _ _

Possible words: 
- ""POUTH"" - not a word? 
- ""LOUTH"" - not common.
- ""DOUTY"" - not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MOTHY"" - but M is excluded, so no.
- ""GOTHY"" - not a word.

Position4: _ O _ T _

Words:
- ""BOLT"" is 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""VOLT"" is 4.

""BOUTS"" - but S is excluded.

We need words with available letters.

List: Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can use vowel-like: U, and sometimes Y.

Try words:

Option 1: Position1=T -> T O _ _ _
Possible: 
  ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> all new letters? U, G, H.
  ""TOWEL"" - but E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.
  ""TOUCH"" - C is excluded -> invalid.
  ""TOPAZ"" - P and Z? T,O,P,A,Z -> A is excluded -> invalid.

So ""TOUGH"" is valid: no excluded letters.

Option 2: Position3=T: _ O T _ _
Possible:
  ""PORTY"" - P,O,R,T,Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
  ""FOT"" not 5 letters.

Actually, hard to find examples? Maybe focus on option1 or option4.

Another position: position4=T -> _ O _ T _
Possible:
  ""DOTTY"" -> D,O,T,T,Y -> we haven't tried D and Y. But T repeated? We don't know if T is repeated? Because T might be repeated? But we only know one T is present? But it could be two.

Wait, from the feedback we only know at least one T is present. It could be more.

But ""DOTTY"" has two T's. It is a word. And D, O, T, T, Y -> let's check excluded: O we know, T we know, D and Y not excluded. But S is excluded? D and Y haven't been used.

So ""DOTTY"" uses D,O,T,Y. Positions: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But note we have two T's. When we guess ""moist"", T was at fifth and got ""wrong position"", but if the word has two T's, that's possible.

But in feedback, we don't know how many Ts. So it's okay.

But ""DOTTY"" has two Ts, which might be inefficient for gaining new information? But we are testing.

Alternatively, to get maximum information, perhaps avoid repeats? But if the word has repeated letters, it is what it is.

We want to test multiple new letters.

Compare:

- TOUGH: letters T, O, U, G, H -> O and T are known, but U, G, H are new.

- DOTTY: letters D, O, T, T, Y -> O and T known, D and Y new, but with repeated T.

We can also consider: put T at position1 and use common letters.

But TOUGH is good.

Another word: ""THOUS"" -> S is excluded? We cannot use S.

We are restricted by absent letters.

Another possibility for position1=T: ""TOUR"" is 4 letters.

""TOUKS"" - not a word.

""TOUK"" not 5.

So ""TOUGH"" seems decent.

But note: in ""moist"", the T did not work at position5, so in TOUGH, T is at position1. If the T is actually at position1, then we might get it correct. If not, then we'll know T isn't at position1 and then it must be at 3 or 4.

We could avoid the T at position1 and test it later? But we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left.

Alternatively, let's make a guess that places T in a different position to test which position it is.

For example, put T at position3: _ O T _ _

What words? ""HOOTY"" -> H,O,O,T,Y -> two O's? But second letter O is already, so we have O at second, but if we put O at second and third? We don't know if there is another O.

But ""HOOTY"" is not standard. What about ""LOFTY"" -> L,O,F,T,Y -> available letters? L, F, Y? Yes.

LOFTY: L(1),O(2),F(3),T(4),Y(5). Wait, this puts T at position4? Let me check indices: 
Pos1: L, Pos2: O, Pos3: F, Pos4: T, Pos5: Y.

But we wanted position3? So for position3, we mean third letter.

In my previous, I said position3: meaning the third letter.

So for _ O T _ _ -> positions: 1: ?, 2: O, 3: T, 4: ?, 5: ?

Word: like ""LOUTH"" not valid. ""BOUTH"" not word. ""COUTH"" C excluded. ""DOUTH"" not word.

""GOTHS"" S excluded.

""YOUTH"" -> Y,O,U,T,H -> positions: Y(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> has T at position4, not 3.

So we don't have many words with a fixed T at third position? Maybe it's rare.

Alternatively, focus on having T at position4: _ O _ T _

Words:
- ""JOUTH"" not word.
- ""WOUT"" not 5.
- ""POUTS"" S excluded.
- ""POUTH"" not standard.
- ""BOOT"" is 4.
- ""DOTTY"" as before has T at 3 and 4: positions 3 and 4.

But index: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> so it has T at 3 and 4? 

For position4=T: _ O _ T _
Examples: 
- ""GOUTY"" -> G,O,U,T,Y -> T at position4? G(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),Y(5). So ""GOUTY"" is a valid word? Actually, not commonly used. Or gouty meaning related to gout, but acceptable? Not always in word lists.

- ""DOUTS"" S excluded.

- ""BOUTS"" S excluded.

So maybe GOATY? But A is excluded.

Actually, hard. 

Therefore, perhaps the easiest is to guess:

- ""TOUGH"": T at position1, O at 2, and new letters U,G,H.

But note: we haven't tried U,G,H. It covers three new letters.

Another option: ""YOUNG"" -> Y(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> but N is excluded? Guess1 ""crane"" has N excluded -> so N cannot be used. And in ""moist"" N is absent? Not tested? No, we didn't use N. Wait, guess1 already said N is absent. So we must avoid N.

So ""YOUNG"" has N -> invalid.

Similarly, ""DOUGH"" -> D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). This uses D,U,G,H. All available. And no forbidden letters.

""DOUGH"" is a common word.

Why not? Or ""TOUGH""?

Actually ""DOUGH"" avoids placing T, but we know T is in the word. So we must include T? Because we have to account for the T? Or not?

Important: We don't have to put every known letter in every guess. However, if we don't put T, we don't get feedback on its position.

But: we have the T that we know is in the word. We should use a letter that we know is present to avoid repeating an absent letter? But that isn't necessary because we know absent letters. However, not putting T might lose information about where T is.

We have limited guesses, so to maximize information, we want to try to lock in the position of T.

Therefore, let's put T in a new position.

In first guess, T was at position5? In ""moist"", positions: M(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),T(5) -> T at 5 got ""-"", meaning present but wrong position.

So now, if we put T at position1 (as in TOUGH) or position4 (as in DOTTY), we can test.

In TOUGH: we put T at position1. If feedback:
- T position1: ✓ -> then T is at position1.
- T position1: - -> then T is present but not at position1 (so must be 3 or 4, and not 5 because we know not 5).
- T position1: x -> but we know T is in the word, so x would be impossible? But wait, the feedback symbol for a letter that is present but not at that position is ""-"", and for absent ""x"". But we know T is present, so if we put T at a position and it's wrong, we get ""-"". If we put T at a position and it is the only T, then only one ""-"" but if multiple, we might get multiple ""-"" or something. But in this case, T cannot be x because we know it's in the word.

So if we guess TOUGH and at position1 we get ""x"", that would contradict because we know T is in the word? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter, and if that exact occurrence isn't in the word? But we know there is at least one T. However, if we put T at position1 and it's not the correct position for T, we get ""-"". Only if there were no T at all we would get ""x"", but since we know there is a T, it should be impossible to get ""x"" for T.

Similarly for other positions.

Actually, for T in TOUGH, since we know T is in the word, the feedback for T will be ✓ if it happens to be at position1, or ""-"" if T is in the word but not at position1 (even if we have another T or not). Because there is at least one T.

Similarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position5 and it was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at position5.

Therefore, when we guess TOUGH with T at position1, we might get:
- ✓ for T: means position1 is T.
- - for T: means T is in the word, but not at position1. Since not position5, then it must be position3 or 4? Or could it be position2? No, position2 is O.

So feedback will help.

Similarly, for O, we know it must be ✓.

Thus, I think TOUGH is a good guess: 
- Second letter O gets ✓ (already known), 
- T at first gets feedback to tell if it's position1 or not.
- U, G, H are new letters: we can find out if any of them is in the word.

But note: the new letters U, G, H are at positions 3,4,5? Positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H.

So position5 is H.

Therefore, we'll get feedback on U, G, H.

Alternatively, guess DOUGH: D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). We then don't have T? Then we don't test T at all? So if the word has T, we must have at least ""-"" for T, but in DOUGH there is no T. So we don't use T? That's a mistake because we know T is present and we're not gaining information about its position. Also, if we guess DOUGH and get feedback, we might learn about D,U,G,H but not about T? But we know T exists, so if we don't include it, we haven't learned its position.

But we don't have to include it, but then we have to guess again for T. That might waste a guess.

Therefore, it's better to include T.

So TOUGH and DOUGH both have position2=O. But TOUGH has T and DOUGH doesn't.

Therefore, TOUGH is better because we can test T.

Another word? What about ""LOUTH"" - not common. Or ""THOLU"" not word.

So TOUGH seems okay.

But let's confirm: TOUGH --> letters: T, O, U, G, H.

We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

So I'll go with TOUGH.

Guess: tough

In the response format.

So:

<guess>tough</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback: M(✗), O(✓), I(✗), S(✗), T(➖). This reveals:
  - The second letter is **O** (correct position).
  - **T** is present but not in the fifth position (wrong position).
  - Letters M, I, and S are absent (✗).

### Key deductions:
- The secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (second letter is O).
- **T** must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in position 5 or 2, which is O).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S. Avoid using these in future guesses.
- Goal for the next guess: 
  - Test potential positions for T (positions 1, 3, or 4) to narrow down options.
  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters (not yet tested) to maximize information gain.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include O in position 2** (since it is confirmed).
- **Include T in a new position** (e.g., position 1) to test if it belongs there.
- Use **fresh, common letters** for remaining positions (e.g., U, G, H) to probe for presence.
- Valid word: `TOUGH` (T in position 1, O in position 2, U in position 3, G in position 4, H in position 5). This word:
  - Tests T at position 1 (✓ if correct, ➖ if T is elsewhere).
  - Introduces three new letters (U, G, H) across positions 3–5.
  - Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>tough</guess>",tough,"We have two guesses so far:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter of the secret word is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) -> T is in the word but not the last letter.

So, from this we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The word contains T, but not in the fifth position (since T was guessed at the fifth and got -).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We can also note: since the second letter is O, we can represent the word as: _ O _ _ _

T is in the word but not fifth position. So T must be in one of positions: 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Has O as the second letter (since it's fixed there).
- Includes T somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the end because we know it's not fifth).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We also want to test other new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Available letters: We've used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T (O and T are present, others are absent). So avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover common letters: L, P, U, D, B, G, etc.

The word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is present and not at end. So let's try to place T in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a valid English word that fits: position2=O, and contains T (but not at position5).

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T O _ _ _
- Position 3: _ O T _ _
- Position 4: _ O _ T _

We also have three other slots to fill with letters not excluded.

Let's think of words:

Option: Position 1 = T
Word: T O _ _ _
Need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S, and already O, T.

Try:
- ""TOUGH"" -> T, O, U, G, H -> U, G, H are available? Yes. But wait, we have position2=O (correct), and T at position1 (we hope). We don't know about others. But note: we haven't tried U,G,H.

But is ""TOUGH"" a word? Yes.

But note: we have T at position1. We don't know yet if T is there. We know T is in the word, but we don't know where.

Alternatively, we might avoid placing T at position1 until we confirm? But we need to guess and get feedback.

We could try a word that puts T in a different slot to test.

But note: if we put T in position1 and it's wrong, we get feedback that T is not at position1 and then we know it must be at 3 or 4.

We have limited guesses (only 4 left), so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: Since we know the second letter is O, and T is present, but we don't know where, let's form a word that uses T in a different position and introduces three new letters.

For example, let's put T in position3: _ O T _ _

Possible words: 
- ""POUTH"" - not a word? 
- ""LOUTH"" - not common.
- ""DOUTY"" - not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MOTHY"" - but M is excluded, so no.
- ""GOTHY"" - not a word.

Position4: _ O _ T _

Words:
- ""BOLT"" is 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""VOLT"" is 4.

""BOUTS"" - but S is excluded.

We need words with available letters.

List: Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can use vowel-like: U, and sometimes Y.

Try words:

Option 1: Position1=T -> T O _ _ _
Possible: 
  ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> all new letters? U, G, H.
  ""TOWEL"" - but E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.
  ""TOUCH"" - C is excluded -> invalid.
  ""TOPAZ"" - P and Z? T,O,P,A,Z -> A is excluded -> invalid.

So ""TOUGH"" is valid: no excluded letters.

Option 2: Position3=T: _ O T _ _
Possible:
  ""PORTY"" - P,O,R,T,Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
  ""FOT"" not 5 letters.

Actually, hard to find examples? Maybe focus on option1 or option4.

Another position: position4=T -> _ O _ T _
Possible:
  ""DOTTY"" -> D,O,T,T,Y -> we haven't tried D and Y. But T repeated? We don't know if T is repeated? Because T might be repeated? But we only know one T is present? But it could be two.

Wait, from the feedback we only know at least one T is present. It could be more.

But ""DOTTY"" has two T's. It is a word. And D, O, T, T, Y -> let's check excluded: O we know, T we know, D and Y not excluded. But S is excluded? D and Y haven't been used.

So ""DOTTY"" uses D,O,T,Y. Positions: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But note we have two T's. When we guess ""moist"", T was at fifth and got ""wrong position"", but if the word has two T's, that's possible.

But in feedback, we don't know how many Ts. So it's okay.

But ""DOTTY"" has two Ts, which might be inefficient for gaining new information? But we are testing.

Alternatively, to get maximum information, perhaps avoid repeats? But if the word has repeated letters, it is what it is.

We want to test multiple new letters.

Compare:

- TOUGH: letters T, O, U, G, H -> O and T are known, but U, G, H are new.

- DOTTY: letters D, O, T, T, Y -> O and T known, D and Y new, but with repeated T.

We can also consider: put T at position1 and use common letters.

But TOUGH is good.

Another word: ""THOUS"" -> S is excluded? We cannot use S.

We are restricted by absent letters.

Another possibility for position1=T: ""TOUR"" is 4 letters.

""TOUKS"" - not a word.

""TOUK"" not 5.

So ""TOUGH"" seems decent.

But note: in ""moist"", the T did not work at position5, so in TOUGH, T is at position1. If the T is actually at position1, then we might get it correct. If not, then we'll know T isn't at position1 and then it must be at 3 or 4.

We could avoid the T at position1 and test it later? But we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left.

Alternatively, let's make a guess that places T in a different position to test which position it is.

For example, put T at position3: _ O T _ _

What words? ""HOOTY"" -> H,O,O,T,Y -> two O's? But second letter O is already, so we have O at second, but if we put O at second and third? We don't know if there is another O.

But ""HOOTY"" is not standard. What about ""LOFTY"" -> L,O,F,T,Y -> available letters? L, F, Y? Yes.

LOFTY: L(1),O(2),F(3),T(4),Y(5). Wait, this puts T at position4? Let me check indices: 
Pos1: L, Pos2: O, Pos3: F, Pos4: T, Pos5: Y.

But we wanted position3? So for position3, we mean third letter.

In my previous, I said position3: meaning the third letter.

So for _ O T _ _ -> positions: 1: ?, 2: O, 3: T, 4: ?, 5: ?

Word: like ""LOUTH"" not valid. ""BOUTH"" not word. ""COUTH"" C excluded. ""DOUTH"" not word.

""GOTHS"" S excluded.

""YOUTH"" -> Y,O,U,T,H -> positions: Y(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> has T at position4, not 3.

So we don't have many words with a fixed T at third position? Maybe it's rare.

Alternatively, focus on having T at position4: _ O _ T _

Words:
- ""JOUTH"" not word.
- ""WOUT"" not 5.
- ""POUTS"" S excluded.
- ""POUTH"" not standard.
- ""BOOT"" is 4.
- ""DOTTY"" as before has T at 3 and 4: positions 3 and 4.

But index: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> so it has T at 3 and 4? 

For position4=T: _ O _ T _
Examples: 
- ""GOUTY"" -> G,O,U,T,Y -> T at position4? G(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),Y(5). So ""GOUTY"" is a valid word? Actually, not commonly used. Or gouty meaning related to gout, but acceptable? Not always in word lists.

- ""DOUTS"" S excluded.

- ""BOUTS"" S excluded.

So maybe GOATY? But A is excluded.

Actually, hard. 

Therefore, perhaps the easiest is to guess:

- ""TOUGH"": T at position1, O at 2, and new letters U,G,H.

But note: we haven't tried U,G,H. It covers three new letters.

Another option: ""YOUNG"" -> Y(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> but N is excluded? Guess1 ""crane"" has N excluded -> so N cannot be used. And in ""moist"" N is absent? Not tested? No, we didn't use N. Wait, guess1 already said N is absent. So we must avoid N.

So ""YOUNG"" has N -> invalid.

Similarly, ""DOUGH"" -> D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). This uses D,U,G,H. All available. And no forbidden letters.

""DOUGH"" is a common word.

Why not? Or ""TOUGH""?

Actually ""DOUGH"" avoids placing T, but we know T is in the word. So we must include T? Because we have to account for the T? Or not?

Important: We don't have to put every known letter in every guess. However, if we don't put T, we don't get feedback on its position.

But: we have the T that we know is in the word. We should use a letter that we know is present to avoid repeating an absent letter? But that isn't necessary because we know absent letters. However, not putting T might lose information about where T is.

We have limited guesses, so to maximize information, we want to try to lock in the position of T.

Therefore, let's put T in a new position.

In first guess, T was at position5? In ""moist"", positions: M(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),T(5) -> T at 5 got ""-"", meaning present but wrong position.

So now, if we put T at position1 (as in TOUGH) or position4 (as in DOTTY), we can test.

In TOUGH: we put T at position1. If feedback:
- T position1: ✓ -> then T is at position1.
- T position1: - -> then T is present but not at position1 (so must be 3 or 4, and not 5 because we know not 5).
- T position1: x -> but we know T is in the word, so x would be impossible? But wait, the feedback symbol for a letter that is present but not at that position is ""-"", and for absent ""x"". But we know T is present, so if we put T at a position and it's wrong, we get ""-"". If we put T at a position and it is the only T, then only one ""-"" but if multiple, we might get multiple ""-"" or something. But in this case, T cannot be x because we know it's in the word.

So if we guess TOUGH and at position1 we get ""x"", that would contradict because we know T is in the word? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter, and if that exact occurrence isn't in the word? But we know there is at least one T. However, if we put T at position1 and it's not the correct position for T, we get ""-"". Only if there were no T at all we would get ""x"", but since we know there is a T, it should be impossible to get ""x"" for T.

Similarly for other positions.

Actually, for T in TOUGH, since we know T is in the word, the feedback for T will be ✓ if it happens to be at position1, or ""-"" if T is in the word but not at position1 (even if we have another T or not). Because there is at least one T.

Similarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position5 and it was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at position5.

Therefore, when we guess TOUGH with T at position1, we might get:
- ✓ for T: means position1 is T.
- - for T: means T is in the word, but not at position1. Since not position5, then it must be position3 or 4? Or could it be position2? No, position2 is O.

So feedback will help.

Similarly, for O, we know it must be ✓.

Thus, I think TOUGH is a good guess: 
- Second letter O gets ✓ (already known), 
- T at first gets feedback to tell if it's position1 or not.
- U, G, H are new letters: we can find out if any of them is in the word.

But note: the new letters U, G, H are at positions 3,4,5? Positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H.

So position5 is H.

Therefore, we'll get feedback on U, G, H.

Alternatively, guess DOUGH: D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). We then don't have T? Then we don't test T at all? So if the word has T, we must have at least ""-"" for T, but in DOUGH there is no T. So we don't use T? That's a mistake because we know T is present and we're not gaining information about its position. Also, if we guess DOUGH and get feedback, we might learn about D,U,G,H but not about T? But we know T exists, so if we don't include it, we haven't learned its position.

But we don't have to include it, but then we have to guess again for T. That might waste a guess.

Therefore, it's better to include T.

So TOUGH and DOUGH both have position2=O. But TOUGH has T and DOUGH doesn't.

Therefore, TOUGH is better because we can test T.

Another word? What about ""LOUTH"" - not common. Or ""THOLU"" not word.

So TOUGH seems okay.

But let's confirm: TOUGH --> letters: T, O, U, G, H.

We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

So I'll go with TOUGH.

Guess: tough

In the response format.

So:

<guess>tough</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.

  - The second letter is **O** (correct position).
  - **T** is present but not in the fifth position (wrong position).
  - Letters M, I, and S are absent (✗).

### Key deductions:
- The secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (second letter is O).
- **T** must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in position 5 or 2, which is O).

 That means the secret word has none of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.
 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to gain more information.

 Let's recall common consonants and vowels. Since vowels are limited, but in this case we've ruled out A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 However, U and Y might be less common. O is a good vowel to try.

 Some good starting letters: We can try a word with O, and then common consonants like S, T, L, P, M, etc.

 Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible word: ""SPOIL"" - but contains I and O. But let's see if it has any excluded letter? No, S, P, O, I, L are none of C,R,A,N,E.

 However, we want to maximize new information. We haven't tried S, P, O, I, L.

 Alternative: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. Also clear.

 Another: ""POUND"" - but we have U and D, but N is excluded so we can't use N. So POUND has N -> invalid.

 Also, avoid using letters we already know are absent.

 Let's list available letters: We've used C,R,A,N,E. So avoid these.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to use frequent letters: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Words that fit: 
   ""SPOIL"" - letters: S, P, O, I, L.
   ""MOIST"" - letters: M, O, I, S, T. This has S, T and two vowels O, I. 
   ""LUMPS"" - L, U, M, P, S. U is less common.
   ""GHOUL"" - less common letters.

 Since we have no information, we can choose ""MOIST"" or ""SPOIL"".

 Let's choose ""MOIST"" because it includes the common T and M.

 So guess: MOIST

<guess>moist</guess>After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked 'x'), we know the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters entirely and uses fresh, high-frequency English letters to maximize information gain. 

Words like **""moist""** or **""spoil""** are strong options since they use common consonants (S, T, M, P, L) and explore new vowels (O, I). Choosing **""moist""** covers five new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all high-frequency, helping to quickly rule in/out critical components of the secret word.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses so far:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter of the secret word is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) -> T is in the word but not the last letter.

So, from this we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The word contains T, but not in the fifth position (since T was guessed at the fifth and got -).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We can also note: since the second letter is O, we can represent the word as: _ O _ _ _

T is in the word but not fifth position. So T must be in one of positions: 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Has O as the second letter (since it's fixed there).
- Includes T somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the end because we know it's not fifth).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We also want to test other new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Available letters: We've used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T (O and T are present, others are absent). So avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover common letters: L, P, U, D, B, G, etc.

The word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is present and not at end. So let's try to place T in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a valid English word that fits: position2=O, and contains T (but not at position5).

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T O _ _ _
- Position 3: _ O T _ _
- Position 4: _ O _ T _

We also have three other slots to fill with letters not excluded.

Let's think of words:

Option: Position 1 = T
Word: T O _ _ _
Need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S, and already O, T.

Try:
- ""TOUGH"" -> T, O, U, G, H -> U, G, H are available? Yes. But wait, we have position2=O (correct), and T at position1 (we hope). We don't know about others. But note: we haven't tried U,G,H.

But is ""TOUGH"" a word? Yes.

But note: we have T at position1. We don't know yet if T is there. We know T is in the word, but we don't know where.

Alternatively, we might avoid placing T at position1 until we confirm? But we need to guess and get feedback.

We could try a word that puts T in a different slot to test.

But note: if we put T in position1 and it's wrong, we get feedback that T is not at position1 and then we know it must be at 3 or 4.

We have limited guesses (only 4 left), so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: Since we know the second letter is O, and T is present, but we don't know where, let's form a word that uses T in a different position and introduces three new letters.

For example, let's put T in position3: _ O T _ _

Possible words: 
- ""POUTH"" - not a word? 
- ""LOUTH"" - not common.
- ""DOUTY"" - not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MOTHY"" - but M is excluded, so no.
- ""GOTHY"" - not a word.

Position4: _ O _ T _

Words:
- ""BOLT"" is 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""VOLT"" is 4.

""BOUTS"" - but S is excluded.

We need words with available letters.

List: Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can use vowel-like: U, and sometimes Y.

Try words:

Option 1: Position1=T -> T O _ _ _
Possible: 
  ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> all new letters? U, G, H.
  ""TOWEL"" - but E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.
  ""TOUCH"" - C is excluded -> invalid.
  ""TOPAZ"" - P and Z? T,O,P,A,Z -> A is excluded -> invalid.

So ""TOUGH"" is valid: no excluded letters.

Option 2: Position3=T: _ O T _ _
Possible:
  ""PORTY"" - P,O,R,T,Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
  ""FOT"" not 5 letters.

Actually, hard to find examples? Maybe focus on option1 or option4.

Another position: position4=T -> _ O _ T _
Possible:
  ""DOTTY"" -> D,O,T,T,Y -> we haven't tried D and Y. But T repeated? We don't know if T is repeated? Because T might be repeated? But we only know one T is present? But it could be two.

Wait, from the feedback we only know at least one T is present. It could be more.

But ""DOTTY"" has two T's. It is a word. And D, O, T, T, Y -> let's check excluded: O we know, T we know, D and Y not excluded. But S is excluded? D and Y haven't been used.

So ""DOTTY"" uses D,O,T,Y. Positions: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But note we have two T's. When we guess ""moist"", T was at fifth and got ""wrong position"", but if the word has two T's, that's possible.

But in feedback, we don't know how many Ts. So it's okay.

But ""DOTTY"" has two Ts, which might be inefficient for gaining new information? But we are testing.

Alternatively, to get maximum information, perhaps avoid repeats? But if the word has repeated letters, it is what it is.

We want to test multiple new letters.

Compare:

- TOUGH: letters T, O, U, G, H -> O and T are known, but U, G, H are new.

- DOTTY: letters D, O, T, T, Y -> O and T known, D and Y new, but with repeated T.

We can also consider: put T at position1 and use common letters.

But TOUGH is good.

Another word: ""THOUS"" -> S is excluded? We cannot use S.

We are restricted by absent letters.

Another possibility for position1=T: ""TOUR"" is 4 letters.

""TOUKS"" - not a word.

""TOUK"" not 5.

So ""TOUGH"" seems decent.

But note: in ""moist"", the T did not work at position5, so in TOUGH, T is at position1. If the T is actually at position1, then we might get it correct. If not, then we'll know T isn't at position1 and then it must be at 3 or 4.

We could avoid the T at position1 and test it later? But we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left.

Alternatively, let's make a guess that places T in a different position to test which position it is.

For example, put T at position3: _ O T _ _

What words? ""HOOTY"" -> H,O,O,T,Y -> two O's? But second letter O is already, so we have O at second, but if we put O at second and third? We don't know if there is another O.

But ""HOOTY"" is not standard. What about ""LOFTY"" -> L,O,F,T,Y -> available letters? L, F, Y? Yes.

LOFTY: L(1),O(2),F(3),T(4),Y(5). Wait, this puts T at position4? Let me check indices: 
Pos1: L, Pos2: O, Pos3: F, Pos4: T, Pos5: Y.

But we wanted position3? So for position3, we mean third letter.

In my previous, I said position3: meaning the third letter.

So for _ O T _ _ -> positions: 1: ?, 2: O, 3: T, 4: ?, 5: ?

Word: like ""LOUTH"" not valid. ""BOUTH"" not word. ""COUTH"" C excluded. ""DOUTH"" not word.

""GOTHS"" S excluded.

""YOUTH"" -> Y,O,U,T,H -> positions: Y(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> has T at position4, not 3.

So we don't have many words with a fixed T at third position? Maybe it's rare.

Alternatively, focus on having T at position4: _ O _ T _

Words:
- ""JOUTH"" not word.
- ""WOUT"" not 5.
- ""POUTS"" S excluded.
- ""POUTH"" not standard.
- ""BOOT"" is 4.
- ""DOTTY"" as before has T at 3 and 4: positions 3 and 4.

But index: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> so it has T at 3 and 4? 

For position4=T: _ O _ T _
Examples: 
- ""GOUTY"" -> G,O,U,T,Y -> T at position4? G(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),Y(5). So ""GOUTY"" is a valid word? Actually, not commonly used. Or gouty meaning related to gout, but acceptable? Not always in word lists.

- ""DOUTS"" S excluded.

- ""BOUTS"" S excluded.

So maybe GOATY? But A is excluded.

Actually, hard. 

Therefore, perhaps the easiest is to guess:

- ""TOUGH"": T at position1, O at 2, and new letters U,G,H.

But note: we haven't tried U,G,H. It covers three new letters.

Another option: ""YOUNG"" -> Y(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> but N is excluded? Guess1 ""crane"" has N excluded -> so N cannot be used. And in ""moist"" N is absent? Not tested? No, we didn't use N. Wait, guess1 already said N is absent. So we must avoid N.

So ""YOUNG"" has N -> invalid.

Similarly, ""DOUGH"" -> D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). This uses D,U,G,H. All available. And no forbidden letters.

""DOUGH"" is a common word.

Why not? Or ""TOUGH""?

Actually ""DOUGH"" avoids placing T, but we know T is in the word. So we must include T? Because we have to account for the T? Or not?

Important: We don't have to put every known letter in every guess. However, if we don't put T, we don't get feedback on its position.

But: we have the T that we know is in the word. We should use a letter that we know is present to avoid repeating an absent letter? But that isn't necessary because we know absent letters. However, not putting T might lose information about where T is.

We have limited guesses, so to maximize information, we want to try to lock in the position of T.

Therefore, let's put T in a new position.

In first guess, T was at position5? In ""moist"", positions: M(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),T(5) -> T at 5 got ""-"", meaning present but wrong position.

So now, if we put T at position1 (as in TOUGH) or position4 (as in DOTTY), we can test.

In TOUGH: we put T at position1. If feedback:
- T position1: ✓ -> then T is at position1.
- T position1: - -> then T is present but not at position1 (so must be 3 or 4, and not 5 because we know not 5).
- T position1: x -> but we know T is in the word, so x would be impossible? But wait, the feedback symbol for a letter that is present but not at that position is ""-"", and for absent ""x"". But we know T is present, so if we put T at a position and it's wrong, we get ""-"". If we put T at a position and it is the only T, then only one ""-"" but if multiple, we might get multiple ""-"" or something. But in this case, T cannot be x because we know it's in the word.

So if we guess TOUGH and at position1 we get ""x"", that would contradict because we know T is in the word? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter, and if that exact occurrence isn't in the word? But we know there is at least one T. However, if we put T at position1 and it's not the correct position for T, we get ""-"". Only if there were no T at all we would get ""x"", but since we know there is a T, it should be impossible to get ""x"" for T.

Similarly for other positions.

Actually, for T in TOUGH, since we know T is in the word, the feedback for T will be ✓ if it happens to be at position1, or ""-"" if T is in the word but not at position1 (even if we have another T or not). Because there is at least one T.

Similarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position5 and it was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at position5.

Therefore, when we guess TOUGH with T at position1, we might get:
- ✓ for T: means position1 is T.
- - for T: means T is in the word, but not at position1. Since not position5, then it must be position3 or 4? Or could it be position2? No, position2 is O.

So feedback will help.

Similarly, for O, we know it must be ✓.

Thus, I think TOUGH is a good guess: 
- Second letter O gets ✓ (already known), 
- T at first gets feedback to tell if it's position1 or not.
- U, G, H are new letters: we can find out if any of them is in the word.

But note: the new letters U, G, H are at positions 3,4,5? Positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H.

So position5 is H.

Therefore, we'll get feedback on U, G, H.

Alternatively, guess DOUGH: D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). We then don't have T? Then we don't test T at all? So if the word has T, we must have at least ""-"" for T, but in DOUGH there is no T. So we don't use T? That's a mistake because we know T is present and we're not gaining information about its position. Also, if we guess DOUGH and get feedback, we might learn about D,U,G,H but not about T? But we know T exists, so if we don't include it, we haven't learned its position.

But we don't have to include it, but then we have to guess again for T. That might waste a guess.

Therefore, it's better to include T.

So TOUGH and DOUGH both have position2=O. But TOUGH has T and DOUGH doesn't.

Therefore, TOUGH is better because we can test T.

Another word? What about ""LOUTH"" - not common. Or ""THOLU"" not word.

So TOUGH seems okay.

But let's confirm: TOUGH --> letters: T, O, U, G, H.

We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

So I'll go with TOUGH.

Guess: tough

In the response format.

So:

<guess>tough</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback: M(✗), O(✓), I(✗), S(✗), T(➖). This reveals:
  - The second letter is **O** (correct position).
  - **T** is present but not in the fifth position (wrong position).
  - Letters M, I, and S are absent (✗).

### Key deductions:
- The secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (second letter is O).
- **T** must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in position 5 or 2, which is O).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S. Avoid using these in future guesses.
- Goal for the next guess: 
  - Test potential positions for T (positions 1, 3, or 4) to narrow down options.
  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters (not yet tested) to maximize information gain.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include O in position 2** (since it is confirmed).
- **Include T in a new position** (e.g., position 1) to test if it belongs there.
- Use **fresh, common letters** for remaining positions (e.g., U, G, H) to probe for presence.
- Valid word: `TOUGH` (T in position 1, O in position 2, U in position 3, G in position 4, H in position 5). This word:
  - Tests T at position 1 (✓ if correct, ➖ if T is elsewhere).
  - Introduces three new letters (U, G, H) across positions 3–5.
  - Avoids all absent letters.

But we need to guess and get feedback.\n\nWe could try a word that puts T in a different slot to test.\n\nBut note: if we put T in position1 and it\'s wrong, we get feedback that T is not at position1 and then we know it must be at 3 or 4.\n\nWe have limited guesses (only 4 left), so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Since we know the second letter is O, and T is present, but we don\'t know where, let\'s form a word that uses T in a different position and introduces three new letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s put T in position3: _ O T _ _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""POUTH"" - not a word? \n- ""LOUTH"" - not common.\n- ""DOUTY"" - not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MOTHY"" - but M is excluded, so no.\n- ""GOTHY"" - not a word.\n\nPosition4: _ O _ T _\n\nWords:\n- ""BOLT"" is 4 letters, we need 5.\n- ""VOLT"" is 4.\n\n""BOUTS"" - but S is excluded.\n\nWe need words with available letters.\n\nList: Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe can use vowel-like: U, and sometimes Y.\n\nTry words:\n\nOption 1: Position1=T -> T O _ _ _\nPossible: \n  ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> all new letters? U, G, H.\n  ""TOWEL"" - but E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.\n  ""TOUCH"" - C is excluded -> invalid.\n  ""TOPAZ"" - P and Z? T,O,P,A,Z -> A is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo ""TOUGH"" is valid: no excluded letters.\n\nOption 2: Position3=T: _ O T _ _\nPossible:\n  ""PORTY"" - P,O,R,T,Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.\n  ""FOT"" not 5 letters.\n\nActually, hard to find examples? Maybe focus on option1 or option4.\n\nAnother position: position4=T -> _ O _ T _\nPossible:\n  ""DOTTY"" -> D,O,T,T,Y -> we haven\'t tried D and Y. But T repeated? We don\'t know if T is repeated? Because T might be repeated? But we only know one T is present? But it could be two.\n\nWait, from the feedback we only know at least one T is present. It could be more.\n\nBut ""DOTTY"" has two T\'s. It is a word. And D, O, T, T, Y -> let\'s check excluded: O we know, T we know, D and Y not excluded. But S is excluded? D and Y haven\'t been used.\n\nSo ""DOTTY"" uses D,O,T,Y. Positions: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But note we have two T\'s. When we guess ""moist"", T was at fifth and got ""wrong position"", but if the word has two T\'s, that\'s possible.\n\nBut in feedback, we don\'t know how many Ts. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""DOTTY"" has two Ts, which might be inefficient for gaining new information? But we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, to get maximum information, perhaps avoid repeats? But if the word has repeated letters, it is what it is.\n\nWe want to test multiple new letters.\n\nCompare:\n\n- TOUGH: letters T, O, U, G, H -> O and T are known, but U, G, H are new.\n\n- DOTTY: letters D, O, T, T, Y -> O and T known, D and Y new, but with repeated T.\n\nWe can also consider: put T at position1 and use common letters.\n\nBut TOUGH is good.\n\nAnother word: ""THOUS"" -> S is excluded? We cannot use S.\n\nWe are restricted by absent letters.\n\nAnother possibility for position1=T: ""TOUR"" is 4 letters.\n\n""TOUKS"" - not a word.\n\n""TOUK"" not 5.\n\nSo ""TOUGH"" seems decent.\n\nBut note: in ""moist"", the T did not work at position5, so in TOUGH, T is at position1. If the T is actually at position1, then we might get it correct. If not, then we\'ll know T isn\'t at position1 and then it must be at 3 or 4.\n\nWe could avoid the T at position1 and test it later? But we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s make a guess that places T in a different position to test which position it is.\n\nFor example, put T at position3: _ O T _ _\n\nWhat words? ""HOOTY"" -> H,O,O,T,Y -> two O\'s? But second letter O is already, so we have O at second, but if we put O at second and third? We don\'t know if there is another O.\n\nBut ""HOOTY"" is not standard. What about ""LOFTY"" -> L,O,F,T,Y -> available letters? L, F, Y? Yes.\n\nLOFTY: L(1),O(2),F(3),T(4),Y(5). Wait, this puts T at position4? Let me check indices: \nPos1: L, Pos2: O, Pos3: F, Pos4: T, Pos5: Y.\n\nBut we wanted position3? So for position3, we mean third letter.\n\nIn my previous, I said position3: meaning the third letter.\n\nSo for _ O T _ _ -> positions: 1: ?, 2: O, 3: T, 4: ?, 5: ?\n\nWord: like ""LOUTH"" not valid. ""BOUTH"" not word. ""COUTH"" C excluded. ""DOUTH"" not word.\n\n""GOTHS"" S excluded.\n\n""YOUTH"" -> Y,O,U,T,H -> positions: Y(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> has T at position4, not 3.\n\nSo we don\'t have many words with a fixed T at third position? Maybe it\'s rare.\n\nAlternatively, focus on having T at position4: _ O _ T _\n\nWords:\n- ""JOUTH"" not word.\n- ""WOUT"" not 5.\n- ""POUTS"" S excluded.\n- ""POUTH"" not standard.\n- ""BOOT"" is 4.\n- ""DOTTY"" as before has T at 3 and 4: positions 3 and 4.\n\nBut index: D(1), O(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> so it has T at 3 and 4? \n\nFor position4=T: _ O _ T _\nExamples: \n- ""GOUTY"" -> G,O,U,T,Y -> T at position4? G(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),Y(5). So ""GOUTY"" is a valid word? Actually, not commonly used. Or gouty meaning related to gout, but acceptable? Not always in word lists.\n\n- ""DOUTS"" S excluded.\n\n- ""BOUTS"" S excluded.\n\nSo maybe GOATY? But A is excluded.\n\nActually, hard. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the easiest is to guess:\n\n- ""TOUGH"": T at position1, O at 2, and new letters U,G,H.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tried U,G,H. It covers three new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""YOUNG"" -> Y(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> but N is excluded? Guess1 ""crane"" has N excluded -> so N cannot be used. And in ""moist"" N is absent? Not tested? No, we didn\'t use N. Wait, guess1 already said N is absent. So we must avoid N.\n\nSo ""YOUNG"" has N -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOUGH"" -> D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). This uses D,U,G,H. All available. And no forbidden letters.\n\n""DOUGH"" is a common word.\n\nWhy not? Or ""TOUGH""?\n\nActually ""DOUGH"" avoids placing T, but we know T is in the word. So we must include T? Because we have to account for the T? Or not?\n\nImportant: We don\'t have to put every known letter in every guess. However, if we don\'t put T, we don\'t get feedback on its position.\n\nBut: we have the T that we know is in the word. We should use a letter that we know is present to avoid repeating an absent letter? But that isn\'t necessary because we know absent letters. However, not putting T might lose information about where T is.\n\nWe have limited guesses, so to maximize information, we want to try to lock in the position of T.\n\nTherefore, let\'s put T in a new position.\n\nIn first guess, T was at position5? In ""moist"", positions: M(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),T(5) -> T at 5 got ""-"", meaning present but wrong position.\n\nSo now, if we put T at position1 (as in TOUGH) or position4 (as in DOTTY), we can test.\n\nIn TOUGH: we put T at position1. If feedback:\n- T position1: ✓ -> then T is at position1.\n- T position1: - -> then T is present but not at position1 (so must be 3 or 4, and not 5 because we know not 5).\n- T position1: x -> but we know T is in the word, so x would be impossible? But wait, the feedback symbol for a letter that is present but not at that position is ""-"", and for absent ""x"". But we know T is present, so if we put T at a position and it\'s wrong, we get ""-"". If we put T at a position and it is the only T, then only one ""-"" but if multiple, we might get multiple ""-"" or something. But in this case, T cannot be x because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo if we guess TOUGH and at position1 we get ""x"", that would contradict because we know T is in the word? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter, and if that exact occurrence isn\'t in the word? But we know there is at least one T. However, if we put T at position1 and it\'s not the correct position for T, we get ""-"". Only if there were no T at all we would get ""x"", but since we know there is a T, it should be impossible to get ""x"" for T.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nActually, for T in TOUGH, since we know T is in the word, the feedback for T will be ✓ if it happens to be at position1, or ""-"" if T is in the word but not at position1 (even if we have another T or not). Because there is at least one T.\n\nSimilarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position5 and it was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at position5.\n\nTherefore, when we guess TOUGH with T at position1, we might get:\n- ✓ for T: means position1 is T.\n- - for T: means T is in the word, but not at position1. Since not position5, then it must be position3 or 4? Or could it be position2? No, position2 is O.\n\nSo feedback will help.\n\nSimilarly, for O, we know it must be ✓.\n\nThus, I think TOUGH is a good guess: \n- Second letter O gets ✓ (already known), \n- T at first gets feedback to tell if it\'s position1 or not.\n- U, G, H are new letters: we can find out if any of them is in the word.\n\nBut note: the new letters U, G, H are at positions 3,4,5? Positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H.\n\nSo position5 is H.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll get feedback on U, G, H.\n\nAlternatively, guess DOUGH: D(1),O(2),U(3),G(4),H(5). We then don\'t have T? Then we don\'t test T at all? So if the word has T, we must have at least ""-"" for T, but in DOUGH there is no T. So we don\'t use T? That\'s a mistake because we know T is present and we\'re not gaining information about its position. Also, if we guess DOUGH and get feedback, we might learn about D,U,G,H but not about T? But we know T exists, so if we don\'t include it, we haven\'t learned its position.\n\nBut we don\'t have to include it, but then we have to guess again for T. That might waste a guess.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to include T.\n\nSo TOUGH and DOUGH both have position2=O. But TOUGH has T and DOUGH doesn\'t.\n\nTherefore, TOUGH is better because we can test T.\n\nAnother word? What about ""LOUTH"" - not common. Or ""THOLU"" not word.\n\nSo TOUGH seems okay.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: TOUGH --> letters: T, O, U, G, H.\n\nWe avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nSo I\'ll go with TOUGH.\n\nGuess: tough\n\nIn the response format.\n\nSo:\n\n<guess>tough</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback: M(✗), O(✓), I(✗), S(✗), T(➖). This reveals:\n  - The second letter is **O** (correct position).\n  - **T** is present but not in the fifth position (wrong position).\n  - Letters M, I, and S are absent (✗).\n\n### Key deductions:\n- The secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (second letter is O).\n- **T** must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can\'t be in position 5 or 2, which is O).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S. Avoid using these in future guesses.\n- Goal for the next guess: \n  - Test potential positions for T (positions 1, 3, or 4) to narrow down options.\n  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters (not yet tested) to maximize information gain.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include O in position 2** (since it is confirmed).\n- **Include T in a new position** (e.g., position 1) to test if it belongs there.\n- Use **fresh, common letters** for remaining positions (e.g., U, G, H) to probe for presence.\n- Valid word: `TOUGH` (T in position 1, O in position 2, U in position 3, G in position 4, H in position 5). This word:\n  - Tests T at position 1 (✓ if correct, ➖ if T is elsewhere).\n  - Introduces three new letters (U, G, H) across positions 3–5.\n  - Avoids all absent letters.\n\n<guess>tough</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(✓) G(x) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""moist"" -> 
  M(x) -> absent
  O(✓) -> correct position (so second letter is O)
  I(x) -> absent
  S(x) -> absent
  T(-) -> present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 3: ""tough"" ->
  T(-) -> present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 1, and we already know not at position 5 from guess 2)
  O(✓) -> correct position (second letter, as before)
  U(✓) -> correct position (so the third letter is U)
  G(x) -> absent
  H(x) -> absent

So now we know:
- The word has the second letter O and the third letter U. So the pattern is: _ O U _ _
- T is in the word, but not at position 1, not at position 5 (from guess 2), and not at position 3 (because position 3 is U, which is correct and fixed). Therefore, T must be at position 4. Because the only positions left are 1 and 4, but position 1 was tested in ""tough"" and got ""-"", meaning T is not at position 1. So T must be at position 4.

Wait, let me confirm: positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: U (fixed)
- T is present, but:
  - Not at 1 (from ""tough"" feedback: T at position 1 got ""-"")
  - Not at 5 (from ""moist"" feedback: T at position 5 got ""-"")
  - Not at 3 (because position 3 is U, and we have U(✓) so it's fixed and T can't be there)
  - Therefore, the only position left for T is 4.

So T must be at position 4.

Thus, the word is: _ O U T _

Now, we only need to find the first and last letters.

We also know the absent letters: from guess1: C, R, A, N, E; from guess2: M, I, S; from guess3: G, H.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, G, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form _ O U T _ with the first and last letters from the available set.

Now, the last letter is the fifth position.

We can list possible words:

Common words: 
- ABOUT? But A is absent -> invalid.
- FLOUT? F, L, O, U, T -> but O and U are at positions 2 and 3? FLOUT: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), T(5) -> but we need O at 2 and U at 3, so not matching pattern.

Our pattern is: position1: ?, position2: O, position3: U, position4: T, position5: ?

So the word must be: ? O U T ?

Possible words:
- DOUT: not 5 letters.
- ROUT: not 5.
- POUT: not 5.

5-letter words ending with T? But we have T at position4, so the last letter is position5.

So we need words like: ?OUT?

Examples:
- DOUTY: not common, and Y is available? But let's see.
- GOUTY: G is absent -> invalid.
- POUTY: P is available, but POUTY is a word? Meaning sulky. But let's check: P(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), Y(5). Yes, that fits.
- TOUTS: T(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5) -> but S is absent, and also T at position1? But we know T is not at position1? And S is absent. So invalid.
- BOUTS: B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5) -> S absent, invalid.
- LOUTS: L(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5) -> S absent, invalid.
- ROUTS: R absent, S absent, invalid.
- FOUTH: not common? F(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> H is absent? From guess3, H is absent. So invalid.
- JOUST: J(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), T(5) -> but we need T at position4, not at 5. And S is absent. Invalid.
- MOUTH: M absent, H absent, invalid.
- YOUTH: Y(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> H absent, invalid.
- DOUGH: already guessed? But we have G absent and H absent, and also it doesn't have T at position4.

Another word: ""POUTY"" as above.

Also, ""BOUTY"" not a word.

""VOUTY"" not a word.

""WOUT"" not 5.

""POULT"" -> P(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> but we need T at position4, not at 5. And L at position4? But we need T at position4. So pattern is ?OUT? meaning position4 is T, so the word ends with T? No, position4 is T, position5 is something.

In ""POULT"", it's P,O,U,L,T -> so position4 is L, position5 is T. But we need position4 to be T and position5 to be something else.

So that doesn't fit.

Another: ""DOUTS"" -> D(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),S(5) -> S absent, invalid.

""DOUTY"" might be accepted? D(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),Y(5). D and Y are available.

But is ""DOUTY"" a word? I think it might be a surname or not common. In Wordle, they use common words.

""POUTY"" is more common.

But let's see if there are others.

""LOUTY"" not common.

""BOUTY"" not word.

""FOUTY"" not word.

""JOUTY"" not word.

""KOUTY"" not word.

""VOUTY"" not word.

""WOUTY"" not word.

""YOUTH"" we considered, but H absent.

Another possibility: ""POUT"" is 4 letters, so not.

What about ""COUTH""? But C is absent.

""DOUTH"" is a Scottish word? But D(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> H absent, invalid.

So the only common word I can think of is ""POUTY"".

But let's confirm: POUTY is an adjective meaning sulky or pouty. It is in the dictionary.

Also, we have P and Y available.

Therefore, we can guess ""POUTY"".

But note: we have to make sure we haven't used any absent letters.

Absent: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,G,H.

P and Y are not in that list.

So ""POUTY"" should be valid.

We could also consider ""JOUGS"" but S absent and not pattern.

Another word: ""BOUTS"" but S absent.

I think ""POUTY"" is the best bet.

But let's see if there is a word with other letters.

For example, ""DOUMA"" but A absent.

""DOUCE"" E absent.

""DOUMS"" not word.

So I think ""POUTY"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""POUTY"".

But note: we have only one missing letter? We need to confirm the first and last. In ""POUTY"", first is P, last is Y.

But we don't know if they are correct. We might need to guess.

Since we have the pattern _OUT_ and we know T is at position4, and we have two letters to find.

But with the available letters, ""POUTY"" seems the only common word.

We could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only two positions: position1 and position5.

And we have limited letters.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? But we might solve it.

Since we are confident, we can guess ""POUTY"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""POUTY"":
- P at position1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, we get x or -? But we don't know if P is in the word or not.
- Similarly for Y at position5.

But if we get all correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But given the pattern, it's likely ""POUTY"".

Another word: ""DOUTY"" if we want to test D and Y, but ""DOUTY"" is less common.

""POUTY"" is better.

So I'll go with ""POUTY"".

<guess>pouty</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (moist)**:
     - M(✗): Absent.
     - O(✓): Correct position (so the second letter is **O**).
     - I(✗): Absent.
     - S(✗): Absent.
     - T(➖): Present but wrong position (so **T** is in the word, but not at position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (tough)**:
     - T(➖): Present but wrong position (so **T** is not at position 1, and we know from Guess 2 it's not at position 5).
     - O(✓): Correct position (confirms second letter is **O**).
     - U(✓): Correct position (so the third letter is **U**).
     - G(✗): Absent.
     - H(✗): Absent.

2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word format is `_ O U _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed as **O** and **U**).
   - **T** must be in position 4:
     - It cannot be in position 1 (from ""tough"" feedback: T➖ at position 1).
     - It cannot be in position 2 or 3 (occupied by O and U).
     - It cannot be in position 5 (from ""moist"" feedback: T➖ at position 5).
     - Thus, **T** must be in position 4.
   - The word is now `_ O U T _` (only positions 1 and 5 are unknown).
   - **Absent letters** (must be avoided): C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, G, H.
   - **Available letters** for positions 1 and 5: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - The word must match the pattern `_ O U T _` and use only available letters.
   - Common English words fitting this pattern:
     - **POUTY**: P (position 1), O (2), U (3), T (4), Y (5). This is a valid word (meaning ""sulky"" or ""pouting"").
     - Other possibilities like ""DOUTY"" (less common) or ""YOUTH"" (H is absent) are invalid. ""POUTY"" is the most common valid option.

4. **Why Guess ""POUTY""?**:
   - It tests the only unknown positions (1 and 5) with high-frequency letters (P and Y).
   - If correct, it solves the word. If not, feedback on P and Y will narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if P is absent, try D or B; if Y is absent, try other vowels/consonants).
   - It avoids all absent letters and fits the deduced pattern.

<guess>pouty</guess>",pouty,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""moist"" -> 
  M(x) -> absent
  O(✓) -> correct position (so second letter is O)
  I(x) -> absent
  S(x) -> absent
  T(-) -> present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 3: ""tough"" ->
  T(-) -> present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 1, and we already know not at position 5 from guess 2)
  O(✓) -> correct position (second letter, as before)
  U(✓) -> correct position (so the third letter is U)
  G(x) -> absent
  H(x) -> absent

So now we know:
- The word has the second letter O and the third letter U. So the pattern is: _ O U _ _
- T is in the word, but not at position 1, not at position 5 (from guess 2), and not at position 3 (because position 3 is U, which is correct and fixed). Therefore, T must be at position 4. Because the only positions left are 1 and 4, but position 1 was tested in ""tough"" and got ""-"", meaning T is not at position 1. So T must be at position 4.

Wait, let me confirm: positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: U (fixed)
- T is present, but:
  - Not at 1 (from ""tough"" feedback: T at position 1 got ""-"")
  - Not at 5 (from ""moist"" feedback: T at position 5 got ""-"")
  - Not at 3 (because position 3 is U, and we have U(✓) so it's fixed and T can't be there)
  - Therefore, the only position left for T is 4.

So T must be at position 4.

Thus, the word is: _ O U T _

Now, we only need to find the first and last letters.

We also know the absent letters: from guess1: C, R, A, N, E; from guess2: M, I, S; from guess3: G, H.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, G, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form _ O U T _ with the first and last letters from the available set.

Now, the last letter is the fifth position.

We can list possible words:

Common words: 
- ABOUT? But A is absent -> invalid.
- FLOUT? F, L, O, U, T -> but O and U are at positions 2 and 3? FLOUT: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), T(5) -> but we need O at 2 and U at 3, so not matching pattern.

Our pattern is: position1: ?, position2: O, position3: U, position4: T, position5: ?

So the word must be: ? O U T ?

Possible words:
- DOUT: not 5 letters.
- ROUT: not 5.
- POUT: not 5.

5-letter words ending with T? But we have T at position4, so the last letter is position5.

So we need words like: ?OUT?

Examples:
- DOUTY: not common, and Y is available? But let's see.
- GOUTY: G is absent -> invalid.
- POUTY: P is available, but POUTY is a word? Meaning sulky. But let's check: P(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), Y(5). Yes, that fits.
- TOUTS: T(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5) -> but S is absent, and also T at position1? But we know T is not at position1? And S is absent. So invalid.
- BOUTS: B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5) -> S absent, invalid.
- LOUTS: L(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5) -> S absent, invalid.
- ROUTS: R absent, S absent, invalid.
- FOUTH: not common? F(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> H is absent? From guess3, H is absent. So invalid.
- JOUST: J(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), T(5) -> but we need T at position4, not at 5. And S is absent. Invalid.
- MOUTH: M absent, H absent, invalid.
- YOUTH: Y(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> H absent, invalid.
- DOUGH: already guessed? But we have G absent and H absent, and also it doesn't have T at position4.

Another word: ""POUTY"" as above.

Also, ""BOUTY"" not a word.

""VOUTY"" not a word.

""WOUT"" not 5.

""POULT"" -> P(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> but we need T at position4, not at 5. And L at position4? But we need T at position4. So pattern is ?OUT? meaning position4 is T, so the word ends with T? No, position4 is T, position5 is something.

In ""POULT"", it's P,O,U,L,T -> so position4 is L, position5 is T. But we need position4 to be T and position5 to be something else.

So that doesn't fit.

Another: ""DOUTS"" -> D(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),S(5) -> S absent, invalid.

""DOUTY"" might be accepted? D(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),Y(5). D and Y are available.

But is ""DOUTY"" a word? I think it might be a surname or not common. In Wordle, they use common words.

""POUTY"" is more common.

But let's see if there are others.

""LOUTY"" not common.

""BOUTY"" not word.

""FOUTY"" not word.

""JOUTY"" not word.

""KOUTY"" not word.

""VOUTY"" not word.

""WOUTY"" not word.

""YOUTH"" we considered, but H absent.

Another possibility: ""POUT"" is 4 letters, so not.

What about ""COUTH""? But C is absent.

""DOUTH"" is a Scottish word? But D(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> H absent, invalid.

So the only common word I can think of is ""POUTY"".

But let's confirm: POUTY is an adjective meaning sulky or pouty. It is in the dictionary.

Also, we have P and Y available.

Therefore, we can guess ""POUTY"".

But note: we have to make sure we haven't used any absent letters.

Absent: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,G,H.

P and Y are not in that list.

So ""POUTY"" should be valid.

We could also consider ""JOUGS"" but S absent and not pattern.

Another word: ""BOUTS"" but S absent.

I think ""POUTY"" is the best bet.

But let's see if there is a word with other letters.

For example, ""DOUMA"" but A absent.

""DOUCE"" E absent.

""DOUMS"" not word.

So I think ""POUTY"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""POUTY"".

But note: we have only one missing letter? We need to confirm the first and last. In ""POUTY"", first is P, last is Y.

But we don't know if they are correct. We might need to guess.

Since we have the pattern _OUT_ and we know T is at position4, and we have two letters to find.

But with the available letters, ""POUTY"" seems the only common word.

We could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only two positions: position1 and position5.

And we have limited letters.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? But we might solve it.

Since we are confident, we can guess ""POUTY"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""POUTY"":
- P at position1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, we get x or -? But we don't know if P is in the word or not.
- Similarly for Y at position5.

But if we get all correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But given the pattern, it's likely ""POUTY"".

Another word: ""DOUTY"" if we want to test D and Y, but ""DOUTY"" is less common.

""POUTY"" is better.

So I'll go with ""POUTY"".

<guess>pouty</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (moist)**:
     - M(✗): Absent.
     - O(✓): Correct position (so the second letter is **O**).
     - I(✗): Absent.
     - S(✗): Absent.
     - T(➖): Present but wrong position (so **T** is in the word, but not at position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (tough)**:
     - T(➖): Present but wrong position (so **T** is not at position 1, and we know from Guess 2 it's not at position 5).
     - O(✓): Correct position (confirms second letter is **O**).
     - U(✓): Correct position (so the third letter is **U**).
     - G(✗): Absent.
     - H(✗): Absent.

2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word format is `_ O U _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed as **O** and **U**).
   - **T** must be in position 4:
     - It cannot be in position 1 (from ""tough"" feedback: T➖ at position 1).
     - It cannot be in position 2 or 3 (occupied by O and U).
     - It cannot be in position 5 (from ""moist"" feedback: T➖ at position 5).
     - Thus, **T** must be in position 4.
   - The word is now `_ O U T _` (only positions 1 and 5 are unknown).
   - **Absent letters** (must be avoided): C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, G, H.
   - **Available letters** for positions 1 and 5: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - The word must match the pattern `_ O U T _` and use only available letters.
   - Common English words fitting this pattern:
     - **POUTY**: P (position 1), O (2), U (3), T (4), Y (5). This is a valid word (meaning ""sulky"" or ""pouting"").
     - Other possibilities like ""DOUTY"" (less common) or ""YOUTH"" (H is absent) are invalid. ""POUTY"" is the most common valid option.

4. **Why Guess ""POUTY""?**:
   - It tests the only unknown positions (1 and 5) with high-frequency letters (P and Y).
   - If correct, it solves the word. If not, feedback on P and Y will narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if P is absent, try D or B; if Y is absent, try other vowels/consonants).
   - It avoids all absent letters and fits the deduced pattern.",Guess 4: pouty -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) U(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
