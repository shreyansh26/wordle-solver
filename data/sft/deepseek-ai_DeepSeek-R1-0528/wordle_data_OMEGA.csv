We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We need to choose a word that gives us as much information as possible. A good starting word often has common letters and distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.

 Some people use words like ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have common letters and no repeated letters.
 However, note that repeated letters are allowed in the word but in our feedback we must consider the frequency.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose: SALET (which is a valid English word and is often used in word games) but note that Wordle words are typically common.
 Alternatively, I can use ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose a word that is known to be effective: ""CRANE"".

 But note, the instruction says ""5-letter English word"" and it must be valid.

 Another popular word is ""IRATE"" or ""RAISE"". I think ""RAISE"" is a good option because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's pick one that has been proven statistically: ""CRATE"" might be even better because C is also common.

 Actually, let's choose ""ROATE"". Is it a valid word? It is a financial term. But if the system requires common words, then I might choose ""TRACE"".

 Since we don't know the dictionary, we'll pick a common word.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"".

 Guess: RAISE

 Let me check the letters: R, A, I, S, E -> all distinct.

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: We are making the first guess. So the feedback will come after.

 Therefore, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".

 Now, return the guess in the required format.

I'm starting a new game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to cover more possibilities.

- It includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S), covering frequent English letters.
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback on each position.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Also, note that A was in position 2 of ""raise"" (if we number positions 1 to 5). Since it's marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are absent)
- Contains A and E (since they are present)
- And we should try to place A and E in positions that are not 2 and 5 respectively, but also in positions we haven't tried.

Moreover, we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and three unknown letters. We should try to cover other common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: R, I, S.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that have A and E, and don't have R, I, S.

We also have three positions to figure out. We should try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also avoid repeating the positions we know are wrong for A and E.

For the second guess, we can try to put A in a different position and E in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (since it can't be 2, and we haven't tried others)
Similarly, for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (can't be 5)

But note: we don't know the exact positions, so we can try one possibility.

Also, we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of repetition. However, we cannot rule it out.

But since we are early, let's assume no repetition for now.

Let me list some candidate words that contain A and E, and avoid R, I, S.

For example:
- ""LATEN"" - but is it a word? Not common. Maybe ""LATTE"" but has double T and no E? Wait, ""LATTE"" doesn't have E.

Better to use common words.

Consider: ""PLATE"" -> contains P, L, A, T, E. 
- A is in position 3, E in position 5. But note: in the feedback, E was in position 5 and was wrong, so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, if we put E in position 5 again, it would be a waste? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal because we already know E is not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PLATE"":
- A is in position 3 (which is new) and E is in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So if we use ""PLATE"", we are putting E in a position we know it doesn't belong. That might not be efficient because we already know E isn't at position 5, so we won't get new information about E's position.

We should try to put E in a position we haven't tested: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly for A: avoid position 2, so try 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""LEACH"" - but has H and C. Also, A is in position 3, E in position 2.

But we don't know if H or C are in the word.

Alternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but has O, C, N. Also, A is in position 4 and E in position 3. But note: we have excluded R, I, S, but O, C, N are new.

But ""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we might want to test more consonants.

Another common word: ""ALERT"" - but has R which is excluded. So invalid.

""LATER"": has R? Yes, R is excluded. So no.

""TALON"": no E.

We need a word with A and E.

Let me think: words with A and E, no R, I, S.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. 
  - A is in position 3, E in position 5. But again, E is in position 5 which we know is wrong.

- ""LEANT"": has L, E, A, N, T. 
  - E in position 2, A in position 3. 
  - Positions: 1: L, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: T.
  - This avoids position 5 for E and position 2 for A? 
    - A was in position 2 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is new. 
    - E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put E in position 2, which is new.

So ""LEANT"" seems good.

But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of ""leaned"" or ""learnt"", but accepted as a word.

Another option: ""LEAPT"" - similar: L, E, A, P, T. E in 2, A in 3.

Or ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T. E in 2, A in 3.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don't know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.

Similarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.

We also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.

In ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.

Both are good.

Another word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.

We should avoid E at 5.

So ""ADOBE"" is not good.

""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.

So let's stick with words that have E not in position 5.

Another candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.

""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.

""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.

So without S, R, I.

""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.

""LEACH"" is a word.

But H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.

But Y is at the end, which might be common.

Another: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.

But W is not very common.

I think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. 
- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven't tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).
- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).
- New letters: D, L, T.

Also, D, L, T are common consonants.

So I'll go with ""DEALT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.

So let's choose ""DEALT"".

We can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.

""LEANT"" is also good.

But ""DEALT"" seems more common.

Another word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".

Now, we return the guess in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).
- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).
- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).
- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:
  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).
  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.

The word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).
- Excludes R, I, S.
- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.
- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.

<guess>dealt</guess>",dealt,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Also, note that A was in position 2 of ""raise"" (if we number positions 1 to 5). Since it's marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don't know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.

Similarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.

We also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.

In ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.

Both are good.

Another word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.

We should avoid E at 5.

So ""ADOBE"" is not good.

""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.

So let's stick with words that have E not in position 5.

Another candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.

""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.

""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.

So without S, R, I.

""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.

""LEACH"" is a word.

But H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.

But Y is at the end, which might be common.

Another: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.

But W is not very common.

I think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. 
- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven't tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).
- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).
- New letters: D, L, T.

Also, D, L, T are common consonants.

So I'll go with ""DEALT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.

So let's choose ""DEALT"".

We can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.

""LEANT"" is also good.

But ""DEALT"" seems more common.

Another word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".

Now, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).
- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).
- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).
- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:
  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).
  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.

The word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).
- Excludes R, I, S.
- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.
- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.",Guess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We need to choose a word that gives us as much information as possible. A good starting word often has common letters and distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.

 Some people use words like ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have common letters and no repeated letters.
 However, note that repeated letters are allowed in the word but in our feedback we must consider the frequency.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose: SALET (which is a valid English word and is often used in word games) but note that Wordle words are typically common.
 Alternatively, I can use ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose a word that is known to be effective: ""CRANE"".

 But note, the instruction says ""5-letter English word"" and it must be valid.

 Another popular word is ""IRATE"" or ""RAISE"". I think ""RAISE"" is a good option because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's pick one that has been proven statistically: ""CRATE"" might be even better because C is also common.

 Actually, let's choose ""ROATE"". Is it a valid word? It is a financial term. But if the system requires common words, then I might choose ""TRACE"".

 Since we don't know the dictionary, we'll pick a common word.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"".

 Guess: RAISE

 Let me check the letters: R, A, I, S, E -> all distinct.

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: We are making the first guess. So the feedback will come after.

 Therefore, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".

 Now, return the guess in the required format.I'm starting a new game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to cover more possibilities. 

After considering options like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE,"" I'm selecting ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S), covering frequent English letters.
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback on each position.
- It ranks high in statistical effectiveness according to Wordle-solving datasets.

This guess will help identify included letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Also, note that A was in position 2 of ""raise"" (if we number positions 1 to 5). Since it's marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are absent)
- Contains A and E (since they are present)
- And we should try to place A and E in positions that are not 2 and 5 respectively, but also in positions we haven't tried.

Moreover, we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and three unknown letters. We should try to cover other common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: R, I, S.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that have A and E, and don't have R, I, S.

We also have three positions to figure out. We should try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also avoid repeating the positions we know are wrong for A and E.

For the second guess, we can try to put A in a different position and E in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (since it can't be 2, and we haven't tried others)
Similarly, for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (can't be 5)

But note: we don't know the exact positions, so we can try one possibility.

Also, we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of repetition. However, we cannot rule it out.

But since we are early, let's assume no repetition for now.

Let me list some candidate words that contain A and E, and avoid R, I, S.

For example:
- ""LATEN"" - but is it a word? Not common. Maybe ""LATTE"" but has double T and no E? Wait, ""LATTE"" doesn't have E.

Better to use common words.

Consider: ""PLATE"" -> contains P, L, A, T, E. 
- A is in position 3, E in position 5. But note: in the feedback, E was in position 5 and was wrong, so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, if we put E in position 5 again, it would be a waste? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal because we already know E is not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PLATE"":
- A is in position 3 (which is new) and E is in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So if we use ""PLATE"", we are putting E in a position we know it doesn't belong. That might not be efficient because we already know E isn't at position 5, so we won't get new information about E's position.

We should try to put E in a position we haven't tested: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly for A: avoid position 2, so try 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""LEACH"" - but has H and C. Also, A is in position 3, E in position 2.

But we don't know if H or C are in the word.

Alternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but has O, C, N. Also, A is in position 4 and E in position 3. But note: we have excluded R, I, S, but O, C, N are new.

But ""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we might want to test more consonants.

Another common word: ""ALERT"" - but has R which is excluded. So invalid.

""LATER"": has R? Yes, R is excluded. So no.

""TALON"": no E.

We need a word with A and E.

Let me think: words with A and E, no R, I, S.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. 
  - A is in position 3, E in position 5. But again, E is in position 5 which we know is wrong.

- ""LEANT"": has L, E, A, N, T. 
  - E in position 2, A in position 3. 
  - Positions: 1: L, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: T.
  - This avoids position 5 for E and position 2 for A? 
    - A was in position 2 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is new. 
    - E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put E in position 2, which is new.

So ""LEANT"" seems good.

But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of ""leaned"" or ""learnt"", but accepted as a word.

Another option: ""LEAPT"" - similar: L, E, A, P, T. E in 2, A in 3.

Or ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T. E in 2, A in 3.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don't know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.

Similarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.

We also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.

In ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.

Both are good.

Another word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.

We should avoid E at 5.

So ""ADOBE"" is not good.

""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.

So let's stick with words that have E not in position 5.

Another candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.

""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.

""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.

So without S, R, I.

""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.

""LEACH"" is a word.

But H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.

But Y is at the end, which might be common.

Another: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.

But W is not very common.

I think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. 
- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven't tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).
- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).
- New letters: D, L, T.

Also, D, L, T are common consonants.

So I'll go with ""DEALT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.

So let's choose ""DEALT"".

We can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.

""LEANT"" is also good.

But ""DEALT"" seems more common.

Another word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".

Now, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).
- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).
- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).
- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:

Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).\n- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).\n- New letters: D, L, T.\n\nAlso, D, L, T are common consonants.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DEALT"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""DEALT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.\n\n""LEANT"" is also good.\n\nBut ""DEALT"" seems more common.\n\nAnother word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".\n\nNow, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").\n- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).\n- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).\n- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).\n- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:\n  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).\n  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.\n\nThe word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).\n- Excludes R, I, S.\n- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.\n- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.\n\n<guess>dealt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- L: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters A and E (from both guesses).
2. The following letters are not in the word: R, I, S, D, L, T (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).
3. A is not in position 2 (from ""raise"") and not in position 3 (from ""dealt""). So A must be in position 1 or 4 (since the word is 5 letters, and position 5 is not tested for A yet, but note E is also to be placed).
4. E is not in position 5 (from ""raise"") and not in position 2 (from ""dealt""). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know A and E are in the word, and they are distinct. So we need to assign them to positions without conflict.

Possible positions for A: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are eliminated)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are eliminated)

But if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 4, E could be in 1 or 3 (but not 4, unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out, but for now, let's assume no duplicates to keep it simple).

So the possible cases for A and E:

Case 1: A in position 1, then E can be in 3 or 4.
Case 2: A in position 4, then E can be in 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have three more letters to find. We know the absent letters: R, I, S, D, L, T. So we must avoid these.

We need to think of common letters that are not excluded. The remaining letters in the alphabet (excluding vowels we know and the absent consonants) are:

Vowels: we have A and E, so other vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's see)

Consonants: we have excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T. Note: I is a vowel, but excluded.

Available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But common ones: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

We also know that the word must have three more letters besides A and E.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the constraints.

We can try to guess a word that tests the possible positions for A and E and uses new common letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and E) and we need to place them in the allowed positions and choose the other three from the available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, consider Case 1: A in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.

If A in 1, E in 3: then the word is A _ E _ _

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {R,I,S,D,L,T} and not A or E (unless duplicate, but we avoid for now).

Similarly, if A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Case 2: A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A _
Or A in 4, E in 3: _ E _ A _

But note: we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 and A in 4, for example.

We need to test these possibilities.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that covers as many of these cases as possible and uses common unused letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in the possible positions and includes other common letters to test.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T.

So available: A, E, and then B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O and U are vowels, but we can use them.)

But we are focusing on positions.

We know A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, E cannot be in 2 or 5, so E in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in 1, then E cannot be in 1, so E in 3 or 4.

Similarly, if A in 4, then E in 1 or 3.

Now, let's try to form words:

Option: A in position 1, E in position 3: A _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks. For example, with common letters: A, then a consonant, then E, then two more.

Possible words: 
- ACHEM? Not a word.
- ACHE: only 4 letters? No, we need 5.
- AWES: but S is excluded.
- AGENT: G, E, N, T. But T is excluded (from dealt, T is x). So no.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D. But D is excluded. No.
- APERT: but R and T excluded.

It's tricky.

Another: A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Examples:
- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y. But E is in position 4? A B B E Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y. But E is in 4, which is allowed. But we have double B? And Y at end. Also, B and Y are available. But is ""ABBEY"" valid? Yes. But note: we have two B's, but that's okay if the secret word has B. However, we don't know.

But we are trying to test, so it might be acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word without duplicates.

- AGAPE: A G A P E -> but A is repeated? And E is in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

- ALONE: but L is excluded.

- ANODE: N, O, D, E. But D is excluded.

- APEX: only 4 letters? A P E X -> 4 letters.

- AWAKE: W, A, K, E. But A is in position 1, then W in 2, A in 3? But we have A in 1 and 3? That would be duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so maybe not. But let's avoid for now.

AWAKE: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E -> but E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

- ABASE: but S excluded.

- ABATE: T excluded.

- ACUTE: C, U, T, E. T excluded.

- ADAGE: D excluded.

- AFIRE: F, I, R, E. I and R excluded.

- AGATE: G, A, T, E. T excluded.

- ALIKE: L and I excluded.

- AMUSE: M, U, S, E. S excluded.

- ANIME: N, I, M, E. I excluded.

- ARISE: R, I, S excluded.

So it's hard to find a word with A in 1 and E in 4 without using excluded letters.

Now, try A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ _

- AGENT: G, E, N, T -> T excluded.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D -> D excluded.
- APERY: P, E, R, Y -> R excluded.
- AVERT: V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.
- AWFUL: W, F, U, L -> L excluded.

Not working.

Now, consider Case 2: A in position 4.

Then E can be in 1 or 3.

First, E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _

Words:
- ECHOA: not a word.
- ECLAT: E C L A T -> but L and T excluded.
- EDEMA: E D E M A -> D excluded and duplicate E? 
- EGYPT: E G Y P T -> T excluded.
- ELOHA: E L O H A -> L excluded.
- ENEMA: E N E M A -> duplicate E? and M and N, but E is repeated. 
- ENOLA: E N O L A -> L excluded.
- EPHOR: E P H O R -> R excluded.
- ERUCA: E R U C A -> R excluded.
- EVADE: E V A D E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

Not finding good words.

Now, E in 3 and A in 4: _ E _ A _

Words:
- BEAU: only 4 letters.
- BLEAR: B L E A R -> L and R excluded.
- CHEAP: C H E A P -> possible? C, H, E, A, P. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:P. 
  - This uses C, H, P which are available. 
  - And E is in 3, A in 4, which are allowed (E not in 2 or 5, A not in 2 or 3).

So ""CHEAP"" is a candidate.

Similarly, other words:
- CLEAN: C L E A N -> L excluded.
- DREAM: D R E A M -> D and R excluded.
- FLEAM: F L E A M -> L excluded.
- GLEAM: G L E A M -> L excluded.
- HEAVY: H E A V Y -> but A is in position 3? H E A V Y: 1:H, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:Y. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed because from ""dealt"", A was in position 3 and was marked wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""HEAVY"" has A in 3, which is invalid.

In ""CHEAP"", A is in position 4, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLEAD"": P L E A D -> L and D excluded.

""QUEAN"": Q U E A N -> possible? 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. Q and U are less common, but valid.

""STEAM"": S excluded.

""WHEAT"": W H E A T -> T excluded.

So ""CHEAP"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> but E is in position 3, A in 4. And O, C, N are available. But in ""OCEAN"", the positions: 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. 
- E is in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed). 
- And it uses O, C, N, which are not excluded.

So ""OCEAN"" is also a candidate.

Similarly, ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"" are both options.

We can also consider ""BEACH"": but S? B E A C H -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:H. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and was wrong). So invalid.

""PEACH"": P E A C H -> A in 3, invalid.

So back to ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"".

Which one to choose? Both test E in 3 and A in 4, and use new letters.

""CHEAP"" uses C, H, P.
""OCEAN"" uses O, C, N.

Both are good. But we might want to use more common letters.

Alternatively, we can consider if there is a word that tests A in position 1.

For example, A in 1 and E in 4: we had trouble, but let's find one.

""AGLEE"": not common.
""AGONE"": G, O, N, E. But E in 4? A G O N E -> 1:A, 2:G, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. But E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

""ALBEE"": L excluded.

So hard to find.

Another idea: A in 1 and E in 3: ""AXIOM"" but I and O? A X I O M -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"": Z, O, T, E. T excluded.

Not working.

So perhaps the secret word has A in position 4 and E in position 3, as in ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But we also have the possibility of E in position 1 and A in position 4.

We haven't tested that.

For example, a word like ""URAEI"" not 5 letters.

""URAE"" no.

""ENACT"": E N A C T -> but A in 3? E N A C T: 1:E, 2:N, 3:A, 4:C, 5:T. But A is in 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and wrong). Also, T excluded.

""EXACT"": E X A C T -> A in 3, T excluded.

""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in 1 and A in 4 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most plausible is E in 3 and A in 4.

So we can go with ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But note: we also have the possibility of A in position 1 and E in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. Or A in position 1 and E in position 3, also hard.

Another word for A in 1 and E in 3: ""AVERT"" but R and T excluded.

""ASKEW"": S and K? A S K E W -> S excluded.

So I think we should test the E in 3 and A in 4 pattern.

Between ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"", which is better?

""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E), so it might be vowel-heavy. ""CHEAP"" has consonants C, H, P.

Also, ""CHEAP"" uses H which is common, and P.

But both are valid.

We can also consider ""CHEAP"" might be more common.

But let's see the frequency: in Wordle, both are accepted.

Another candidate: ""BEANO"" - B E A N O -> but E in 2? 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O. But E is in 2, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", E was in 2 and was wrong). So E cannot be in 2. Therefore, ""BEANO"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> L excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""CHEAP"", we have E in position 3 and A in position 4. We are testing if A is in 4 and E in 3.

If the secret word has A in 1, then this guess won't have A and E in the right positions, but we will get feedback.

We are trying to cover the most likely case.

We could choose a word that has A in 1 and E in 4, but we need to find one.

After some thought, I found ""AGAPE"" but E is at 5, invalid.

""ADOBE"" E at 5.

""ABODE"" has E at 5 and D excluded.

""AFORE"" R excluded.

So I think it's safe to go with ""CHEAP"".

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHEAP"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has A in 4 and E in 3, then in ""CHEAP"":
- C: could be correct or not
- H: same
- E: in position 3, if the secret has E in 3, it would be ✓, else -
- A: in position 4, if secret has A in 4, ✓, else -
- P: ?

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in 1 to test that case.

For example, ""ANKHS"" not common.

""ANODE"" D excluded.

""APPLE"" P, P, L, E -> L excluded and duplicate P.

Not good.

""AROSE"" R and S excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> but A in 2? 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N. But A is in position 2, which is not allowed (from ""raise"", A was in 2 and wrong). So invalid.

Similarly, ""UNAU"" not 5 letters.

So I'll go with ""CHEAP"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CHEAP"" has C, H, E, A, P. None of R,I,S,D,L,T. So it's clean.

Therefore, the third guess is ""CHEAP"".

Now, return in the required format.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - R, I, S are **absent** from the secret word.
     - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - A is not in position 2.
       - E is not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → Feedback: D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - D, L, T are **absent** from the secret word.
     - E and A are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - E is not in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 2).
       - A is not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 3).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**: A and E are in the secret word (from both guesses).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1 or 4.
     - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
   - Since A and E are distinct, they cannot occupy the same position. Possible valid (A, E) position pairs:
     - A in 1, E in 3
     - A in 1, E in 4
     - A in 4, E in 1
     - A in 4, E in 3
   - The word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters are unknown. These must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters: available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test the most likely position pairs for A and E while introducing new common letters to maximize information.
   - Focus on the (A in 4, E in 3) pair, as it aligns with common English words and avoids positions ruled out by feedback.
   - Avoid absent letters (R, I, S, D, L, T) and reuse A and E to confirm their positions.
   - Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, H, P, N) to test new letters efficiently.
   - After evaluating options like ""ocean"" (O, C, E, A, N) and ""cheap"" (C, H, E, A, P), ""cheap"" is selected because:
     - It places E in position 3 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed).
     - It uses common consonants C, H, P, which are untested and high-frequency.
     - It avoids all absent letters and repeated letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E is correctly in position 3, it will show ✓ for E.
   - If A is correctly in position 4, it will show ✓ for A.
   - Feedback for C, H, and P will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>cheap</guess>",cheap,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- L: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters A and E (from both guesses).
2. The following letters are not in the word: R, I, S, D, L, T (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).
3. A is not in position 2 (from ""raise"") and not in position 3 (from ""dealt""). So A must be in position 1 or 4 (since the word is 5 letters, and position 5 is not tested for A yet, but note E is also to be placed).
4. E is not in position 5 (from ""raise"") and not in position 2 (from ""dealt""). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know A and E are in the word, and they are distinct. So we need to assign them to positions without conflict.

Possible positions for A: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are eliminated)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are eliminated)

But if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 4, E could be in 1 or 3 (but not 4, unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out, but for now, let's assume no duplicates to keep it simple).

So the possible cases for A and E:

Case 1: A in position 1, then E can be in 3 or 4.
Case 2: A in position 4, then E can be in 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have three more letters to find. We know the absent letters: R, I, S, D, L, T. So we must avoid these.

We need to think of common letters that are not excluded. The remaining letters in the alphabet (excluding vowels we know and the absent consonants) are:

Vowels: we have A and E, so other vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's see)

Consonants: we have excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T. Note: I is a vowel, but excluded.

Available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But common ones: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

We also know that the word must have three more letters besides A and E.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the constraints.

We can try to guess a word that tests the possible positions for A and E and uses new common letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and E) and we need to place them in the allowed positions and choose the other three from the available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, consider Case 1: A in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.

If A in 1, E in 3: then the word is A _ E _ _

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {R,I,S,D,L,T} and not A or E (unless duplicate, but we avoid for now).

Similarly, if A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Case 2: A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A _
Or A in 4, E in 3: _ E _ A _

But note: we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 and A in 4, for example.

We need to test these possibilities.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that covers as many of these cases as possible and uses common unused letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in the possible positions and includes other common letters to test.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T.

So available: A, E, and then B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O and U are vowels, but we can use them.)

But we are focusing on positions.

We know A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, E cannot be in 2 or 5, so E in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in 1, then E cannot be in 1, so E in 3 or 4.

Similarly, if A in 4, then E in 1 or 3.

Now, let's try to form words:

Option: A in position 1, E in position 3: A _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks. For example, with common letters: A, then a consonant, then E, then two more.

Possible words: 
- ACHEM? Not a word.
- ACHE: only 4 letters? No, we need 5.
- AWES: but S is excluded.
- AGENT: G, E, N, T. But T is excluded (from dealt, T is x). So no.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D. But D is excluded. No.
- APERT: but R and T excluded.

It's tricky.

Another: A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Examples:
- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y. But E is in position 4? A B B E Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y. But E is in 4, which is allowed. But we have double B? And Y at end. Also, B and Y are available. But is ""ABBEY"" valid? Yes. But note: we have two B's, but that's okay if the secret word has B. However, we don't know.

But we are trying to test, so it might be acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word without duplicates.

- AGAPE: A G A P E -> but A is repeated? And E is in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

- ALONE: but L is excluded.

- ANODE: N, O, D, E. But D is excluded.

- APEX: only 4 letters? A P E X -> 4 letters.

- AWAKE: W, A, K, E. But A is in position 1, then W in 2, A in 3? But we have A in 1 and 3? That would be duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so maybe not. But let's avoid for now.

AWAKE: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E -> but E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

- ABASE: but S excluded.

- ABATE: T excluded.

- ACUTE: C, U, T, E. T excluded.

- ADAGE: D excluded.

- AFIRE: F, I, R, E. I and R excluded.

- AGATE: G, A, T, E. T excluded.

- ALIKE: L and I excluded.

- AMUSE: M, U, S, E. S excluded.

- ANIME: N, I, M, E. I excluded.

- ARISE: R, I, S excluded.

So it's hard to find a word with A in 1 and E in 4 without using excluded letters.

Now, try A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ _

- AGENT: G, E, N, T -> T excluded.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D -> D excluded.
- APERY: P, E, R, Y -> R excluded.
- AVERT: V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.
- AWFUL: W, F, U, L -> L excluded.

Not working.

Now, consider Case 2: A in position 4.

Then E can be in 1 or 3.

First, E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _

Words:
- ECHOA: not a word.
- ECLAT: E C L A T -> but L and T excluded.
- EDEMA: E D E M A -> D excluded and duplicate E? 
- EGYPT: E G Y P T -> T excluded.
- ELOHA: E L O H A -> L excluded.
- ENEMA: E N E M A -> duplicate E? and M and N, but E is repeated. 
- ENOLA: E N O L A -> L excluded.
- EPHOR: E P H O R -> R excluded.
- ERUCA: E R U C A -> R excluded.
- EVADE: E V A D E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

Not finding good words.

Now, E in 3 and A in 4: _ E _ A _

Words:
- BEAU: only 4 letters.
- BLEAR: B L E A R -> L and R excluded.
- CHEAP: C H E A P -> possible? C, H, E, A, P. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:P. 
  - This uses C, H, P which are available. 
  - And E is in 3, A in 4, which are allowed (E not in 2 or 5, A not in 2 or 3).

So ""CHEAP"" is a candidate.

Similarly, other words:
- CLEAN: C L E A N -> L excluded.
- DREAM: D R E A M -> D and R excluded.
- FLEAM: F L E A M -> L excluded.
- GLEAM: G L E A M -> L excluded.
- HEAVY: H E A V Y -> but A is in position 3? H E A V Y: 1:H, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:Y. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed because from ""dealt"", A was in position 3 and was marked wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""HEAVY"" has A in 3, which is invalid.

In ""CHEAP"", A is in position 4, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLEAD"": P L E A D -> L and D excluded.

""QUEAN"": Q U E A N -> possible? 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. Q and U are less common, but valid.

""STEAM"": S excluded.

""WHEAT"": W H E A T -> T excluded.

So ""CHEAP"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> but E is in position 3, A in 4. And O, C, N are available. But in ""OCEAN"", the positions: 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. 
- E is in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed). 
- And it uses O, C, N, which are not excluded.

So ""OCEAN"" is also a candidate.

Similarly, ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"" are both options.

We can also consider ""BEACH"": but S? B E A C H -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:H. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and was wrong). So invalid.

""PEACH"": P E A C H -> A in 3, invalid.

So back to ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"".

Which one to choose? Both test E in 3 and A in 4, and use new letters.

""CHEAP"" uses C, H, P.
""OCEAN"" uses O, C, N.

Both are good. But we might want to use more common letters.

Alternatively, we can consider if there is a word that tests A in position 1.

For example, A in 1 and E in 4: we had trouble, but let's find one.

""AGLEE"": not common.
""AGONE"": G, O, N, E. But E in 4? A G O N E -> 1:A, 2:G, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. But E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

""ALBEE"": L excluded.

So hard to find.

Another idea: A in 1 and E in 3: ""AXIOM"" but I and O? A X I O M -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"": Z, O, T, E. T excluded.

Not working.

So perhaps the secret word has A in position 4 and E in position 3, as in ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But we also have the possibility of E in position 1 and A in position 4.

We haven't tested that.

For example, a word like ""URAEI"" not 5 letters.

""URAE"" no.

""ENACT"": E N A C T -> but A in 3? E N A C T: 1:E, 2:N, 3:A, 4:C, 5:T. But A is in 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and wrong). Also, T excluded.

""EXACT"": E X A C T -> A in 3, T excluded.

""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in 1 and A in 4 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most plausible is E in 3 and A in 4.

So we can go with ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But note: we also have the possibility of A in position 1 and E in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. Or A in position 1 and E in position 3, also hard.

Another word for A in 1 and E in 3: ""AVERT"" but R and T excluded.

""ASKEW"": S and K? A S K E W -> S excluded.

So I think we should test the E in 3 and A in 4 pattern.

Between ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"", which is better?

""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E), so it might be vowel-heavy. ""CHEAP"" has consonants C, H, P.

Also, ""CHEAP"" uses H which is common, and P.

But both are valid.

We can also consider ""CHEAP"" might be more common.

But let's see the frequency: in Wordle, both are accepted.

Another candidate: ""BEANO"" - B E A N O -> but E in 2? 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O. But E is in 2, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", E was in 2 and was wrong). So E cannot be in 2. Therefore, ""BEANO"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> L excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""CHEAP"", we have E in position 3 and A in position 4. We are testing if A is in 4 and E in 3.

If the secret word has A in 1, then this guess won't have A and E in the right positions, but we will get feedback.

We are trying to cover the most likely case.

We could choose a word that has A in 1 and E in 4, but we need to find one.

After some thought, I found ""AGAPE"" but E is at 5, invalid.

""ADOBE"" E at 5.

""ABODE"" has E at 5 and D excluded.

""AFORE"" R excluded.

So I think it's safe to go with ""CHEAP"".

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHEAP"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has A in 4 and E in 3, then in ""CHEAP"":
- C: could be correct or not
- H: same
- E: in position 3, if the secret has E in 3, it would be ✓, else -
- A: in position 4, if secret has A in 4, ✓, else -
- P: ?

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in 1 to test that case.

For example, ""ANKHS"" not common.

""ANODE"" D excluded.

""APPLE"" P, P, L, E -> L excluded and duplicate P.

Not good.

""AROSE"" R and S excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> but A in 2? 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N. But A is in position 2, which is not allowed (from ""raise"", A was in 2 and wrong). So invalid.

Similarly, ""UNAU"" not 5 letters.

So I'll go with ""CHEAP"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CHEAP"" has C, H, E, A, P. None of R,I,S,D,L,T. So it's clean.

Therefore, the third guess is ""CHEAP"".

Now, return in the required format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - R, I, S are **absent** from the secret word.
     - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - A is not in position 2.
       - E is not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → Feedback: D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - D, L, T are **absent** from the secret word.
     - E and A are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - E is not in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 2).
       - A is not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 3).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**: A and E are in the secret word (from both guesses).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1 or 4.
     - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
   - Since A and E are distinct, they cannot occupy the same position. Possible valid (A, E) position pairs:
     - A in 1, E in 3
     - A in 1, E in 4
     - A in 4, E in 1
     - A in 4, E in 3
   - The word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters are unknown. These must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters: available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test the most likely position pairs for A and E while introducing new common letters to maximize information.
   - Focus on the (A in 4, E in 3) pair, as it aligns with common English words and avoids positions ruled out by feedback.
   - Avoid absent letters (R, I, S, D, L, T) and reuse A and E to confirm their positions.
   - Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, H, P, N) to test new letters efficiently.
   - After evaluating options like ""ocean"" (O, C, E, A, N) and ""cheap"" (C, H, E, A, P), ""cheap"" is selected because:
     - It places E in position 3 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed).
     - It uses common consonants C, H, P, which are untested and high-frequency.
     - It avoids all absent letters and repeated letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E is correctly in position 3, it will show ✓ for E.
   - If A is correctly in position 4, it will show ✓ for A.
   - Feedback for C, H, and P will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.",Guess 3: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) A(-) P(x),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We need to choose a word that gives us as much information as possible. A good starting word often has common letters and distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.

 Some people use words like ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have common letters and no repeated letters.
 However, note that repeated letters are allowed in the word but in our feedback we must consider the frequency.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose: SALET (which is a valid English word and is often used in word games) but note that Wordle words are typically common.
 Alternatively, I can use ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose a word that is known to be effective: ""CRANE"".

 But note, the instruction says ""5-letter English word"" and it must be valid.

 Another popular word is ""IRATE"" or ""RAISE"". I think ""RAISE"" is a good option because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's pick one that has been proven statistically: ""CRATE"" might be even better because C is also common.

 Actually, let's choose ""ROATE"". Is it a valid word? It is a financial term. But if the system requires common words, then I might choose ""TRACE"".

 Since we don't know the dictionary, we'll pick a common word.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"".

 Guess: RAISE

 Let me check the letters: R, A, I, S, E -> all distinct.

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: We are making the first guess. So the feedback will come after.

 Therefore, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".

 Now, return the guess in the required format.I'm starting a new game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to cover more possibilities. 

After considering options like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE,"" I'm selecting ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S), covering frequent English letters.
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback on each position.
- It ranks high in statistical effectiveness according to Wordle-solving datasets.

This guess will help identify included letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Also, note that A was in position 2 of ""raise"" (if we number positions 1 to 5). Since it's marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are absent)
- Contains A and E (since they are present)
- And we should try to place A and E in positions that are not 2 and 5 respectively, but also in positions we haven't tried.

Moreover, we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and three unknown letters. We should try to cover other common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: R, I, S.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that have A and E, and don't have R, I, S.

We also have three positions to figure out. We should try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also avoid repeating the positions we know are wrong for A and E.

For the second guess, we can try to put A in a different position and E in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (since it can't be 2, and we haven't tried others)
Similarly, for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (can't be 5)

But note: we don't know the exact positions, so we can try one possibility.

Also, we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of repetition. However, we cannot rule it out.

But since we are early, let's assume no repetition for now.

Let me list some candidate words that contain A and E, and avoid R, I, S.

For example:
- ""LATEN"" - but is it a word? Not common. Maybe ""LATTE"" but has double T and no E? Wait, ""LATTE"" doesn't have E.

Better to use common words.

Consider: ""PLATE"" -> contains P, L, A, T, E. 
- A is in position 3, E in position 5. But note: in the feedback, E was in position 5 and was wrong, so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, if we put E in position 5 again, it would be a waste? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal because we already know E is not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PLATE"":
- A is in position 3 (which is new) and E is in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So if we use ""PLATE"", we are putting E in a position we know it doesn't belong. That might not be efficient because we already know E isn't at position 5, so we won't get new information about E's position.

We should try to put E in a position we haven't tested: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly for A: avoid position 2, so try 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""LEACH"" - but has H and C. Also, A is in position 3, E in position 2.

But we don't know if H or C are in the word.

Alternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but has O, C, N. Also, A is in position 4 and E in position 3. But note: we have excluded R, I, S, but O, C, N are new.

But ""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we might want to test more consonants.

Another common word: ""ALERT"" - but has R which is excluded. So invalid.

""LATER"": has R? Yes, R is excluded. So no.

""TALON"": no E.

We need a word with A and E.

Let me think: words with A and E, no R, I, S.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. 
  - A is in position 3, E in position 5. But again, E is in position 5 which we know is wrong.

- ""LEANT"": has L, E, A, N, T. 
  - E in position 2, A in position 3. 
  - Positions: 1: L, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: T.
  - This avoids position 5 for E and position 2 for A? 
    - A was in position 2 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is new. 
    - E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put E in position 2, which is new.

So ""LEANT"" seems good.

But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of ""leaned"" or ""learnt"", but accepted as a word.

Another option: ""LEAPT"" - similar: L, E, A, P, T. E in 2, A in 3.

Or ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T. E in 2, A in 3.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don't know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.

Similarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.

We also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.

In ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.

Both are good.

Another word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.

We should avoid E at 5.

So ""ADOBE"" is not good.

""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.

So let's stick with words that have E not in position 5.

Another candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.

""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.

""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.

So without S, R, I.

""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.

""LEACH"" is a word.

But H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.

But Y is at the end, which might be common.

Another: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.

But W is not very common.

I think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. 
- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven't tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).
- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).
- New letters: D, L, T.

Also, D, L, T are common consonants.

So I'll go with ""DEALT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.

So let's choose ""DEALT"".

We can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.

""LEANT"" is also good.

But ""DEALT"" seems more common.

Another word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".

Now, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).
- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).
- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).
- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:
  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).
  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.

The word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).
- Excludes R, I, S.
- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.
- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.

<guess>dealt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- L: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters A and E (from both guesses).
2. The following letters are not in the word: R, I, S, D, L, T (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).
3. A is not in position 2 (from ""raise"") and not in position 3 (from ""dealt""). So A must be in position 1 or 4 (since the word is 5 letters, and position 5 is not tested for A yet, but note E is also to be placed).
4. E is not in position 5 (from ""raise"") and not in position 2 (from ""dealt""). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know A and E are in the word, and they are distinct. So we need to assign them to positions without conflict.

Possible positions for A: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are eliminated)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are eliminated)

But if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 4, E could be in 1 or 3 (but not 4, unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out, but for now, let's assume no duplicates to keep it simple).

So the possible cases for A and E:

Case 1: A in position 1, then E can be in 3 or 4.
Case 2: A in position 4, then E can be in 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have three more letters to find. We know the absent letters: R, I, S, D, L, T. So we must avoid these.

We need to think of common letters that are not excluded. The remaining letters in the alphabet (excluding vowels we know and the absent consonants) are:

Vowels: we have A and E, so other vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's see)

Consonants: we have excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T. Note: I is a vowel, but excluded.

Available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But common ones: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

We also know that the word must have three more letters besides A and E.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the constraints.

We can try to guess a word that tests the possible positions for A and E and uses new common letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and E) and we need to place them in the allowed positions and choose the other three from the available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, consider Case 1: A in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.

If A in 1, E in 3: then the word is A _ E _ _

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {R,I,S,D,L,T} and not A or E (unless duplicate, but we avoid for now).

Similarly, if A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Case 2: A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A _
Or A in 4, E in 3: _ E _ A _

But note: we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 and A in 4, for example.

We need to test these possibilities.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that covers as many of these cases as possible and uses common unused letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in the possible positions and includes other common letters to test.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T.

So available: A, E, and then B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O and U are vowels, but we can use them.)

But we are focusing on positions.

We know A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, E cannot be in 2 or 5, so E in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in 1, then E cannot be in 1, so E in 3 or 4.

Similarly, if A in 4, then E in 1 or 3.

Now, let's try to form words:

Option: A in position 1, E in position 3: A _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks. For example, with common letters: A, then a consonant, then E, then two more.

Possible words: 
- ACHEM? Not a word.
- ACHE: only 4 letters? No, we need 5.
- AWES: but S is excluded.
- AGENT: G, E, N, T. But T is excluded (from dealt, T is x). So no.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D. But D is excluded. No.
- APERT: but R and T excluded.

It's tricky.

Another: A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Examples:
- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y. But E is in position 4? A B B E Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y. But E is in 4, which is allowed. But we have double B? And Y at end. Also, B and Y are available. But is ""ABBEY"" valid? Yes. But note: we have two B's, but that's okay if the secret word has B. However, we don't know.

But we are trying to test, so it might be acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word without duplicates.

- AGAPE: A G A P E -> but A is repeated? And E is in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

- ALONE: but L is excluded.

- ANODE: N, O, D, E. But D is excluded.

- APEX: only 4 letters? A P E X -> 4 letters.

- AWAKE: W, A, K, E. But A is in position 1, then W in 2, A in 3? But we have A in 1 and 3? That would be duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so maybe not. But let's avoid for now.

AWAKE: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E -> but E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

- ABASE: but S excluded.

- ABATE: T excluded.

- ACUTE: C, U, T, E. T excluded.

- ADAGE: D excluded.

- AFIRE: F, I, R, E. I and R excluded.

- AGATE: G, A, T, E. T excluded.

- ALIKE: L and I excluded.

- AMUSE: M, U, S, E. S excluded.

- ANIME: N, I, M, E. I excluded.

- ARISE: R, I, S excluded.

So it's hard to find a word with A in 1 and E in 4 without using excluded letters.

Now, try A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ _

- AGENT: G, E, N, T -> T excluded.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D -> D excluded.
- APERY: P, E, R, Y -> R excluded.
- AVERT: V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.
- AWFUL: W, F, U, L -> L excluded.

Not working.

Now, consider Case 2: A in position 4.

Then E can be in 1 or 3.

First, E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _

Words:
- ECHOA: not a word.
- ECLAT: E C L A T -> but L and T excluded.
- EDEMA: E D E M A -> D excluded and duplicate E? 
- EGYPT: E G Y P T -> T excluded.
- ELOHA: E L O H A -> L excluded.
- ENEMA: E N E M A -> duplicate E? and M and N, but E is repeated. 
- ENOLA: E N O L A -> L excluded.
- EPHOR: E P H O R -> R excluded.
- ERUCA: E R U C A -> R excluded.
- EVADE: E V A D E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

Not finding good words.

Now, E in 3 and A in 4: _ E _ A _

Words:
- BEAU: only 4 letters.
- BLEAR: B L E A R -> L and R excluded.
- CHEAP: C H E A P -> possible? C, H, E, A, P. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:P. 
  - This uses C, H, P which are available. 
  - And E is in 3, A in 4, which are allowed (E not in 2 or 5, A not in 2 or 3).

So ""CHEAP"" is a candidate.

Similarly, other words:
- CLEAN: C L E A N -> L excluded.
- DREAM: D R E A M -> D and R excluded.
- FLEAM: F L E A M -> L excluded.
- GLEAM: G L E A M -> L excluded.
- HEAVY: H E A V Y -> but A is in position 3? H E A V Y: 1:H, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:Y. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed because from ""dealt"", A was in position 3 and was marked wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""HEAVY"" has A in 3, which is invalid.

In ""CHEAP"", A is in position 4, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLEAD"": P L E A D -> L and D excluded.

""QUEAN"": Q U E A N -> possible? 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. Q and U are less common, but valid.

""STEAM"": S excluded.

""WHEAT"": W H E A T -> T excluded.

So ""CHEAP"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> but E is in position 3, A in 4. And O, C, N are available. But in ""OCEAN"", the positions: 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. 
- E is in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed). 
- And it uses O, C, N, which are not excluded.

So ""OCEAN"" is also a candidate.

Similarly, ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"" are both options.

We can also consider ""BEACH"": but S? B E A C H -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:H. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and was wrong). So invalid.

""PEACH"": P E A C H -> A in 3, invalid.

So back to ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"".

Which one to choose? Both test E in 3 and A in 4, and use new letters.

""CHEAP"" uses C, H, P.
""OCEAN"" uses O, C, N.

Both are good. But we might want to use more common letters.

Alternatively, we can consider if there is a word that tests A in position 1.

For example, A in 1 and E in 4: we had trouble, but let's find one.

""AGLEE"": not common.
""AGONE"": G, O, N, E. But E in 4? A G O N E -> 1:A, 2:G, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. But E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

""ALBEE"": L excluded.

So hard to find.

Another idea: A in 1 and E in 3: ""AXIOM"" but I and O? A X I O M -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"": Z, O, T, E. T excluded.

Not working.

So perhaps the secret word has A in position 4 and E in position 3, as in ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But we also have the possibility of E in position 1 and A in position 4.

We haven't tested that.

For example, a word like ""URAEI"" not 5 letters.

""URAE"" no.

""ENACT"": E N A C T -> but A in 3? E N A C T: 1:E, 2:N, 3:A, 4:C, 5:T. But A is in 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and wrong). Also, T excluded.

""EXACT"": E X A C T -> A in 3, T excluded.

""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in 1 and A in 4 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most plausible is E in 3 and A in 4.

So we can go with ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But note: we also have the possibility of A in position 1 and E in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. Or A in position 1 and E in position 3, also hard.

Another word for A in 1 and E in 3: ""AVERT"" but R and T excluded.

""ASKEW"": S and K? A S K E W -> S excluded.

So I think we should test the E in 3 and A in 4 pattern.

Between ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"", which is better?

""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E), so it might be vowel-heavy. ""CHEAP"" has consonants C, H, P.

Also, ""CHEAP"" uses H which is common, and P.

But both are valid.

We can also consider ""CHEAP"" might be more common.

But let's see the frequency: in Wordle, both are accepted.

Another candidate: ""BEANO"" - B E A N O -> but E in 2? 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O. But E is in 2, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", E was in 2 and was wrong). So E cannot be in 2. Therefore, ""BEANO"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> L excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""CHEAP"", we have E in position 3 and A in position 4. We are testing if A is in 4 and E in 3.

If the secret word has A in 1, then this guess won't have A and E in the right positions, but we will get feedback.

We are trying to cover the most likely case.

We could choose a word that has A in 1 and E in 4, but we need to find one.

After some thought, I found ""AGAPE"" but E is at 5, invalid.

""ADOBE"" E at 5.

""ABODE"" has E at 5 and D excluded.

""AFORE"" R excluded.

So I think it's safe to go with ""CHEAP"".

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHEAP"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has A in 4 and E in 3, then in ""CHEAP"":
- C: could be correct or not
- H: same
- E: in position 3, if the secret has E in 3, it would be ✓, else -
- A: in position 4, if secret has A in 4, ✓, else -
- P: ?

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in 1 to test that case.

For example, ""ANKHS"" not common.

""ANODE"" D excluded.

""APPLE"" P, P, L, E -> L excluded and duplicate P.

Not good.

""AROSE"" R and S excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> but A in 2? 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N. But A is in position 2, which is not allowed (from ""raise"", A was in 2 and wrong). So invalid.

Similarly, ""UNAU"" not 5 letters.

So I'll go with ""CHEAP"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CHEAP"" has C, H, E, A, P. None of R,I,S,D,L,T. So it's clean.

Therefore, the third guess is ""CHEAP"".

Now, return in the required format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - R, I, S are **absent** from the secret word.
     - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - A is not in position 2.
       - E is not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → Feedback: D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - D, L, T are **absent** from the secret word.
     - E and A are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - E is not in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 2).
       - A is not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 3).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**: A and E are in the secret word (from both guesses).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1 or 4.
     - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
   - Since A and E are distinct, they cannot occupy the same position. Possible valid (A, E) position pairs:
     - A in 1, E in 3
     - A in 1, E in 4
     - A in 4, E in 1
     - A in 4, E in 3
   - The word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters are unknown. These must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters: available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test the most likely position pairs for A and E while introducing new common letters to maximize information.
   - Focus on the (A in 4, E in 3) pair, as it aligns with common English words and avoids positions ruled out by feedback.
   - Avoid absent letters (R, I, S, D, L, T) and reuse A and E to confirm their positions.
   - Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, H, P, N) to test new letters efficiently.
   - After evaluating options like ""ocean"" (O, C, E, A, N) and ""cheap"" (C, H, E, A, P), ""cheap"" is selected because:
     - It places E in position 3 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed).
     - It uses common consonants C, H, P, which are untested and high-frequency.
     - It avoids all absent letters and repeated letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E is correctly in position 3, it will show ✓ for E.
   - If A is correctly in position 4, it will show ✓ for A.
   - Feedback for C, H, and P will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

A good starting word often has common letters and distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.\n\n Some people use words like ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have common letters and no repeated letters.\n However, note that repeated letters are allowed in the word but in our feedback we must consider the frequency.\n\n Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll choose: SALET (which is a valid English word and is often used in word games) but note that Wordle words are typically common.\n Alternatively, I can use ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"".\n\n However, to be safe, I\'ll choose a word that is known to be effective: ""CRANE"".\n\n But note, the instruction says ""5-letter English word"" and it must be valid.\n\n Another popular word is ""IRATE"" or ""RAISE"".

Since it\'s marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are absent)\n- Contains A and E (since they are present)\n- And we should try to place A and E in positions that are not 2 and 5 respectively, but also in positions we haven\'t tried.\n\nMoreover, we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and three unknown letters. We should try to cover other common letters and avoid the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded letters: R, I, S.\n\nWe know the word has A and E. Let\'s think of words that have A and E, and don\'t have R, I, S.\n\nWe also have three positions to figure out. We should try to use other common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should also avoid repeating the positions we know are wrong for A and E.\n\nFor the second guess, we can try to put A in a different position and E in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (since it can\'t be 2, and we haven\'t tried others)\nSimilarly, for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (can\'t be 5)\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the exact positions, so we can try one possibility.\n\nAlso, we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn\'t show any, and we don\'t have evidence of repetition. However, we cannot rule it out.\n\nBut since we are early, let\'s assume no repetition for now.\n\nLet me list some candidate words that contain A and E, and avoid R, I, S.\n\nFor example:\n- ""LATEN"" - but is it a word? Not common. Maybe ""LATTE"" but has double T and no E? Wait, ""LATTE"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nBetter to use common words.\n\nConsider: ""PLATE"" -> contains P, L, A, T, E. \n- A is in position 3, E in position 5. But note: in the feedback, E was in position 5 and was wrong, so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, if we put E in position 5 again, it would be a waste? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal because we already know E is not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nIn ""PLATE"":\n- A is in position 3 (which is new) and E is in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So if we use ""PLATE"", we are putting E in a position we know it doesn\'t belong. That might not be efficient because we already know E isn\'t at position 5, so we won\'t get new information about E\'s position.\n\nWe should try to put E in a position we haven\'t tested: 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly for A: avoid position 2, so try 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""LEACH"" - but has H and C. Also, A is in position 3, E in position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H or C are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but has O, C, N. Also, A is in position 4 and E in position 3. But note: we have excluded R, I, S, but O, C, N are new.\n\nBut ""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we might want to test more consonants.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALERT"" - but has R which is excluded. So invalid.\n\n""LATER"": has R? Yes, R is excluded. So no.\n\n""TALON"": no E.\n\nWe need a word with A and E.\n\nLet me think: words with A and E, no R, I, S.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. \n  - A is in position 3, E in position 5. But again, E is in position 5 which we know is wrong.\n\n- ""LEANT"": has L, E, A, N, T. \n  - E in position 2, A in position 3. \n  - Positions: 1: L, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: T.\n  - This avoids position 5 for E and position 2 for A? \n    - A was in position 2 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is new. \n    - E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put E in position 2, which is new.\n\nSo ""LEANT"" seems good.\n\nBut is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of ""leaned"" or ""learnt"", but accepted as a word.\n\nAnother option: ""LEAPT"" - similar: L, E, A, P, T. E in 2, A in 3.\n\nOr ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T. E in 2, A in 3.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don\'t know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.\n\nSimilarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.\n\nWe also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.\n\nIn ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nAnother word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.\n\nWe should avoid E at 5.\n\nSo ""ADOBE"" is not good.\n\n""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.\n\nSo let\'s stick with words that have E not in position 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.\n\n""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.\n\n""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.\n\nSo without S, R, I.\n\n""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.\n\n""LEACH"" is a word.\n\nBut H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\n""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.\n\nBut Y is at the end, which might be common.\n\nAnother: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.\n\nBut W is not very common.\n\nI think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. \n- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).\n- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).\n- New letters: D, L, T.\n\nAlso, D, L, T are common consonants.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DEALT"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""DEALT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.\n\n""LEANT"" is also good.\n\nBut ""DEALT"" seems more common.\n\nAnother word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".\n\nNow, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").\n- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).\n- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).\n- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).\n- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:\n  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).\n  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.\n\nThe word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).\n- Excludes R, I, S.\n- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.\n- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.\n\n<guess>dealt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""dealt""\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word contains the letters A and E (from both guesses).\n2. The following letters are not in the word: R, I, S, D, L, T (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).\n3. A is not in position 2 (from ""raise"") and not in position 3 (from ""dealt""). So A must be in position 1 or 4 (since the word is 5 letters, and position 5 is not tested for A yet, but note E is also to be placed).\n4. E is not in position 5 (from ""raise"") and not in position 2 (from ""dealt""). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We know A and E are in the word, and they are distinct. So we need to assign them to positions without conflict.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are eliminated)\nPossible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are eliminated)\n\nBut if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 4, E could be in 1 or 3 (but not 4, unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out, but for now, let\'s assume no duplicates to keep it simple).\n\nSo the possible cases for A and E:\n\nCase 1: A in position 1, then E can be in 3 or 4.\nCase 2: A in position 4, then E can be in 1 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we have three more letters to find. We know the absent letters: R, I, S, D, L, T. So we must avoid these.\n\nWe need to think of common letters that are not excluded. The remaining letters in the alphabet (excluding vowels we know and the absent consonants) are:\n\nVowels: we have A and E, so other vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s see)\n\nConsonants: we have excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T. Note: I is a vowel, but excluded.\n\nAvailable consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut common ones: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.\n\nWe also know that the word must have three more letters besides A and E.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits the constraints.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that tests the possible positions for A and E and uses new common letters.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (A and E) and we need to place them in the allowed positions and choose the other three from the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, consider Case 1: A in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.\n\nIf A in 1, E in 3: then the word is A _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {R,I,S,D,L,T} and not A or E (unless duplicate, but we avoid for now).\n\nSimilarly, if A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _\n\nCase 2: A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A _\nOr A in 4, E in 3: _ E _ A _\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 and A in 4, for example.\n\nWe need to test these possibilities.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that covers as many of these cases as possible and uses common unused letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in the possible positions and includes other common letters to test.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: R, I, S, D, L, T.\n\nSo available: A, E, and then B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O and U are vowels, but we can use them.)\n\nBut we are focusing on positions.\n\nWe know A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be in 2 or 5, so E in 1,3,4.\n\nBut if we put A in 1, then E cannot be in 1, so E in 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if A in 4, then E in 1 or 3.\n\nNow, let\'s try to form words:\n\nOption: A in position 1, E in position 3: A _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks. For example, with common letters: A, then a consonant, then E, then two more.\n\nPossible words: \n- ACHEM? Not a word.\n- ACHE: only 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n- AWES: but S is excluded.\n- AGENT: G, E, N, T. But T is excluded (from dealt, T is x). So no.\n- AMEND: M, E, N, D. But D is excluded. No.\n- APERT: but R and T excluded.\n\nIt\'s tricky.\n\nAnother: A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _\n\nExamples:\n- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y. But E is in position 4? A B B E Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y. But E is in 4, which is allowed. But we have double B? And Y at end. Also, B and Y are available. But is ""ABBEY"" valid? Yes. But note: we have two B\'s, but that\'s okay if the secret word has B. However, we don\'t know.\n\nBut we are trying to test, so it might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word without duplicates.\n\n- AGAPE: A G A P E -> but A is repeated? And E is in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.\n\n- ALONE: but L is excluded.\n\n- ANODE: N, O, D, E. But D is excluded.\n\n- APEX: only 4 letters? A P E X -> 4 letters.\n\n- AWAKE: W, A, K, E. But A is in position 1, then W in 2, A in 3? But we have A in 1 and 3? That would be duplicate A. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates, so maybe not. But let\'s avoid for now.\n\nAWAKE: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E -> but E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.\n\n- ABASE: but S excluded.\n\n- ABATE: T excluded.\n\n- ACUTE: C, U, T, E. T excluded.\n\n- ADAGE: D excluded.\n\n- AFIRE: F, I, R, E. I and R excluded.\n\n- AGATE: G, A, T, E. T excluded.\n\n- ALIKE: L and I excluded.\n\n- AMUSE: M, U, S, E. S excluded.\n\n- ANIME: N, I, M, E. I excluded.\n\n- ARISE: R, I, S excluded.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with A in 1 and E in 4 without using excluded letters.\n\nNow, try A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ _\n\n- AGENT: G, E, N, T -> T excluded.\n- AMEND: M, E, N, D -> D excluded.\n- APERY: P, E, R, Y -> R excluded.\n- AVERT: V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.\n- AWFUL: W, F, U, L -> L excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nNow, consider Case 2: A in position 4.\n\nThen E can be in 1 or 3.\n\nFirst, E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _\n\nWords:\n- ECHOA: not a word.\n- ECLAT: E C L A T -> but L and T excluded.\n- EDEMA: E D E M A -> D excluded and duplicate E? \n- EGYPT: E G Y P T -> T excluded.\n- ELOHA: E L O H A -> L excluded.\n- ENEMA: E N E M A -> duplicate E? and M and N, but E is repeated. \n- ENOLA: E N O L A -> L excluded.\n- EPHOR: E P H O R -> R excluded.\n- ERUCA: E R U C A -> R excluded.\n- EVADE: E V A D E -> D excluded and duplicate E.\n\nNot finding good words.\n\nNow, E in 3 and A in 4: _ E _ A _\n\nWords:\n- BEAU: only 4 letters.\n- BLEAR: B L E A R -> L and R excluded.\n- CHEAP: C H E A P -> possible? C, H, E, A, P. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:P. \n  - This uses C, H, P which are available. \n  - And E is in 3, A in 4, which are allowed (E not in 2 or 5, A not in 2 or 3).\n\nSo ""CHEAP"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, other words:\n- CLEAN: C L E A N -> L excluded.\n- DREAM: D R E A M -> D and R excluded.\n- FLEAM: F L E A M -> L excluded.\n- GLEAM: G L E A M -> L excluded.\n- HEAVY: H E A V Y -> but A is in position 3? H E A V Y: 1:H, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:Y. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed because from ""dealt"", A was in position 3 and was marked wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""HEAVY"" has A in 3, which is invalid.\n\nIn ""CHEAP"", A is in position 4, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""PLEAD"": P L E A D -> L and D excluded.\n\n""QUEAN"": Q U E A N -> possible? 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. Q and U are less common, but valid.\n\n""STEAM"": S excluded.\n\n""WHEAT"": W H E A T -> T excluded.\n\nSo ""CHEAP"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother word: ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> but E is in position 3, A in 4. And O, C, N are available. But in ""OCEAN"", the positions: 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. \n- E is in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed). \n- And it uses O, C, N, which are not excluded.\n\nSo ""OCEAN"" is also a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"" are both options.\n\nWe can also consider ""BEACH"": but S? B E A C H -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:H. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and was wrong). So invalid.\n\n""PEACH"": P E A C H -> A in 3, invalid.\n\nSo back to ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"".\n\nWhich one to choose? Both test E in 3 and A in 4, and use new letters.\n\n""CHEAP"" uses C, H, P.\n""OCEAN"" uses O, C, N.\n\nBoth are good. But we might want to use more common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider if there is a word that tests A in position 1.\n\nFor example, A in 1 and E in 4: we had trouble, but let\'s find one.\n\n""AGLEE"": not common.\n""AGONE"": G, O, N, E. But E in 4? A G O N E -> 1:A, 2:G, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. But E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.\n\n""ALBEE"": L excluded.\n\nSo hard to find.\n\nAnother idea: A in 1 and E in 3: ""AXIOM"" but I and O? A X I O M -> I excluded.\n\n""AZOTE"": Z, O, T, E. T excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nSo perhaps the secret word has A in position 4 and E in position 3, as in ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".\n\nBut we also have the possibility of E in position 1 and A in position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tested that.\n\nFor example, a word like ""URAEI"" not 5 letters.\n\n""URAE"" no.\n\n""ENACT"": E N A C T -> but A in 3? E N A C T: 1:E, 2:N, 3:A, 4:C, 5:T. But A is in 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and wrong). Also, T excluded.\n\n""EXACT"": E X A C T -> A in 3, T excluded.\n\n""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> D excluded and duplicate E.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with E in 1 and A in 4 without using excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible is E in 3 and A in 4.\n\nSo we can go with ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".\n\nBut note: we also have the possibility of A in position 1 and E in position 4, but we couldn\'t find a common word. Or A in position 1 and E in position 3, also hard.\n\nAnother word for A in 1 and E in 3: ""AVERT"" but R and T excluded.\n\n""ASKEW"": S and K? A S K E W -> S excluded.\n\nSo I think we should test the E in 3 and A in 4 pattern.\n\nBetween ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"", which is better?\n\n""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E), so it might be vowel-heavy. ""CHEAP"" has consonants C, H, P.\n\nAlso, ""CHEAP"" uses H which is common, and P.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""CHEAP"" might be more common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: in Wordle, both are accepted.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEANO"" - B E A N O -> but E in 2? 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O. But E is in 2, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", E was in 2 and was wrong). So E cannot be in 2. Therefore, ""BEANO"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> L excluded.\n\nSo I think ""CHEAP"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: in ""CHEAP"", we have E in position 3 and A in position 4. We are testing if A is in 4 and E in 3.\n\nIf the secret word has A in 1, then this guess won\'t have A and E in the right positions, but we will get feedback.\n\nWe are trying to cover the most likely case.\n\nWe could choose a word that has A in 1 and E in 4, but we need to find one.\n\nAfter some thought, I found ""AGAPE"" but E is at 5, invalid.\n\n""ADOBE"" E at 5.\n\n""ABODE"" has E at 5 and D excluded.\n\n""AFORE"" R excluded.\n\nSo I think it\'s safe to go with ""CHEAP"".\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""CHEAP"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the secret word has A in 4 and E in 3, then in ""CHEAP"":\n- C: could be correct or not\n- H: same\n- E: in position 3, if the secret has E in 3, it would be ✓, else -\n- A: in position 4, if secret has A in 4, ✓, else -\n- P: ?\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in 1 to test that case.\n\nFor example, ""ANKHS"" not common.\n\n""ANODE"" D excluded.\n\n""APPLE"" P, P, L, E -> L excluded and duplicate P.\n\nNot good.\n\n""AROSE"" R and S excluded.\n\nSo I think ""CHEAP"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> but A in 2? 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N. But A is in position 2, which is not allowed (from ""raise"", A was in 2 and wrong). So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNAU"" not 5 letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHEAP"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CHEAP"" has C, H, E, A, P. None of R,I,S,D,L,T. So it\'s clean.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""CHEAP"".\n\nNow, return in the required format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)\n     - R, I, S are **absent** from the secret word.\n     - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n       - A is not in position 2.\n       - E is not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → Feedback: D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)\n     - D, L, T are **absent** from the secret word.\n     - E and A are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n       - E is not in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 2).\n       - A is not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 3).\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **Confirmed Letters**: A and E are in the secret word (from both guesses).\n   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.\n   - **Position Constraints**:\n     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1 or 4.\n     - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.\n   - Since A and E are distinct, they cannot occupy the same position. Possible valid (A, E) position pairs:\n     - A in 1, E in 3\n     - A in 1, E in 4\n     - A in 4, E in 1\n     - A in 4, E in 3\n   - The word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters are unknown. These must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters: available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Test the most likely position pairs for A and E while introducing new common letters to maximize information.\n   - Focus on the (A in 4, E in 3) pair, as it aligns with common English words and avoids positions ruled out by feedback.\n   - Avoid absent letters (R, I, S, D, L, T) and reuse A and E to confirm their positions.\n   - Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, H, P, N) to test new letters efficiently.\n   - After evaluating options like ""ocean"" (O, C, E, A, N) and ""cheap"" (C, H, E, A, P), ""cheap"" is selected because:\n     - It places E in position 3 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed).\n     - It uses common consonants C, H, P, which are untested and high-frequency.\n     - It avoids all absent letters and repeated letters.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If E is correctly in position 3, it will show ✓ for E.\n   - If A is correctly in position 4, it will show ✓ for A.\n   - Feedback for C, H, and P will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>cheap</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) A(-) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)  [so E is not in position 2]
- A: present, wrong position (-)  [so A is not in position 3]
- L: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""cheap""
- C: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 3
- A: present, but wrong position (-) [so A is not in position 4]
- P: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Absent Letters**: From all guesses, the absent letters are: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P. So the secret word does not contain any of these: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.

2. **Present Letters**:
   - E is in the word and is in position 3 (from ""cheap"" feedback: E(✓)).
   - A is in the word, but we know it's not in position 2 (from ""raise""), not in position 3 (from ""dealt""), and not in position 4 (from ""cheap""). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5.

3. **Position of E**: We know E is fixed at position 3.

4. **Position of A**: Since A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, it must be in position 1 or 5.

5. **Other Letters**: We need to find three more letters (since E is fixed at 3, and A is one of the other positions). The word has 5 letters, so:
   - If A is in position 1, then positions 2,4,5 are unknown.
   - If A is in position 5, then positions 1,2,4 are unknown.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: E (at 3) and A (at 1 or 5). So we need three more distinct letters (unless there are duplicates, but we haven't seen evidence of duplicates yet).

Available letters: We have excluded R,I,S,D,L,T,C,H,P. The remaining letters are: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We must choose a word that:
- Has E in position 3.
- Includes A, but not in positions 2,3,4 (so only 1 or 5).
- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).

Now, let's consider the two cases for A:

**Case 1: A in position 1**
- Word pattern: A _ E _ _
- We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from the available set (B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not repeating any absent letters.

**Case 2: A in position 5**
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ A
- We need to fill positions 1,2,4 with available letters.

We need to choose a guess that can test between these cases and also test new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to maximize information.

We can try to cover both cases in one guess? Or choose a word that fits one case and tests it.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and another that has A in position 5, but we can only guess one.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: A in position 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _

Possible words (using available letters):
- AWAKE? But K and W are available, but E is at 5? A W A K E -> but A repeated? And E at 5. But we have E fixed at 3, so this doesn't fit. We need E at 3: so A _ E _ _

Examples:
- ABEAM: A B E A M -> but A repeated? And M. But positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:E, 4:A? That would be A in 4, but we know A cannot be in 4. Also, duplicate A. Not good.
- ABELE: A B E L E -> but L is excluded, and E repeated.
- AGENE: A G E N E -> E repeated? And G, N. But E is at 3 and 5? But we have E fixed at 3, so position 5 is E? But in the word, it would be A G E N E. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, L not present? AGENE: G and N are available. But E is at 3 and 5? The pattern is A _ E _ E. But we have E at 3, and if E is also at 5, that's possible? But in feedback, we haven't seen E in other positions. But it's allowed. However, we have A in 1 and E in 3 and 5? But we are only required to have A and E, but E is already at 3. So if we have another E, it's okay.

But let's check the feedback: in ""raise"", E was present but not in 5, so if E is in 5, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""raise"", E was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in 5. So if E were in 5, it would have been marked as correct? But it was not, so E is not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word does not have E in position 5. So we cannot have E in position 5.

Similarly, from ""dealt"", E was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so E is not in 2.

Therefore, E is only in position 3. So no duplicate E? Not necessarily, but if there is a duplicate E, it cannot be in position 2 or 5. But we don't have evidence for duplicate, so we assume no duplicate for now.

So for Case 1: A _ E _ _ , with no E in 5, so position 5 cannot be E.

Similarly, for Case 2: _ _ E _ A, with no E in 2, so position 2 cannot be E.

Back to Case 1: A in 1, E in 3, then positions 2,4,5 must be filled with other available letters, not A or E (since A is only once, and E is at 3).

So A _ E _ _ , with positions 2,4,5: three distinct letters from available set.

Possible words:
- ABEAM: not, because A in 4 and duplicate.
- ABELE: L excluded.
- AGENE: E at 5? But E cannot be at 5, and also duplicate E.
- AGONE: A G O N E -> but E at 5? Not allowed. And O and N are available, but E at 5 is forbidden.
- AKEES: K, E, E, S -> S excluded and E duplicate and at 5? Not.
- ALECK: L excluded.

It's hard. Let's think of common words.

- AWAKE: A W A K E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.
- AWAVE: A W A V E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.
- AZOLE: L excluded.

Perhaps ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.

Not many common words fit.

""ABASE"": S excluded.

""ABATE"": T excluded.

""ACETA"": C excluded.

So Case 1 seems less likely.

Now Case 2: A in position 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A

Pattern: position 1,2,4 to fill with available letters.

Examples:
- BEA: not 5 letters.
- BREAD: R excluded.
- BREAK: R excluded.
- CLEAN: L excluded.
- DREAD: D and R excluded.
- FREAK: F R E A K -> R excluded.
- GLEAM: L excluded.
- OCEAN: O C E A N -> but C is excluded (from cheap, C:x). So invalid.
- WHEAT: H and T excluded.

We need to use available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words:
- BEAU: not 5.
- BEAUT: T excluded.
- BEAUX: B E A U X -> but E at 2? Pattern: if we have _ _ E _ A, then B in 1, E in 2? But E cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). So if we put E in 2, it would be wrong, but we know E is fixed at 3. So in this pattern, position 2 must not be E.

So for the word, position 3 is E, so position 2 is a different letter.

So for example, ""QUEUE"" not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> but E at 3 and 4? And E at 4: is that allowed? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible? From feedback, we only know E is not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4? But in this case, we have E at 3 (fixed) and also at 4? That would be duplicate E.

But in ""QUEEN"", positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. But we have E at 3 and 4. And A is not present? We need A in position 5? But here position 5 is N, not A. So not.

We need A in position 5.

So pattern: _ _ E _ A

With position 1,2,4 filled with available letters, not E (since E is only at 3), and not A (since A at 5), and not the absent letters.

Also, position 2 cannot be E (which it isn't), and position 4 can be anything except E? But E could be duplicate? But we don't know.

Assume no duplicate E for simplicity.

So positions 1,2,4: three distinct letters from available set.

Words:
- FJELD: not common, and J? F J E L D -> L and D excluded.
- MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E at 4? Pattern: M in 1, O in 2, N in 3? But we need E at 3, so position 3 must be E. So ""MONEY"" has E at 4, not 3. So not.

We need E at position 3.

So the word must have the third letter as E.

Examples of words ending with A, with E in position 3:

- UREA: not 5.
- UREMA: U R E M A -> R excluded.
- UVEAS: U V E A S -> S excluded.
- VENAE: V E N A E -> E at 2 and 5? But E at 2 is not allowed, and at 5 not allowed. Also, duplicate E.
- WACKO: no E.

After some thought, common words: 
- ""PIZZA"" but Z and A, but no E.

Not working.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" not.

Another idea: ""JUMBA"" no E.

Maybe we missed something.

What about ""BEAKY"": B E A K Y -> but E at 2? Not allowed.

""BEAKY"" has E at 2, which is forbidden.

""BEGEM"": B E G E M -> E at 2 and 4? Not allowed.

""BEMA"": not 5.

Perhaps ""FEMUR"": R excluded.

I think we need to consider that A might be in position 1.

But earlier for Case 1, we had trouble finding words.

Another possibility: perhaps there is a duplicate A? But we haven't seen evidence.

From feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked wrong, so if there is a duplicate A, it could be elsewhere, but we know A is not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5 for one A, and if duplicate, the other could be? But positions 1 and 5 are the only options, so if A is in both 1 and 5? But that would be the only possibility for duplicate.

But let's not go there yet.

Perhaps we missed a word for Case 1.

Let's list all possible words with A in 1, E in 3, and no E in 5, and no absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Word: A _ E _ _

With positions 2,4,5 filled with three distinct letters from above.

For example:
- AWAKE: not, E at 5.
- AGAPE: E at 5.
- AMAZE: Z, E at 5.
- ABEAM: duplicate A.
- How about ""AGENE""? E at 5 not allowed.

Perhaps ""AWEEN"": A W E E N -> E at 3 and 4? Duplicate E, and E at 4 is not forbidden? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible. But in ""aween"", positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. So E at 3 and 4. And A at 1. But is ""aween"" a word? It might be obscure.

Not common.

""AVINE"": V, I? I excluded.

""AXONE"": X, O, N, E -> but E at 5? A X O N E -> E at 5, not allowed.

So Case 1 seems difficult.

Now, back to Case 2: A in 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A

With positions 1,2,4 to fill.

We need a word like: X Y E Z A, where X,Y,Z are from available letters.

For example:
- BEA: not 5.
- Let's try ""QUEEN"" but no A at 5.
- ""BEIGE"" no A.
- ""JUMBA"" no E at 3.

After research in mind, common words: 
- ""OPERA"": O P E R A -> but P and R excluded.
- ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> R and T excluded.
- ""UNFED"": D excluded.

Not working.

""UMBER"": U M B E R -> R excluded.

""UMPED"": D excluded.

""UNAU"" not 5.

""VENOM"": V E N O M -> E at 2? Not allowed.

We need E at position 3.

So position 3 is E.

So for example, ""  E  A"" with A at 5.

Words:
- BAKED: D excluded.
- BAKER: R excluded.
- BANED: D excluded.
- BANER: R excluded.
- BASED: S and D excluded.
- BATED: T and D excluded.
- BEAUT: T excluded.
- BEEFY: B E E F Y -> E at 2 and 3? But E at 2 not allowed.
- BEFOG: B E F O G -> E at 2 not allowed.

Position 2 cannot be E, so the second letter is not E.

So for example, ""  X E Y A"" with X in 1, Y in 4.

Common words:
- ""QUEEN"" not.
- ""QUEER"" R excluded.
- ""QUEYS"": Q U E Y S -> S excluded.
- ""QUENA"": Q U E N A -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A. This fits! Q U E N A.

But is ""quena"" a valid word? It is a musical instrument, so it might be accepted.

Another: ""FIQUE"": F I Q U E -> I excluded.

""GUAVA"" no E.

""JUMAR"": R excluded.

""KARMA"" no E.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> but A in 2? M A U V E: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:V, 5:E. But we need A at 5, not E. And E at 5 is forbidden.

""NEWLY"" no A.

""OGEED"": O G E E D -> D excluded and E duplicate.

""OKEHS"": O K E H S -> H and S excluded.

""PEKOE"": P E K O E -> P excluded and E duplicate.

""PZAZZ"" no E.

""UMIAK"": U M I A K -> I excluded.

""UNBAN"": U N B A N -> but E not present? We need E at 3.

""VEGAN"": V E G A N -> E at 2 not allowed.

""VODKA"" no E.

""WACKO"" no E.

""YEAST"" E at 2 not allowed.

""YENTA"": Y E N T A -> E at 2 not allowed.

""ZEBRA"" R excluded.

So ""QUENA"" might be a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another word: ""BEMUD"" not common.

Perhaps ""FEMUR"" R excluded.

I think we need to consider that A might be in position 1, and we missed a word.

Let's try ""AGONE"" again, but E at 5 not allowed.

""AGONE"" has E at 5.

""AGENE"" has E at 5.

""AMINE"" M, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"" T excluded.

""ABUNA"" no E.

Perhaps ""AEGIS"" S and I excluded.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, like two A's.

For example, if A is in position 1 and also in position 5, then from feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked absent? No, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked ""-"", which means it is present but not in that position. So if there is a duplicate A, it could be that one A is in 1 or 5, and the other is not in 4.

But in ""raise"", A was in 2 and marked ""-"", so not in 2.

In ""dealt"", A in 3 and ""-"", not in 3.

So if there are two A's, they must be in positions 1 and 5.

So the word would be A _ E _ A

With position 2 and 4 to fill, and position 3 is E.

So pattern: A ? E ? A

With ? in 2 and 4.

And the letters must be from available set.

Also, position 2 cannot be E (already), and position 4 cannot be E (because E is at 3, and if duplicate, it could be, but we know E not in 4? No, we don't know that. We only know E not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4.

In ""cheap"", E is at 3, and we have no feedback on position 4 for E.

So E could be in 4 if duplicate.

But for now, for the A duplicate case, the word is A X E Y A.

With X and Y from available letters.

Words:
- AREA: not 5.
- AREAD: D excluded.
- AREAR: R excluded.
- AREAS: S excluded.
- AREFY: R excluded.
- ARENA: R excluded.
- ASEA: not 5.
- AVEDA: V, but E at 3? A V E D A -> D excluded.
- AWETA: W E T A -> T excluded.
- AZOFA: Z O F A -> no E.

Not common.

""AGEEA"" not a word.

So perhaps not.

Another possibility: the feedback might have been misinterpreted.

Let's list all the information again.

From guess 1: ""raise"" -> A and E are present, not in 2 and 5 respectively.

From guess 2: ""dealt"" -> A and E are present, not in 3 and 2 respectively. But E not in 2 we already knew.

From guess 3: ""cheap"" -> E is correct at position 3, A is present but not in 4.

So E is fixed at 3.

A is present, not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test whether A is in 1 or 5.

So we can choose a word that has A in 1 and one that has A in 5, but we can only do one.

So let's choose a word that has A in 1, for example, and uses new letters.

But earlier we had trouble, so let's find any word with A in 1 and E in 3.

For example, ""AKEES"" not.

""AGLEE"" L excluded.

""AMBER"" R excluded.

""ANKER"" R excluded.

""APTER"" R and T excluded.

""AVERT"" R and T excluded.

""AXMEN"" X, M, E, N -> A X M E N -> 1:A, 2:X, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N. But E is at 4, not 3. We need E at 3.

So not.

""AZURE"" U, R, E -> R excluded and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""AUMIL"" not common.

I think we need to consider ""QUEEN"" but no A.

Another idea: perhaps ""OAKED"" D excluded.

Let's list all 5-letter words with E in position 3 and A in the word, and no absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And A must be in 1 or 5.

So for A in 1: A _ E _ _

With the last two letters not E, and from available.

For example:
- A B E K A -> but A at 5, so ""ABEKA"" not a word.
- A B E N D -> D excluded.
- A B E T H -> T and H excluded.
- A B E W Y -> A B E W Y: 1:A,2:B,3:E,4:W,5:Y. Is ""abewy"" a word? No.
- A F E E R -> R excluded.
- A F E L L -> L excluded.
- A G E E K -> A G E E K: E at 3 and 4? ""ageek"" might be informal, but let's see. Positions: 1:A,2:G,3:E,4:E,5:K. But E at 4 is possible? We don't have evidence against E in 4. And ""ageek"" is in some dictionaries as a variant or slang. But might not be accepted.

But let's see if there are better.

- A G E M S -> S excluded.
- A G E N D -> D excluded.
- A G E S T -> S and T excluded.
- A J E E P -> P excluded.
- A K E N E -> E at 5 not allowed.
- A K E T O -> A K E T O: T excluded.
- A M E B A -> A M E B A: 1:A,2:M,3:E,4:B,5:A. This is ""ameba"", which is a valid word (variant of amoeba). And it has A at 1 and 5, and E at 3. And B and M are available letters.

So ""ameba"" is a possibility.

Similarly, for Case 2, we had ""quena"".

But ""ameba"" seems more common.

Also, in ""ameba"", the letters are A, M, E, B, A. So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:E, 4:B, 5:A.

Now, for our guess, we can use a word that tests this structure.

But we don't know if A is in 1 or 5.

We can guess ""ameba"" to test.

If we guess ""ameba"":
- If the secret word has A in 1, then position 1 A might be correct or not.
- But we know A is not in 2,3,4, so if it's in 1, it would be correct if the secret has A in 1.
- Similarly, if the secret has A in 5, then in ""ameba"", A at 5 would be correct.

But ""ameba"" has A at 1 and 5, so it covers both cases.

If the secret word has A only in 1, then in ""ameba"", A at 1 would be correct (✓), A at 5 might be absent or present but wrong position? But if the secret has only one A, then A at 5 would be absent if not present, or present but wrong position if there's a duplicate? But we don't know.

This might be messy.

Perhaps guess a word that has A only in position 1 or only in position 5.

For example, to test if A is in 1, guess a word with A in 1 and not in 5.

But earlier we couldn't find one with E in 3.

Another word: ""aweto"" not common.

""ameba"" might be our best shot.

Perhaps ""baned"" but D excluded.

Let's go with ""ameba"".

But ""ameba"" has M and B, which are available.

So for guess 4, we can guess ""ameba"".

Then based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see if there's a better word.

We can guess a word that has E in 3, and A in 5, for example.

Like ""quena"", but obscure.

Or ""bwana"": B W A N A -> no E.

Not.

""kwela"": K W E L A -> L excluded.

""pwned"": D excluded.

""vanda"": no E.

So ""ameba"" is a possibility.

Another common word: ""arena"" but R excluded.

""asana"" no E.

I think we should go with ""ameba"".

But let's confirm the letters: A, M, E, B, A.

M and B are not excluded.

So guess ""ameba"".

Then, in the feedback, we can see:
- If A in position 1 is correct, then ✓ for A at 1.
- E at 3 is already known correct, so ✓.
- A at 5: if the secret has A in 5, then ✓, else if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere, but we know A is only in 1 or 5, so if not in 5, then it must be in 1, but we have A in 1 already.

If the secret word has A only in position 1, then in ""ameba"":
- Position 1: A correct (✓)
- Position 2: M, could be correct or not
- Position 3: E correct (✓)
- Position 4: B, could be correct or not
- Position 5: A, since the secret has only one A and it's in 1, so A at 5 is not in the word, so (x)

Similarly, if the secret has A only in position 5, then:
- Position 1: A is not in the word (since only in 5), so (x)
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: A (✓)

If the secret has A in both 1 and 5, then both A's would be correct.

So the feedback will tell us.

Also, M and B will give information.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""ameba"".

But is ""ameba"" accepted in Wordle? I think so, as it's in the word list.

So for the fourth guess: ""ameba""

Return in format.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.
     - R, I, S are absent.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - E and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
     - D, L, T are absent.
   - **Guess 3: ""cheap""** → C(x), H(x), E(✓), A(-), P(x)
     - E is **correct and in position 3**.
     - A is in the word but not in position 4.
     - C, H, P are absent.

2. **Consolidate Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - E is fixed at position 3.
     - A is present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2), C, H, P (from Guess 3). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels O, U, Y).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word has E in position 3, and A in position 1 or 5. The remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 2, 4, 5, depending on A) must be filled with available letters.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Test the position of A (1 or 5) while maximizing information on new letters.
   - Choose a word with E in position 3, A in either position 1 or 5, and three new high-frequency consonants from the available set (e.g., M, B, N).
   - ""ameba"" (a valid English word, variant of ""amoeba"") fits perfectly:
     - Places E in position 3 (confirmed correct).
     - Places A in both position 1 and 5 to test the two possible cases for A:
       - If A is only in position 1, feedback will show A(✓) at 1 and A(x) at 5.
       - If A is only in position 5, feedback will show A(x) at 1 and A(✓) at 5.
       - If A is in both positions, both will be ✓.
     - Uses new letters M and B (position 2 and 4), which are common and untested.
     - Avoids all absent letters.
   - This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by resolving A's position and testing two new letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - Feedback for A at positions 1 and 5 will confirm the exact position of A.
   - Feedback for M and B will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.
   - E at position 3 is already confirmed, so it will show ✓.

<guess>ameba</guess>",ameba,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)  [so E is not in position 2]
- A: present, wrong position (-)  [so A is not in position 3]
- L: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""cheap""
- C: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 3
- A: present, but wrong position (-) [so A is not in position 4]
- P: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Absent Letters**: From all guesses, the absent letters are: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P. So the secret word does not contain any of these: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.

2. **Present Letters**:
   - E is in the word and is in position 3 (from ""cheap"" feedback: E(✓)).
   - A is in the word, but we know it's not in position 2 (from ""raise""), not in position 3 (from ""dealt""), and not in position 4 (from ""cheap""). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5.

3. **Position of E**: We know E is fixed at position 3.

4. **Position of A**: Since A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, it must be in position 1 or 5.

5. **Other Letters**: We need to find three more letters (since E is fixed at 3, and A is one of the other positions). The word has 5 letters, so:
   - If A is in position 1, then positions 2,4,5 are unknown.
   - If A is in position 5, then positions 1,2,4 are unknown.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: E (at 3) and A (at 1 or 5). So we need three more distinct letters (unless there are duplicates, but we haven't seen evidence of duplicates yet).

Available letters: We have excluded R,I,S,D,L,T,C,H,P. The remaining letters are: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We must choose a word that:
- Has E in position 3.
- Includes A, but not in positions 2,3,4 (so only 1 or 5).
- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).

Now, let's consider the two cases for A:

**Case 1: A in position 1**
- Word pattern: A _ E _ _
- We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from the available set (B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not repeating any absent letters.

**Case 2: A in position 5**
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ A
- We need to fill positions 1,2,4 with available letters.

We need to choose a guess that can test between these cases and also test new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to maximize information.

We can try to cover both cases in one guess? Or choose a word that fits one case and tests it.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and another that has A in position 5, but we can only guess one.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: A in position 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _

Possible words (using available letters):
- AWAKE? But K and W are available, but E is at 5? A W A K E -> but A repeated? And E at 5. But we have E fixed at 3, so this doesn't fit. We need E at 3: so A _ E _ _

Examples:
- ABEAM: A B E A M -> but A repeated? And M. But positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:E, 4:A? That would be A in 4, but we know A cannot be in 4. Also, duplicate A. Not good.
- ABELE: A B E L E -> but L is excluded, and E repeated.
- AGENE: A G E N E -> E repeated? And G, N. But E is at 3 and 5? But we have E fixed at 3, so position 5 is E? But in the word, it would be A G E N E. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, L not present? AGENE: G and N are available. But E is at 3 and 5? The pattern is A _ E _ E. But we have E at 3, and if E is also at 5, that's possible? But in feedback, we haven't seen E in other positions. But it's allowed. However, we have A in 1 and E in 3 and 5? But we are only required to have A and E, but E is already at 3. So if we have another E, it's okay.

But let's check the feedback: in ""raise"", E was present but not in 5, so if E is in 5, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""raise"", E was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in 5. So if E were in 5, it would have been marked as correct? But it was not, so E is not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word does not have E in position 5. So we cannot have E in position 5.

Similarly, from ""dealt"", E was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so E is not in 2.

Therefore, E is only in position 3. So no duplicate E? Not necessarily, but if there is a duplicate E, it cannot be in position 2 or 5. But we don't have evidence for duplicate, so we assume no duplicate for now.

So for Case 1: A _ E _ _ , with no E in 5, so position 5 cannot be E.

Similarly, for Case 2: _ _ E _ A, with no E in 2, so position 2 cannot be E.

Back to Case 1: A in 1, E in 3, then positions 2,4,5 must be filled with other available letters, not A or E (since A is only once, and E is at 3).

So A _ E _ _ , with positions 2,4,5: three distinct letters from available set.

Possible words:
- ABEAM: not, because A in 4 and duplicate.
- ABELE: L excluded.
- AGENE: E at 5? But E cannot be at 5, and also duplicate E.
- AGONE: A G O N E -> but E at 5? Not allowed. And O and N are available, but E at 5 is forbidden.
- AKEES: K, E, E, S -> S excluded and E duplicate and at 5? Not.
- ALECK: L excluded.

It's hard. Let's think of common words.

- AWAKE: A W A K E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.
- AWAVE: A W A V E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.
- AZOLE: L excluded.

Perhaps ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.

Not many common words fit.

""ABASE"": S excluded.

""ABATE"": T excluded.

""ACETA"": C excluded.

So Case 1 seems less likely.

Now Case 2: A in position 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A

Pattern: position 1,2,4 to fill with available letters.

Examples:
- BEA: not 5 letters.
- BREAD: R excluded.
- BREAK: R excluded.
- CLEAN: L excluded.
- DREAD: D and R excluded.
- FREAK: F R E A K -> R excluded.
- GLEAM: L excluded.
- OCEAN: O C E A N -> but C is excluded (from cheap, C:x). So invalid.
- WHEAT: H and T excluded.

We need to use available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words:
- BEAU: not 5.
- BEAUT: T excluded.
- BEAUX: B E A U X -> but E at 2? Pattern: if we have _ _ E _ A, then B in 1, E in 2? But E cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). So if we put E in 2, it would be wrong, but we know E is fixed at 3. So in this pattern, position 2 must not be E.

So for the word, position 3 is E, so position 2 is a different letter.

So for example, ""QUEUE"" not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> but E at 3 and 4? And E at 4: is that allowed? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible? From feedback, we only know E is not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4? But in this case, we have E at 3 (fixed) and also at 4? That would be duplicate E.

But in ""QUEEN"", positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. But we have E at 3 and 4. And A is not present? We need A in position 5? But here position 5 is N, not A. So not.

We need A in position 5.

So pattern: _ _ E _ A

With position 1,2,4 filled with available letters, not E (since E is only at 3), and not A (since A at 5), and not the absent letters.

Also, position 2 cannot be E (which it isn't), and position 4 can be anything except E? But E could be duplicate? But we don't know.

Assume no duplicate E for simplicity.

So positions 1,2,4: three distinct letters from available set.

Words:
- FJELD: not common, and J? F J E L D -> L and D excluded.
- MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E at 4? Pattern: M in 1, O in 2, N in 3? But we need E at 3, so position 3 must be E. So ""MONEY"" has E at 4, not 3. So not.

We need E at position 3.

So the word must have the third letter as E.

Examples of words ending with A, with E in position 3:

- UREA: not 5.
- UREMA: U R E M A -> R excluded.
- UVEAS: U V E A S -> S excluded.
- VENAE: V E N A E -> E at 2 and 5? But E at 2 is not allowed, and at 5 not allowed. Also, duplicate E.
- WACKO: no E.

After some thought, common words: 
- ""PIZZA"" but Z and A, but no E.

Not working.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" not.

Another idea: ""JUMBA"" no E.

Maybe we missed something.

What about ""BEAKY"": B E A K Y -> but E at 2? Not allowed.

""BEAKY"" has E at 2, which is forbidden.

""BEGEM"": B E G E M -> E at 2 and 4? Not allowed.

""BEMA"": not 5.

Perhaps ""FEMUR"": R excluded.

I think we need to consider that A might be in position 1.

But earlier for Case 1, we had trouble finding words.

Another possibility: perhaps there is a duplicate A? But we haven't seen evidence.

From feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked wrong, so if there is a duplicate A, it could be elsewhere, but we know A is not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5 for one A, and if duplicate, the other could be? But positions 1 and 5 are the only options, so if A is in both 1 and 5? But that would be the only possibility for duplicate.

But let's not go there yet.

Perhaps we missed a word for Case 1.

Let's list all possible words with A in 1, E in 3, and no E in 5, and no absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Word: A _ E _ _

With positions 2,4,5 filled with three distinct letters from above.

For example:
- AWAKE: not, E at 5.
- AGAPE: E at 5.
- AMAZE: Z, E at 5.
- ABEAM: duplicate A.
- How about ""AGENE""? E at 5 not allowed.

Perhaps ""AWEEN"": A W E E N -> E at 3 and 4? Duplicate E, and E at 4 is not forbidden? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible. But in ""aween"", positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. So E at 3 and 4. And A at 1. But is ""aween"" a word? It might be obscure.

Not common.

""AVINE"": V, I? I excluded.

""AXONE"": X, O, N, E -> but E at 5? A X O N E -> E at 5, not allowed.

So Case 1 seems difficult.

Now, back to Case 2: A in 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A

With positions 1,2,4 to fill.

We need a word like: X Y E Z A, where X,Y,Z are from available letters.

For example:
- BEA: not 5.
- Let's try ""QUEEN"" but no A at 5.
- ""BEIGE"" no A.
- ""JUMBA"" no E at 3.

After research in mind, common words: 
- ""OPERA"": O P E R A -> but P and R excluded.
- ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> R and T excluded.
- ""UNFED"": D excluded.

Not working.

""UMBER"": U M B E R -> R excluded.

""UMPED"": D excluded.

""UNAU"" not 5.

""VENOM"": V E N O M -> E at 2? Not allowed.

We need E at position 3.

So position 3 is E.

So for example, ""  E  A"" with A at 5.

Words:
- BAKED: D excluded.
- BAKER: R excluded.
- BANED: D excluded.
- BANER: R excluded.
- BASED: S and D excluded.
- BATED: T and D excluded.
- BEAUT: T excluded.
- BEEFY: B E E F Y -> E at 2 and 3? But E at 2 not allowed.
- BEFOG: B E F O G -> E at 2 not allowed.

Position 2 cannot be E, so the second letter is not E.

So for example, ""  X E Y A"" with X in 1, Y in 4.

Common words:
- ""QUEEN"" not.
- ""QUEER"" R excluded.
- ""QUEYS"": Q U E Y S -> S excluded.
- ""QUENA"": Q U E N A -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A. This fits! Q U E N A.

But is ""quena"" a valid word? It is a musical instrument, so it might be accepted.

Another: ""FIQUE"": F I Q U E -> I excluded.

""GUAVA"" no E.

""JUMAR"": R excluded.

""KARMA"" no E.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> but A in 2? M A U V E: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:V, 5:E. But we need A at 5, not E. And E at 5 is forbidden.

""NEWLY"" no A.

""OGEED"": O G E E D -> D excluded and E duplicate.

""OKEHS"": O K E H S -> H and S excluded.

""PEKOE"": P E K O E -> P excluded and E duplicate.

""PZAZZ"" no E.

""UMIAK"": U M I A K -> I excluded.

""UNBAN"": U N B A N -> but E not present? We need E at 3.

""VEGAN"": V E G A N -> E at 2 not allowed.

""VODKA"" no E.

""WACKO"" no E.

""YEAST"" E at 2 not allowed.

""YENTA"": Y E N T A -> E at 2 not allowed.

""ZEBRA"" R excluded.

So ""QUENA"" might be a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another word: ""BEMUD"" not common.

Perhaps ""FEMUR"" R excluded.

I think we need to consider that A might be in position 1, and we missed a word.

Let's try ""AGONE"" again, but E at 5 not allowed.

""AGONE"" has E at 5.

""AGENE"" has E at 5.

""AMINE"" M, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"" T excluded.

""ABUNA"" no E.

Perhaps ""AEGIS"" S and I excluded.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, like two A's.

For example, if A is in position 1 and also in position 5, then from feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked absent? No, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked ""-"", which means it is present but not in that position. So if there is a duplicate A, it could be that one A is in 1 or 5, and the other is not in 4.

But in ""raise"", A was in 2 and marked ""-"", so not in 2.

In ""dealt"", A in 3 and ""-"", not in 3.

So if there are two A's, they must be in positions 1 and 5.

So the word would be A _ E _ A

With position 2 and 4 to fill, and position 3 is E.

So pattern: A ? E ? A

With ? in 2 and 4.

And the letters must be from available set.

Also, position 2 cannot be E (already), and position 4 cannot be E (because E is at 3, and if duplicate, it could be, but we know E not in 4? No, we don't know that. We only know E not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4.

In ""cheap"", E is at 3, and we have no feedback on position 4 for E.

So E could be in 4 if duplicate.

But for now, for the A duplicate case, the word is A X E Y A.

With X and Y from available letters.

Words:
- AREA: not 5.
- AREAD: D excluded.
- AREAR: R excluded.
- AREAS: S excluded.
- AREFY: R excluded.
- ARENA: R excluded.
- ASEA: not 5.
- AVEDA: V, but E at 3? A V E D A -> D excluded.
- AWETA: W E T A -> T excluded.
- AZOFA: Z O F A -> no E.

Not common.

""AGEEA"" not a word.

So perhaps not.

Another possibility: the feedback might have been misinterpreted.

Let's list all the information again.

From guess 1: ""raise"" -> A and E are present, not in 2 and 5 respectively.

From guess 2: ""dealt"" -> A and E are present, not in 3 and 2 respectively. But E not in 2 we already knew.

From guess 3: ""cheap"" -> E is correct at position 3, A is present but not in 4.

So E is fixed at 3.

A is present, not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test whether A is in 1 or 5.

So we can choose a word that has A in 1 and one that has A in 5, but we can only do one.

So let's choose a word that has A in 1, for example, and uses new letters.

But earlier we had trouble, so let's find any word with A in 1 and E in 3.

For example, ""AKEES"" not.

""AGLEE"" L excluded.

""AMBER"" R excluded.

""ANKER"" R excluded.

""APTER"" R and T excluded.

""AVERT"" R and T excluded.

""AXMEN"" X, M, E, N -> A X M E N -> 1:A, 2:X, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N. But E is at 4, not 3. We need E at 3.

So not.

""AZURE"" U, R, E -> R excluded and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""AUMIL"" not common.

I think we need to consider ""QUEEN"" but no A.

Another idea: perhaps ""OAKED"" D excluded.

Let's list all 5-letter words with E in position 3 and A in the word, and no absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And A must be in 1 or 5.

So for A in 1: A _ E _ _

With the last two letters not E, and from available.

For example:
- A B E K A -> but A at 5, so ""ABEKA"" not a word.
- A B E N D -> D excluded.
- A B E T H -> T and H excluded.
- A B E W Y -> A B E W Y: 1:A,2:B,3:E,4:W,5:Y. Is ""abewy"" a word? No.
- A F E E R -> R excluded.
- A F E L L -> L excluded.
- A G E E K -> A G E E K: E at 3 and 4? ""ageek"" might be informal, but let's see. Positions: 1:A,2:G,3:E,4:E,5:K. But E at 4 is possible? We don't have evidence against E in 4. And ""ageek"" is in some dictionaries as a variant or slang. But might not be accepted.

But let's see if there are better.

- A G E M S -> S excluded.
- A G E N D -> D excluded.
- A G E S T -> S and T excluded.
- A J E E P -> P excluded.
- A K E N E -> E at 5 not allowed.
- A K E T O -> A K E T O: T excluded.
- A M E B A -> A M E B A: 1:A,2:M,3:E,4:B,5:A. This is ""ameba"", which is a valid word (variant of amoeba). And it has A at 1 and 5, and E at 3. And B and M are available letters.

So ""ameba"" is a possibility.

Similarly, for Case 2, we had ""quena"".

But ""ameba"" seems more common.

Also, in ""ameba"", the letters are A, M, E, B, A. So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:E, 4:B, 5:A.

Now, for our guess, we can use a word that tests this structure.

But we don't know if A is in 1 or 5.

We can guess ""ameba"" to test.

If we guess ""ameba"":
- If the secret word has A in 1, then position 1 A might be correct or not.
- But we know A is not in 2,3,4, so if it's in 1, it would be correct if the secret has A in 1.
- Similarly, if the secret has A in 5, then in ""ameba"", A at 5 would be correct.

But ""ameba"" has A at 1 and 5, so it covers both cases.

If the secret word has A only in 1, then in ""ameba"", A at 1 would be correct (✓), A at 5 might be absent or present but wrong position? But if the secret has only one A, then A at 5 would be absent if not present, or present but wrong position if there's a duplicate? But we don't know.

This might be messy.

Perhaps guess a word that has A only in position 1 or only in position 5.

For example, to test if A is in 1, guess a word with A in 1 and not in 5.

But earlier we couldn't find one with E in 3.

Another word: ""aweto"" not common.

""ameba"" might be our best shot.

Perhaps ""baned"" but D excluded.

Let's go with ""ameba"".

But ""ameba"" has M and B, which are available.

So for guess 4, we can guess ""ameba"".

Then based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see if there's a better word.

We can guess a word that has E in 3, and A in 5, for example.

Like ""quena"", but obscure.

Or ""bwana"": B W A N A -> no E.

Not.

""kwela"": K W E L A -> L excluded.

""pwned"": D excluded.

""vanda"": no E.

So ""ameba"" is a possibility.

Another common word: ""arena"" but R excluded.

""asana"" no E.

I think we should go with ""ameba"".

But let's confirm the letters: A, M, E, B, A.

M and B are not excluded.

So guess ""ameba"".

Then, in the feedback, we can see:
- If A in position 1 is correct, then ✓ for A at 1.
- E at 3 is already known correct, so ✓.
- A at 5: if the secret has A in 5, then ✓, else if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere, but we know A is only in 1 or 5, so if not in 5, then it must be in 1, but we have A in 1 already.

If the secret word has A only in position 1, then in ""ameba"":
- Position 1: A correct (✓)
- Position 2: M, could be correct or not
- Position 3: E correct (✓)
- Position 4: B, could be correct or not
- Position 5: A, since the secret has only one A and it's in 1, so A at 5 is not in the word, so (x)

Similarly, if the secret has A only in position 5, then:
- Position 1: A is not in the word (since only in 5), so (x)
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: A (✓)

If the secret has A in both 1 and 5, then both A's would be correct.

So the feedback will tell us.

Also, M and B will give information.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""ameba"".

But is ""ameba"" accepted in Wordle? I think so, as it's in the word list.

So for the fourth guess: ""ameba""

Return in format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.
     - R, I, S are absent.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - E and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
     - D, L, T are absent.
   - **Guess 3: ""cheap""** → C(x), H(x), E(✓), A(-), P(x)
     - E is **correct and in position 3**.
     - A is in the word but not in position 4.
     - C, H, P are absent.

2. **Consolidate Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - E is fixed at position 3.
     - A is present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2), C, H, P (from Guess 3). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels O, U, Y).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word has E in position 3, and A in position 1 or 5. The remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 2, 4, 5, depending on A) must be filled with available letters.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Test the position of A (1 or 5) while maximizing information on new letters.
   - Choose a word with E in position 3, A in either position 1 or 5, and three new high-frequency consonants from the available set (e.g., M, B, N).
   - ""ameba"" (a valid English word, variant of ""amoeba"") fits perfectly:
     - Places E in position 3 (confirmed correct).
     - Places A in both position 1 and 5 to test the two possible cases for A:
       - If A is only in position 1, feedback will show A(✓) at 1 and A(x) at 5.
       - If A is only in position 5, feedback will show A(x) at 1 and A(✓) at 5.
       - If A is in both positions, both will be ✓.
     - Uses new letters M and B (position 2 and 4), which are common and untested.
     - Avoids all absent letters.
   - This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by resolving A's position and testing two new letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - Feedback for A at positions 1 and 5 will confirm the exact position of A.
   - Feedback for M and B will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.
   - E at position 3 is already confirmed, so it will show ✓.",Guess 4: ameba -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(✓) E(✓) B(x) A(✓),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We need to choose a word that gives us as much information as possible. A good starting word often has common letters and distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.

 Some people use words like ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have common letters and no repeated letters.
 However, note that repeated letters are allowed in the word but in our feedback we must consider the frequency.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose: SALET (which is a valid English word and is often used in word games) but note that Wordle words are typically common.
 Alternatively, I can use ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose a word that is known to be effective: ""CRANE"".

 But note, the instruction says ""5-letter English word"" and it must be valid.

 Another popular word is ""IRATE"" or ""RAISE"". I think ""RAISE"" is a good option because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's pick one that has been proven statistically: ""CRATE"" might be even better because C is also common.

 Actually, let's choose ""ROATE"". Is it a valid word? It is a financial term. But if the system requires common words, then I might choose ""TRACE"".

 Since we don't know the dictionary, we'll pick a common word.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"".

 Guess: RAISE

 Let me check the letters: R, A, I, S, E -> all distinct.

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: We are making the first guess. So the feedback will come after.

 Therefore, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".

 Now, return the guess in the required format.I'm starting a new game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to cover more possibilities. 

After considering options like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE,"" I'm selecting ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S), covering frequent English letters.
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback on each position.
- It ranks high in statistical effectiveness according to Wordle-solving datasets.

This guess will help identify included letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Also, note that A was in position 2 of ""raise"" (if we number positions 1 to 5). Since it's marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are absent)
- Contains A and E (since they are present)
- And we should try to place A and E in positions that are not 2 and 5 respectively, but also in positions we haven't tried.

Moreover, we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and three unknown letters. We should try to cover other common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: R, I, S.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that have A and E, and don't have R, I, S.

We also have three positions to figure out. We should try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also avoid repeating the positions we know are wrong for A and E.

For the second guess, we can try to put A in a different position and E in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (since it can't be 2, and we haven't tried others)
Similarly, for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (can't be 5)

But note: we don't know the exact positions, so we can try one possibility.

Also, we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of repetition. However, we cannot rule it out.

But since we are early, let's assume no repetition for now.

Let me list some candidate words that contain A and E, and avoid R, I, S.

For example:
- ""LATEN"" - but is it a word? Not common. Maybe ""LATTE"" but has double T and no E? Wait, ""LATTE"" doesn't have E.

Better to use common words.

Consider: ""PLATE"" -> contains P, L, A, T, E. 
- A is in position 3, E in position 5. But note: in the feedback, E was in position 5 and was wrong, so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, if we put E in position 5 again, it would be a waste? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal because we already know E is not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PLATE"":
- A is in position 3 (which is new) and E is in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So if we use ""PLATE"", we are putting E in a position we know it doesn't belong. That might not be efficient because we already know E isn't at position 5, so we won't get new information about E's position.

We should try to put E in a position we haven't tested: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly for A: avoid position 2, so try 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""LEACH"" - but has H and C. Also, A is in position 3, E in position 2.

But we don't know if H or C are in the word.

Alternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but has O, C, N. Also, A is in position 4 and E in position 3. But note: we have excluded R, I, S, but O, C, N are new.

But ""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we might want to test more consonants.

Another common word: ""ALERT"" - but has R which is excluded. So invalid.

""LATER"": has R? Yes, R is excluded. So no.

""TALON"": no E.

We need a word with A and E.

Let me think: words with A and E, no R, I, S.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. 
  - A is in position 3, E in position 5. But again, E is in position 5 which we know is wrong.

- ""LEANT"": has L, E, A, N, T. 
  - E in position 2, A in position 3. 
  - Positions: 1: L, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: T.
  - This avoids position 5 for E and position 2 for A? 
    - A was in position 2 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is new. 
    - E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put E in position 2, which is new.

So ""LEANT"" seems good.

But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of ""leaned"" or ""learnt"", but accepted as a word.

Another option: ""LEAPT"" - similar: L, E, A, P, T. E in 2, A in 3.

Or ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T. E in 2, A in 3.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don't know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.

Similarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.

We also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.

In ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.

Both are good.

Another word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.

We should avoid E at 5.

So ""ADOBE"" is not good.

""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.

So let's stick with words that have E not in position 5.

Another candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.

""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.

""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.

So without S, R, I.

""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.

""LEACH"" is a word.

But H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.

But Y is at the end, which might be common.

Another: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.

But W is not very common.

I think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. 
- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven't tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).
- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).
- New letters: D, L, T.

Also, D, L, T are common consonants.

So I'll go with ""DEALT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.

So let's choose ""DEALT"".

We can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.

""LEANT"" is also good.

But ""DEALT"" seems more common.

Another word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".

Now, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).
- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).
- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).
- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:
  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).
  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.

The word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).
- Excludes R, I, S.
- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.
- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.

<guess>dealt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- L: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters A and E (from both guesses).
2. The following letters are not in the word: R, I, S, D, L, T (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).
3. A is not in position 2 (from ""raise"") and not in position 3 (from ""dealt""). So A must be in position 1 or 4 (since the word is 5 letters, and position 5 is not tested for A yet, but note E is also to be placed).
4. E is not in position 5 (from ""raise"") and not in position 2 (from ""dealt""). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know A and E are in the word, and they are distinct. So we need to assign them to positions without conflict.

Possible positions for A: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are eliminated)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are eliminated)

But if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 4, E could be in 1 or 3 (but not 4, unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out, but for now, let's assume no duplicates to keep it simple).

So the possible cases for A and E:

Case 1: A in position 1, then E can be in 3 or 4.
Case 2: A in position 4, then E can be in 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have three more letters to find. We know the absent letters: R, I, S, D, L, T. So we must avoid these.

We need to think of common letters that are not excluded. The remaining letters in the alphabet (excluding vowels we know and the absent consonants) are:

Vowels: we have A and E, so other vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's see)

Consonants: we have excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T. Note: I is a vowel, but excluded.

Available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But common ones: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

We also know that the word must have three more letters besides A and E.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the constraints.

We can try to guess a word that tests the possible positions for A and E and uses new common letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and E) and we need to place them in the allowed positions and choose the other three from the available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, consider Case 1: A in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.

If A in 1, E in 3: then the word is A _ E _ _

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {R,I,S,D,L,T} and not A or E (unless duplicate, but we avoid for now).

Similarly, if A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Case 2: A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A _
Or A in 4, E in 3: _ E _ A _

But note: we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 and A in 4, for example.

We need to test these possibilities.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that covers as many of these cases as possible and uses common unused letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in the possible positions and includes other common letters to test.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T.

So available: A, E, and then B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O and U are vowels, but we can use them.)

But we are focusing on positions.

We know A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, E cannot be in 2 or 5, so E in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in 1, then E cannot be in 1, so E in 3 or 4.

Similarly, if A in 4, then E in 1 or 3.

Now, let's try to form words:

Option: A in position 1, E in position 3: A _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks. For example, with common letters: A, then a consonant, then E, then two more.

Possible words: 
- ACHEM? Not a word.
- ACHE: only 4 letters? No, we need 5.
- AWES: but S is excluded.
- AGENT: G, E, N, T. But T is excluded (from dealt, T is x). So no.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D. But D is excluded. No.
- APERT: but R and T excluded.

It's tricky.

Another: A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _

Examples:
- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y. But E is in position 4? A B B E Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y. But E is in 4, which is allowed. But we have double B? And Y at end. Also, B and Y are available. But is ""ABBEY"" valid? Yes. But note: we have two B's, but that's okay if the secret word has B. However, we don't know.

But we are trying to test, so it might be acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word without duplicates.

- AGAPE: A G A P E -> but A is repeated? And E is in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

- ALONE: but L is excluded.

- ANODE: N, O, D, E. But D is excluded.

- APEX: only 4 letters? A P E X -> 4 letters.

- AWAKE: W, A, K, E. But A is in position 1, then W in 2, A in 3? But we have A in 1 and 3? That would be duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so maybe not. But let's avoid for now.

AWAKE: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E -> but E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

- ABASE: but S excluded.

- ABATE: T excluded.

- ACUTE: C, U, T, E. T excluded.

- ADAGE: D excluded.

- AFIRE: F, I, R, E. I and R excluded.

- AGATE: G, A, T, E. T excluded.

- ALIKE: L and I excluded.

- AMUSE: M, U, S, E. S excluded.

- ANIME: N, I, M, E. I excluded.

- ARISE: R, I, S excluded.

So it's hard to find a word with A in 1 and E in 4 without using excluded letters.

Now, try A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ _

- AGENT: G, E, N, T -> T excluded.
- AMEND: M, E, N, D -> D excluded.
- APERY: P, E, R, Y -> R excluded.
- AVERT: V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.
- AWFUL: W, F, U, L -> L excluded.

Not working.

Now, consider Case 2: A in position 4.

Then E can be in 1 or 3.

First, E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _

Words:
- ECHOA: not a word.
- ECLAT: E C L A T -> but L and T excluded.
- EDEMA: E D E M A -> D excluded and duplicate E? 
- EGYPT: E G Y P T -> T excluded.
- ELOHA: E L O H A -> L excluded.
- ENEMA: E N E M A -> duplicate E? and M and N, but E is repeated. 
- ENOLA: E N O L A -> L excluded.
- EPHOR: E P H O R -> R excluded.
- ERUCA: E R U C A -> R excluded.
- EVADE: E V A D E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

Not finding good words.

Now, E in 3 and A in 4: _ E _ A _

Words:
- BEAU: only 4 letters.
- BLEAR: B L E A R -> L and R excluded.
- CHEAP: C H E A P -> possible? C, H, E, A, P. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:P. 
  - This uses C, H, P which are available. 
  - And E is in 3, A in 4, which are allowed (E not in 2 or 5, A not in 2 or 3).

So ""CHEAP"" is a candidate.

Similarly, other words:
- CLEAN: C L E A N -> L excluded.
- DREAM: D R E A M -> D and R excluded.
- FLEAM: F L E A M -> L excluded.
- GLEAM: G L E A M -> L excluded.
- HEAVY: H E A V Y -> but A is in position 3? H E A V Y: 1:H, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:Y. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed because from ""dealt"", A was in position 3 and was marked wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""HEAVY"" has A in 3, which is invalid.

In ""CHEAP"", A is in position 4, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLEAD"": P L E A D -> L and D excluded.

""QUEAN"": Q U E A N -> possible? 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. Q and U are less common, but valid.

""STEAM"": S excluded.

""WHEAT"": W H E A T -> T excluded.

So ""CHEAP"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> but E is in position 3, A in 4. And O, C, N are available. But in ""OCEAN"", the positions: 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. 
- E is in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed). 
- And it uses O, C, N, which are not excluded.

So ""OCEAN"" is also a candidate.

Similarly, ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"" are both options.

We can also consider ""BEACH"": but S? B E A C H -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:H. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and was wrong). So invalid.

""PEACH"": P E A C H -> A in 3, invalid.

So back to ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"".

Which one to choose? Both test E in 3 and A in 4, and use new letters.

""CHEAP"" uses C, H, P.
""OCEAN"" uses O, C, N.

Both are good. But we might want to use more common letters.

Alternatively, we can consider if there is a word that tests A in position 1.

For example, A in 1 and E in 4: we had trouble, but let's find one.

""AGLEE"": not common.
""AGONE"": G, O, N, E. But E in 4? A G O N E -> 1:A, 2:G, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. But E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.

""ALBEE"": L excluded.

So hard to find.

Another idea: A in 1 and E in 3: ""AXIOM"" but I and O? A X I O M -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"": Z, O, T, E. T excluded.

Not working.

So perhaps the secret word has A in position 4 and E in position 3, as in ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But we also have the possibility of E in position 1 and A in position 4.

We haven't tested that.

For example, a word like ""URAEI"" not 5 letters.

""URAE"" no.

""ENACT"": E N A C T -> but A in 3? E N A C T: 1:E, 2:N, 3:A, 4:C, 5:T. But A is in 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and wrong). Also, T excluded.

""EXACT"": E X A C T -> A in 3, T excluded.

""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> D excluded and duplicate E.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in 1 and A in 4 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most plausible is E in 3 and A in 4.

So we can go with ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".

But note: we also have the possibility of A in position 1 and E in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. Or A in position 1 and E in position 3, also hard.

Another word for A in 1 and E in 3: ""AVERT"" but R and T excluded.

""ASKEW"": S and K? A S K E W -> S excluded.

So I think we should test the E in 3 and A in 4 pattern.

Between ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"", which is better?

""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E), so it might be vowel-heavy. ""CHEAP"" has consonants C, H, P.

Also, ""CHEAP"" uses H which is common, and P.

But both are valid.

We can also consider ""CHEAP"" might be more common.

But let's see the frequency: in Wordle, both are accepted.

Another candidate: ""BEANO"" - B E A N O -> but E in 2? 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O. But E is in 2, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", E was in 2 and was wrong). So E cannot be in 2. Therefore, ""BEANO"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> L excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""CHEAP"", we have E in position 3 and A in position 4. We are testing if A is in 4 and E in 3.

If the secret word has A in 1, then this guess won't have A and E in the right positions, but we will get feedback.

We are trying to cover the most likely case.

We could choose a word that has A in 1 and E in 4, but we need to find one.

After some thought, I found ""AGAPE"" but E is at 5, invalid.

""ADOBE"" E at 5.

""ABODE"" has E at 5 and D excluded.

""AFORE"" R excluded.

So I think it's safe to go with ""CHEAP"".

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHEAP"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has A in 4 and E in 3, then in ""CHEAP"":
- C: could be correct or not
- H: same
- E: in position 3, if the secret has E in 3, it would be ✓, else -
- A: in position 4, if secret has A in 4, ✓, else -
- P: ?

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in 1 to test that case.

For example, ""ANKHS"" not common.

""ANODE"" D excluded.

""APPLE"" P, P, L, E -> L excluded and duplicate P.

Not good.

""AROSE"" R and S excluded.

So I think ""CHEAP"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> but A in 2? 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N. But A is in position 2, which is not allowed (from ""raise"", A was in 2 and wrong). So invalid.

Similarly, ""UNAU"" not 5 letters.

So I'll go with ""CHEAP"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CHEAP"" has C, H, E, A, P. None of R,I,S,D,L,T. So it's clean.

Therefore, the third guess is ""CHEAP"".

Now, return in the required format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - R, I, S are **absent** from the secret word.
     - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - A is not in position 2.
       - E is not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → Feedback: D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - D, L, T are **absent** from the secret word.
     - E and A are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
       - E is not in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 2).
       - A is not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 3).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**: A and E are in the secret word (from both guesses).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1 or 4.
     - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
   - Since A and E are distinct, they cannot occupy the same position. Possible valid (A, E) position pairs:
     - A in 1, E in 3
     - A in 1, E in 4
     - A in 4, E in 1
     - A in 4, E in 3
   - The word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters are unknown. These must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters: available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test the most likely position pairs for A and E while introducing new common letters to maximize information.
   - Focus on the (A in 4, E in 3) pair, as it aligns with common English words and avoids positions ruled out by feedback.
   - Avoid absent letters (R, I, S, D, L, T) and reuse A and E to confirm their positions.
   - Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, H, P, N) to test new letters efficiently.
   - After evaluating options like ""ocean"" (O, C, E, A, N) and ""cheap"" (C, H, E, A, P), ""cheap"" is selected because:
     - It places E in position 3 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed).
     - It uses common consonants C, H, P, which are untested and high-frequency.
     - It avoids all absent letters and repeated letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E is correctly in position 3, it will show ✓ for E.
   - If A is correctly in position 4, it will show ✓ for A.
   - Feedback for C, H, and P will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

Guess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)
Guess 3: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) A(-) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)  [so E is not in position 2]
- A: present, wrong position (-)  [so A is not in position 3]
- L: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""cheap""
- C: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 3
- A: present, but wrong position (-) [so A is not in position 4]
- P: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Absent Letters**: From all guesses, the absent letters are: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P. So the secret word does not contain any of these: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.

2. **Present Letters**:
   - E is in the word and is in position 3 (from ""cheap"" feedback: E(✓)).
   - A is in the word, but we know it's not in position 2 (from ""raise""), not in position 3 (from ""dealt""), and not in position 4 (from ""cheap""). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5.

3. **Position of E**: We know E is fixed at position 3.

4. **Position of A**: Since A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, it must be in position 1 or 5.

5. **Other Letters**: We need to find three more letters (since E is fixed at 3, and A is one of the other positions). The word has 5 letters, so:
   - If A is in position 1, then positions 2,4,5 are unknown.
   - If A is in position 5, then positions 1,2,4 are unknown.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: E (at 3) and A (at 1 or 5). So we need three more distinct letters (unless there are duplicates, but we haven't seen evidence of duplicates yet).

Available letters: We have excluded R,I,S,D,L,T,C,H,P. The remaining letters are: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We must choose a word that:
- Has E in position 3.
- Includes A, but not in positions 2,3,4 (so only 1 or 5).
- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).

Now, let's consider the two cases for A:

**Case 1: A in position 1**
- Word pattern: A _ E _ _
- We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from the available set (B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not repeating any absent letters.

**Case 2: A in position 5**
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ A
- We need to fill positions 1,2,4 with available letters.

We need to choose a guess that can test between these cases and also test new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to maximize information.

We can try to cover both cases in one guess? Or choose a word that fits one case and tests it.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and another that has A in position 5, but we can only guess one.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: A in position 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _

Possible words (using available letters):
- AWAKE? But K and W are available, but E is at 5? A W A K E -> but A repeated? And E at 5. But we have E fixed at 3, so this doesn't fit. We need E at 3: so A _ E _ _

Examples:
- ABEAM: A B E A M -> but A repeated? And M. But positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:E, 4:A? That would be A in 4, but we know A cannot be in 4. Also, duplicate A. Not good.
- ABELE: A B E L E -> but L is excluded, and E repeated.
- AGENE: A G E N E -> E repeated? And G, N. But E is at 3 and 5? But we have E fixed at 3, so position 5 is E? But in the word, it would be A G E N E. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, L not present? AGENE: G and N are available. But E is at 3 and 5? The pattern is A _ E _ E. But we have E at 3, and if E is also at 5, that's possible? But in feedback, we haven't seen E in other positions. But it's allowed. However, we have A in 1 and E in 3 and 5? But we are only required to have A and E, but E is already at 3. So if we have another E, it's okay.

But let's check the feedback: in ""raise"", E was present but not in 5, so if E is in 5, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""raise"", E was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in 5. So if E were in 5, it would have been marked as correct? But it was not, so E is not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word does not have E in position 5. So we cannot have E in position 5.

Similarly, from ""dealt"", E was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so E is not in 2.

Therefore, E is only in position 3. So no duplicate E? Not necessarily, but if there is a duplicate E, it cannot be in position 2 or 5. But we don't have evidence for duplicate, so we assume no duplicate for now.

So for Case 1: A _ E _ _ , with no E in 5, so position 5 cannot be E.

Similarly, for Case 2: _ _ E _ A, with no E in 2, so position 2 cannot be E.

Back to Case 1: A in 1, E in 3, then positions 2,4,5 must be filled with other available letters, not A or E (since A is only once, and E is at 3).

So A _ E _ _ , with positions 2,4,5: three distinct letters from available set.

Possible words:
- ABEAM: not, because A in 4 and duplicate.
- ABELE: L excluded.
- AGENE: E at 5? But E cannot be at 5, and also duplicate E.
- AGONE: A G O N E -> but E at 5? Not allowed. And O and N are available, but E at 5 is forbidden.
- AKEES: K, E, E, S -> S excluded and E duplicate and at 5? Not.
- ALECK: L excluded.

It's hard. Let's think of common words.

- AWAKE: A W A K E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.
- AWAVE: A W A V E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.
- AZOLE: L excluded.

Perhaps ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.

Not many common words fit.

""ABASE"": S excluded.

""ABATE"": T excluded.

""ACETA"": C excluded.

So Case 1 seems less likely.

Now Case 2: A in position 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A

Pattern: position 1,2,4 to fill with available letters.

Examples:
- BEA: not 5 letters.
- BREAD: R excluded.
- BREAK: R excluded.
- CLEAN: L excluded.
- DREAD: D and R excluded.
- FREAK: F R E A K -> R excluded.
- GLEAM: L excluded.
- OCEAN: O C E A N -> but C is excluded (from cheap, C:x). So invalid.
- WHEAT: H and T excluded.

We need to use available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words:
- BEAU: not 5.
- BEAUT: T excluded.
- BEAUX: B E A U X -> but E at 2? Pattern: if we have _ _ E _ A, then B in 1, E in 2? But E cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). So if we put E in 2, it would be wrong, but we know E is fixed at 3. So in this pattern, position 2 must not be E.

So for the word, position 3 is E, so position 2 is a different letter.

So for example, ""QUEUE"" not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> but E at 3 and 4? And E at 4: is that allowed? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible? From feedback, we only know E is not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4? But in this case, we have E at 3 (fixed) and also at 4? That would be duplicate E.

But in ""QUEEN"", positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. But we have E at 3 and 4. And A is not present? We need A in position 5? But here position 5 is N, not A. So not.

We need A in position 5.

So pattern: _ _ E _ A

With position 1,2,4 filled with available letters, not E (since E is only at 3), and not A (since A at 5), and not the absent letters.

Also, position 2 cannot be E (which it isn't), and position 4 can be anything except E? But E could be duplicate? But we don't know.

Assume no duplicate E for simplicity.

So positions 1,2,4: three distinct letters from available set.

Words:
- FJELD: not common, and J? F J E L D -> L and D excluded.
- MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E at 4? Pattern: M in 1, O in 2, N in 3? But we need E at 3, so position 3 must be E. So ""MONEY"" has E at 4, not 3. So not.

We need E at position 3.

So the word must have the third letter as E.

Examples of words ending with A, with E in position 3:

- UREA: not 5.
- UREMA: U R E M A -> R excluded.
- UVEAS: U V E A S -> S excluded.
- VENAE: V E N A E -> E at 2 and 5? But E at 2 is not allowed, and at 5 not allowed. Also, duplicate E.
- WACKO: no E.

After some thought, common words: 
- ""PIZZA"" but Z and A, but no E.

Not working.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" not.

Another idea: ""JUMBA"" no E.

Maybe we missed something.

What about ""BEAKY"": B E A K Y -> but E at 2? Not allowed.

""BEAKY"" has E at 2, which is forbidden.

""BEGEM"": B E G E M -> E at 2 and 4? Not allowed.

""BEMA"": not 5.

Perhaps ""FEMUR"": R excluded.

I think we need to consider that A might be in position 1.

But earlier for Case 1, we had trouble finding words.

Another possibility: perhaps there is a duplicate A? But we haven't seen evidence.

From feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked wrong, so if there is a duplicate A, it could be elsewhere, but we know A is not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5 for one A, and if duplicate, the other could be? But positions 1 and 5 are the only options, so if A is in both 1 and 5? But that would be the only possibility for duplicate.

But let's not go there yet.

Perhaps we missed a word for Case 1.

Let's list all possible words with A in 1, E in 3, and no E in 5, and no absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Word: A _ E _ _

With positions 2,4,5 filled with three distinct letters from above.

For example:
- AWAKE: not, E at 5.
- AGAPE: E at 5.
- AMAZE: Z, E at 5.
- ABEAM: duplicate A.
- How about ""AGENE""? E at 5 not allowed.

Perhaps ""AWEEN"": A W E E N -> E at 3 and 4? Duplicate E, and E at 4 is not forbidden? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible. But in ""aween"", positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. So E at 3 and 4. And A at 1. But is ""aween"" a word? It might be obscure.

Not common.

""AVINE"": V, I? I excluded.

""AXONE"": X, O, N, E -> but E at 5? A X O N E -> E at 5, not allowed.

So Case 1 seems difficult.

Now, back to Case 2: A in 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A

With positions 1,2,4 to fill.

We need a word like: X Y E Z A, where X,Y,Z are from available letters.

For example:
- BEA: not 5.
- Let's try ""QUEEN"" but no A at 5.
- ""BEIGE"" no A.
- ""JUMBA"" no E at 3.

After research in mind, common words: 
- ""OPERA"": O P E R A -> but P and R excluded.
- ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> R and T excluded.
- ""UNFED"": D excluded.

Not working.

""UMBER"": U M B E R -> R excluded.

""UMPED"": D excluded.

""UNAU"" not 5.

""VENOM"": V E N O M -> E at 2? Not allowed.

We need E at position 3.

So position 3 is E.

So for example, ""  E  A"" with A at 5.

Words:
- BAKED: D excluded.
- BAKER: R excluded.
- BANED: D excluded.
- BANER: R excluded.
- BASED: S and D excluded.
- BATED: T and D excluded.
- BEAUT: T excluded.
- BEEFY: B E E F Y -> E at 2 and 3? But E at 2 not allowed.
- BEFOG: B E F O G -> E at 2 not allowed.

Position 2 cannot be E, so the second letter is not E.

So for example, ""  X E Y A"" with X in 1, Y in 4.

Common words:
- ""QUEEN"" not.
- ""QUEER"" R excluded.
- ""QUEYS"": Q U E Y S -> S excluded.
- ""QUENA"": Q U E N A -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A. This fits! Q U E N A.

But is ""quena"" a valid word? It is a musical instrument, so it might be accepted.

Another: ""FIQUE"": F I Q U E -> I excluded.

""GUAVA"" no E.

""JUMAR"": R excluded.

""KARMA"" no E.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> but A in 2? M A U V E: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:V, 5:E. But we need A at 5, not E. And E at 5 is forbidden.

""NEWLY"" no A.

""OGEED"": O G E E D -> D excluded and E duplicate.

""OKEHS"": O K E H S -> H and S excluded.

""PEKOE"": P E K O E -> P excluded and E duplicate.

""PZAZZ"" no E.

""UMIAK"": U M I A K -> I excluded.

""UNBAN"": U N B A N -> but E not present? We need E at 3.

""VEGAN"": V E G A N -> E at 2 not allowed.

""VODKA"" no E.

""WACKO"" no E.

""YEAST"" E at 2 not allowed.

""YENTA"": Y E N T A -> E at 2 not allowed.

""ZEBRA"" R excluded.

So ""QUENA"" might be a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another word: ""BEMUD"" not common.

Perhaps ""FEMUR"" R excluded.

I think we need to consider that A might be in position 1, and we missed a word.

Let's try ""AGONE"" again, but E at 5 not allowed.

""AGONE"" has E at 5.

""AGENE"" has E at 5.

""AMINE"" M, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""AZOTE"" T excluded.

""ABUNA"" no E.

Perhaps ""AEGIS"" S and I excluded.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, like two A's.

For example, if A is in position 1 and also in position 5, then from feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked absent? No, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked ""-"", which means it is present but not in that position. So if there is a duplicate A, it could be that one A is in 1 or 5, and the other is not in 4.

But in ""raise"", A was in 2 and marked ""-"", so not in 2.

In ""dealt"", A in 3 and ""-"", not in 3.

So if there are two A's, they must be in positions 1 and 5.

So the word would be A _ E _ A

With position 2 and 4 to fill, and position 3 is E.

So pattern: A ? E ? A

With ? in 2 and 4.

And the letters must be from available set.

Also, position 2 cannot be E (already), and position 4 cannot be E (because E is at 3, and if duplicate, it could be, but we know E not in 4? No, we don't know that. We only know E not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4.

In ""cheap"", E is at 3, and we have no feedback on position 4 for E.

So E could be in 4 if duplicate.

But for now, for the A duplicate case, the word is A X E Y A.

With X and Y from available letters.

Words:
- AREA: not 5.
- AREAD: D excluded.
- AREAR: R excluded.
- AREAS: S excluded.
- AREFY: R excluded.
- ARENA: R excluded.
- ASEA: not 5.
- AVEDA: V, but E at 3? A V E D A -> D excluded.
- AWETA: W E T A -> T excluded.
- AZOFA: Z O F A -> no E.

Not common.

""AGEEA"" not a word.

So perhaps not.

Another possibility: the feedback might have been misinterpreted.

Let's list all the information again.

From guess 1: ""raise"" -> A and E are present, not in 2 and 5 respectively.

From guess 2: ""dealt"" -> A and E are present, not in 3 and 2 respectively. But E not in 2 we already knew.

From guess 3: ""cheap"" -> E is correct at position 3, A is present but not in 4.

So E is fixed at 3.

A is present, not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test whether A is in 1 or 5.

So we can choose a word that has A in 1 and one that has A in 5, but we can only do one.

So let's choose a word that has A in 1, for example, and uses new letters.

But earlier we had trouble, so let's find any word with A in 1 and E in 3.

For example, ""AKEES"" not.

""AGLEE"" L excluded.

""AMBER"" R excluded.

""ANKER"" R excluded.

""APTER"" R and T excluded.

""AVERT"" R and T excluded.

""AXMEN"" X, M, E, N -> A X M E N -> 1:A, 2:X, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N. But E is at 4, not 3. We need E at 3.

So not.

""AZURE"" U, R, E -> R excluded and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""AUMIL"" not common.

I think we need to consider ""QUEEN"" but no A.

Another idea: perhaps ""OAKED"" D excluded.

Let's list all 5-letter words with E in position 3 and A in the word, and no absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And A must be in 1 or 5.

So for A in 1: A _ E _ _

With the last two letters not E, and from available.

For example:
- A B E K A -> but A at 5, so ""ABEKA"" not a word.
- A B E N D -> D excluded.
- A B E T H -> T and H excluded.
- A B E W Y -> A B E W Y: 1:A,2:B,3:E,4:W,5:Y. Is ""abewy"" a word? No.
- A F E E R -> R excluded.
- A F E L L -> L excluded.
- A G E E K -> A G E E K: E at 3 and 4? ""ageek"" might be informal, but let's see. Positions: 1:A,2:G,3:E,4:E,5:K. But E at 4 is possible? We don't have evidence against E in 4. And ""ageek"" is in some dictionaries as a variant or slang. But might not be accepted.

But let's see if there are better.

- A G E M S -> S excluded.
- A G E N D -> D excluded.
- A G E S T -> S and T excluded.
- A J E E P -> P excluded.
- A K E N E -> E at 5 not allowed.
- A K E T O -> A K E T O: T excluded.
- A M E B A -> A M E B A: 1:A,2:M,3:E,4:B,5:A. This is ""ameba"", which is a valid word (variant of amoeba). And it has A at 1 and 5, and E at 3. And B and M are available letters.

So ""ameba"" is a possibility.

Similarly, for Case 2, we had ""quena"".

But ""ameba"" seems more common.

Also, in ""ameba"", the letters are A, M, E, B, A. So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:E, 4:B, 5:A.

Now, for our guess, we can use a word that tests this structure.

But we don't know if A is in 1 or 5.

We can guess ""ameba"" to test.

If we guess ""ameba"":
- If the secret word has A in 1, then position 1 A might be correct or not.
- But we know A is not in 2,3,4, so if it's in 1, it would be correct if the secret has A in 1.
- Similarly, if the secret has A in 5, then in ""ameba"", A at 5 would be correct.

But ""ameba"" has A at 1 and 5, so it covers both cases.

If the secret word has A only in 1, then in ""ameba"", A at 1 would be correct (✓), A at 5 might be absent or present but wrong position? But if the secret has only one A, then A at 5 would be absent if not present, or present but wrong position if there's a duplicate? But we don't know.

This might be messy.

Perhaps guess a word that has A only in position 1 or only in position 5.

For example, to test if A is in 1, guess a word with A in 1 and not in 5.

But earlier we couldn't find one with E in 3.

Another word: ""aweto"" not common.

""ameba"" might be our best shot.

Perhaps ""baned"" but D excluded.

Let's go with ""ameba"".

But ""ameba"" has M and B, which are available.

So for guess 4, we can guess ""ameba"".

Then based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see if there's a better word.

We can guess a word that has E in 3, and A in 5, for example.

Like ""quena"", but obscure.

Or ""bwana"": B W A N A -> no E.

Not.

""kwela"": K W E L A -> L excluded.

""pwned"": D excluded.

""vanda"": no E.

So ""ameba"" is a possibility.

Another common word: ""arena"" but R excluded.

""asana"" no E.

I think we should go with ""ameba"".

But let's confirm the letters: A, M, E, B, A.

M and B are not excluded.

So guess ""ameba"".

Then, in the feedback, we can see:
- If A in position 1 is correct, then ✓ for A at 1.
- E at 3 is already known correct, so ✓.
- A at 5: if the secret has A in 5, then ✓, else if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere, but we know A is only in 1 or 5, so if not in 5, then it must be in 1, but we have A in 1 already.

If the secret word has A only in position 1, then in ""ameba"":
- Position 1: A correct (✓)
- Position 2: M, could be correct or not
- Position 3: E correct (✓)
- Position 4: B, could be correct or not
- Position 5: A, since the secret has only one A and it's in 1, so A at 5 is not in the word, so (x)

Similarly, if the secret has A only in position 5, then:
- Position 1: A is not in the word (since only in 5), so (x)
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: A (✓)

If the secret has A in both 1 and 5, then both A's would be correct.

So the feedback will tell us.

Also, M and B will give information.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""ameba"".

But is ""ameba"" accepted in Wordle? I think so, as it's in the word list.

So for the fourth guess: ""ameba""

Return in format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)
     - A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.
     - R, I, S are absent.
   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)
     - E and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
     - D, L, T are absent.
   - **Guess 3: ""cheap""** → C(x), H(x), E(✓), A(-), P(x)
     - E is **correct and in position 3**.
     - A is in the word but not in position 4.
     - C, H, P are absent.

2. **Consolidate Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - E is fixed at position 3.
     - A is present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2), C, H, P (from Guess 3). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels O, U, Y).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word has E in position 3, and A in position 1 or 5. The remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 2, 4, 5, depending on A) must be filled with available letters.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Test the position of A (1 or 5) while maximizing information on new letters.
   - Choose a word with E in position 3, A in either position 1 or 5, and three new high-frequency consonants from the available set (e.g., M, B, N).
   - ""ameba"" (a valid English word, variant of ""amoeba"") fits perfectly:
     - Places E in position 3 (confirmed correct).
     - Places A in both position 1 and 5 to test the two possible cases for A:
       - If A is only in position 1, feedback will show A(✓) at 1 and A(x) at 5.
       - If A is only in position 5, feedback will show A(x) at 1 and A(✓) at 5.
       - If A is in both positions, both will be ✓.
     - Uses new letters M and B (position 2 and 4), which are common and untested.
     - Avoids all absent letters.
   - This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by resolving A's position and testing two new letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - Feedback for A at positions 1 and 5 will confirm the exact position of A.
   - Feedback for M and B will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.
   - E at position 3 is already confirmed, so it will show ✓.

A good starting word often has common letters and distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.\n\n Some people use words like ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have common letters and no repeated letters.\n However, note that repeated letters are allowed in the word but in our feedback we must consider the frequency.\n\n Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll choose: SALET (which is a valid English word and is often used in word games) but note that Wordle words are typically common.\n Alternatively, I can use ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"".\n\n However, to be safe, I\'ll choose a word that is known to be effective: ""CRANE"".\n\n But note, the instruction says ""5-letter English word"" and it must be valid.\n\n Another popular word is ""IRATE"" or ""RAISE"". I think ""RAISE"" is a good option because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n But let\'s pick one that has been proven statistically: ""CRATE"" might be even better because C is also common.\n\n Actually, let\'s choose ""ROATE"". Is it a valid word? It is a financial term. But if the system requires common words, then I might choose ""TRACE"".\n\n Since we don\'t know the dictionary, we\'ll pick a common word.\n\n I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\n Guess: RAISE\n\n Let me check the letters: R, A, I, S, E -> all distinct.\n\n We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n But note: We are making the first guess. So the feedback will come after.\n\n Therefore, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".\n\n Now, return the guess in the required format.I\'m starting a new game and need to make my first guess. Since there\'s no prior feedback, I should choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to cover more possibilities. \n\nAfter considering options like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE,"" I\'m selecting ""RAISE"" because:\n- It includes two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S), covering frequent English letters.\n- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback on each position.\n- It ranks high in statistical effectiveness according to Wordle-solving datasets.\n\nThis guess will help identify included letters and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letters A and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.\n\nAlso, note that A was in position 2 of ""raise"" (if we number positions 1 to 5). Since it\'s marked as wrong position, A cannot be in position 2 of the secret word. Similarly, E was in position 5 and is marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are absent)\n- Contains A and E (since they are present)\n- And we should try to place A and E in positions that are not 2 and 5 respectively, but also in positions we haven\'t tried.\n\nMoreover, we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and three unknown letters. We should try to cover other common letters and avoid the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded letters: R, I, S.\n\nWe know the word has A and E. Let\'s think of words that have A and E, and don\'t have R, I, S.\n\nWe also have three positions to figure out. We should try to use other common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should also avoid repeating the positions we know are wrong for A and E.\n\nFor the second guess, we can try to put A in a different position and E in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (since it can\'t be 2, and we haven\'t tried others)\nSimilarly, for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (can\'t be 5)\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the exact positions, so we can try one possibility.\n\nAlso, we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn\'t show any, and we don\'t have evidence of repetition. However, we cannot rule it out.\n\nBut since we are early, let\'s assume no repetition for now.\n\nLet me list some candidate words that contain A and E, and avoid R, I, S.\n\nFor example:\n- ""LATEN"" - but is it a word? Not common. Maybe ""LATTE"" but has double T and no E? Wait, ""LATTE"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nBetter to use common words.\n\nConsider: ""PLATE"" -> contains P, L, A, T, E. \n- A is in position 3, E in position 5. But note: in the feedback, E was in position 5 and was wrong, so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, if we put E in position 5 again, it would be a waste? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal because we already know E is not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nIn ""PLATE"":\n- A is in position 3 (which is new) and E is in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So if we use ""PLATE"", we are putting E in a position we know it doesn\'t belong. That might not be efficient because we already know E isn\'t at position 5, so we won\'t get new information about E\'s position.\n\nWe should try to put E in a position we haven\'t tested: 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly for A: avoid position 2, so try 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""LEACH"" - but has H and C. Also, A is in position 3, E in position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H or C are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but has O, C, N. Also, A is in position 4 and E in position 3. But note: we have excluded R, I, S, but O, C, N are new.\n\nBut ""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we might want to test more consonants.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALERT"" - but has R which is excluded. So invalid.\n\n""LATER"": has R? Yes, R is excluded. So no.\n\n""TALON"": no E.\n\nWe need a word with A and E.\n\nLet me think: words with A and E, no R, I, S.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. \n  - A is in position 3, E in position 5. But again, E is in position 5 which we know is wrong.\n\n- ""LEANT"": has L, E, A, N, T. \n  - E in position 2, A in position 3. \n  - Positions: 1: L, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: T.\n  - This avoids position 5 for E and position 2 for A? \n    - A was in position 2 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is new. \n    - E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put E in position 2, which is new.\n\nSo ""LEANT"" seems good.\n\nBut is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of ""leaned"" or ""learnt"", but accepted as a word.\n\nAnother option: ""LEAPT"" - similar: L, E, A, P, T. E in 2, A in 3.\n\nOr ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T. E in 2, A in 3.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E in position 2. That is allowed because we don\'t know what is in position 2 yet. We only know that A is not in position 2, but it could be E.\n\nSimilarly, we are putting A in position 3, which is a new position.\n\nWe also want to test new letters. We have already used A and E, so we should test three new letters to maximize information.\n\nIn ""LEANT"", the new letters are L, N, T.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DEALT"", new letters are D, L, T.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nAnother word: ""ADOBE"" - but has O, B, and E in position 5? E is at the end again. Also, A is at position 1, which is new. But E at 5 is bad.\n\nWe should avoid E at 5.\n\nSo ""ADOBE"" is not good.\n\n""MANGE"" - E at 5 again.\n\nSo let\'s stick with words that have E not in position 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TABLE"" - but E is at position 5? No, ""TABLE"" has E at the end? T-A-B-L-E: E is at 5. So avoid.\n\n""CAFES"" - has S? S is excluded. So no.\n\n""FEAST"" - has S? Yes, excluded.\n\nSo without S, R, I.\n\n""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: L, C, H.\n\n""LEACH"" is a word.\n\nBut H is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\n""BEADY"": has B, E, A, D, Y. E at 2, A at 3. New letters: B, D, Y.\n\nBut Y is at the end, which might be common.\n\nAnother: ""WEALD"": W, E, A, L, D. E at 2, A at 3.\n\nBut W is not very common.\n\nI think ""DEALT"" is a good choice: D, E, A, L, T. \n- E in position 2 (new position for E, and we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? Actually, we tested E only in position 5 before, so position 2 is new for E).\n- A in position 3 (new for A, previously tested in position 2).\n- New letters: D, L, T.\n\nAlso, D, L, T are common consonants.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DEALT"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""DEALT"" is a common English word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLANE"" would be good if not for E at 5. But we know E is not at 5, so we avoid that.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""DEALT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LATTE"" but it has double T and no E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so it has E at the end? Position 5. So avoid.\n\n""LEANT"" is also good.\n\nBut ""DEALT"" seems more common.\n\nAnother word: ""TEARY"" - but has R? R is excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think ""DEALT"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""DEALT"".\n\nNow, we return the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").\n- A cannot be in position 2 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).\n- E cannot be in position 5 (since it was guessed there and was wrong).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the word).\n- Must exclude R, I, S (since they are absent).\n- Should place A and E in new positions to test for correct placement:\n  - A should not be in position 2 (test positions 1, 3, or 4).\n  - E should not be in position 5 (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n- Aim to maximize information by using common unused consonants (e.g., D, L, T) and avoiding repeated letters.\n\nThe word ""dealt"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A (in position 3, a new position) and E (in position 2, a new position).\n- Excludes R, I, S.\n- Introduces new common letters: D, L, T.\n- Tests new positions for known letters and covers three additional consonants.\n\n<guess>dealt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""dealt""\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word contains the letters A and E (from both guesses).\n2. The following letters are not in the word: R, I, S, D, L, T (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).\n3. A is not in position 2 (from ""raise"") and not in position 3 (from ""dealt""). So A must be in position 1 or 4 (since the word is 5 letters, and position 5 is not tested for A yet, but note E is also to be placed).\n4. E is not in position 5 (from ""raise"") and not in position 2 (from ""dealt""). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We know A and E are in the word, and they are distinct. So we need to assign them to positions without conflict.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are eliminated)\nPossible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are eliminated)\n\nBut if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 4, E could be in 1 or 3 (but not 4, unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out, but for now, let\'s assume no duplicates to keep it simple).\n\nSo the possible cases for A and E:\n\nCase 1: A in position 1, then E can be in 3 or 4.\nCase 2: A in position 4, then E can be in 1 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we have three more letters to find. We know the absent letters: R, I, S, D, L, T. So we must avoid these.\n\nWe need to think of common letters that are not excluded. The remaining letters in the alphabet (excluding vowels we know and the absent consonants) are:\n\nVowels: we have A and E, so other vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s see)\n\nConsonants: we have excluded: R, I, S, D, L, T. Note: I is a vowel, but excluded.\n\nAvailable consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut common ones: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.\n\nWe also know that the word must have three more letters besides A and E.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits the constraints.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that tests the possible positions for A and E and uses new common letters.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (A and E) and we need to place them in the allowed positions and choose the other three from the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, consider Case 1: A in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.\n\nIf A in 1, E in 3: then the word is A _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {R,I,S,D,L,T} and not A or E (unless duplicate, but we avoid for now).\n\nSimilarly, if A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _\n\nCase 2: A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A _\nOr A in 4, E in 3: _ E _ A _\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 and A in 4, for example.\n\nWe need to test these possibilities.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that covers as many of these cases as possible and uses common unused letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in the possible positions and includes other common letters to test.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: R, I, S, D, L, T.\n\nSo available: A, E, and then B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O and U are vowels, but we can use them.)\n\nBut we are focusing on positions.\n\nWe know A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be in 2 or 5, so E in 1,3,4.\n\nBut if we put A in 1, then E cannot be in 1, so E in 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if A in 4, then E in 1 or 3.\n\nNow, let\'s try to form words:\n\nOption: A in position 1, E in position 3: A _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks. For example, with common letters: A, then a consonant, then E, then two more.\n\nPossible words: \n- ACHEM? Not a word.\n- ACHE: only 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n- AWES: but S is excluded.\n- AGENT: G, E, N, T. But T is excluded (from dealt, T is x). So no.\n- AMEND: M, E, N, D. But D is excluded. No.\n- APERT: but R and T excluded.\n\nIt\'s tricky.\n\nAnother: A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E _\n\nExamples:\n- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y. But E is in position 4? A B B E Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y. But E is in 4, which is allowed. But we have double B? And Y at end. Also, B and Y are available. But is ""ABBEY"" valid? Yes. But note: we have two B\'s, but that\'s okay if the secret word has B. However, we don\'t know.\n\nBut we are trying to test, so it might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word without duplicates.\n\n- AGAPE: A G A P E -> but A is repeated? And E is in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.\n\n- ALONE: but L is excluded.\n\n- ANODE: N, O, D, E. But D is excluded.\n\n- APEX: only 4 letters? A P E X -> 4 letters.\n\n- AWAKE: W, A, K, E. But A is in position 1, then W in 2, A in 3? But we have A in 1 and 3? That would be duplicate A. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates, so maybe not. But let\'s avoid for now.\n\nAWAKE: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E -> but E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.\n\n- ABASE: but S excluded.\n\n- ABATE: T excluded.\n\n- ACUTE: C, U, T, E. T excluded.\n\n- ADAGE: D excluded.\n\n- AFIRE: F, I, R, E. I and R excluded.\n\n- AGATE: G, A, T, E. T excluded.\n\n- ALIKE: L and I excluded.\n\n- AMUSE: M, U, S, E. S excluded.\n\n- ANIME: N, I, M, E. I excluded.\n\n- ARISE: R, I, S excluded.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with A in 1 and E in 4 without using excluded letters.\n\nNow, try A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ _\n\n- AGENT: G, E, N, T -> T excluded.\n- AMEND: M, E, N, D -> D excluded.\n- APERY: P, E, R, Y -> R excluded.\n- AVERT: V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.\n- AWFUL: W, F, U, L -> L excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nNow, consider Case 2: A in position 4.\n\nThen E can be in 1 or 3.\n\nFirst, E in 1, A in 4: E _ _ A _\n\nWords:\n- ECHOA: not a word.\n- ECLAT: E C L A T -> but L and T excluded.\n- EDEMA: E D E M A -> D excluded and duplicate E? \n- EGYPT: E G Y P T -> T excluded.\n- ELOHA: E L O H A -> L excluded.\n- ENEMA: E N E M A -> duplicate E? and M and N, but E is repeated. \n- ENOLA: E N O L A -> L excluded.\n- EPHOR: E P H O R -> R excluded.\n- ERUCA: E R U C A -> R excluded.\n- EVADE: E V A D E -> D excluded and duplicate E.\n\nNot finding good words.\n\nNow, E in 3 and A in 4: _ E _ A _\n\nWords:\n- BEAU: only 4 letters.\n- BLEAR: B L E A R -> L and R excluded.\n- CHEAP: C H E A P -> possible? C, H, E, A, P. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:P. \n  - This uses C, H, P which are available. \n  - And E is in 3, A in 4, which are allowed (E not in 2 or 5, A not in 2 or 3).\n\nSo ""CHEAP"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, other words:\n- CLEAN: C L E A N -> L excluded.\n- DREAM: D R E A M -> D and R excluded.\n- FLEAM: F L E A M -> L excluded.\n- GLEAM: G L E A M -> L excluded.\n- HEAVY: H E A V Y -> but A is in position 3? H E A V Y: 1:H, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:Y. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed because from ""dealt"", A was in position 3 and was marked wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""HEAVY"" has A in 3, which is invalid.\n\nIn ""CHEAP"", A is in position 4, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""PLEAD"": P L E A D -> L and D excluded.\n\n""QUEAN"": Q U E A N -> possible? 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. Q and U are less common, but valid.\n\n""STEAM"": S excluded.\n\n""WHEAT"": W H E A T -> T excluded.\n\nSo ""CHEAP"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to consider if there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother word: ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> but E is in position 3, A in 4. And O, C, N are available. But in ""OCEAN"", the positions: 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N. \n- E is in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed). \n- And it uses O, C, N, which are not excluded.\n\nSo ""OCEAN"" is also a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"" are both options.\n\nWe can also consider ""BEACH"": but S? B E A C H -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:H. But A is in position 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and was wrong). So invalid.\n\n""PEACH"": P E A C H -> A in 3, invalid.\n\nSo back to ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"".\n\nWhich one to choose? Both test E in 3 and A in 4, and use new letters.\n\n""CHEAP"" uses C, H, P.\n""OCEAN"" uses O, C, N.\n\nBoth are good. But we might want to use more common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider if there is a word that tests A in position 1.\n\nFor example, A in 1 and E in 4: we had trouble, but let\'s find one.\n\n""AGLEE"": not common.\n""AGONE"": G, O, N, E. But E in 4? A G O N E -> 1:A, 2:G, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. But E is in 5, which is forbidden. So no.\n\n""ALBEE"": L excluded.\n\nSo hard to find.\n\nAnother idea: A in 1 and E in 3: ""AXIOM"" but I and O? A X I O M -> I excluded.\n\n""AZOTE"": Z, O, T, E. T excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nSo perhaps the secret word has A in position 4 and E in position 3, as in ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".\n\nBut we also have the possibility of E in position 1 and A in position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tested that.\n\nFor example, a word like ""URAEI"" not 5 letters.\n\n""URAE"" no.\n\n""ENACT"": E N A C T -> but A in 3? E N A C T: 1:E, 2:N, 3:A, 4:C, 5:T. But A is in 3, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", A was in 3 and wrong). Also, T excluded.\n\n""EXACT"": E X A C T -> A in 3, T excluded.\n\n""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> D excluded and duplicate E.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with E in 1 and A in 4 without using excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible is E in 3 and A in 4.\n\nSo we can go with ""CHEAP"" or ""OCEAN"".\n\nBut note: we also have the possibility of A in position 1 and E in position 4, but we couldn\'t find a common word. Or A in position 1 and E in position 3, also hard.\n\nAnother word for A in 1 and E in 3: ""AVERT"" but R and T excluded.\n\n""ASKEW"": S and K? A S K E W -> S excluded.\n\nSo I think we should test the E in 3 and A in 4 pattern.\n\nBetween ""CHEAP"" and ""OCEAN"", which is better?\n\n""OCEAN"" has O which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E), so it might be vowel-heavy. ""CHEAP"" has consonants C, H, P.\n\nAlso, ""CHEAP"" uses H which is common, and P.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""CHEAP"" might be more common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: in Wordle, both are accepted.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEANO"" - B E A N O -> but E in 2? 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O. But E is in 2, which is not allowed (from ""dealt"", E was in 2 and was wrong). So E cannot be in 2. Therefore, ""BEANO"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> L excluded.\n\nSo I think ""CHEAP"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: in ""CHEAP"", we have E in position 3 and A in position 4. We are testing if A is in 4 and E in 3.\n\nIf the secret word has A in 1, then this guess won\'t have A and E in the right positions, but we will get feedback.\n\nWe are trying to cover the most likely case.\n\nWe could choose a word that has A in 1 and E in 4, but we need to find one.\n\nAfter some thought, I found ""AGAPE"" but E is at 5, invalid.\n\n""ADOBE"" E at 5.\n\n""ABODE"" has E at 5 and D excluded.\n\n""AFORE"" R excluded.\n\nSo I think it\'s safe to go with ""CHEAP"".\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""CHEAP"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the secret word has A in 4 and E in 3, then in ""CHEAP"":\n- C: could be correct or not\n- H: same\n- E: in position 3, if the secret has E in 3, it would be ✓, else -\n- A: in position 4, if secret has A in 4, ✓, else -\n- P: ?\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in 1 to test that case.\n\nFor example, ""ANKHS"" not common.\n\n""ANODE"" D excluded.\n\n""APPLE"" P, P, L, E -> L excluded and duplicate P.\n\nNot good.\n\n""AROSE"" R and S excluded.\n\nSo I think ""CHEAP"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> but A in 2? 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N. But A is in position 2, which is not allowed (from ""raise"", A was in 2 and wrong). So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNAU"" not 5 letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHEAP"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CHEAP"" has C, H, E, A, P. None of R,I,S,D,L,T. So it\'s clean.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""CHEAP"".\n\nNow, return in the required format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)\n     - R, I, S are **absent** from the secret word.\n     - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n       - A is not in position 2.\n       - E is not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → Feedback: D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)\n     - D, L, T are **absent** from the secret word.\n     - E and A are **present** but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n       - E is not in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 2).\n       - A is not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 3).\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **Confirmed Letters**: A and E are in the secret word (from both guesses).\n   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.\n   - **Position Constraints**:\n     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1 or 4.\n     - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.\n   - Since A and E are distinct, they cannot occupy the same position. Possible valid (A, E) position pairs:\n     - A in 1, E in 3\n     - A in 1, E in 4\n     - A in 4, E in 1\n     - A in 4, E in 3\n   - The word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters are unknown. These must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters: available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Test the most likely position pairs for A and E while introducing new common letters to maximize information.\n   - Focus on the (A in 4, E in 3) pair, as it aligns with common English words and avoids positions ruled out by feedback.\n   - Avoid absent letters (R, I, S, D, L, T) and reuse A and E to confirm their positions.\n   - Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, H, P, N) to test new letters efficiently.\n   - After evaluating options like ""ocean"" (O, C, E, A, N) and ""cheap"" (C, H, E, A, P), ""cheap"" is selected because:\n     - It places E in position 3 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed).\n     - It uses common consonants C, H, P, which are untested and high-frequency.\n     - It avoids all absent letters and repeated letters.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If E is correctly in position 3, it will show ✓ for E.\n   - If A is correctly in position 4, it will show ✓ for A.\n   - Feedback for C, H, and P will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>cheap</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) A(-) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: present, wrong position (-)\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-)\n\nGuess 2: ""dealt""\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-)  [so E is not in position 2]\n- A: present, wrong position (-)  [so A is not in position 3]\n- L: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: ""cheap""\n- C: absent (x)\n- H: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) at position 3\n- A: present, but wrong position (-) [so A is not in position 4]\n- P: absent (x)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate the information:\n\n1. **Absent Letters**: From all guesses, the absent letters are: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P. So the secret word does not contain any of these: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.\n\n2. **Present Letters**:\n   - E is in the word and is in position 3 (from ""cheap"" feedback: E(✓)).\n   - A is in the word, but we know it\'s not in position 2 (from ""raise""), not in position 3 (from ""dealt""), and not in position 4 (from ""cheap""). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5.\n\n3. **Position of E**: We know E is fixed at position 3.\n\n4. **Position of A**: Since A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, it must be in position 1 or 5.\n\n5. **Other Letters**: We need to find three more letters (since E is fixed at 3, and A is one of the other positions). The word has 5 letters, so:\n   - If A is in position 1, then positions 2,4,5 are unknown.\n   - If A is in position 5, then positions 1,2,4 are unknown.\n\nBut note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: E (at 3) and A (at 1 or 5). So we need three more distinct letters (unless there are duplicates, but we haven\'t seen evidence of duplicates yet).\n\nAvailable letters: We have excluded R,I,S,D,L,T,C,H,P. The remaining letters are: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe must choose a word that:\n- Has E in position 3.\n- Includes A, but not in positions 2,3,4 (so only 1 or 5).\n- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).\n\nNow, let\'s consider the two cases for A:\n\n**Case 1: A in position 1**\n- Word pattern: A _ E _ _\n- We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from the available set (B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not repeating any absent letters.\n\n**Case 2: A in position 5**\n- Word pattern: _ _ E _ A\n- We need to fill positions 1,2,4 with available letters.\n\nWe need to choose a guess that can test between these cases and also test new letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to maximize information.\n\nWe can try to cover both cases in one guess? Or choose a word that fits one case and tests it.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and another that has A in position 5, but we can only guess one.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, Case 1: A in position 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _\n\nPossible words (using available letters):\n- AWAKE? But K and W are available, but E is at 5? A W A K E -> but A repeated? And E at 5. But we have E fixed at 3, so this doesn\'t fit. We need E at 3: so A _ E _ _\n\nExamples:\n- ABEAM: A B E A M -> but A repeated? And M. But positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:E, 4:A? That would be A in 4, but we know A cannot be in 4. Also, duplicate A. Not good.\n- ABELE: A B E L E -> but L is excluded, and E repeated.\n- AGENE: A G E N E -> E repeated? And G, N. But E is at 3 and 5? But we have E fixed at 3, so position 5 is E? But in the word, it would be A G E N E. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, L not present? AGENE: G and N are available. But E is at 3 and 5? The pattern is A _ E _ E. But we have E at 3, and if E is also at 5, that\'s possible? But in feedback, we haven\'t seen E in other positions. But it\'s allowed. However, we have A in 1 and E in 3 and 5? But we are only required to have A and E, but E is already at 3. So if we have another E, it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback: in ""raise"", E was present but not in 5, so if E is in 5, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""raise"", E was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in 5. So if E were in 5, it would have been marked as correct? But it was not, so E is not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word does not have E in position 5. So we cannot have E in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, from ""dealt"", E was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so E is not in 2.\n\nTherefore, E is only in position 3. So no duplicate E? Not necessarily, but if there is a duplicate E, it cannot be in position 2 or 5. But we don\'t have evidence for duplicate, so we assume no duplicate for now.\n\nSo for Case 1: A _ E _ _ , with no E in 5, so position 5 cannot be E.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: _ _ E _ A, with no E in 2, so position 2 cannot be E.\n\nBack to Case 1: A in 1, E in 3, then positions 2,4,5 must be filled with other available letters, not A or E (since A is only once, and E is at 3).\n\nSo A _ E _ _ , with positions 2,4,5: three distinct letters from available set.\n\nPossible words:\n- ABEAM: not, because A in 4 and duplicate.\n- ABELE: L excluded.\n- AGENE: E at 5? But E cannot be at 5, and also duplicate E.\n- AGONE: A G O N E -> but E at 5? Not allowed. And O and N are available, but E at 5 is forbidden.\n- AKEES: K, E, E, S -> S excluded and E duplicate and at 5? Not.\n- ALECK: L excluded.\n\nIt\'s hard. Let\'s think of common words.\n\n- AWAKE: A W A K E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.\n- AWAVE: A W A V E -> duplicate A and E at 5? Not.\n- AZOLE: L excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.\n\nNot many common words fit.\n\n""ABASE"": S excluded.\n\n""ABATE"": T excluded.\n\n""ACETA"": C excluded.\n\nSo Case 1 seems less likely.\n\nNow Case 2: A in position 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A\n\nPattern: position 1,2,4 to fill with available letters.\n\nExamples:\n- BEA: not 5 letters.\n- BREAD: R excluded.\n- BREAK: R excluded.\n- CLEAN: L excluded.\n- DREAD: D and R excluded.\n- FREAK: F R E A K -> R excluded.\n- GLEAM: L excluded.\n- OCEAN: O C E A N -> but C is excluded (from cheap, C:x). So invalid.\n- WHEAT: H and T excluded.\n\nWe need to use available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- BEAU: not 5.\n- BEAUT: T excluded.\n- BEAUX: B E A U X -> but E at 2? Pattern: if we have _ _ E _ A, then B in 1, E in 2? But E cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). So if we put E in 2, it would be wrong, but we know E is fixed at 3. So in this pattern, position 2 must not be E.\n\nSo for the word, position 3 is E, so position 2 is a different letter.\n\nSo for example, ""QUEUE"" not.\n\n""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> but E at 3 and 4? And E at 4: is that allowed? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible? From feedback, we only know E is not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4? But in this case, we have E at 3 (fixed) and also at 4? That would be duplicate E.\n\nBut in ""QUEEN"", positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. But we have E at 3 and 4. And A is not present? We need A in position 5? But here position 5 is N, not A. So not.\n\nWe need A in position 5.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ E _ A\n\nWith position 1,2,4 filled with available letters, not E (since E is only at 3), and not A (since A at 5), and not the absent letters.\n\nAlso, position 2 cannot be E (which it isn\'t), and position 4 can be anything except E? But E could be duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nAssume no duplicate E for simplicity.\n\nSo positions 1,2,4: three distinct letters from available set.\n\nWords:\n- FJELD: not common, and J? F J E L D -> L and D excluded.\n- MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E at 4? Pattern: M in 1, O in 2, N in 3? But we need E at 3, so position 3 must be E. So ""MONEY"" has E at 4, not 3. So not.\n\nWe need E at position 3.\n\nSo the word must have the third letter as E.\n\nExamples of words ending with A, with E in position 3:\n\n- UREA: not 5.\n- UREMA: U R E M A -> R excluded.\n- UVEAS: U V E A S -> S excluded.\n- VENAE: V E N A E -> E at 2 and 5? But E at 2 is not allowed, and at 5 not allowed. Also, duplicate E.\n- WACKO: no E.\n\nAfter some thought, common words: \n- ""PIZZA"" but Z and A, but no E.\n\nNot working.\n\nPerhaps ""QUEUE"" not.\n\nAnother idea: ""JUMBA"" no E.\n\nMaybe we missed something.\n\nWhat about ""BEAKY"": B E A K Y -> but E at 2? Not allowed.\n\n""BEAKY"" has E at 2, which is forbidden.\n\n""BEGEM"": B E G E M -> E at 2 and 4? Not allowed.\n\n""BEMA"": not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""FEMUR"": R excluded.\n\nI think we need to consider that A might be in position 1.\n\nBut earlier for Case 1, we had trouble finding words.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps there is a duplicate A? But we haven\'t seen evidence.\n\nFrom feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked wrong, so if there is a duplicate A, it could be elsewhere, but we know A is not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5 for one A, and if duplicate, the other could be? But positions 1 and 5 are the only options, so if A is in both 1 and 5? But that would be the only possibility for duplicate.\n\nBut let\'s not go there yet.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word for Case 1.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words with A in 1, E in 3, and no E in 5, and no absent letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWord: A _ E _ _\n\nWith positions 2,4,5 filled with three distinct letters from above.\n\nFor example:\n- AWAKE: not, E at 5.\n- AGAPE: E at 5.\n- AMAZE: Z, E at 5.\n- ABEAM: duplicate A.\n- How about ""AGENE""? E at 5 not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""AWEEN"": A W E E N -> E at 3 and 4? Duplicate E, and E at 4 is not forbidden? We know E is not in 2 or 5, but 4 is possible. But in ""aween"", positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:E, 4:E, 5:N. So E at 3 and 4. And A at 1. But is ""aween"" a word? It might be obscure.\n\nNot common.\n\n""AVINE"": V, I? I excluded.\n\n""AXONE"": X, O, N, E -> but E at 5? A X O N E -> E at 5, not allowed.\n\nSo Case 1 seems difficult.\n\nNow, back to Case 2: A in 5, E in 3: _ _ E _ A\n\nWith positions 1,2,4 to fill.\n\nWe need a word like: X Y E Z A, where X,Y,Z are from available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- BEA: not 5.\n- Let\'s try ""QUEEN"" but no A at 5.\n- ""BEIGE"" no A.\n- ""JUMBA"" no E at 3.\n\nAfter research in mind, common words: \n- ""OPERA"": O P E R A -> but P and R excluded.\n- ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> R and T excluded.\n- ""UNFED"": D excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\n""UMBER"": U M B E R -> R excluded.\n\n""UMPED"": D excluded.\n\n""UNAU"" not 5.\n\n""VENOM"": V E N O M -> E at 2? Not allowed.\n\nWe need E at position 3.\n\nSo position 3 is E.\n\nSo for example, ""  E  A"" with A at 5.\n\nWords:\n- BAKED: D excluded.\n- BAKER: R excluded.\n- BANED: D excluded.\n- BANER: R excluded.\n- BASED: S and D excluded.\n- BATED: T and D excluded.\n- BEAUT: T excluded.\n- BEEFY: B E E F Y -> E at 2 and 3? But E at 2 not allowed.\n- BEFOG: B E F O G -> E at 2 not allowed.\n\nPosition 2 cannot be E, so the second letter is not E.\n\nSo for example, ""  X E Y A"" with X in 1, Y in 4.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""QUEEN"" not.\n- ""QUEER"" R excluded.\n- ""QUEYS"": Q U E Y S -> S excluded.\n- ""QUENA"": Q U E N A -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A. This fits! Q U E N A.\n\nBut is ""quena"" a valid word? It is a musical instrument, so it might be accepted.\n\nAnother: ""FIQUE"": F I Q U E -> I excluded.\n\n""GUAVA"" no E.\n\n""JUMAR"": R excluded.\n\n""KARMA"" no E.\n\n""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> but A in 2? M A U V E: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:V, 5:E. But we need A at 5, not E. And E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""NEWLY"" no A.\n\n""OGEED"": O G E E D -> D excluded and E duplicate.\n\n""OKEHS"": O K E H S -> H and S excluded.\n\n""PEKOE"": P E K O E -> P excluded and E duplicate.\n\n""PZAZZ"" no E.\n\n""UMIAK"": U M I A K -> I excluded.\n\n""UNBAN"": U N B A N -> but E not present? We need E at 3.\n\n""VEGAN"": V E G A N -> E at 2 not allowed.\n\n""VODKA"" no E.\n\n""WACKO"" no E.\n\n""YEAST"" E at 2 not allowed.\n\n""YENTA"": Y E N T A -> E at 2 not allowed.\n\n""ZEBRA"" R excluded.\n\nSo ""QUENA"" might be a possibility, but it\'s obscure.\n\nAnother word: ""BEMUD"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""FEMUR"" R excluded.\n\nI think we need to consider that A might be in position 1, and we missed a word.\n\nLet\'s try ""AGONE"" again, but E at 5 not allowed.\n\n""AGONE"" has E at 5.\n\n""AGENE"" has E at 5.\n\n""AMINE"" M, I, N, E -> I excluded.\n\n""AZOTE"" T excluded.\n\n""ABUNA"" no E.\n\nPerhaps ""AEGIS"" S and I excluded.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, like two A\'s.\n\nFor example, if A is in position 1 and also in position 5, then from feedback, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked absent? No, in ""cheap"", A was in position 4 and marked ""-"", which means it is present but not in that position. So if there is a duplicate A, it could be that one A is in 1 or 5, and the other is not in 4.\n\nBut in ""raise"", A was in 2 and marked ""-"", so not in 2.\n\nIn ""dealt"", A in 3 and ""-"", not in 3.\n\nSo if there are two A\'s, they must be in positions 1 and 5.\n\nSo the word would be A _ E _ A\n\nWith position 2 and 4 to fill, and position 3 is E.\n\nSo pattern: A ? E ? A\n\nWith ? in 2 and 4.\n\nAnd the letters must be from available set.\n\nAlso, position 2 cannot be E (already), and position 4 cannot be E (because E is at 3, and if duplicate, it could be, but we know E not in 4? No, we don\'t know that. We only know E not in 2 or 5, but it could be in 4.\n\nIn ""cheap"", E is at 3, and we have no feedback on position 4 for E.\n\nSo E could be in 4 if duplicate.\n\nBut for now, for the A duplicate case, the word is A X E Y A.\n\nWith X and Y from available letters.\n\nWords:\n- AREA: not 5.\n- AREAD: D excluded.\n- AREAR: R excluded.\n- AREAS: S excluded.\n- AREFY: R excluded.\n- ARENA: R excluded.\n- ASEA: not 5.\n- AVEDA: V, but E at 3? A V E D A -> D excluded.\n- AWETA: W E T A -> T excluded.\n- AZOFA: Z O F A -> no E.\n\nNot common.\n\n""AGEEA"" not a word.\n\nSo perhaps not.\n\nAnother possibility: the feedback might have been misinterpreted.\n\nLet\'s list all the information again.\n\nFrom guess 1: ""raise"" -> A and E are present, not in 2 and 5 respectively.\n\nFrom guess 2: ""dealt"" -> A and E are present, not in 3 and 2 respectively. But E not in 2 we already knew.\n\nFrom guess 3: ""cheap"" -> E is correct at position 3, A is present but not in 4.\n\nSo E is fixed at 3.\n\nA is present, not in 2,3,4, so only position 1 or 5.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to test whether A is in 1 or 5.\n\nSo we can choose a word that has A in 1 and one that has A in 5, but we can only do one.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has A in 1, for example, and uses new letters.\n\nBut earlier we had trouble, so let\'s find any word with A in 1 and E in 3.\n\nFor example, ""AKEES"" not.\n\n""AGLEE"" L excluded.\n\n""AMBER"" R excluded.\n\n""ANKER"" R excluded.\n\n""APTER"" R and T excluded.\n\n""AVERT"" R and T excluded.\n\n""AXMEN"" X, M, E, N -> A X M E N -> 1:A, 2:X, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N. But E is at 4, not 3. We need E at 3.\n\nSo not.\n\n""AZURE"" U, R, E -> R excluded and E at 5.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""AUMIL"" not common.\n\nI think we need to consider ""QUEEN"" but no A.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps ""OAKED"" D excluded.\n\nLet\'s list all 5-letter words with E in position 3 and A in the word, and no absent letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,N,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nAnd A must be in 1 or 5.\n\nSo for A in 1: A _ E _ _\n\nWith the last two letters not E, and from available.\n\nFor example:\n- A B E K A -> but A at 5, so ""ABEKA"" not a word.\n- A B E N D -> D excluded.\n- A B E T H -> T and H excluded.\n- A B E W Y -> A B E W Y: 1:A,2:B,3:E,4:W,5:Y. Is ""abewy"" a word? No.\n- A F E E R -> R excluded.\n- A F E L L -> L excluded.\n- A G E E K -> A G E E K: E at 3 and 4? ""ageek"" might be informal, but let\'s see. Positions: 1:A,2:G,3:E,4:E,5:K. But E at 4 is possible? We don\'t have evidence against E in 4. And ""ageek"" is in some dictionaries as a variant or slang. But might not be accepted.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better.\n\n- A G E M S -> S excluded.\n- A G E N D -> D excluded.\n- A G E S T -> S and T excluded.\n- A J E E P -> P excluded.\n- A K E N E -> E at 5 not allowed.\n- A K E T O -> A K E T O: T excluded.\n- A M E B A -> A M E B A: 1:A,2:M,3:E,4:B,5:A. This is ""ameba"", which is a valid word (variant of amoeba). And it has A at 1 and 5, and E at 3. And B and M are available letters.\n\nSo ""ameba"" is a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2, we had ""quena"".\n\nBut ""ameba"" seems more common.\n\nAlso, in ""ameba"", the letters are A, M, E, B, A. So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:E, 4:B, 5:A.\n\nNow, for our guess, we can use a word that tests this structure.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is in 1 or 5.\n\nWe can guess ""ameba"" to test.\n\nIf we guess ""ameba"":\n- If the secret word has A in 1, then position 1 A might be correct or not.\n- But we know A is not in 2,3,4, so if it\'s in 1, it would be correct if the secret has A in 1.\n- Similarly, if the secret has A in 5, then in ""ameba"", A at 5 would be correct.\n\nBut ""ameba"" has A at 1 and 5, so it covers both cases.\n\nIf the secret word has A only in 1, then in ""ameba"", A at 1 would be correct (✓), A at 5 might be absent or present but wrong position? But if the secret has only one A, then A at 5 would be absent if not present, or present but wrong position if there\'s a duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis might be messy.\n\nPerhaps guess a word that has A only in position 1 or only in position 5.\n\nFor example, to test if A is in 1, guess a word with A in 1 and not in 5.\n\nBut earlier we couldn\'t find one with E in 3.\n\nAnother word: ""aweto"" not common.\n\n""ameba"" might be our best shot.\n\nPerhaps ""baned"" but D excluded.\n\nLet\'s go with ""ameba"".\n\nBut ""ameba"" has M and B, which are available.\n\nSo for guess 4, we can guess ""ameba"".\n\nThen based on feedback, we can determine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nWe can guess a word that has E in 3, and A in 5, for example.\n\nLike ""quena"", but obscure.\n\nOr ""bwana"": B W A N A -> no E.\n\nNot.\n\n""kwela"": K W E L A -> L excluded.\n\n""pwned"": D excluded.\n\n""vanda"": no E.\n\nSo ""ameba"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother common word: ""arena"" but R excluded.\n\n""asana"" no E.\n\nI think we should go with ""ameba"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: A, M, E, B, A.\n\nM and B are not excluded.\n\nSo guess ""ameba"".\n\nThen, in the feedback, we can see:\n- If A in position 1 is correct, then ✓ for A at 1.\n- E at 3 is already known correct, so ✓.\n- A at 5: if the secret has A in 5, then ✓, else if not, then it might be absent or present elsewhere, but we know A is only in 1 or 5, so if not in 5, then it must be in 1, but we have A in 1 already.\n\nIf the secret word has A only in position 1, then in ""ameba"":\n- Position 1: A correct (✓)\n- Position 2: M, could be correct or not\n- Position 3: E correct (✓)\n- Position 4: B, could be correct or not\n- Position 5: A, since the secret has only one A and it\'s in 1, so A at 5 is not in the word, so (x)\n\nSimilarly, if the secret has A only in position 5, then:\n- Position 1: A is not in the word (since only in 5), so (x)\n- Position 2: M\n- Position 3: E (✓)\n- Position 4: B\n- Position 5: A (✓)\n\nIf the secret has A in both 1 and 5, then both A\'s would be correct.\n\nSo the feedback will tell us.\n\nAlso, M and B will give information.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""ameba"".\n\nBut is ""ameba"" accepted in Wordle? I think so, as it\'s in the word list.\n\nSo for the fourth guess: ""ameba""\n\nReturn in format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-)\n     - A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.\n     - R, I, S are absent.\n   - **Guess 2: ""dealt""** → D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)\n     - E and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.\n     - D, L, T are absent.\n   - **Guess 3: ""cheap""** → C(x), H(x), E(✓), A(-), P(x)\n     - E is **correct and in position 3**.\n     - A is in the word but not in position 4.\n     - C, H, P are absent.\n\n2. **Consolidate Information**:\n   - **Confirmed Letters**:\n     - E is fixed at position 3.\n     - A is present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, A must be in position 1 or 5.\n   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (from Guess 1), D, L, T (from Guess 2), C, H, P (from Guess 3). Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P.\n   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels O, U, Y).\n   - **Word Structure**: The secret word has E in position 3, and A in position 1 or 5. The remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 2, 4, 5, depending on A) must be filled with available letters.\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:\n   - Test the position of A (1 or 5) while maximizing information on new letters.\n   - Choose a word with E in position 3, A in either position 1 or 5, and three new high-frequency consonants from the available set (e.g., M, B, N).\n   - ""ameba"" (a valid English word, variant of ""amoeba"") fits perfectly:\n     - Places E in position 3 (confirmed correct).\n     - Places A in both position 1 and 5 to test the two possible cases for A:\n       - If A is only in position 1, feedback will show A(✓) at 1 and A(x) at 5.\n       - If A is only in position 5, feedback will show A(x) at 1 and A(✓) at 5.\n       - If A is in both positions, both will be ✓.\n     - Uses new letters M and B (position 2 and 4), which are common and untested.\n     - Avoids all absent letters.\n   - This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by resolving A\'s position and testing two new letters.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - Feedback for A at positions 1 and 5 will confirm the exact position of A.\n   - Feedback for M and B will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.\n   - E at position 3 is already confirmed, so it will show ✓.\n\n<guess>ameba</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: dealt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) A(-) P(x)\nGuess 4: ameba -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(✓) E(✓) B(x) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, not in position 2
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, not in position 5

Guess 2: ""dealt""
- D: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) → E is not in position 2
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is not in position 3
- L: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""cheap""
- C: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → E is in position 3
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is not in position 4
- P: absent (x)

Guess 4: ""ameba""
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 1
- M: correct position (✓) → M is in position 2
- E: correct position (✓) → E is in position 3 (already known)
- B: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) → A is in position 5

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - E is in position 3 (from Guess 3).
   - M is in position 2 (from Guess 4).
   - A is in position 5 (from Guess 4, since the second A is marked correct at position 5).

   Note: In ""ameba"", the first A is marked as present but wrong position (-), but the second A is marked correct (✓) at position 5. This means:
   - The secret word has A in position 5.
   - The first A (position 1) is not correct, but since A is present elsewhere (and we now know it's at position 5), the first A being marked (-) indicates that there is no A in position 1. However, we already know A is in position 5, so the first A being wrong position is consistent (it's because A is at 5, not 1).

   But note: the feedback for the first A is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. Since we have A at position 5, that is consistent. There might be only one A, or if there are two, the other is not at 1.

   However, from the feedback, we can deduce:
   - A is definitely in position 5 (from the ✓ at position 5).
   - The first A (position 1) is not correct, and since A is already placed at 5, the ""-"" for position 1 might indicate that there is no additional A at position 1. But it could also mean that if there were a duplicate A, it's not at 1. However, since we have a ✓ at 5, the A at 5 is fixed.

   Given that, the secret word has:
   - Position 2: M (fixed)
   - Position 3: E (fixed)
   - Position 5: A (fixed)

   So the word pattern is: _ M E _ A

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From Guess 1: R, I, S
   - From Guess 2: D, L, T
   - From Guess 3: C, H, P
   - From Guess 4: B
   - Total absent: R, I, S, D, L, T, C, H, P, B

3. **Available Letters**:
   - Remaining: F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels O, U, but we have positions to fill).

4. **Word Structure**:
   - The secret word is of the form: [letter1] M E [letter4] A
   - We need to find letter1 and letter4 from the available letters.

5. **Constraints from Feedback**:
   - In Guess 4 (""ameba""), the first A (position 1) is marked ""-"", meaning it is present but not in position 1. However, we now know that A is in position 5, and there is no other A (because if there were an A in position 1, it would have been marked as present and possibly correct or wrong position, but it's marked as present but not in 1, which is consistent with A being only at 5). But note: the ""-"" for the first A indicates that A is in the word (which we know) but not at position 1. Since we have A at 5, it doesn't require a duplicate. So likely, there is only one A.

   Therefore, letter1 and letter4 are not A.

   Also, from Guess 1, A was not in position 2; from Guess 2, not in 3; from Guess 3, not in 4; and now we know it's in 5.

6. **Possible Words**:
   - We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ M E _ A, using available letters (F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoiding absent letters.

   Examples:
   - ""OMEGA"": O M E G A → positions: 1:O, 2:M, 3:E, 4:G, 5:A. This fits the pattern. Letters: O, G are available.
   - ""UMBRA"": U M B R A → but B and R are absent (B from Guess 4, R from Guess 1). Invalid.
   - ""UNFED"": D excluded.
   - ""UMPED"": D excluded.
   - ""VEGAN"": V E G A N → but E is at position 2? V E G A N: 1:V, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N. But we need position 2 to be M, not E. So not.
   - ""WOMAN"": W O M A N → but pattern: 1:W, 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N. But we need position 3 to be E, not M. And position 5 is N, not A. So not.

   Let's list words ending with ""MEA"" but with E at position 3? The pattern is [letter] M E [letter] A.

   Common words:
   - ""omega"": as above.
   - ""ameba"" we already tried.
   - ""cameo"": C excluded.
   - ""famed"": D excluded.
   - ""gamed"": D excluded.
   - ""hamed"": D excluded.
   - ""japed"": D excluded.
   - ""kames"": S excluded.
   - ""lamed"": L and D excluded.
   - ""named"": D excluded.
   - ""pampa"": P excluded and no E.
   - ""ramee"": R excluded.
   - ""tamed"": T and D excluded.
   - ""wames"": S excluded.

   ""Omega"" seems a strong candidate.

   Other possibilities:
   - ""IMBUE"": I excluded.
   - ""UMBEL"": L excluded.
   - ""UMBER"": R excluded.
   - ""UMPED"": D excluded.
   - ""UNAUS"": S excluded.
   - ""UNMEW"": U N M E W → 1:U, 2:N, 3:M, 4:E, 5:W. But we need position 3 to be E, not M. So not.
   - ""VOMER"": V O M E R → R excluded.
   - ""WOMEN"": W O M E N → 1:W, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N. But we need position 3 to be E, not M. And position 4 is E, but we need position 4 to be filled with a letter, and position 5 is A, not N. So not.

   After reviewing, ""omega"" is a common word that fits:
   - O (position 1), M (position 2, fixed), E (position 3, fixed), G (position 4), A (position 5, fixed).

   Are there other words?
   - ""ympeh"" not a word.
   - ""zombi"" no E and not ending with A.

   So ""omega"" is a valid and common word.

   But note: in ""omega"", the letter at position 1 is O and position 4 is G, both available.

   Also, we haven't tested O or G before.

7. **Why ""omega""?**
   - It fits the fixed pattern: _ M E _ A → O M E G A.
   - It uses new letters O and G to test.
   - If correct, we solve the word. If not, we get feedback on O and G.

   Since we have only two positions to guess (1 and 4) and many letters available, ""omega"" is a strong candidate that might be the solution.

   If ""omega"" is not the word, the feedback will tell us about O and G, helping to narrow down.

   Therefore, we choose ""omega"" as the next guess.

</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: A and E are present but not in positions 2 or 5. R, I, S are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""dealt"")**: A and E are present but not in positions 3 or 2. D, L, T are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""cheap"")**: E is **correct at position 3**. A is present but not in position 4. C, H, P are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""ameba"")**: 
     - A at position 1 is present but wrong position (-), confirming A is **not in position 1**.
     - M at position 2 is correct (✓).
     - E at position 3 is correct (✓) (already known).
     - B is absent (x).
     - A at position 5 is correct (✓), **confirming A is in position 5**.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: M (from ""ameba"" feedback).
     - Position 3: E (from ""cheap"" and confirmed).
     - Position 5: A (from ""ameba"" feedback).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S (G1), D, L, T (G2), C, H, P (G3), B (G4). Total: B, C, D, H, I, L, P, R, S, T.
   - **Available Letters**: F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `[letter1] M E [letter4] A`. We need to find:
     - `letter1` (position 1) and `letter4` (position 4) from the available letters.
     - Since A is confirmed at position 5 and not position 1 (from ""ameba"" feedback), there is likely only one A in the word (no duplicates).

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - The secret word must match the pattern `_ M E _ A`.
   - Test a word that fits this pattern using high-frequency available letters (e.g., O, G, N) to maximize information if incorrect.
   - ""omega"" (O M E G A) is an optimal guess:
     - It uses available letters O and G.
     - It tests position 1 (O) and position 4 (G) directly.
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on O and G will reveal their status (present/absent) and narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If ""omega"" is correct, feedback will show all ✓.
   - If incorrect, feedback for O and G will:
     - Confirm if O is in position 1 (or present elsewhere).
     - Confirm if G is in position 4 (or present elsewhere).
     - Reduce the pool of possible words (e.g., if O is absent, focus on other starters like F, K, N; if G is absent, focus on other position-4 letters like N, W, Y).

But note: the ""-"" for the first A indicates that A is in the word (which we know) but not at position 1. Since we have A at 5, it doesn't require a duplicate. So likely, there is only one A.

   Let's list words ending with ""MEA"" but with E at position 3? The pattern is [letter] M E [letter] A.

   After reviewing, ""omega"" is a common word that fits:
   - O (position 1), M (position 2, fixed), E (position 3, fixed), G (position 4), A (position 5, fixed).

   Are there other words?
   - ""ympeh"" not a word.
   - ""zombi"" no E and not ending with A.

   So ""omega"" is a valid and common word.

   But note: in ""omega"", the letter at position 1 is O and position 4 is G, both available.

   Also, we haven't tested O or G before.

7. **Why ""omega""?**
   - It fits the fixed pattern: _ M E _ A → O M E G A.
   - It uses new letters O and G to test.
   - If correct, we solve the word. If not, we get feedback on O and G.

   Since we have only two positions to guess (1 and 4) and many letters available, ""omega"" is a strong candidate that might be the solution.

   If ""omega"" is not the word, the feedback will tell us about O and G, helping to narrow down.

   Therefore, we choose ""omega"" as the next guess.

   - **Available Letters**: F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `[letter1] M E [letter4] A`. We need to find:
     - `letter1` (position 1) and `letter4` (position 4) from the available letters.
     - Since A is confirmed at position 5 and not position 1 (from ""ameba"" feedback), there is likely only one A in the word (no duplicates).

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - The secret word must match the pattern `_ M E _ A`.
   - Test a word that fits this pattern using high-frequency available letters (e.g., O, G, N) to maximize information if incorrect.
   - ""omega"" (O M E G A) is an optimal guess:
     - It uses available letters O and G.
     - It tests position 1 (O) and position 4 (G) directly.
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on O and G will reveal their status (present/absent) and narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If ""omega"" is correct, feedback will show all ✓.
   - If incorrect, feedback for O and G will:
     - Confirm if O is in position 1 (or present elsewhere).
     - Confirm if G is in position 4 (or present elsewhere).
     - Reduce the pool of possible words (e.g., if O is absent, focus on other starters like F, K, N; if G is absent, focus on other position-4 letters like N, W, Y).",Guess 5: omega -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) M(✓) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
