We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, it's best to start with a word that has common letters to maximize the information we gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like S, T, R, N, E, A, etc.
 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" as it contains common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us which letters are present and in the correct position, which are present but wrong position, and which are absent.

 Since it's the first guess, we have no constraints. Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers common letters.

 I will choose: ""CRANE""

 But note: the game example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We can use any valid 5-letter word.

 Alternatively, another common starting word is ""SLATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for its coverage.

 After this guess, we'll get feedback and then use that to make the next guesses.

 Since it's the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The response must be in the format <guess>CRANE</guess> but note the format specified: 
    ""<guess> guessed-word </guess>""

 However, looking at the example: the user wrote the guess without spaces. So we'll write the word.

 So, our first guess: CRANE.

I need to make the first guess for the 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically include common consonants and vowels to test widespread letter coverage. Based on Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are effective because they contain frequent letters and multiple vowels.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""CRANE"" covers C (common consonant), R (frequent), A (vowel), N (common), E (vowel).  
- It avoids rare letters and has no repeats, ensuring maximum feedback.  
- Alternatives like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is slightly more balanced in consonant-vowel distribution.  

I'll start with **CRANE** to get initial feedback on letter presence/position efficiently.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

From this, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the 5th position (since the feedback shows E as correct at the end). So the secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter). So N must be in one of the first four positions, but not the 4th. Therefore, positions 1, 2, or 3 must have N.
3. The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Now for the next guess, we must:
- Include E in the 5th position since it's correct.
- Include N in the word, but not in the 4th position. Also, since we don't know its position, we should try it in a different position than in the first guess (which was position 4). So try N in position 1, 2, or 3, but avoid position 4.
- Avoid using C, R, A again since they are absent.

Our goal is to test other common letters and narrow down the position for N.

Common letters to test: We have ruled out C, R, A. We know E is fixed at the end and N is present somewhere. We can try other vowels and common consonants.

Available letters: We should consider frequent letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We also note that the word has an N and E, so words containing N and E are good.

But we must not use C, R, A.

Idea: Let's form a word that tests N in a new position and includes other frequent letters.

Since N was in position 4 and now we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3, we can try putting N in position 1 or 2 to test. Position 3 might also be possible.

Also, we need to test new letters. Since E is fixed at position 5, we can form words like _ _ _ N E? But wait: we avoid putting N in the 4th position because that was already wrong. So we must put N in 1,2, or 3.

Moreover, the word must be 5 letters long and valid.

Candidate words:

1. STONE: S T O N E
   - Would test S, T, O (new letters) and N (in position 4? But wait: we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not in position 4 from the first feedback. The first guess had N in position 4 and it was wrong.) So if we put N in position 4 again, we would expect it to be wrong? But the word might have N in position 4? Actually, no: from first feedback, N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, in STONE, putting N in position 4 would be incorrect again. We want to test a position that hasn't been tried. So we should not put N in position 4.

2. We can try a word with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
   - This tests N at the start and O, I, S. Also E is fixed at the end.

But note: feedback symbols:
- We know E is at the end (position 5), so we can expect ✓ for the E.
- We know N is in the word so we might get information on its position.

Other possibilities:

- Try ""INLET"": I N L E T -> but E is in position 4? Wait, we need E in position 5. So this word has E in position 4? Not acceptable because we must have the E in the fifth position? Actually, no. The guess must be a valid word but we are allowed to put E anywhere? However, we know the secret word has E in the fifth position, so if we put E in the fifth, we get direct feedback. But if we put E elsewhere, it might show as wrong position? Since E is known to be in the fifth position, we should keep it there in our subsequent guesses to save time. Because we know it's correct, we can fix it.

So in the next guess, we must put E at the end. Therefore, all our guesses should have E in the fifth position until we change that if we find otherwise? Actually, the feedback showed E as correct, so it is fixed at the end.

Therefore, the next guess must be ? ? ? ? E, and we have to fill the first four letters without C, R, A, and including N in one of the first three positions (since position 4 is not allowed for N).

Possible words:

- With N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
  - Tests N at position 1, and O, I, S.

- With N in position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S N I D E
  - Tests S, N at 2, I, D.

- With N in position 3: e.g., ""POINT"": P O I N T -> but ends with T? Not E. We need to end with E. So words ending with E.

Words with N in position 3 and ending with E: e.g., ""PRONE"" -> P R O N E -> but R is excluded (we know R is absent). Avoid R? We know R is absent so cannot use R.

We must not use C, R, A.

So filter letters: no C, no R, no A.

Look for 5-letter words ending in E that contain N and avoid C,R,A.

Searching common words:

- ""LINED"": L I N E D -> but E is in fourth? No, it ends with D. We need X X X E? Actually, format: position 5 must be E: so the word must end with E.

So words: _ _ _ _ E

With N in the first three positions:

1. N at position 1: NE?E? but must be 5 letters. Examples: ""NOISE"" (not ending with E? ends with E? NOISE: N,O,I,S,E -> yes, ends with E). Or ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> but no E at the end? It ends with E: NOBLE -> positions:1-N,2-O,3-B,4-L,5-E. So yes.

   But NOBLE: tests N in position 1, O, B, L.

2. N at position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S, N (pos2), I, D, E -> S N I D E.

3. N at position 3: e.g., ""POISE"": P O I S E -> but P,O,I,S -> N is missing? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So the word must contain N and E.

For position 3: words like ""PRONE"" cannot because it has R (excluded). How about ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> positions:1-P,2-H,3-O,4-N,5-E -> but N is in position 4? We want N in position 3? Position 3 is O, position 4 is N.

We want N in position 3: so letters 1,2, ?,3=N,4,5=E.

For example: ""ANODE"" -> but A is excluded? A is absent so we can't use A. ""INODE"" is not a word? ""MINCE"" -> but C is excluded and M? Let's see: M I N C E -> but contains C? Excluded. ""WOMEN"": W O M E N -> but N is position 5? We need N at 3? Position: W(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),N(5). But we need E at position 5, so that would be ... wait, WOMEN doesn't have E at the end? It ends with N? Not E. So we need words ending in E.

Hard to find with N at position 3 and without C,R,A.

Perhaps: ""PRUNE"" -> but has R? Excluded. ""TRINE"" -> has T,R? R excluded.

Another: ""SUGNE"" not a word.

Maybe: ""TUNES"": T U N E S -> ends with S? Not E. ""TUNE"" is not 5 letters.

""USHER"" no E? and not ending with E.

Perhaps better to avoid position 3 for now because it's hard to come up with a word? Or try another.

Another idea: ""THINE"": T H I N E -> ends with E? THINE: T(1),H(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). But N is in position 4? We want to avoid position 4 because we know from first guess that N is not in position 4? Or is it?

Recall: the secret word has N, but not in position 4? Because in ""CRANE"", N was at position 4 and we got ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, we know that the secret word's N is not at position 4. So putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect and not provide new information? It would confirm that it's still not at position 4? We want to test positions that could be right.

So we should avoid position 4 for N. Therefore, in THINE, N is at position 4 -> avoid? But THINE can be used? However, we know that N is not at position 4 so we don't gain new info if we put it there? And we waste a letter slot. Better to put N in an untested position: position 1,2, or 3.

So for position 3, let's try: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> ends with R? Not E. ""MINED"": M I N E D -> ends with D? Not E. ""FINED"": F I N E D -> same. But we need position 5 E. So only words that have the structure: letter1, letter2, N, letter4, E? Because if N is at position 3, then position 4 must be some letter and 5 is E.

Example: ""MINCE"" -> M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded? So invalid letter.

""PINED"": P I N E D -> but ends with D? Not E. ""PINER"" ends with R.

Hard.

Look for words: 
- ""SCONE"": S C O N E -> C is excluded? C is absent so cannot use.

Perhaps: ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> but N is at position 4? We are avoiding position 4 for N? Because we know it's not position 4. So again, don't put at 4.

So maybe it's better to prioritize testing N in position 1 or 2.

I will go with N in position 1: try ""NOBLE""

But let's also consider: we want to test many new common letters.

Word: ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> tests O, B, L.

Also: ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> tests O, I, S.

S and T are very common. Since we already have E and know the word has N, we can test S, T, O, I, etc.

Another candidate: ""ONSET"": O N S E T -> ends with T? Not E. No.

""STONE"": S T O N E -> but N is at position 4? Avoid. Because position 4 N is known wrong.

We must avoid putting N at 4.

So ""NOISE"" is good: it has N at 1 (which is untested), and tests O,I,S.

""NOISY"" ends with Y? Not E.

So ""NOISE"" seems valid.

But let's check the letters: we avoid C,R,A? Yes, none of those.

Now, what about other alternatives: ""SNIPE"": S N I P E -> N is at position 2? and E at the end.

SNIPE: S(1), N(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> This tests N at position 2 (which is untested).

Compared to NOISE: NOISE tests N at 1, while SNIPE tests at 2.

Both valid.

Which one to choose? SNIPE has P, which might be less common than S? But S is common.

SNIPE: S, N, I, P, E -> tests S, I, P.

NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> tests O, I, S.

Both are fine. But I think testing O might be better than P? Because O is a vowel.

But also, we are testing S in both? NOISE has S in position 4? And SNIPE has S in position 1? And we haven't tested S before? So that's good.

Let me choose SNIPE because it tests N at position 2, which is common? And we can see if N fits there.

Alternatively, we might try to cover more vowels? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? Well, both have I? And NOISE has one vowel more? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? But vowels are important.

Actually, both words have one vowel besides the E? SNIPE: I is a vowel? And NOISE: O and I are vowels? So NOISE has two vowels: O and I, plus E? So actually, it has more vowel coverage.

Better to test multiple vowels? But we can also test consonants.

Another word: ""OUZEL"" not common? Avoid.

I think ""NOISE"" is a better choice because it tests two new vowels (O,I) and a common consonant (S). And we test N at position 1.

But lets see the position: if we choose NOISE:

- If the secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓ for N? Also, if O at 2? etc.

We'll get feedback.

Similarly, if we choose SNIPE.

I'll go with ""SNIPE"" because it leaves positions 1 and 3 for other letters? Or ""NOISE"".

Wait, why not test a word with T? Because T is a common letter. In NOISE, we don't test T. In SNIPE, we don't test T.

We might include T.

Candidate: ""UNTIE"" -> but U N T I E -> this ends with E? UNTIE: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). So N at position 2? Also tests U, T, I.

But U is not as common as O? And we avoid C,R,A? Yes.

T is a very common letter. So ""UNTIE"" might be good: tests U, N, T, I.

U is a vowel but less common? We have already an E, so testing other vowels is good.

Alternatively, ""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N in position 4? Avoid? We know N is not at position 4? So we skip.

""ELUDE"" doesn't have N? We must include N.

Another: ""NICHE"" -> but has C? Absent.

""THINE"": T H I N E -> N at position 4? Avoid.

Back to UNTIE: U N T I E -> tests U at position 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4. And avoids bad letters.

This word tests T, which is common, and I,U.

We can compare UNTIE and SNIPE: both test N at position 2? SNIPE: S at 1, N at 2? And UNTIE: U at 1, N at 2? Then T and I in different positions.

UNTIE might be less common? But it is a valid word.

I think it's better to use a word with more common letters: S and T would be ideal.

But we can't get both? How about ""STOLE"" -> but OLE? Ends with E but no N? We must include N.

Unless we don't? But we know N is in the word, so we need to test its position? Not necessarily: we could skip N for now? But that might be inefficient because we can test it.

Actually, we can skip testing N if we test other letters? For example, we know E is fixed? And then test other letters? But we know N must be somewhere? So if we don't include N, we might lose an opportunity to locate it.

So we must include N to get feedback on its position.

Therefore, UNTIE: valid? But UNTIE includes I and T? And U? U is less common? But acceptable.

Another word: ""POINT"" -> ends with T? Not E. Not possible.

""JOINT"",""POINT"" same.

I think SNIPE or NOISE are better? Or perhaps ""LINEY"" not common.

Decision: I'll pick ""SNIPE"" because S and P are common consonants and we get to test N at position 2.

But let's write the word: SNIPE.

So guess: S N I P E
</think>
After the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)), we know:
1. E is in the word and in the 5th position.
2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was marked as wrong position in the 4th spot).
3. C, R, and A are absent from the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not N or C/R/A] E, with N appearing in positions 1, 2, or 3. 

For the second guess:
- We must include N (in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new locations) and E in the 5th position.
- We should avoid C, R, and A.
- Maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, I, O, L, P, etc.

""SNIPE"" is a strong choice because:
- It places E correctly at position 5.
- It tests N in position 2 (new position).
- It introduces three new common letters: S, I, P.
- S and I are high-frequency letters, providing more coverage.

If N is in position 2, it may reveal a match. S, I, or P appearing could quickly narrow down possibilities.

<guess>SNIPE</guess>",SNIPE,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

From this, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the 5th position (since the feedback shows E as correct at the end). So the secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter). So N must be in one of the first four positions, but not the 4th. Therefore, positions 1, 2, or 3 must have N.
3. The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Now for the next guess, we must:
- Include E in the 5th position since it's correct.
- Include N in the word, but not in the 4th position. Also, since we don't know its position, we should try it in a different position than in the first guess (which was position 4). So try N in position 1, 2, or 3, but avoid position 4.
- Avoid using C, R, A again since they are absent.

Our goal is to test other common letters and narrow down the position for N.

Common letters to test: We have ruled out C, R, A. We know E is fixed at the end and N is present somewhere. We can try other vowels and common consonants.

Available letters: We should consider frequent letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We also note that the word has an N and E, so words containing N and E are good.

But we must not use C, R, A.

Idea: Let's form a word that tests N in a new position and includes other frequent letters.

Since N was in position 4 and now we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3, we can try putting N in position 1 or 2 to test. Position 3 might also be possible.

Also, we need to test new letters. Since E is fixed at position 5, we can form words like _ _ _ N E? But wait: we avoid putting N in the 4th position because that was already wrong. So we must put N in 1,2, or 3.

Moreover, the word must be 5 letters long and valid.

Candidate words:

1. STONE: S T O N E
   - Would test S, T, O (new letters) and N (in position 4? But wait: we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not in position 4 from the first feedback. The first guess had N in position 4 and it was wrong.) So if we put N in position 4 again, we would expect it to be wrong? But the word might have N in position 4? Actually, no: from first feedback, N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, in STONE, putting N in position 4 would be incorrect again. We want to test a position that hasn't been tried. So we should not put N in position 4.

2. We can try a word with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
   - This tests N at the start and O, I, S. Also E is fixed at the end.

But note: feedback symbols:
- We know E is at the end (position 5), so we can expect ✓ for the E.
- We know N is in the word so we might get information on its position.

Other possibilities:

- Try ""INLET"": I N L E T -> but E is in position 4? Wait, we need E in position 5. So this word has E in position 4? Not acceptable because we must have the E in the fifth position? Actually, no. The guess must be a valid word but we are allowed to put E anywhere? However, we know the secret word has E in the fifth position, so if we put E in the fifth, we get direct feedback. But if we put E elsewhere, it might show as wrong position? Since E is known to be in the fifth position, we should keep it there in our subsequent guesses to save time. Because we know it's correct, we can fix it.

So in the next guess, we must put E at the end. Therefore, all our guesses should have E in the fifth position until we change that if we find otherwise? Actually, the feedback showed E as correct, so it is fixed at the end.

Therefore, the next guess must be ? ? ? ? E, and we have to fill the first four letters without C, R, A, and including N in one of the first three positions (since position 4 is not allowed for N).

Possible words:

- With N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
  - Tests N at position 1, and O, I, S.

- With N in position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S N I D E
  - Tests S, N at 2, I, D.

- With N in position 3: e.g., ""POINT"": P O I N T -> but ends with T? Not E. We need to end with E. So words ending with E.

Words with N in position 3 and ending with E: e.g., ""PRONE"" -> P R O N E -> but R is excluded (we know R is absent). Avoid R? We know R is absent so cannot use R.

We must not use C, R, A.

So filter letters: no C, no R, no A.

Look for 5-letter words ending in E that contain N and avoid C,R,A.

Searching common words:

- ""LINED"": L I N E D -> but E is in fourth? No, it ends with D. We need X X X E? Actually, format: position 5 must be E: so the word must end with E.

So words: _ _ _ _ E

With N in the first three positions:

1. N at position 1: NE?E? but must be 5 letters. Examples: ""NOISE"" (not ending with E? ends with E? NOISE: N,O,I,S,E -> yes, ends with E). Or ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> but no E at the end? It ends with E: NOBLE -> positions:1-N,2-O,3-B,4-L,5-E. So yes.

   But NOBLE: tests N in position 1, O, B, L.

2. N at position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S, N (pos2), I, D, E -> S N I D E.

3. N at position 3: e.g., ""POISE"": P O I S E -> but P,O,I,S -> N is missing? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So the word must contain N and E.

For position 3: words like ""PRONE"" cannot because it has R (excluded). How about ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> positions:1-P,2-H,3-O,4-N,5-E -> but N is in position 4? We want N in position 3? Position 3 is O, position 4 is N.

We want N in position 3: so letters 1,2, ?,3=N,4,5=E.

For example: ""ANODE"" -> but A is excluded? A is absent so we can't use A. ""INODE"" is not a word? ""MINCE"" -> but C is excluded and M? Let's see: M I N C E -> but contains C? Excluded. ""WOMEN"": W O M E N -> but N is position 5? We need N at 3? Position: W(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),N(5). But we need E at position 5, so that would be ... wait, WOMEN doesn't have E at the end? It ends with N? Not E. So we need words ending in E.

Hard to find with N at position 3 and without C,R,A.

Perhaps: ""PRUNE"" -> but has R? Excluded. ""TRINE"" -> has T,R? R excluded.

Another: ""SUGNE"" not a word.

Maybe: ""TUNES"": T U N E S -> ends with S? Not E. ""TUNE"" is not 5 letters.

""USHER"" no E? and not ending with E.

Perhaps better to avoid position 3 for now because it's hard to come up with a word? Or try another.

Another idea: ""THINE"": T H I N E -> ends with E? THINE: T(1),H(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). But N is in position 4? We want to avoid position 4 because we know from first guess that N is not in position 4? Or is it?

Recall: the secret word has N, but not in position 4? Because in ""CRANE"", N was at position 4 and we got ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, we know that the secret word's N is not at position 4. So putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect and not provide new information? It would confirm that it's still not at position 4? We want to test positions that could be right.

So we should avoid position 4 for N. Therefore, in THINE, N is at position 4 -> avoid? But THINE can be used? However, we know that N is not at position 4 so we don't gain new info if we put it there? And we waste a letter slot. Better to put N in an untested position: position 1,2, or 3.

So for position 3, let's try: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> ends with R? Not E. ""MINED"": M I N E D -> ends with D? Not E. ""FINED"": F I N E D -> same. But we need position 5 E. So only words that have the structure: letter1, letter2, N, letter4, E? Because if N is at position 3, then position 4 must be some letter and 5 is E.

Example: ""MINCE"" -> M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded? So invalid letter.

""PINED"": P I N E D -> but ends with D? Not E. ""PINER"" ends with R.

Hard.

Look for words: 
- ""SCONE"": S C O N E -> C is excluded? C is absent so cannot use.

Perhaps: ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> but N is at position 4? We are avoiding position 4 for N? Because we know it's not position 4. So again, don't put at 4.

So maybe it's better to prioritize testing N in position 1 or 2.

I will go with N in position 1: try ""NOBLE""

But let's also consider: we want to test many new common letters.

Word: ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> tests O, B, L.

Also: ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> tests O, I, S.

S and T are very common. Since we already have E and know the word has N, we can test S, T, O, I, etc.

Another candidate: ""ONSET"": O N S E T -> ends with T? Not E. No.

""STONE"": S T O N E -> but N is at position 4? Avoid. Because position 4 N is known wrong.

We must avoid putting N at 4.

So ""NOISE"" is good: it has N at 1 (which is untested), and tests O,I,S.

""NOISY"" ends with Y? Not E.

So ""NOISE"" seems valid.

But let's check the letters: we avoid C,R,A? Yes, none of those.

Now, what about other alternatives: ""SNIPE"": S N I P E -> N is at position 2? and E at the end.

SNIPE: S(1), N(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> This tests N at position 2 (which is untested).

Compared to NOISE: NOISE tests N at 1, while SNIPE tests at 2.

Both valid.

Which one to choose? SNIPE has P, which might be less common than S? But S is common.

SNIPE: S, N, I, P, E -> tests S, I, P.

NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> tests O, I, S.

Both are fine. But I think testing O might be better than P? Because O is a vowel.

But also, we are testing S in both? NOISE has S in position 4? And SNIPE has S in position 1? And we haven't tested S before? So that's good.

Let me choose SNIPE because it tests N at position 2, which is common? And we can see if N fits there.

Alternatively, we might try to cover more vowels? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? Well, both have I? And NOISE has one vowel more? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? But vowels are important.

Actually, both words have one vowel besides the E? SNIPE: I is a vowel? And NOISE: O and I are vowels? So NOISE has two vowels: O and I, plus E? So actually, it has more vowel coverage.

Better to test multiple vowels? But we can also test consonants.

Another word: ""OUZEL"" not common? Avoid.

I think ""NOISE"" is a better choice because it tests two new vowels (O,I) and a common consonant (S). And we test N at position 1.

But lets see the position: if we choose NOISE:

- If the secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓ for N? Also, if O at 2? etc.

We'll get feedback.

Similarly, if we choose SNIPE.

I'll go with ""SNIPE"" because it leaves positions 1 and 3 for other letters? Or ""NOISE"".

Wait, why not test a word with T? Because T is a common letter. In NOISE, we don't test T. In SNIPE, we don't test T.

We might include T.

Candidate: ""UNTIE"" -> but U N T I E -> this ends with E? UNTIE: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). So N at position 2? Also tests U, T, I.

But U is not as common as O? And we avoid C,R,A? Yes.

T is a very common letter. So ""UNTIE"" might be good: tests U, N, T, I.

U is a vowel but less common? We have already an E, so testing other vowels is good.

Alternatively, ""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N in position 4? Avoid? We know N is not at position 4? So we skip.

""ELUDE"" doesn't have N? We must include N.

Another: ""NICHE"" -> but has C? Absent.

""THINE"": T H I N E -> N at position 4? Avoid.

Back to UNTIE: U N T I E -> tests U at position 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4. And avoids bad letters.

This word tests T, which is common, and I,U.

We can compare UNTIE and SNIPE: both test N at position 2? SNIPE: S at 1, N at 2? And UNTIE: U at 1, N at 2? Then T and I in different positions.

UNTIE might be less common? But it is a valid word.

I think it's better to use a word with more common letters: S and T would be ideal.

But we can't get both? How about ""STOLE"" -> but OLE? Ends with E but no N? We must include N.

Unless we don't? But we know N is in the word, so we need to test its position? Not necessarily: we could skip N for now? But that might be inefficient because we can test it.

Actually, we can skip testing N if we test other letters? For example, we know E is fixed? And then test other letters? But we know N must be somewhere? So if we don't include N, we might lose an opportunity to locate it.

So we must include N to get feedback on its position.

Therefore, UNTIE: valid? But UNTIE includes I and T? And U? U is less common? But acceptable.

Another word: ""POINT"" -> ends with T? Not E. Not possible.

""JOINT"",""POINT"" same.

I think SNIPE or NOISE are better? Or perhaps ""LINEY"" not common.

Decision: I'll pick ""SNIPE"" because S and P are common consonants and we get to test N at position 2.

But let's write the word: SNIPE.

So guess: S N I P EAfter the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)), we know:
1. E is in the word and in the 5th position.
2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was marked as wrong position in the 4th spot).
3. C, R, and A are absent from the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not N or C/R/A] E, with N appearing in positions 1, 2, or 3. 

For the second guess:
- We must include N (in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new locations) and E in the 5th position.
- We should avoid C, R, and A.
- Maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, I, O, L, P, etc.

""SNIPE"" is a strong choice because:
- It places E correctly at position 5.
- It tests N in position 2 (new position).
- It introduces three new common letters: S, I, P.
- S and I are high-frequency letters, providing more coverage.

If N is in position 2, it may reveal a match. S, I, or P appearing could quickly narrow down possibilities.",Guess 2: SNIPE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(-) I(x) P(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,DENSE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, it's best to start with a word that has common letters to maximize the information we gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like S, T, R, N, E, A, etc.
 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" as it contains common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us which letters are present and in the correct position, which are present but wrong position, and which are absent.

 Since it's the first guess, we have no constraints. Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers common letters.

 I will choose: ""CRANE""

 But note: the game example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We can use any valid 5-letter word.

 Alternatively, another common starting word is ""SLATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for its coverage.

 After this guess, we'll get feedback and then use that to make the next guesses.

 Since it's the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The response must be in the format <guess>CRANE</guess> but note the format specified: 
    ""<guess> guessed-word </guess>""

 However, looking at the example: the user wrote the guess without spaces. So we'll write the word.

 So, our first guess: CRANE.I need to make the first guess for the 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically include common consonants and vowels to test widespread letter coverage. Based on Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are effective because they contain frequent letters and multiple vowels.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""CRANE"" covers C (common consonant), R (frequent), A (vowel), N (common), E (vowel).  
- It avoids rare letters and has no repeats, ensuring maximum feedback.  
- Alternatives like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is slightly more balanced in consonant-vowel distribution.  

I'll start with **CRANE** to get initial feedback on letter presence/position efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

From this, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the 5th position (since the feedback shows E as correct at the end). So the secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter). So N must be in one of the first four positions, but not the 4th. Therefore, positions 1, 2, or 3 must have N.
3. The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Now for the next guess, we must:
- Include E in the 5th position since it's correct.
- Include N in the word, but not in the 4th position. Also, since we don't know its position, we should try it in a different position than in the first guess (which was position 4). So try N in position 1, 2, or 3, but avoid position 4.
- Avoid using C, R, A again since they are absent.

Our goal is to test other common letters and narrow down the position for N.

Common letters to test: We have ruled out C, R, A. We know E is fixed at the end and N is present somewhere. We can try other vowels and common consonants.

Available letters: We should consider frequent letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We also note that the word has an N and E, so words containing N and E are good.

But we must not use C, R, A.

Idea: Let's form a word that tests N in a new position and includes other frequent letters.

Since N was in position 4 and now we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3, we can try putting N in position 1 or 2 to test. Position 3 might also be possible.

Also, we need to test new letters. Since E is fixed at position 5, we can form words like _ _ _ N E? But wait: we avoid putting N in the 4th position because that was already wrong. So we must put N in 1,2, or 3.

Moreover, the word must be 5 letters long and valid.

Candidate words:

1. STONE: S T O N E
   - Would test S, T, O (new letters) and N (in position 4? But wait: we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not in position 4 from the first feedback. The first guess had N in position 4 and it was wrong.) So if we put N in position 4 again, we would expect it to be wrong? But the word might have N in position 4? Actually, no: from first feedback, N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, in STONE, putting N in position 4 would be incorrect again. We want to test a position that hasn't been tried. So we should not put N in position 4.

2. We can try a word with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
   - This tests N at the start and O, I, S. Also E is fixed at the end.

But note: feedback symbols:
- We know E is at the end (position 5), so we can expect ✓ for the E.
- We know N is in the word so we might get information on its position.

Other possibilities:

- Try ""INLET"": I N L E T -> but E is in position 4? Wait, we need E in position 5. So this word has E in position 4? Not acceptable because we must have the E in the fifth position? Actually, no. The guess must be a valid word but we are allowed to put E anywhere? However, we know the secret word has E in the fifth position, so if we put E in the fifth, we get direct feedback. But if we put E elsewhere, it might show as wrong position? Since E is known to be in the fifth position, we should keep it there in our subsequent guesses to save time. Because we know it's correct, we can fix it.

So in the next guess, we must put E at the end. Therefore, all our guesses should have E in the fifth position until we change that if we find otherwise? Actually, the feedback showed E as correct, so it is fixed at the end.

Therefore, the next guess must be ? ? ? ? E, and we have to fill the first four letters without C, R, A, and including N in one of the first three positions (since position 4 is not allowed for N).

Possible words:

- With N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
  - Tests N at position 1, and O, I, S.

- With N in position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S N I D E
  - Tests S, N at 2, I, D.

- With N in position 3: e.g., ""POINT"": P O I N T -> but ends with T? Not E. We need to end with E. So words ending with E.

Words with N in position 3 and ending with E: e.g., ""PRONE"" -> P R O N E -> but R is excluded (we know R is absent). Avoid R? We know R is absent so cannot use R.

We must not use C, R, A.

So filter letters: no C, no R, no A.

Look for 5-letter words ending in E that contain N and avoid C,R,A.

Searching common words:

- ""LINED"": L I N E D -> but E is in fourth? No, it ends with D. We need X X X E? Actually, format: position 5 must be E: so the word must end with E.

So words: _ _ _ _ E

With N in the first three positions:

1. N at position 1: NE?E? but must be 5 letters. Examples: ""NOISE"" (not ending with E? ends with E? NOISE: N,O,I,S,E -> yes, ends with E). Or ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> but no E at the end? It ends with E: NOBLE -> positions:1-N,2-O,3-B,4-L,5-E. So yes.

   But NOBLE: tests N in position 1, O, B, L.

2. N at position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S, N (pos2), I, D, E -> S N I D E.

3. N at position 3: e.g., ""POISE"": P O I S E -> but P,O,I,S -> N is missing? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So the word must contain N and E.

For position 3: words like ""PRONE"" cannot because it has R (excluded). How about ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> positions:1-P,2-H,3-O,4-N,5-E -> but N is in position 4? We want N in position 3? Position 3 is O, position 4 is N.

We want N in position 3: so letters 1,2, ?,3=N,4,5=E.

For example: ""ANODE"" -> but A is excluded? A is absent so we can't use A. ""INODE"" is not a word? ""MINCE"" -> but C is excluded and M? Let's see: M I N C E -> but contains C? Excluded. ""WOMEN"": W O M E N -> but N is position 5? We need N at 3? Position: W(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),N(5). But we need E at position 5, so that would be ... wait, WOMEN doesn't have E at the end? It ends with N? Not E. So we need words ending in E.

Hard to find with N at position 3 and without C,R,A.

Perhaps: ""PRUNE"" -> but has R? Excluded. ""TRINE"" -> has T,R? R excluded.

Another: ""SUGNE"" not a word.

Maybe: ""TUNES"": T U N E S -> ends with S? Not E. ""TUNE"" is not 5 letters.

""USHER"" no E? and not ending with E.

Perhaps better to avoid position 3 for now because it's hard to come up with a word? Or try another.

Another idea: ""THINE"": T H I N E -> ends with E? THINE: T(1),H(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). But N is in position 4? We want to avoid position 4 because we know from first guess that N is not in position 4? Or is it?

Recall: the secret word has N, but not in position 4? Because in ""CRANE"", N was at position 4 and we got ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, we know that the secret word's N is not at position 4. So putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect and not provide new information? It would confirm that it's still not at position 4? We want to test positions that could be right.

So we should avoid position 4 for N. Therefore, in THINE, N is at position 4 -> avoid? But THINE can be used? However, we know that N is not at position 4 so we don't gain new info if we put it there? And we waste a letter slot. Better to put N in an untested position: position 1,2, or 3.

So for position 3, let's try: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> ends with R? Not E. ""MINED"": M I N E D -> ends with D? Not E. ""FINED"": F I N E D -> same. But we need position 5 E. So only words that have the structure: letter1, letter2, N, letter4, E? Because if N is at position 3, then position 4 must be some letter and 5 is E.

Example: ""MINCE"" -> M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded? So invalid letter.

""PINED"": P I N E D -> but ends with D? Not E. ""PINER"" ends with R.

Hard.

Look for words: 
- ""SCONE"": S C O N E -> C is excluded? C is absent so cannot use.

Perhaps: ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> but N is at position 4? We are avoiding position 4 for N? Because we know it's not position 4. So again, don't put at 4.

So maybe it's better to prioritize testing N in position 1 or 2.

I will go with N in position 1: try ""NOBLE""

But let's also consider: we want to test many new common letters.

Word: ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> tests O, B, L.

Also: ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> tests O, I, S.

S and T are very common. Since we already have E and know the word has N, we can test S, T, O, I, etc.

Another candidate: ""ONSET"": O N S E T -> ends with T? Not E. No.

""STONE"": S T O N E -> but N is at position 4? Avoid. Because position 4 N is known wrong.

We must avoid putting N at 4.

So ""NOISE"" is good: it has N at 1 (which is untested), and tests O,I,S.

""NOISY"" ends with Y? Not E.

So ""NOISE"" seems valid.

But let's check the letters: we avoid C,R,A? Yes, none of those.

Now, what about other alternatives: ""SNIPE"": S N I P E -> N is at position 2? and E at the end.

SNIPE: S(1), N(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> This tests N at position 2 (which is untested).

Compared to NOISE: NOISE tests N at 1, while SNIPE tests at 2.

Both valid.

Which one to choose? SNIPE has P, which might be less common than S? But S is common.

SNIPE: S, N, I, P, E -> tests S, I, P.

NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> tests O, I, S.

Both are fine. But I think testing O might be better than P? Because O is a vowel.

But also, we are testing S in both? NOISE has S in position 4? And SNIPE has S in position 1? And we haven't tested S before? So that's good.

Let me choose SNIPE because it tests N at position 2, which is common? And we can see if N fits there.

Alternatively, we might try to cover more vowels? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? Well, both have I? And NOISE has one vowel more? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? But vowels are important.

Actually, both words have one vowel besides the E? SNIPE: I is a vowel? And NOISE: O and I are vowels? So NOISE has two vowels: O and I, plus E? So actually, it has more vowel coverage.

Better to test multiple vowels? But we can also test consonants.

Another word: ""OUZEL"" not common? Avoid.

I think ""NOISE"" is a better choice because it tests two new vowels (O,I) and a common consonant (S). And we test N at position 1.

But lets see the position: if we choose NOISE:

- If the secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓ for N? Also, if O at 2? etc.

We'll get feedback.

Similarly, if we choose SNIPE.

I'll go with ""SNIPE"" because it leaves positions 1 and 3 for other letters? Or ""NOISE"".

Wait, why not test a word with T? Because T is a common letter. In NOISE, we don't test T. In SNIPE, we don't test T.

We might include T.

Candidate: ""UNTIE"" -> but U N T I E -> this ends with E? UNTIE: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). So N at position 2? Also tests U, T, I.

But U is not as common as O? And we avoid C,R,A? Yes.

T is a very common letter. So ""UNTIE"" might be good: tests U, N, T, I.

U is a vowel but less common? We have already an E, so testing other vowels is good.

Alternatively, ""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N in position 4? Avoid? We know N is not at position 4? So we skip.

""ELUDE"" doesn't have N? We must include N.

Another: ""NICHE"" -> but has C? Absent.

""THINE"": T H I N E -> N at position 4? Avoid.

Back to UNTIE: U N T I E -> tests U at position 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4. And avoids bad letters.

This word tests T, which is common, and I,U.

We can compare UNTIE and SNIPE: both test N at position 2? SNIPE: S at 1, N at 2? And UNTIE: U at 1, N at 2? Then T and I in different positions.

UNTIE might be less common? But it is a valid word.

I think it's better to use a word with more common letters: S and T would be ideal.

But we can't get both? How about ""STOLE"" -> but OLE? Ends with E but no N? We must include N.

Unless we don't? But we know N is in the word, so we need to test its position? Not necessarily: we could skip N for now? But that might be inefficient because we can test it.

Actually, we can skip testing N if we test other letters? For example, we know E is fixed? And then test other letters? But we know N must be somewhere? So if we don't include N, we might lose an opportunity to locate it.

So we must include N to get feedback on its position.

Therefore, UNTIE: valid? But UNTIE includes I and T? And U? U is less common? But acceptable.

Another word: ""POINT"" -> ends with T? Not E. Not possible.

""JOINT"",""POINT"" same.

I think SNIPE or NOISE are better? Or perhaps ""LINEY"" not common.

Decision: I'll pick ""SNIPE"" because S and P are common consonants and we get to test N at position 2.

But let's write the word: SNIPE.

So guess: S N I P EAfter the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)), we know:
1. E is in the word and in the 5th position.
2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was marked as wrong position in the 4th spot).
3. C, R, and A are absent from the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not N or C/R/A] E, with N appearing in positions 1, 2, or 3. 

For the second guess:
- We must include N (in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new locations) and E in the 5th position.
- We should avoid C, R, and A.
- Maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, I, O, L, P, etc.

""SNIPE"" is a strong choice because:
- It places E correctly at position 5.
- It tests N in position 2 (new position).
- It introduces three new common letters: S, I, P.
- S and I are high-frequency letters, providing more coverage.

If N is in position 2, it may reveal a match. S, I, or P appearing could quickly narrow down possibilities.

The letter E is in the word and it is in the 5th position (since the feedback shows E as correct at the end). So the secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E\n2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter). So N must be in one of the first four positions, but not the 4th. Therefore, positions 1, 2, or 3 must have N.\n3. The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n\nNow for the next guess, we must:\n- Include E in the 5th position since it\'s correct.\n- Include N in the word, but not in the 4th position.

Position 3 might also be possible.\n\nAlso, we need to test new letters. Since E is fixed at position 5, we can form words like _ _ _ N E? But wait: we avoid putting N in the 4th position because that was already wrong. So we must put N in 1,2, or 3.\n\nMoreover, the word must be 5 letters long and valid.\n\nCandidate words:\n\n1. STONE: S T O N E\n   - Would test S, T, O (new letters) and N (in position 4? But wait: we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not in position 4 from the first feedback. The first guess had N in position 4 and it was wrong.) So if we put N in position 4 again, we would expect it to be wrong? But the word might have N in position 4? Actually, no: from first feedback, N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, in STONE, putting N in position 4 would be incorrect again. We want to test a position that hasn\'t been tried. So we should not put N in position 4.\n\n2. We can try a word with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E\n   - This tests N at the start and O, I, S. Also E is fixed at the end.\n\nBut note: feedback symbols:\n- We know E is at the end (position 5), so we can expect ✓ for the E.\n- We know N is in the word so we might get information on its position.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- Try ""INLET"": I N L E T -> but E is in position 4? Wait, we need E in position 5. So this word has E in position 4? Not acceptable because we must have the E in the fifth position? Actually, no. The guess must be a valid word but we are allowed to put E anywhere? However, we know the secret word has E in the fifth position, so if we put E in the fifth, we get direct feedback. But if we put E elsewhere, it might show as wrong position? Since E is known to be in the fifth position, we should keep it there in our subsequent guesses to save time. Because we know it\'s correct, we can fix it.\n\nSo in the next guess, we must put E at the end. Therefore, all our guesses should have E in the fifth position until we change that if we find otherwise? Actually, the feedback showed E as correct, so it is fixed at the end.\n\nTherefore, the next guess must be ? ? ? ? E, and we have to fill the first four letters without C, R, A, and including N in one of the first three positions (since position 4 is not allowed for N).\n\nPossible words:\n\n- With N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E\n  - Tests N at position 1, and O, I, S.\n\n- With N in position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S N I D E\n  - Tests S, N at 2, I, D.\n\n- With N in position 3: e.g., ""POINT"": P O I N T -> but ends with T? Not E. We need to end with E. So words ending with E.\n\nWords with N in position 3 and ending with E: e.g., ""PRONE"" -> P R O N E -> but R is excluded (we know R is absent). Avoid R? We know R is absent so cannot use R.\n\nWe must not use C, R, A.\n\nSo filter letters: no C, no R, no A.\n\nLook for 5-letter words ending in E that contain N and avoid C,R,A.\n\nSearching common words:\n\n- ""LINED"": L I N E D -> but E is in fourth? No, it ends with D. We need X X X E? Actually, format: position 5 must be E: so the word must end with E.\n\nSo words: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWith N in the first three positions:\n\n1. N at position 1: NE?E? but must be 5 letters. Examples: ""NOISE"" (not ending with E? ends with E? NOISE: N,O,I,S,E -> yes, ends with E). Or ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> but no E at the end? It ends with E: NOBLE -> positions:1-N,2-O,3-B,4-L,5-E. So yes.\n\n   But NOBLE: tests N in position 1, O, B, L.\n\n2. N at position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S, N (pos2), I, D, E -> S N I D E.\n\n3. N at position 3: e.g., ""POISE"": P O I S E -> but P,O,I,S -> N is missing? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So the word must contain N and E.\n\nFor position 3: words like ""PRONE"" cannot because it has R (excluded). How about ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> positions:1-P,2-H,3-O,4-N,5-E -> but N is in position 4? We want N in position 3? Position 3 is O, position 4 is N.\n\nWe want N in position 3: so letters 1,2, ?,3=N,4,5=E.\n\nFor example: ""ANODE"" -> but A is excluded? A is absent so we can\'t use A. ""INODE"" is not a word? ""MINCE"" -> but C is excluded and M? Let\'s see: M I N C E -> but contains C? Excluded. ""WOMEN"": W O M E N -> but N is position 5? We need N at 3? Position: W(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),N(5). But we need E at position 5, so that would be ... wait, WOMEN doesn\'t have E at the end? It ends with N? Not E. So we need words ending in E.\n\nHard to find with N at position 3 and without C,R,A.\n\nPerhaps: ""PRUNE"" -> but has R? Excluded. ""TRINE"" -> has T,R? R excluded.\n\nAnother: ""SUGNE"" not a word.\n\nMaybe: ""TUNES"": T U N E S -> ends with S? Not E. ""TUNE"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""USHER"" no E? and not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps better to avoid position 3 for now because it\'s hard to come up with a word? Or try another.\n\nAnother idea: ""THINE"": T H I N E -> ends with E? THINE: T(1),H(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). But N is in position 4? We want to avoid position 4 because we know from first guess that N is not in position 4? Or is it?\n\nRecall: the secret word has N, but not in position 4? Because in ""CRANE"", N was at position 4 and we got ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, we know that the secret word\'s N is not at position 4. So putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect and not provide new information? It would confirm that it\'s still not at position 4? We want to test positions that could be right.\n\nSo we should avoid position 4 for N. Therefore, in THINE, N is at position 4 -> avoid? But THINE can be used? However, we know that N is not at position 4 so we don\'t gain new info if we put it there? And we waste a letter slot. Better to put N in an untested position: position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo for position 3, let\'s try: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> ends with R? Not E. ""MINED"": M I N E D -> ends with D? Not E. ""FINED"": F I N E D -> same. But we need position 5 E. So only words that have the structure: letter1, letter2, N, letter4, E? Because if N is at position 3, then position 4 must be some letter and 5 is E.\n\nExample: ""MINCE"" -> M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded? So invalid letter.\n\n""PINED"": P I N E D -> but ends with D? Not E. ""PINER"" ends with R.\n\nHard.\n\nLook for words: \n- ""SCONE"": S C O N E -> C is excluded? C is absent so cannot use.\n\nPerhaps: ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> but N is at position 4? We are avoiding position 4 for N? Because we know it\'s not position 4. So again, don\'t put at 4.\n\nSo maybe it\'s better to prioritize testing N in position 1 or 2.\n\nI will go with N in position 1: try ""NOBLE""\n\nBut let\'s also consider: we want to test many new common letters.\n\nWord: ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> tests O, B, L.\n\nAlso: ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> tests O, I, S.\n\nS and T are very common.

Yes, none of those.\n\nNow, what about other alternatives: ""SNIPE"": S N I P E -> N is at position 2? and E at the end.\n\nSNIPE: S(1), N(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> This tests N at position 2 (which is untested).\n\nCompared to NOISE: NOISE tests N at 1, while SNIPE tests at 2.\n\nBoth valid.\n\nWhich one to choose?

But I think testing O might be better than P? Because O is a vowel.\n\nBut also, we are testing S in both? NOISE has S in position 4? And SNIPE has S in position 1? And we haven\'t tested S before?

Now, we have feedback from two guesses:

Combining the information:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, I, P
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and now not in position 2 (from second guess). From first guess, N was tested in position 4, and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there.

- S is present but not in position 1 (from second guess's S(-)). So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But positions available: we have four slots: 1,2,3,4. Absolutes:
  - Position 5: E ✓
  - Positions to fill: 1,2,3,4
  - S cannot be in position 1 (tried in SNIPE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Since N can only be in 1 or 3, and S can be in 2,3,4, but note: if N is in position 1, then S can't be in 1, so S could be in 2,3,4. If N is in position 3, then S can be in 2 or 4 (since position 3 is taken by N).

We need to guess a word that fits:
- Must include S and N (since they are present).
- Must end with E.
- Must not contain C, R, A, I, P.
- Test new letters to find others.

Common letters not yet tested: T, O, L, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.

Given constraints:
- Word pattern: ? ? ? ? E
- Must have S in it (somewhere but not position 1)
- Must have N in position 1 or 3.
- Avoid letters: C, R, A, I, P

Let's brainstorm words based on N position:

Case 1: N in position 1
- Then word starts with N, pattern: N ? ? ? E
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- We need to fill the other slots with new letters.

Possible words:
- N O S E S? No, not 5 letters? N O S E is 4. Or ""NOSE"" is 4, need 5.
- 5-letter words: like ""NOBLE"" but E? ""NOBLE"" ends with E? N-O-B-L-E → positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) - but O and B are not ruled out? But we have S to include? Must include S. ""NOBLE"" doesn't have S.
- ""NOISE"": But I is absent? We know I is absent (from SNIPE feedback), so cannot include I. Similarly, P absent. So ""NOISE"" invalid.
- ""NURSE"": N U R S E → but R is absent? R is absent (from first feedback). Cannot use R.
- ""NUDGE"": N U D G E → includes U,D,G,E. Does it have S? No.
- How about ""NYMPH"" no E, not ending E.
- ""NASTY"" ends with Y, not E.
- ""NAMES"": N A M E S → A absent? A is absent, invalid.
- ""NOSES"": N O S E S → ends with S? Should end E? We need position 5 E. ""NOSES"" has S in pos5? N(1),O(2),S(3),E(4),S(5) — E is in position 4? Not position 5. Invalid because E must be at end.
- Need words like N ? ? ? E with S in it.
- ""NOELS""? Not common. ""NUTSE""? Invalid.
- ""NIGER"" has G and E? But has R? And ends R? Not E.

This is tough. Maybe N in position 1 is less likely? But possible.

Case 2: N in position 3
- Pattern: ? ? N ? E
- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied by something else? Position 1 is free).
- Also, position 2 can be S, or position 4 can be S.

Possible words:
- With S in position 2: E.g., ""USNEE""? Not a word.
- Standard words: like ""STONE"" but O, T? But S is position 1? But in ""STONE"", S is position 1? But S cannot be in position 1? From feedback, S is not in position 1. So we cannot have words with S at position 1.
- If S is in position 2: Pattern: _ S N ? E
- Fill: First position: must be a letter not C,R,A,I,P. Possible T, O, L, U, etc.
- Third position N? Position 3 is N? Pattern: position 1, S at 2, N at 3, then ? at 4, E at 5.
- Examples: ""ASIDE"" → A absent and I absent? Invalid.
  ""OSNEL""? Not common.
  ""ISNEE"" invalid.
- Better: ""USNIE""? No.
  ""GUNGE""? Not ending E.

- With S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E
- This is _ ? N S E

Common words: like ""UNSEE""? Not valid. ""ONCES"" has C.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but O? H O U S E → positions: H(1),O(2),U(3),S(4),E(5). But no N? Must include N. Where is N? Missing.

All must have N. So for pattern _ _ N ? E, S can be in the second or fourth position.

For S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E → letter1, letter2, N, S, E.

What words fit this? e.g., ""BONUS"" but ends S? No E.
""TUNS E""? Not words.

""MINUS"" ends S? No E.

Hard.

Perhaps S can be in position 3? But position 3 is for N? If N is at 3, position 3 is taking.

Maybe N and S can share or something? No separate positions.

Since N at position 3, S must be at 2 or 4.

Try to list words: for _, S, N, ?, E: like ""C S N ? E"" but C absent? ""L S N? E"" not standard.

Not many common words have ""SN"" together? Usually not.

Perhaps if S is in position 4: word like L O N S E? Not a word.

""SONE"" is not 5. ""ZONES"" has Z? and ends S? Not E.

""TONES"" T O N E S ends with S, not E.

To end with E: ""CONES"" has C and ends E? C absent.

""ONES"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ANISE"" but A absent and I absent.

Consider other positions.

But back to constraints: we have S to place and N at 3.

Better not fix N position? Maybe we guess a word that tests N at position 1 or 3 implicitly.

Possible words ending with E, having S and N, no C,R,A,I,P.

Searching: 
- ""NOUSE"" not English? 
- ""VENUS"" V E N U S → but E is at position 2? We need E at end. Pos: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),S(5). If secret word E should be at end, so not.
- ""SENSE"" S E N S E → positions: S(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5). 
  - S at position 1: but feedback says S is not in position 1? Therefore, ""SENSE"" invalid because S at 1.
- ""MENSA"" not ending E? 
""WOMEN"" but ends N.

""CAUSE"" has C,A? Absent.

""TABLE"" has A,B,L,E, no S or N? Must have both S and N.

""SHINE"" H,I,N,E? But I absent? In ""SHINE"": S H I N E → I at position 3 is absent? From SNIPE, I(x). Also, E at end, but to test.

Let's calculate: ""SHINE"" would have S at position 1? But S cannot be at position 1. Also, I is absent. So invalid.

""PHONE"" has P? Absent.

""THANK"" ends K, no E.

Try ""TUNED"" T U N E D → ends with D? Not E.

""TINES"" ends S, not E.

""SONDE""? Not common? S O N D E → S(1),O(2),N(3),D(4),E(5). 
- S at position 1 is not allowed? Feedback S(-) in SNIPE means S is in word but not position 1. So SONDE would test S at position 1, which is known not present, so it would useless or wrong? In feedback, if S is at position 1, it should be marked x or -? Since S is in the word, if we put it in position 1, it might be - if not correct, but we know position 1 is not correct for S? So SONDE has S at position 1, which is incorrect, so feedback would be S(-) likely, wasting a slot.

We should avoid putting S at position 1.

Similarly, for N, we must put at position 1 or 3.

Let's choose a word with N at position 1 and S in positions 2,3,4.

For example, ""NOUNS"" ends S, not E.

""NEEDS"" N E E D S ends with S? Not E; also E at position 2? But we know E is at end.

""NOILS"" not E.

""NAVES"" has A? Absent.

""NELIS"" not common.

""NESTS"" N E S T S → E at 2? Ends with S? Not E.

Hard to find.

What about ""s L O N E"" type? S at 1? Bad.

Perhaps ""O S N E something"" but not.

Another approach: forget having S in the word for a moment? But we know S is present, so we must include S to test its position.

List of possible letters: not C, R, A, I, P.

Vowels available: O, U, sometimes Y? But may not be.

Consonants: T, L, D, H, M, B, G, K, W, V, etc.

Try to form word: for N at 1 and E at 5: N _ _ _ E, with S in one of the blanks.

E.g., ""N T S E"" but need 5 letters. ""N T ? S E"" for N at 1, S at 4: position 2 and 3 to fill.

With common letters: like N T H S E? ""NTHES"" not word.
N O L S E? ""NOLSE"" not word.
N U T S E? ""NUTSE"" not word.

N at 1 and S at 3: N ? S ? E

""N O S T E""? ""NOSTE"" not common.
"" N U S T E"" ""NUSTE"" no.

""N E S T E"" but E at 2? And S at 3? ""NESTE"" is not word; ""NEST"" is 4 letters.

""NIKAU"" not E.

Perhaps N in position 3 is better? Pattern: ? ? N ? E with S in position 2 or 4.

S in position 2: letter positions: 1, S(2), N(3), 4, E(5)

Guess: for example, ""T S N U E"" but ""TSNUE"" not a word.
""AS N E?"" not with S at 2.

""B S N E E"" not, ""bosome"" no.

S in position 4: pattern: ? ? N S E

 positions 1 and 2 are free, position 3 is N, position 4 is S, position 5 is E.

This might be easier: _ _ N S E

What words have this? ""MINSE"" not common.
"" ""PONSE"" not.
"" ""OONSE"" no.

""CONES"" C absent.
""TONES"" T O N E S? positions: T(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),S(5) — but E at position 4? But we need E at position 5. Here S is at position 5, E at 4. Not matching pattern.

The word must be like [letter1] [letter2] N S E.

Examples: ""BANSE"" not a word.
"" ""DENSE"": D E N S E → positions: D(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5).
Oh! ""DENSE"" is a word.
- D(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)
- E is at position 2 and 5? Position 5 has E, good.
- But E at position 2: we know E is only in position 5, so E should not appear elsewhere? Well, it could, but we don't know. Feedback might be - for E at 2 if present but wrong position.

In this case, we can test.

Letters: D, E, N, S — E is already known present at pos5, N present, S present. 
D is a new letter.

Absent letters: not C,R,A,I,P, so D is allowed.

Also E at position 2 might be a problem, but if secret word has only one E? We don't know.

Secret word could have multiple E's? Possible.

With ""DENSE"":
- We can test D at position 1.
- E at position 2: if present but not at 2, will be -.
- N at position 3: if N is here, ✓ or not.
- S at position 4: test S position.

Also, the word has all required letters: N and S included.

And ends with E.

So for the guess ""DENSE"":
- If N is in position 3, we get feedback.
- S in position 4: if not correct, will be -.

But we need to see if it's valid with previous feedback.

Previous: N not in position 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible.
S not in position 1, so position 4 is untested.

Also, new letter D tested.

Alternatively, other words with this pattern: ""CENSE"" has C.
"" ""LENSE"" sometimes considered? Or ""LENS"" not 5.
"" ""MENSE"" may not be common.
"" ""SENSE"" S at position 1 which is invalid to use.

So ""DENSE"" seems like a reasonable guess.

If we want to avoid double E, but it's okay.

Another word: ""HONSE"" not English.

"" HOUSE"" but position: H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But no N? Must include N.

So back to ""DENSE"":

It has N at position 3, which is a candidate.

S at 4, which is possible.

E at position 2 could be redundant if E is only at 5, but we test it.

Let's guess ""DENSE"".

In terms of feedback, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then E at position 2 will show x or -? Since E is present, but at wrong position, should be ""-"" if E is in the word elsewhere? But position 5 is E, so E is present, so E at position 2 should be ""-"" for wrong position.

But in secret word, if there is no E at position 2, we get ""-"", which tells us nothing new other than E is not at 2.

Similarly, for D, we get feedback.

So it should be fine.

We can choose ""TENSE"" : T E N S E, similar pattern.

T E N S E: T(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)

Also good, tests T instead of D.

Both are possible. D is slightly less common? But valid; tense is common.

Since T is a common letter, we might prefer ""TENSE"".

But ""TENSE"" has E at position 2 as well.

Same as ""DENSE"".

We'll go with ""TENSE"".

So guess: T E N S E

But in the feedback, we already know E is at 5, so having E at position 2 might not be efficient? But it could help if the word has multiple E's.

Since we have few tries left, we should avoid guesses with known letters in wrong spots? Not necessarily, as it helps narrow.

But also, by putting E at position 2, if it shows 'x', then we know E is only at position 5? But it can't show 'x' because E is present, so it would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position.

But since we know position 5 has E, E at 2 must be ""-"" anyway if it's not correct? Unless there is another E.

But worst case, we learn that there is another E? Or not.

In the secret word, it might have only one E at position 5, so E at position 2 would show ""-"" which is consistent, but doesn't give new information about other E? Actually, it tells us that E is also present but not at position 2, but since position 5 is also E, it could be the same E? No, because positions are different.

In the feedback system, for duplicate letters, the rules might handle it, but generally, if there is only one E and it's at position 5, then E at position 2 should be ""x""meaning not in the word? But E is in the word at position 5, so it should be ""-"" for present but wrong position.

Game rules say: - if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So even if there is only one E, if we put it in wrong position, it should be ""-"".

But in this case, with E at position 2, it would show ""-"" because E is in the word elsewhere.

Then for position 1, T etc.

But ""TENSE"" also has S at position 4.

Perhaps it's okay.

To maximize new letters, choose ""MOUND"" no E, etc.

""TENSE"" seems a solid choice.

So we'll guess ""TENSE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → E is in position 5 (correct), and N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A are absent.
  
- **SNIPE**: S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)  
  → E is confirmed in position 5. S is in the word but not in position 1. N is in the word but not in position 2. I and P are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **E** is fixed in position 5.
2. **N** is present but not in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions are 1 or 3.
3. **S** is present but not in position 1. Possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, P (must be avoided).
5. Need to test **N** in position 1 or 3 and **S** in a new position (2, 3, or 4), while adding new common letters like T, O, L, D, etc.

For this guess:
- Focus on placing **N** in position 1 or 3 to test its location.
- Place **S** in a new position (not 1).
- Keep **E** in position 5.
- Avoid absent letters.
- ""TENSE"" is a strong candidate:
  - Pattern: `T E N S E`
  - Tests N in position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests S in position 4 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 1), and implicitly E in position 2 (which could provide additional feedback on E duplication).
  - No C, R, A, I, P.
- This guess maximizes coverage: T is a high-frequency letter, and testing N in position 3 will help narrow possibilities quickly.

<guess>TENSE</guess>",TENSE,"Now, we have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
- E is correct and in position 5.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- C, R, A are absent.

Second guess: SNIPE → S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)
- E is still correct in position 5 (as expected).
- S is present in the word but not in position 1.
- N is present but not in position 2 (since we got ""-"" for position 2).
- I and P are absent.

Combining the information:
- Secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Present letters: N, E (already known), and now S is also present.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, I, P
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and now not in position 2 (from second guess). From first guess, N was tested in position 4, and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there. From second guess, N was tested in position 2, and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there. So possible positions for N are now only 1 or 3.
- S is present but not in position 1 (from second guess's S(-)). So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But positions available: we have four slots: 1,2,3,4. Absolutes:
  - Position 5: E ✓
  - Positions to fill: 1,2,3,4
  - S cannot be in position 1 (tried in SNIPE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Since N can only be in 1 or 3, and S can be in 2,3,4, but note: if N is in position 1, then S can't be in 1, so S could be in 2,3,4. If N is in position 3, then S can be in 2 or 4 (since position 3 is taken by N).

We need to guess a word that fits:
- Must include S and N (since they are present).
- Must end with E.
- Must not contain C, R, A, I, P.
- Test new letters to find others.

Common letters not yet tested: T, O, L, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.

Given constraints:
- Word pattern: ? ? ? ? E
- Must have S in it (somewhere but not position 1)
- Must have N in position 1 or 3.
- Avoid letters: C, R, A, I, P

Let's brainstorm words based on N position:

Case 1: N in position 1
- Then word starts with N, pattern: N ? ? ? E
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- We need to fill the other slots with new letters.

Possible words:
- N O S E S? No, not 5 letters? N O S E is 4. Or ""NOSE"" is 4, need 5.
- 5-letter words: like ""NOBLE"" but E? ""NOBLE"" ends with E? N-O-B-L-E → positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) - but O and B are not ruled out? But we have S to include? Must include S. ""NOBLE"" doesn't have S.
- ""NOISE"": But I is absent? We know I is absent (from SNIPE feedback), so cannot include I. Similarly, P absent. So ""NOISE"" invalid.
- ""NURSE"": N U R S E → but R is absent? R is absent (from first feedback). Cannot use R.
- ""NUDGE"": N U D G E → includes U,D,G,E. Does it have S? No.
- How about ""NYMPH"" no E, not ending E.
- ""NASTY"" ends with Y, not E.
- ""NAMES"": N A M E S → A absent? A is absent, invalid.
- ""NOSES"": N O S E S → ends with S? Should end E? We need position 5 E. ""NOSES"" has S in pos5? N(1),O(2),S(3),E(4),S(5) — E is in position 4? Not position 5. Invalid because E must be at end.
- Need words like N ? ? ? E with S in it.
- ""NOELS""? Not common. ""NUTSE""? Invalid.
- ""NIGER"" has G and E? But has R? And ends R? Not E.

This is tough. Maybe N in position 1 is less likely? But possible.

Case 2: N in position 3
- Pattern: ? ? N ? E
- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied by something else? Position 1 is free).
- Also, position 2 can be S, or position 4 can be S.

Possible words:

- If S is in position 2: Pattern: _ S N ? E

- Third position N? Position 3 is N? Pattern: position 1, S at 2, N at 3, then ? at 4, E at 5.
- Examples: ""ASIDE"" → A absent and I absent? Invalid.
  ""OSNEL""? Not common.
  ""ISNEE"" invalid.
- Better: ""USNIE""? No.
  ""GUNGE""? Not ending E.

- With S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E
- This is _ ? N S E

Common words: like ""UNSEE""? Not valid. ""ONCES"" has C.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but O? H O U S E → positions: H(1),O(2),U(3),S(4),E(5). But no N? Must include N. Where is N? Missing.

All must have N. So for pattern _ _ N ? E, S can be in the second or fourth position.

For S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E → letter1, letter2, N, S, E.

What words fit this? e.g., ""BONUS"" but ends S? No E.
""TUNS E""? Not words.

""MINUS"" ends S? No E.

Hard.

Perhaps S can be in position 3? But position 3 is for N? If N is at 3, position 3 is taking.

Maybe N and S can share or something? No separate positions.

Since N at position 3, S must be at 2 or 4.

Try to list words: for _, S, N, ?, E: like ""C S N ? E"" but C absent? ""L S N? E"" not standard.

Not many common words have ""SN"" together? Usually not.

Perhaps if S is in position 4: word like L O N S E? Not a word.

""SONE"" is not 5. ""ZONES"" has Z? and ends S? Not E.

""TONES"" T O N E S ends with S, not E.

To end with E: ""CONES"" has C and ends E? C absent.

""ONES"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ANISE"" but A absent and I absent.

Consider other positions.

But back to constraints: we have S to place and N at 3.

Better not fix N position? Maybe we guess a word that tests N at position 1 or 3 implicitly.

Possible words ending with E, having S and N, no C,R,A,I,P.

S in position 2: letter positions: 1, S(2), N(3), 4, E(5)

Guess: for example, ""T S N U E"" but ""TSNUE"" not a word.
""AS N E?"" not with S at 2.

""B S N E E"" not, ""bosome"" no.

S in position 4: pattern: ? ? N S E

 positions 1 and 2 are free, position 3 is N, position 4 is S, position 5 is E.

This might be easier: _ _ N S E

What words have this? ""MINSE"" not common.
"" ""PONSE"" not.
"" ""OONSE"" no.

""CONES"" C absent.
""TONES"" T O N E S? positions: T(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),S(5) — but E at position 4? But we need E at position 5. Here S is at position 5, E at 4. Not matching pattern.

The word must be like [letter1] [letter2] N S E.

Examples: ""BANSE"" not a word.
"" ""DENSE"": D E N S E → positions: D(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5).
Oh! ""DENSE"" is a word.
- D(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)
- E is at position 2 and 5? Position 5 has E, good.
- But E at position 2: we know E is only in position 5, so E should not appear elsewhere? Well, it could, but we don't know. Feedback might be - for E at 2 if present but wrong position.

In this case, we can test.

Letters: D, E, N, S — E is already known present at pos5, N present, S present. 
D is a new letter.

Absent letters: not C,R,A,I,P, so D is allowed.

Also E at position 2 might be a problem, but if secret word has only one E? We don't know.

Secret word could have multiple E's? Possible.

With ""DENSE"":
- We can test D at position 1.
- E at position 2: if present but not at 2, will be -.
- N at position 3: if N is here, ✓ or not.
- S at position 4: test S position.

Also, the word has all required letters: N and S included.

And ends with E.

So for the guess ""DENSE"":
- If N is in position 3, we get feedback.
- S in position 4: if not correct, will be -.

But we need to see if it's valid with previous feedback.

Previous: N not in position 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible.
S not in position 1, so position 4 is untested.

Also, new letter D tested.

Alternatively, other words with this pattern: ""CENSE"" has C.
"" ""LENSE"" sometimes considered? Or ""LENS"" not 5.
"" ""MENSE"" may not be common.
"" ""SENSE"" S at position 1 which is invalid to use.

So ""DENSE"" seems like a reasonable guess.

If we want to avoid double E, but it's okay.

Another word: ""HONSE"" not English.

"" HOUSE"" but position: H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But no N? Must include N.

So back to ""DENSE"":

It has N at position 3, which is a candidate.

S at 4, which is possible.

E at position 2 could be redundant if E is only at 5, but we test it.

Let's guess ""DENSE"".

In terms of feedback, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then E at position 2 will show x or -? Since E is present, but at wrong position, should be ""-"" if E is in the word elsewhere? But position 5 is E, so E is present, so E at position 2 should be ""-"" for wrong position.

But in secret word, if there is no E at position 2, we get ""-"", which tells us nothing new other than E is not at 2.

Similarly, for D, we get feedback.

So it should be fine.

We can choose ""TENSE"" : T E N S E, similar pattern.

T E N S E: T(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)

Also good, tests T instead of D.

Both are possible. D is slightly less common? But valid; tense is common.

Since T is a common letter, we might prefer ""TENSE"".

But ""TENSE"" has E at position 2 as well.

Same as ""DENSE"".

We'll go with ""TENSE"".

So guess: T E N S E

But in the feedback, we already know E is at 5, so having E at position 2 might not be efficient? But it could help if the word has multiple E's.

Since we have few tries left, we should avoid guesses with known letters in wrong spots? Not necessarily, as it helps narrow.

But also, by putting E at position 2, if it shows 'x', then we know E is only at position 5? But it can't show 'x' because E is present, so it would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position.

But since we know position 5 has E, E at 2 must be ""-"" anyway if it's not correct? Unless there is another E.

But worst case, we learn that there is another E? Or not.

In the secret word, it might have only one E at position 5, so E at position 2 would show ""-"" which is consistent, but doesn't give new information about other E? Actually, it tells us that E is also present but not at position 2, but since position 5 is also E, it could be the same E? No, because positions are different.

In the feedback system, for duplicate letters, the rules might handle it, but generally, if there is only one E and it's at position 5, then E at position 2 should be ""x""meaning not in the word? But E is in the word at position 5, so it should be ""-"" for present but wrong position.

Game rules say: - if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So even if there is only one E, if we put it in wrong position, it should be ""-"".

But in this case, with E at position 2, it would show ""-"" because E is in the word elsewhere.

Then for position 1, T etc.

But ""TENSE"" also has S at position 4.

Perhaps it's okay.

To maximize new letters, choose ""MOUND"" no E, etc.

""TENSE"" seems a solid choice.

So we'll guess ""TENSE"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → E is in position 5 (correct), and N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A are absent.
  
- **SNIPE**: S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)  
  → E is confirmed in position 5. S is in the word but not in position 1. N is in the word but not in position 2. I and P are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **E** is fixed in position 5.
2. **N** is present but not in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions are 1 or 3.
3. **S** is present but not in position 1. Possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, P (must be avoided).
5. Need to test **N** in position 1 or 3 and **S** in a new position (2, 3, or 4), while adding new common letters like T, O, L, D, etc.

For this guess:
- Focus on placing **N** in position 1 or 3 to test its location.
- Place **S** in a new position (not 1).
- Keep **E** in position 5.
- Avoid absent letters.
- ""TENSE"" is a strong candidate:
  - Pattern: `T E N S E`
  - Tests N in position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests S in position 4 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 1), and implicitly E in position 2 (which could provide additional feedback on E duplication).
  - No C, R, A, I, P.
- This guess maximizes coverage: T is a high-frequency letter, and testing N in position 3 will help narrow possibilities quickly.",Guess 3: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,DENSE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, it's best to start with a word that has common letters to maximize the information we gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like S, T, R, N, E, A, etc.
 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" as it contains common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us which letters are present and in the correct position, which are present but wrong position, and which are absent.

 Since it's the first guess, we have no constraints. Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers common letters.

 I will choose: ""CRANE""

 But note: the game example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We can use any valid 5-letter word.

 Alternatively, another common starting word is ""SLATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for its coverage.

 After this guess, we'll get feedback and then use that to make the next guesses.

 Since it's the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The response must be in the format <guess>CRANE</guess> but note the format specified: 
    ""<guess> guessed-word </guess>""

 However, looking at the example: the user wrote the guess without spaces. So we'll write the word.

 So, our first guess: CRANE.I need to make the first guess for the 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically include common consonants and vowels to test widespread letter coverage. Based on Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are effective because they contain frequent letters and multiple vowels.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""CRANE"" covers C (common consonant), R (frequent), A (vowel), N (common), E (vowel).  
- It avoids rare letters and has no repeats, ensuring maximum feedback.  
- Alternatives like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is slightly more balanced in consonant-vowel distribution.  

I'll start with **CRANE** to get initial feedback on letter presence/position efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

From this, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the 5th position (since the feedback shows E as correct at the end). So the secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter). So N must be in one of the first four positions, but not the 4th. Therefore, positions 1, 2, or 3 must have N.
3. The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Now for the next guess, we must:
- Include E in the 5th position since it's correct.
- Include N in the word, but not in the 4th position. Also, since we don't know its position, we should try it in a different position than in the first guess (which was position 4). So try N in position 1, 2, or 3, but avoid position 4.
- Avoid using C, R, A again since they are absent.

Our goal is to test other common letters and narrow down the position for N.

Common letters to test: We have ruled out C, R, A. We know E is fixed at the end and N is present somewhere. We can try other vowels and common consonants.

Available letters: We should consider frequent letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We also note that the word has an N and E, so words containing N and E are good.

But we must not use C, R, A.

Idea: Let's form a word that tests N in a new position and includes other frequent letters.

Since N was in position 4 and now we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3, we can try putting N in position 1 or 2 to test. Position 3 might also be possible.

Also, we need to test new letters. Since E is fixed at position 5, we can form words like _ _ _ N E? But wait: we avoid putting N in the 4th position because that was already wrong. So we must put N in 1,2, or 3.

Moreover, the word must be 5 letters long and valid.

Candidate words:

1. STONE: S T O N E
   - Would test S, T, O (new letters) and N (in position 4? But wait: we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not in position 4 from the first feedback. The first guess had N in position 4 and it was wrong.) So if we put N in position 4 again, we would expect it to be wrong? But the word might have N in position 4? Actually, no: from first feedback, N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, in STONE, putting N in position 4 would be incorrect again. We want to test a position that hasn't been tried. So we should not put N in position 4.

2. We can try a word with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
   - This tests N at the start and O, I, S. Also E is fixed at the end.

But note: feedback symbols:
- We know E is at the end (position 5), so we can expect ✓ for the E.
- We know N is in the word so we might get information on its position.

Other possibilities:

- Try ""INLET"": I N L E T -> but E is in position 4? Wait, we need E in position 5. So this word has E in position 4? Not acceptable because we must have the E in the fifth position? Actually, no. The guess must be a valid word but we are allowed to put E anywhere? However, we know the secret word has E in the fifth position, so if we put E in the fifth, we get direct feedback. But if we put E elsewhere, it might show as wrong position? Since E is known to be in the fifth position, we should keep it there in our subsequent guesses to save time. Because we know it's correct, we can fix it.

So in the next guess, we must put E at the end. Therefore, all our guesses should have E in the fifth position until we change that if we find otherwise? Actually, the feedback showed E as correct, so it is fixed at the end.

Therefore, the next guess must be ? ? ? ? E, and we have to fill the first four letters without C, R, A, and including N in one of the first three positions (since position 4 is not allowed for N).

Possible words:

- With N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E
  - Tests N at position 1, and O, I, S.

- With N in position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S N I D E
  - Tests S, N at 2, I, D.

- With N in position 3: e.g., ""POINT"": P O I N T -> but ends with T? Not E. We need to end with E. So words ending with E.

Words with N in position 3 and ending with E: e.g., ""PRONE"" -> P R O N E -> but R is excluded (we know R is absent). Avoid R? We know R is absent so cannot use R.

We must not use C, R, A.

So filter letters: no C, no R, no A.

Look for 5-letter words ending in E that contain N and avoid C,R,A.

Searching common words:

- ""LINED"": L I N E D -> but E is in fourth? No, it ends with D. We need X X X E? Actually, format: position 5 must be E: so the word must end with E.

So words: _ _ _ _ E

With N in the first three positions:

1. N at position 1: NE?E? but must be 5 letters. Examples: ""NOISE"" (not ending with E? ends with E? NOISE: N,O,I,S,E -> yes, ends with E). Or ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> but no E at the end? It ends with E: NOBLE -> positions:1-N,2-O,3-B,4-L,5-E. So yes.

   But NOBLE: tests N in position 1, O, B, L.

2. N at position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S, N (pos2), I, D, E -> S N I D E.

3. N at position 3: e.g., ""POISE"": P O I S E -> but P,O,I,S -> N is missing? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So the word must contain N and E.

For position 3: words like ""PRONE"" cannot because it has R (excluded). How about ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> positions:1-P,2-H,3-O,4-N,5-E -> but N is in position 4? We want N in position 3? Position 3 is O, position 4 is N.

We want N in position 3: so letters 1,2, ?,3=N,4,5=E.

For example: ""ANODE"" -> but A is excluded? A is absent so we can't use A. ""INODE"" is not a word? ""MINCE"" -> but C is excluded and M? Let's see: M I N C E -> but contains C? Excluded. ""WOMEN"": W O M E N -> but N is position 5? We need N at 3? Position: W(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),N(5). But we need E at position 5, so that would be ... wait, WOMEN doesn't have E at the end? It ends with N? Not E. So we need words ending in E.

Hard to find with N at position 3 and without C,R,A.

Perhaps: ""PRUNE"" -> but has R? Excluded. ""TRINE"" -> has T,R? R excluded.

Another: ""SUGNE"" not a word.

Maybe: ""TUNES"": T U N E S -> ends with S? Not E. ""TUNE"" is not 5 letters.

""USHER"" no E? and not ending with E.

Perhaps better to avoid position 3 for now because it's hard to come up with a word? Or try another.

Another idea: ""THINE"": T H I N E -> ends with E? THINE: T(1),H(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). But N is in position 4? We want to avoid position 4 because we know from first guess that N is not in position 4? Or is it?

Recall: the secret word has N, but not in position 4? Because in ""CRANE"", N was at position 4 and we got ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, we know that the secret word's N is not at position 4. So putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect and not provide new information? It would confirm that it's still not at position 4? We want to test positions that could be right.

So we should avoid position 4 for N. Therefore, in THINE, N is at position 4 -> avoid? But THINE can be used? However, we know that N is not at position 4 so we don't gain new info if we put it there? And we waste a letter slot. Better to put N in an untested position: position 1,2, or 3.

So for position 3, let's try: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> ends with R? Not E. ""MINED"": M I N E D -> ends with D? Not E. ""FINED"": F I N E D -> same. But we need position 5 E. So only words that have the structure: letter1, letter2, N, letter4, E? Because if N is at position 3, then position 4 must be some letter and 5 is E.

Example: ""MINCE"" -> M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded? So invalid letter.

""PINED"": P I N E D -> but ends with D? Not E. ""PINER"" ends with R.

Hard.

Look for words: 
- ""SCONE"": S C O N E -> C is excluded? C is absent so cannot use.

Perhaps: ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> but N is at position 4? We are avoiding position 4 for N? Because we know it's not position 4. So again, don't put at 4.

So maybe it's better to prioritize testing N in position 1 or 2.

I will go with N in position 1: try ""NOBLE""

But let's also consider: we want to test many new common letters.

Word: ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> tests O, B, L.

Also: ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> tests O, I, S.

S and T are very common. Since we already have E and know the word has N, we can test S, T, O, I, etc.

Another candidate: ""ONSET"": O N S E T -> ends with T? Not E. No.

""STONE"": S T O N E -> but N is at position 4? Avoid. Because position 4 N is known wrong.

We must avoid putting N at 4.

So ""NOISE"" is good: it has N at 1 (which is untested), and tests O,I,S.

""NOISY"" ends with Y? Not E.

So ""NOISE"" seems valid.

But let's check the letters: we avoid C,R,A? Yes, none of those.

Now, what about other alternatives: ""SNIPE"": S N I P E -> N is at position 2? and E at the end.

SNIPE: S(1), N(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> This tests N at position 2 (which is untested).

Compared to NOISE: NOISE tests N at 1, while SNIPE tests at 2.

Both valid.

Which one to choose? SNIPE has P, which might be less common than S? But S is common.

SNIPE: S, N, I, P, E -> tests S, I, P.

NOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> tests O, I, S.

Both are fine. But I think testing O might be better than P? Because O is a vowel.

But also, we are testing S in both? NOISE has S in position 4? And SNIPE has S in position 1? And we haven't tested S before? So that's good.

Let me choose SNIPE because it tests N at position 2, which is common? And we can see if N fits there.

Alternatively, we might try to cover more vowels? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? Well, both have I? And NOISE has one vowel more? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? But vowels are important.

Actually, both words have one vowel besides the E? SNIPE: I is a vowel? And NOISE: O and I are vowels? So NOISE has two vowels: O and I, plus E? So actually, it has more vowel coverage.

Better to test multiple vowels? But we can also test consonants.

Another word: ""OUZEL"" not common? Avoid.

I think ""NOISE"" is a better choice because it tests two new vowels (O,I) and a common consonant (S). And we test N at position 1.

But lets see the position: if we choose NOISE:

- If the secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓ for N? Also, if O at 2? etc.

We'll get feedback.

Similarly, if we choose SNIPE.

I'll go with ""SNIPE"" because it leaves positions 1 and 3 for other letters? Or ""NOISE"".

Wait, why not test a word with T? Because T is a common letter. In NOISE, we don't test T. In SNIPE, we don't test T.

We might include T.

Candidate: ""UNTIE"" -> but U N T I E -> this ends with E? UNTIE: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). So N at position 2? Also tests U, T, I.

But U is not as common as O? And we avoid C,R,A? Yes.

T is a very common letter. So ""UNTIE"" might be good: tests U, N, T, I.

U is a vowel but less common? We have already an E, so testing other vowels is good.

Alternatively, ""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N in position 4? Avoid? We know N is not at position 4? So we skip.

""ELUDE"" doesn't have N? We must include N.

Another: ""NICHE"" -> but has C? Absent.

""THINE"": T H I N E -> N at position 4? Avoid.

Back to UNTIE: U N T I E -> tests U at position 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4. And avoids bad letters.

This word tests T, which is common, and I,U.

We can compare UNTIE and SNIPE: both test N at position 2? SNIPE: S at 1, N at 2? And UNTIE: U at 1, N at 2? Then T and I in different positions.

UNTIE might be less common? But it is a valid word.

I think it's better to use a word with more common letters: S and T would be ideal.

But we can't get both? How about ""STOLE"" -> but OLE? Ends with E but no N? We must include N.

Unless we don't? But we know N is in the word, so we need to test its position? Not necessarily: we could skip N for now? But that might be inefficient because we can test it.

Actually, we can skip testing N if we test other letters? For example, we know E is fixed? And then test other letters? But we know N must be somewhere? So if we don't include N, we might lose an opportunity to locate it.

So we must include N to get feedback on its position.

Therefore, UNTIE: valid? But UNTIE includes I and T? And U? U is less common? But acceptable.

Another word: ""POINT"" -> ends with T? Not E. Not possible.

""JOINT"",""POINT"" same.

I think SNIPE or NOISE are better? Or perhaps ""LINEY"" not common.

Decision: I'll pick ""SNIPE"" because S and P are common consonants and we get to test N at position 2.

But let's write the word: SNIPE.

So guess: S N I P EAfter the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)), we know:
1. E is in the word and in the 5th position.
2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was marked as wrong position in the 4th spot).
3. C, R, and A are absent from the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not N or C/R/A] E, with N appearing in positions 1, 2, or 3. 

For the second guess:
- We must include N (in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new locations) and E in the 5th position.
- We should avoid C, R, and A.
- Maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, I, O, L, P, etc.

""SNIPE"" is a strong choice because:
- It places E correctly at position 5.
- It tests N in position 2 (new position).
- It introduces three new common letters: S, I, P.
- S and I are high-frequency letters, providing more coverage.

If N is in position 2, it may reveal a match. S, I, or P appearing could quickly narrow down possibilities.

<guess>SNIPE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: SNIPE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(-) I(x) P(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>Now, we have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
- E is correct and in position 5.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- C, R, A are absent.

Second guess: SNIPE → S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)
- E is still correct in position 5 (as expected).
- S is present in the word but not in position 1.
- N is present but not in position 2 (since we got ""-"" for position 2).
- I and P are absent.

Combining the information:
- Secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Present letters: N, E (already known), and now S is also present.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, I, P
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and now not in position 2 (from second guess). From first guess, N was tested in position 4, and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there. From second guess, N was tested in position 2, and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there. So possible positions for N are now only 1 or 3.
- S is present but not in position 1 (from second guess's S(-)). So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But positions available: we have four slots: 1,2,3,4. Absolutes:
  - Position 5: E ✓
  - Positions to fill: 1,2,3,4
  - S cannot be in position 1 (tried in SNIPE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Since N can only be in 1 or 3, and S can be in 2,3,4, but note: if N is in position 1, then S can't be in 1, so S could be in 2,3,4. If N is in position 3, then S can be in 2 or 4 (since position 3 is taken by N).

We need to guess a word that fits:
- Must include S and N (since they are present).
- Must end with E.
- Must not contain C, R, A, I, P.
- Test new letters to find others.

Common letters not yet tested: T, O, L, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.

Given constraints:
- Word pattern: ? ? ? ? E
- Must have S in it (somewhere but not position 1)
- Must have N in position 1 or 3.
- Avoid letters: C, R, A, I, P

Let's brainstorm words based on N position:

Case 1: N in position 1
- Then word starts with N, pattern: N ? ? ? E
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- We need to fill the other slots with new letters.

Possible words:
- N O S E S? No, not 5 letters? N O S E is 4. Or ""NOSE"" is 4, need 5.
- 5-letter words: like ""NOBLE"" but E? ""NOBLE"" ends with E? N-O-B-L-E → positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) - but O and B are not ruled out? But we have S to include? Must include S. ""NOBLE"" doesn't have S.
- ""NOISE"": But I is absent? We know I is absent (from SNIPE feedback), so cannot include I. Similarly, P absent. So ""NOISE"" invalid.
- ""NURSE"": N U R S E → but R is absent? R is absent (from first feedback). Cannot use R.
- ""NUDGE"": N U D G E → includes U,D,G,E. Does it have S? No.
- How about ""NYMPH"" no E, not ending E.
- ""NASTY"" ends with Y, not E.
- ""NAMES"": N A M E S → A absent? A is absent, invalid.
- ""NOSES"": N O S E S → ends with S? Should end E? We need position 5 E. ""NOSES"" has S in pos5? N(1),O(2),S(3),E(4),S(5) — E is in position 4? Not position 5. Invalid because E must be at end.
- Need words like N ? ? ? E with S in it.
- ""NOELS""? Not common. ""NUTSE""? Invalid.
- ""NIGER"" has G and E? But has R? And ends R? Not E.

This is tough. Maybe N in position 1 is less likely? But possible.

Case 2: N in position 3
- Pattern: ? ? N ? E
- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied by something else? Position 1 is free).
- Also, position 2 can be S, or position 4 can be S.

Possible words:
- With S in position 2: E.g., ""USNEE""? Not a word.
- Standard words: like ""STONE"" but O, T? But S is position 1? But in ""STONE"", S is position 1? But S cannot be in position 1? From feedback, S is not in position 1. So we cannot have words with S at position 1.
- If S is in position 2: Pattern: _ S N ? E
- Fill: First position: must be a letter not C,R,A,I,P. Possible T, O, L, U, etc.
- Third position N? Position 3 is N? Pattern: position 1, S at 2, N at 3, then ? at 4, E at 5.
- Examples: ""ASIDE"" → A absent and I absent? Invalid.
  ""OSNEL""? Not common.
  ""ISNEE"" invalid.
- Better: ""USNIE""? No.
  ""GUNGE""? Not ending E.

- With S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E
- This is _ ? N S E

Common words: like ""UNSEE""? Not valid. ""ONCES"" has C.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but O? H O U S E → positions: H(1),O(2),U(3),S(4),E(5). But no N? Must include N. Where is N? Missing.

All must have N. So for pattern _ _ N ? E, S can be in the second or fourth position.

For S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E → letter1, letter2, N, S, E.

What words fit this? e.g., ""BONUS"" but ends S? No E.
""TUNS E""? Not words.

""MINUS"" ends S? No E.

Hard.

Perhaps S can be in position 3? But position 3 is for N? If N is at 3, position 3 is taking.

Maybe N and S can share or something? No separate positions.

Since N at position 3, S must be at 2 or 4.

Try to list words: for _, S, N, ?, E: like ""C S N ? E"" but C absent? ""L S N? E"" not standard.

Not many common words have ""SN"" together? Usually not.

Perhaps if S is in position 4: word like L O N S E? Not a word.

""SONE"" is not 5. ""ZONES"" has Z? and ends S? Not E.

""TONES"" T O N E S ends with S, not E.

To end with E: ""CONES"" has C and ends E? C absent.

""ONES"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ANISE"" but A absent and I absent.

Consider other positions.

But back to constraints: we have S to place and N at 3.

Better not fix N position? Maybe we guess a word that tests N at position 1 or 3 implicitly.

Possible words ending with E, having S and N, no C,R,A,I,P.

Searching: 
- ""NOUSE"" not English? 
- ""VENUS"" V E N U S → but E is at position 2? We need E at end. Pos: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),S(5). If secret word E should be at end, so not.
- ""SENSE"" S E N S E → positions: S(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5). 
  - S at position 1: but feedback says S is not in position 1? Therefore, ""SENSE"" invalid because S at 1.
- ""MENSA"" not ending E? 
""WOMEN"" but ends N.

""CAUSE"" has C,A? Absent.

""TABLE"" has A,B,L,E, no S or N? Must have both S and N.

""SHINE"" H,I,N,E? But I absent? In ""SHINE"": S H I N E → I at position 3 is absent? From SNIPE, I(x). Also, E at end, but to test.

Let's calculate: ""SHINE"" would have S at position 1? But S cannot be at position 1. Also, I is absent. So invalid.

""PHONE"" has P? Absent.

""THANK"" ends K, no E.

Try ""TUNED"" T U N E D → ends with D? Not E.

""TINES"" ends S, not E.

""SONDE""? Not common? S O N D E → S(1),O(2),N(3),D(4),E(5). 
- S at position 1 is not allowed? Feedback S(-) in SNIPE means S is in word but not position 1. So SONDE would test S at position 1, which is known not present, so it would useless or wrong? In feedback, if S is at position 1, it should be marked x or -? Since S is in the word, if we put it in position 1, it might be - if not correct, but we know position 1 is not correct for S? So SONDE has S at position 1, which is incorrect, so feedback would be S(-) likely, wasting a slot.

We should avoid putting S at position 1.

Similarly, for N, we must put at position 1 or 3.

Let's choose a word with N at position 1 and S in positions 2,3,4.

For example, ""NOUNS"" ends S, not E.

""NEEDS"" N E E D S ends with S? Not E; also E at position 2? But we know E is at end.

""NOILS"" not E.

""NAVES"" has A? Absent.

""NELIS"" not common.

""NESTS"" N E S T S → E at 2? Ends with S? Not E.

Hard to find.

What about ""s L O N E"" type? S at 1? Bad.

Perhaps ""O S N E something"" but not.

Another approach: forget having S in the word for a moment? But we know S is present, so we must include S to test its position.

List of possible letters: not C, R, A, I, P.

Vowels available: O, U, sometimes Y? But may not be.

Consonants: T, L, D, H, M, B, G, K, W, V, etc.

Try to form word: for N at 1 and E at 5: N _ _ _ E, with S in one of the blanks.

E.g., ""N T S E"" but need 5 letters. ""N T ? S E"" for N at 1, S at 4: position 2 and 3 to fill.

With common letters: like N T H S E? ""NTHES"" not word.
N O L S E? ""NOLSE"" not word.
N U T S E? ""NUTSE"" not word.

N at 1 and S at 3: N ? S ? E

""N O S T E""? ""NOSTE"" not common.
"" N U S T E"" ""NUSTE"" no.

""N E S T E"" but E at 2? And S at 3? ""NESTE"" is not word; ""NEST"" is 4 letters.

""NIKAU"" not E.

Perhaps N in position 3 is better? Pattern: ? ? N ? E with S in position 2 or 4.

S in position 2: letter positions: 1, S(2), N(3), 4, E(5)

Guess: for example, ""T S N U E"" but ""TSNUE"" not a word.
""AS N E?"" not with S at 2.

""B S N E E"" not, ""bosome"" no.

S in position 4: pattern: ? ? N S E

 positions 1 and 2 are free, position 3 is N, position 4 is S, position 5 is E.

This might be easier: _ _ N S E

What words have this? ""MINSE"" not common.
"" ""PONSE"" not.
"" ""OONSE"" no.

""CONES"" C absent.
""TONES"" T O N E S? positions: T(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),S(5) — but E at position 4? But we need E at position 5. Here S is at position 5, E at 4. Not matching pattern.

The word must be like [letter1] [letter2] N S E.

Examples: ""BANSE"" not a word.
"" ""DENSE"": D E N S E → positions: D(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5).
Oh! ""DENSE"" is a word.
- D(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)
- E is at position 2 and 5? Position 5 has E, good.
- But E at position 2: we know E is only in position 5, so E should not appear elsewhere? Well, it could, but we don't know. Feedback might be - for E at 2 if present but wrong position.

In this case, we can test.

Letters: D, E, N, S — E is already known present at pos5, N present, S present. 
D is a new letter.

Absent letters: not C,R,A,I,P, so D is allowed.

Also E at position 2 might be a problem, but if secret word has only one E? We don't know.

Secret word could have multiple E's? Possible.

With ""DENSE"":
- We can test D at position 1.
- E at position 2: if present but not at 2, will be -.
- N at position 3: if N is here, ✓ or not.
- S at position 4: test S position.

Also, the word has all required letters: N and S included.

And ends with E.

So for the guess ""DENSE"":
- If N is in position 3, we get feedback.
- S in position 4: if not correct, will be -.

But we need to see if it's valid with previous feedback.

Previous: N not in position 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible.
S not in position 1, so position 4 is untested.

Also, new letter D tested.

Alternatively, other words with this pattern: ""CENSE"" has C.
"" ""LENSE"" sometimes considered? Or ""LENS"" not 5.
"" ""MENSE"" may not be common.
"" ""SENSE"" S at position 1 which is invalid to use.

So ""DENSE"" seems like a reasonable guess.

If we want to avoid double E, but it's okay.

Another word: ""HONSE"" not English.

"" HOUSE"" but position: H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But no N? Must include N.

So back to ""DENSE"":

It has N at position 3, which is a candidate.

S at 4, which is possible.

E at position 2 could be redundant if E is only at 5, but we test it.

Let's guess ""DENSE"".

In terms of feedback, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then E at position 2 will show x or -? Since E is present, but at wrong position, should be ""-"" if E is in the word elsewhere? But position 5 is E, so E is present, so E at position 2 should be ""-"" for wrong position.

But in secret word, if there is no E at position 2, we get ""-"", which tells us nothing new other than E is not at 2.

Similarly, for D, we get feedback.

So it should be fine.

We can choose ""TENSE"" : T E N S E, similar pattern.

T E N S E: T(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)

Also good, tests T instead of D.

Both are possible. D is slightly less common? But valid; tense is common.

Since T is a common letter, we might prefer ""TENSE"".

But ""TENSE"" has E at position 2 as well.

Same as ""DENSE"".

We'll go with ""TENSE"".

So guess: T E N S E

But in the feedback, we already know E is at 5, so having E at position 2 might not be efficient? But it could help if the word has multiple E's.

Since we have few tries left, we should avoid guesses with known letters in wrong spots? Not necessarily, as it helps narrow.

But also, by putting E at position 2, if it shows 'x', then we know E is only at position 5? But it can't show 'x' because E is present, so it would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position.

But since we know position 5 has E, E at 2 must be ""-"" anyway if it's not correct? Unless there is another E.

But worst case, we learn that there is another E? Or not.

In the secret word, it might have only one E at position 5, so E at position 2 would show ""-"" which is consistent, but doesn't give new information about other E? Actually, it tells us that E is also present but not at position 2, but since position 5 is also E, it could be the same E? No, because positions are different.

In the feedback system, for duplicate letters, the rules might handle it, but generally, if there is only one E and it's at position 5, then E at position 2 should be ""x""meaning not in the word? But E is in the word at position 5, so it should be ""-"" for present but wrong position.

Game rules say: - if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So even if there is only one E, if we put it in wrong position, it should be ""-"".

But in this case, with E at position 2, it would show ""-"" because E is in the word elsewhere.

Then for position 1, T etc.

But ""TENSE"" also has S at position 4.

Perhaps it's okay.

To maximize new letters, choose ""MOUND"" no E, etc.

""TENSE"" seems a solid choice.

So we'll guess ""TENSE"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → E is in position 5 (correct), and N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A are absent.
  
- **SNIPE**: S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)  
  → E is confirmed in position 5. S is in the word but not in position 1. N is in the word but not in position 2. I and P are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **E** is fixed in position 5.
2. **N** is present but not in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions are 1 or 3.
3. **S** is present but not in position 1. Possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, P (must be avoided).
5. Need to test **N** in position 1 or 3 and **S** in a new position (2, 3, or 4), while adding new common letters like T, O, L, D, etc.

For this guess:
- Focus on placing **N** in position 1 or 3 to test its location.
- Place **S** in a new position (not 1).
- Keep **E** in position 5.
- Avoid absent letters.
- ""TENSE"" is a strong candidate:
  - Pattern: `T E N S E`
  - Tests N in position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests S in position 4 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 1), and implicitly E in position 2 (which could provide additional feedback on E duplication).
  - No C, R, A, I, P.
- This guess maximizes coverage: T is a high-frequency letter, and testing N in position 3 will help narrow possibilities quickly.

The letter E is in the word and it is in the 5th position (since the feedback shows E as correct at the end). So the secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E\n2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""CRANE"", N was the 4th letter). So N must be in one of the first four positions, but not the 4th. Therefore, positions 1, 2, or 3 must have N.\n3. The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n\nNow for the next guess, we must:\n- Include E in the 5th position since it\'s correct.\n- Include N in the word, but not in the 4th position.

We can try other vowels and common consonants.\n\nAvailable letters: We should consider frequent letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word has an N and E, so words containing N and E are good.\n\nBut we must not use C, R, A.\n\nIdea: Let\'s form a word that tests N in a new position and includes other frequent letters.\n\nSince N was in position 4 and now we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3, we can try putting N in position 1 or 2 to test. Position 3 might also be possible.\n\nAlso, we need to test new letters. Since E is fixed at position 5, we can form words like _ _ _ N E? But wait: we avoid putting N in the 4th position because that was already wrong. So we must put N in 1,2, or 3.\n\nMoreover, the word must be 5 letters long and valid.\n\nCandidate words:\n\n1. STONE: S T O N E\n   - Would test S, T, O (new letters) and N (in position 4? But wait: we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not in position 4 from the first feedback. The first guess had N in position 4 and it was wrong.) So if we put N in position 4 again, we would expect it to be wrong? But the word might have N in position 4? Actually, no: from first feedback, N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, in STONE, putting N in position 4 would be incorrect again. We want to test a position that hasn\'t been tried. So we should not put N in position 4.\n\n2. We can try a word with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E\n   - This tests N at the start and O, I, S. Also E is fixed at the end.\n\nBut note: feedback symbols:\n- We know E is at the end (position 5), so we can expect ✓ for the E.\n- We know N is in the word so we might get information on its position.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- Try ""INLET"": I N L E T -> but E is in position 4? Wait, we need E in position 5. So this word has E in position 4? Not acceptable because we must have the E in the fifth position? Actually, no. The guess must be a valid word but we are allowed to put E anywhere? However, we know the secret word has E in the fifth position, so if we put E in the fifth, we get direct feedback. But if we put E elsewhere, it might show as wrong position? Since E is known to be in the fifth position, we should keep it there in our subsequent guesses to save time. Because we know it\'s correct, we can fix it.\n\nSo in the next guess, we must put E at the end. Therefore, all our guesses should have E in the fifth position until we change that if we find otherwise? Actually, the feedback showed E as correct, so it is fixed at the end.\n\nTherefore, the next guess must be ? ? ? ? E, and we have to fill the first four letters without C, R, A, and including N in one of the first three positions (since position 4 is not allowed for N).\n\nPossible words:\n\n- With N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISE"": N O I S E\n  - Tests N at position 1, and O, I, S.\n\n- With N in position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S N I D E\n  - Tests S, N at 2, I, D.\n\n- With N in position 3: e.g., ""POINT"": P O I N T -> but ends with T? Not E. We need to end with E. So words ending with E.\n\nWords with N in position 3 and ending with E: e.g., ""PRONE"" -> P R O N E -> but R is excluded (we know R is absent). Avoid R? We know R is absent so cannot use R.\n\nWe must not use C, R, A.\n\nSo filter letters: no C, no R, no A.\n\nLook for 5-letter words ending in E that contain N and avoid C,R,A.\n\nSearching common words:\n\n- ""LINED"": L I N E D -> but E is in fourth? No, it ends with D. We need X X X E? Actually, format: position 5 must be E: so the word must end with E.\n\nSo words: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWith N in the first three positions:\n\n1. N at position 1: NE?E? but must be 5 letters. Examples: ""NOISE"" (not ending with E? ends with E? NOISE: N,O,I,S,E -> yes, ends with E). Or ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> but no E at the end? It ends with E: NOBLE -> positions:1-N,2-O,3-B,4-L,5-E. So yes.\n\n   But NOBLE: tests N in position 1, O, B, L.\n\n2. N at position 2: e.g., ""SNIDE"": S, N (pos2), I, D, E -> S N I D E.\n\n3. N at position 3: e.g., ""POISE"": P O I S E -> but P,O,I,S -> N is missing? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So the word must contain N and E.\n\nFor position 3: words like ""PRONE"" cannot because it has R (excluded). How about ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> positions:1-P,2-H,3-O,4-N,5-E -> but N is in position 4? We want N in position 3? Position 3 is O, position 4 is N.\n\nWe want N in position 3: so letters 1,2, ?,3=N,4,5=E.\n\nFor example: ""ANODE"" -> but A is excluded? A is absent so we can\'t use A. ""INODE"" is not a word? ""MINCE"" -> but C is excluded and M? Let\'s see: M I N C E -> but contains C? Excluded. ""WOMEN"": W O M E N -> but N is position 5? We need N at 3? Position: W(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),N(5). But we need E at position 5, so that would be ... wait, WOMEN doesn\'t have E at the end? It ends with N? Not E. So we need words ending in E.\n\nHard to find with N at position 3 and without C,R,A.\n\nPerhaps: ""PRUNE"" -> but has R? Excluded. ""TRINE"" -> has T,R? R excluded.\n\nAnother: ""SUGNE"" not a word.\n\nMaybe: ""TUNES"": T U N E S -> ends with S? Not E. ""TUNE"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""USHER"" no E? and not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps better to avoid position 3 for now because it\'s hard to come up with a word? Or try another.\n\nAnother idea: ""THINE"": T H I N E -> ends with E? THINE: T(1),H(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). But N is in position 4? We want to avoid position 4 because we know from first guess that N is not in position 4? Or is it?\n\nRecall: the secret word has N, but not in position 4? Because in ""CRANE"", N was at position 4 and we got ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, we know that the secret word\'s N is not at position 4. So putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect and not provide new information? It would confirm that it\'s still not at position 4? We want to test positions that could be right.\n\nSo we should avoid position 4 for N. Therefore, in THINE, N is at position 4 -> avoid? But THINE can be used? However, we know that N is not at position 4 so we don\'t gain new info if we put it there? And we waste a letter slot. Better to put N in an untested position: position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo for position 3, let\'s try: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> ends with R? Not E. ""MINED"": M I N E D -> ends with D? Not E. ""FINED"": F I N E D -> same. But we need position 5 E. So only words that have the structure: letter1, letter2, N, letter4, E? Because if N is at position 3, then position 4 must be some letter and 5 is E.\n\nExample: ""MINCE"" -> M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded? So invalid letter.\n\n""PINED"": P I N E D -> but ends with D? Not E. ""PINER"" ends with R.\n\nHard.\n\nLook for words: \n- ""SCONE"": S C O N E -> C is excluded? C is absent so cannot use.\n\nPerhaps: ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> but N is at position 4? We are avoiding position 4 for N? Because we know it\'s not position 4. So again, don\'t put at 4.\n\nSo maybe it\'s better to prioritize testing N in position 1 or 2.\n\nI will go with N in position 1: try ""NOBLE""\n\nBut let\'s also consider: we want to test many new common letters.\n\nWord: ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> tests O, B, L.\n\nAlso: ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> tests O, I, S.\n\nS and T are very common. Since we already have E and know the word has N, we can test S, T, O, I, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ONSET"": O N S E T -> ends with T? Not E. No.\n\n""STONE"": S T O N E -> but N is at position 4? Avoid. Because position 4 N is known wrong.\n\nWe must avoid putting N at 4.\n\nSo ""NOISE"" is good: it has N at 1 (which is untested), and tests O,I,S.\n\n""NOISY"" ends with Y? Not E.\n\nSo ""NOISE"" seems valid.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: we avoid C,R,A? Yes, none of those.\n\nNow, what about other alternatives: ""SNIPE"": S N I P E -> N is at position 2? and E at the end.\n\nSNIPE: S(1), N(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> This tests N at position 2 (which is untested).\n\nCompared to NOISE: NOISE tests N at 1, while SNIPE tests at 2.\n\nBoth valid.\n\nWhich one to choose? SNIPE has P, which might be less common than S? But S is common.\n\nSNIPE: S, N, I, P, E -> tests S, I, P.\n\nNOISE: N, O, I, S, E -> tests O, I, S.\n\nBoth are fine. But I think testing O might be better than P? Because O is a vowel.\n\nBut also, we are testing S in both? NOISE has S in position 4? And SNIPE has S in position 1? And we haven\'t tested S before? So that\'s good.\n\nLet me choose SNIPE because it tests N at position 2, which is common? And we can see if N fits there.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to cover more vowels? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? Well, both have I? And NOISE has one vowel more? NOISE has O and I? SNIPE has only I? But vowels are important.\n\nActually, both words have one vowel besides the E? SNIPE: I is a vowel? And NOISE: O and I are vowels? So NOISE has two vowels: O and I, plus E? So actually, it has more vowel coverage.\n\nBetter to test multiple vowels? But we can also test consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""OUZEL"" not common? Avoid.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a better choice because it tests two new vowels (O,I) and a common consonant (S). And we test N at position 1.\n\nBut lets see the position: if we choose NOISE:\n\n- If the secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓ for N? Also, if O at 2? etc.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose SNIPE.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SNIPE"" because it leaves positions 1 and 3 for other letters? Or ""NOISE"".\n\nWait, why not test a word with T? Because T is a common letter. In NOISE, we don\'t test T. In SNIPE, we don\'t test T.\n\nWe might include T.\n\nCandidate: ""UNTIE"" -> but U N T I E -> this ends with E? UNTIE: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). So N at position 2? Also tests U, T, I.\n\nBut U is not as common as O? And we avoid C,R,A? Yes.\n\nT is a very common letter. So ""UNTIE"" might be good: tests U, N, T, I.\n\nU is a vowel but less common? We have already an E, so testing other vowels is good.\n\nAlternatively, ""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N in position 4? Avoid? We know N is not at position 4? So we skip.\n\n""ELUDE"" doesn\'t have N? We must include N.\n\nAnother: ""NICHE"" -> but has C? Absent.\n\n""THINE"": T H I N E -> N at position 4? Avoid.\n\nBack to UNTIE: U N T I E -> tests U at position 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4. And avoids bad letters.\n\nThis word tests T, which is common, and I,U.\n\nWe can compare UNTIE and SNIPE: both test N at position 2? SNIPE: S at 1, N at 2? And UNTIE: U at 1, N at 2? Then T and I in different positions.\n\nUNTIE might be less common? But it is a valid word.\n\nI think it\'s better to use a word with more common letters: S and T would be ideal.\n\nBut we can\'t get both? How about ""STOLE"" -> but OLE? Ends with E but no N? We must include N.\n\nUnless we don\'t? But we know N is in the word, so we need to test its position? Not necessarily: we could skip N for now? But that might be inefficient because we can test it.\n\nActually, we can skip testing N if we test other letters? For example, we know E is fixed? And then test other letters? But we know N must be somewhere? So if we don\'t include N, we might lose an opportunity to locate it.\n\nSo we must include N to get feedback on its position.\n\nTherefore, UNTIE: valid? But UNTIE includes I and T? And U? U is less common? But acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""POINT"" -> ends with T? Not E. Not possible.\n\n""JOINT"",""POINT"" same.\n\nI think SNIPE or NOISE are better? Or perhaps ""LINEY"" not common.\n\nDecision: I\'ll pick ""SNIPE"" because S and P are common consonants and we get to test N at position 2.\n\nBut let\'s write the word: SNIPE.\n\nSo guess: S N I P EAfter the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)), we know:\n1. E is in the word and in the 5th position.\n2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was marked as wrong position in the 4th spot).\n3. C, R, and A are absent from the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the pattern: [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not C/R/A] [not N or C/R/A] E, with N appearing in positions 1, 2, or 3. \n\nFor the second guess:\n- We must include N (in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new locations) and E in the 5th position.\n- We should avoid C, R, and A.\n- Maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, I, O, L, P, etc.\n\n""SNIPE"" is a strong choice because:\n- It places E correctly at position 5.\n- It tests N in position 2 (new position).\n- It introduces three new common letters: S, I, P.\n- S and I are high-frequency letters, providing more coverage.\n\nIf N is in position 2, it may reveal a match. S, I, or P appearing could quickly narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>SNIPE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SNIPE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(-) I(x) P(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Now, we have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)\n- E is correct and in position 5.\n- N is present but not in position 4.\n- C, R, A are absent.\n\nSecond guess: SNIPE → S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)\n- E is still correct in position 5 (as expected).\n- S is present in the word but not in position 1.\n- N is present but not in position 2 (since we got ""-"" for position 2).\n- I and P are absent.\n\nCombining the information:\n- Secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E\n- Present letters: N, E (already known), and now S is also present.\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, I, P\n- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and now not in position 2 (from second guess). From first guess, N was tested in position 4, and got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not there. From second guess, N was tested in position 2, and got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not there. So possible positions for N are now only 1 or 3.\n- S is present but not in position 1 (from second guess\'s S(-)). So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But positions available: we have four slots: 1,2,3,4. Absolutes:\n  - Position 5: E ✓\n  - Positions to fill: 1,2,3,4\n  - S cannot be in position 1 (tried in SNIPE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 and 4 are ruled out).\n\nSince N can only be in 1 or 3, and S can be in 2,3,4, but note: if N is in position 1, then S can\'t be in 1, so S could be in 2,3,4. If N is in position 3, then S can be in 2 or 4 (since position 3 is taken by N).\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits:\n- Must include S and N (since they are present).\n- Must end with E.\n- Must not contain C, R, A, I, P.\n- Test new letters to find others.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: T, O, L, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.\n\nGiven constraints:\n- Word pattern: ? ? ? ?

No.\n- How about ""NYMPH"" no E, not ending E.\n- ""NASTY"" ends with Y, not E.\n- ""NAMES"": N A M E S → A absent? A is absent, invalid.\n- ""NOSES"": N O S E S → ends with S? Should end E?

But possible.\n\nCase 2: N in position 3\n- Pattern: ? ? N ? E\n- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied by something else? Position 1 is free).\n- Also, position 2 can be S, or position 4 can be S.\n\nPossible words:\n- With S in position 2: E.g., ""USNEE""? Not a word.\n- Standard words: like ""STONE"" but O, T? But S is position 1? But in ""STONE"", S is position 1? But S cannot be in position 1? From feedback, S is not in position 1. So we cannot have words with S at position 1.\n- If S is in position 2: Pattern: _ S N ? E\n- Fill: First position: must be a letter not C,R,A,I,P. Possible T, O, L, U, etc.\n- Third position N?

""ONCES"" has C.\n\nAnother idea: ""HOUSE"" but O? H O U S E → positions: H(1),O(2),U(3),S(4),E(5). But no N? Must include N. Where is N? Missing.\n\nAll must have N. So for pattern _ _ N ? E, S can be in the second or fourth position.\n\nFor S in position 4: Pattern: _ ? N S E → letter1, letter2, N, S, E.\n\nWhat words fit this? e.g., ""BONUS"" but ends S? No E.\n""TUNS E""? Not words.\n\n""MINUS"" ends S? No E.\n\nHard.\n\nPerhaps S can be in position 3? But position 3 is for N? If N is at 3, position 3 is taking.\n\nMaybe N and S can share or something? No separate positions.\n\nSince N at position 3, S must be at 2 or 4.\n\nTry to list words: for _, S, N, ?, E: like ""C S N ? E"" but C absent? ""L S N?

Not E.\n\n""TONES"" T O N E S ends with S, not E.\n\nTo end with E: ""CONES"" has C and ends E? C absent.\n\n""ONES"" is 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""ANISE"" but A absent and I absent.\n\nConsider other positions.\n\nBut back to constraints: we have S to place and N at 3.\n\nBetter not fix N position? Maybe we guess a word that tests N at position 1 or 3 implicitly.\n\nPossible words ending with E, having S and N, no C,R,A,I,P.\n\nSearching: \n- ""NOUSE"" not English? \n- ""VENUS"" V E N U S → but E is at position 2? We need E at end. Pos: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),S(5). If secret word E should be at end, so not.\n- ""SENSE"" S E N S E → positions: S(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5). \n  - S at position 1: but feedback says S is not in position 1? Therefore, ""SENSE"" invalid because S at 1.\n- ""MENSA"" not ending E? \n""WOMEN"" but ends N.\n\n""CAUSE"" has C,A? Absent.\n\n""TABLE"" has A,B,L,E, no S or N? Must have both S and N.\n\n""SHINE"" H,I,N,E? But I absent? In ""SHINE"": S H I N E → I at position 3 is absent? From SNIPE, I(x). Also, E at end, but to test.\n\nLet\'s calculate: ""SHINE"" would have S at position 1? But S cannot be at position 1. Also, I is absent. So invalid.\n\n""PHONE"" has P? Absent.\n\n""THANK"" ends K, no E.\n\nTry ""TUNED"" T U N E D → ends with D? Not E.\n\n""TINES"" ends S, not E.\n\n""SONDE""? Not common? S O N D E → S(1),O(2),N(3),D(4),E(5). \n- S at position 1 is not allowed? Feedback S(-) in SNIPE means S is in word but not position 1. So SONDE would test S at position 1, which is known not present, so it would useless or wrong? In feedback, if S is at position 1, it should be marked x or -? Since S is in the word, if we put it in position 1, it might be - if not correct, but we know position 1 is not correct for S? So SONDE has S at position 1, which is incorrect, so feedback would be S(-) likely, wasting a slot.\n\nWe should avoid putting S at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, for N, we must put at position 1 or 3.\n\nLet\'s choose a word with N at position 1 and S in positions 2,3,4.\n\nFor example, ""NOUNS"" ends S, not E.\n\n""NEEDS"" N E E D S ends with S? Not E; also E at position 2? But we know E is at end.\n\n""NOILS"" not E.\n\n""NAVES"" has A? Absent.\n\n""NELIS"" not common.\n\n""NESTS"" N E S T S → E at 2? Ends with S? Not E.\n\nHard to find.\n\nWhat about ""s L O N E"" type? S at 1? Bad.\n\nPerhaps ""O S N E something"" but not.\n\nAnother approach: forget having S in the word for a moment? But we know S is present, so we must include S to test its position.\n\nList of possible letters: not C, R, A, I, P.\n\nVowels available: O, U, sometimes Y? But may not be.\n\nConsonants: T, L, D, H, M, B, G, K, W, V, etc.\n\nTry to form word: for N at 1 and E at 5: N _ _ _ E, with S in one of the blanks.\n\nE.g., ""N T S E"" but need 5 letters. ""N T ? S E"" for N at 1, S at 4: position 2 and 3 to fill.\n\nWith common letters: like N T H S E? ""NTHES"" not word.\nN O L S E? ""NOLSE"" not word.\nN U T S E? ""NUTSE"" not word.\n\nN at 1 and S at 3: N ? S ? E\n\n""N O S T E""? ""NOSTE"" not common.\n"" N U S T E"" ""NUSTE"" no.\n\n""N E S T E"" but E at 2? And S at 3? ""NESTE"" is not word; ""NEST"" is 4 letters.\n\n""NIKAU"" not E.\n\nPerhaps N in position 3 is better? Pattern: ? ? N ? E with S in position 2 or 4.\n\nS in position 2: letter positions: 1, S(2), N(3), 4, E(5)\n\nGuess: for example, ""T S N U E"" but ""TSNUE"" not a word.\n""AS N E?"" not with S at 2.\n\n""B S N E E"" not, ""bosome"" no.\n\nS in position 4: pattern: ? ? N S E\n\n positions 1 and 2 are free, position 3 is N, position 4 is S, position 5 is E.\n\nThis might be easier: _ _ N S E\n\nWhat words have this? ""MINSE"" not common.\n"" ""PONSE"" not.\n"" ""OONSE"" no.\n\n""CONES"" C absent.\n""TONES"" T O N E S? positions: T(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),S(5) — but E at position 4? But we need E at position 5. Here S is at position 5, E at 4. Not matching pattern.\n\nThe word must be like [letter1] [letter2] N S E.\n\nExamples: ""BANSE"" not a word.\n"" ""DENSE"": D E N S E → positions: D(1),E(2),N(3),S(4),E(5).\nOh! ""DENSE"" is a word.\n- D(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)\n- E is at position 2 and 5? Position 5 has E, good.\n- But E at position 2: we know E is only in position 5, so E should not appear elsewhere? Well, it could, but we don\'t know. Feedback might be - for E at 2 if present but wrong position.\n\nIn this case, we can test.\n\nLetters: D, E, N, S — E is already known present at pos5, N present, S present. \nD is a new letter.\n\nAbsent letters: not C,R,A,I,P, so D is allowed.\n\nAlso E at position 2 might be a problem, but if secret word has only one E? We don\'t know.\n\nSecret word could have multiple E\'s? Possible.\n\nWith ""DENSE"":\n- We can test D at position 1.\n- E at position 2: if present but not at 2, will be -.\n- N at position 3: if N is here, ✓ or not.\n- S at position 4: test S position.\n\nAlso, the word has all required letters: N and S included.\n\nAnd ends with E.\n\nSo for the guess ""DENSE"":\n- If N is in position 3, we get feedback.\n- S in position 4: if not correct, will be -.\n\nBut we need to see if it\'s valid with previous feedback.\n\nPrevious: N not in position 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible.\nS not in position 1, so position 4 is untested.\n\nAlso, new letter D tested.\n\nAlternatively, other words with this pattern: ""CENSE"" has C.\n"" ""LENSE"" sometimes considered? Or ""LENS"" not 5.\n"" ""MENSE"" may not be common.\n"" ""SENSE"" S at position 1 which is invalid to use.\n\nSo ""DENSE"" seems like a reasonable guess.\n\nIf we want to avoid double E, but it\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""HONSE"" not English.\n\n"" HOUSE"" but position: H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But no N? Must include N.\n\nSo back to ""DENSE"":\n\nIt has N at position 3, which is a candidate.\n\nS at 4, which is possible.\n\nE at position 2 could be redundant if E is only at 5, but we test it.\n\nLet\'s guess ""DENSE"".\n\nIn terms of feedback, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then E at position 2 will show x or -? Since E is present, but at wrong position, should be ""-"" if E is in the word elsewhere? But position 5 is E, so E is present, so E at position 2 should be ""-"" for wrong position.\n\nBut in secret word, if there is no E at position 2, we get ""-"", which tells us nothing new other than E is not at 2.\n\nSimilarly, for D, we get feedback.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nWe can choose ""TENSE"" : T E N S E, similar pattern.\n\nT E N S E: T(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5)\n\nAlso good, tests T instead of D.\n\nBoth are possible. D is slightly less common? But valid; tense is common.\n\nSince T is a common letter, we might prefer ""TENSE"".\n\nBut ""TENSE"" has E at position 2 as well.\n\nSame as ""DENSE"".\n\nWe\'ll go with ""TENSE"".\n\nSo guess: T E N S E\n\nBut in the feedback, we already know E is at 5, so having E at position 2 might not be efficient? But it could help if the word has multiple E\'s.\n\nSince we have few tries left, we should avoid guesses with known letters in wrong spots? Not necessarily, as it helps narrow.\n\nBut also, by putting E at position 2, if it shows \'x\', then we know E is only at position 5? But it can\'t show \'x\' because E is present, so it would be \'-\', meaning in the word but wrong position.\n\nBut since we know position 5 has E, E at 2 must be ""-"" anyway if it\'s not correct? Unless there is another E.\n\nBut worst case, we learn that there is another E? Or not.\n\nIn the secret word, it might have only one E at position 5, so E at position 2 would show ""-"" which is consistent, but doesn\'t give new information about other E? Actually, it tells us that E is also present but not at position 2, but since position 5 is also E, it could be the same E? No, because positions are different.\n\nIn the feedback system, for duplicate letters, the rules might handle it, but generally, if there is only one E and it\'s at position 5, then E at position 2 should be ""x""meaning not in the word? But E is in the word at position 5, so it should be ""-"" for present but wrong position.\n\nGame rules say: - if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nSo even if there is only one E, if we put it in wrong position, it should be ""-"".\n\nBut in this case, with E at position 2, it would show ""-"" because E is in the word elsewhere.\n\nThen for position 1, T etc.\n\nBut ""TENSE"" also has S at position 4.\n\nPerhaps it\'s okay.\n\nTo maximize new letters, choose ""MOUND"" no E, etc.\n\n""TENSE"" seems a solid choice.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""TENSE"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  \n  → E is in position 5 (correct), and N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A are absent.\n  \n- **SNIPE**: S(-), N(-), I(x), P(x), E(✓)  \n  → E is confirmed in position 5. S is in the word but not in position 1. N is in the word but not in position 2.

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: correct position (✓)

Guess 2: SNIPE
- S: present, wrong position (-) [so S is in the word, but not in position 1]
- N: present, wrong position (-) [so N is in the word, but not in position 2]
- I: absent (x)
- P: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [so E is in position 5]

Guess 3: TENSE
- T: absent (x) [so T is not in the word at all]
- E: correct position (✓) [for position 2? But wait, let's see the positions in TENSE: T(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). The feedback says E(✓) for position 2? But we know E is at position 5. This might be confusing.]

Wait, the feedback for TENSE is: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)

This means:
- T at position 1: absent (x) -> T is not in the word.
- E at position 2: correct (✓) -> so E is in position 2? But we also have E at position 5 which was already known to be correct.

This implies that the secret word has at least two E's: one at position 2 and one at position 5.

Also:
- N at position 3: correct (✓) -> so N is in position 3.
- S at position 4: correct (✓) -> so S is in position 4.
- E at position 5: correct (✓) -> already known.

So from TENSE feedback:
- E is at position 2 and 5 (so two E's).
- N is at position 3.
- S is at position 4.
- T is absent.

Now, we know the secret word has the following:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E

And position 1 is unknown, but we know it cannot be T (since T is absent), and cannot be C, R, A, I, P (from previous feedback).

Also, from the feedback, we know that the word has at least two E's.

Now, what about position 1? We need to find a letter that is not in the absent list: absent letters are C, R, A, I, P, T.

Possible letters for position 1: any letter except C, R, A, I, P, T, and it must be a letter that can form a valid English word with the pattern: ? E N S E

So the word is of the form: _ E N S E

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""ENSE"", and the first letter is not in the absent list.

Common words ending with ""ENSE"":
- tense (but T is absent, so not)
- sense (S is at position 4, but in sense: S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5) -> but S at position 1 is not allowed? From SNIPE feedback, S is not at position 1, and in TENSE we have S at position 4 which is correct. But in ""sense"", if we put it, position 1 is S, which we know is not position 1? But we are not guessing ""sense"", we are considering the secret word.

The secret word has position 1 unknown, position 2 E, position 3 N, position 4 S, position 5 E.

So the word is ? E N S E

What are the possibilities?
- dense: D E N S E -> D is not in the absent list (C,R,A,I,P,T)
- mense: M E N S E (archaic, but might be accepted? Not common)
- tense: T E N S E -> but T is absent, so not possible.
- sense: S E N S E -> but S at position 1? We know from SNIPE that S is not in position 1 (because S was in position 1 of SNIPE and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not position 1). Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 1. So ""sense"" is invalid because it would require S at position 1, which is not allowed.

Similarly, other words:
- gense? Not a word.
- hense? Not common, usually ""hence"" but that has H and C? ""hence"" is H E N C E -> but C is absent, and it has C at position 4? Not matching our pattern.

Our pattern is ? E N S E, so the fourth letter must be S.

""hence"" is H E N C E -> positions: H(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need S at position 4, not C.

So not.

""lense"": sometimes used for lens, but not standard; L E N S E -> L is not in absent list.

""pense"": P E N S E -> but P is absent (from SNIPE feedback, P(x)), so not.

""wense"": not a word.

So possible candidates: dense, lense, mense, etc.

But ""dense"" is a common word.

Also, ""cleanse"" is 6 letters? No, 7? Cleanse is 7? C-L-E-A-N-S-E, 7 letters.

5-letter words: 
- dense: D E N S E
- lense: L E N S E (sometimes accepted as a variant of lens, but might be in word list)
- mense: M E N S E (Scottish, meaning dignity, but rare)

Also, ""fense"": not standard, usually fence.

""cense"": C E N S E -> but C is absent.

So the most common word is ""dense"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 1: must be a letter not in {C, R, A, I, P, T}
- The word must be ""?ENSE""

In ""dense"": D is not in the absent list, so it is a candidate.

Similarly, ""lense"" might be acceptable.

But we also have to consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""tense"" is out because T is absent.

So the secret word is likely ""dense"" or ""lense"" or ""mense"".

But we need to guess one.

Since we have only one position to determine, we can guess ""dense"" to confirm.

But note: in the previous guess, we used ""TENSE"", which has T at position 1 (absent) and E at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), S at 4 (correct), E at 5 (correct).

So for the next guess, we can try ""dense"".

But ""dense"" has D at position 1, which is new.

If we guess ""dense"", and it is correct, we win.

If not, then we try another.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 4.

Alternatively, we can think if there is any other constraint.

From the first guess, we had N in the word but not position 4, which is consistent because in ""dense"", N is at position 3.

Similarly, S was not in position 1, and in ""dense"", S is at position 4.

Also, E at position 5 and now also at position 2.

So ""dense"" fits all.

Similarly, ""lense"" also fits.

But ""dense"" is more common.

We can also consider the feedback from CRANE: we had N present but not position 4, which is satisfied.

In SNIPE: S present but not position 1, and N present but not position 2, which is satisfied for both ""dense"" and ""lense"".

So let's guess ""dense"".

But note: in the feedback for TENSE, we have E at position 2 correct, so the secret word has E at position 2. Therefore, in ""dense"", E at position 2 is correct.

Similarly, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

So the only unknown is position 1.

Therefore, we can guess ""dense"" to test D.

If it's not, then we try ""lense"" or ""mense"".

But since we are to make a guess, and ""dense"" is a common word, we'll go with that.

So the next guess is ""dense"".

But let's write it in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **E** is in the correct position at 5 (known since Guess 1).
- **N** is in the correct position at 3 (confirmed in Guess 3: TENSE).
- **S** is in the correct position at 4 (confirmed in Guess 3: TENSE).
- **E** is also in the correct position at 2 (new from Guess 3: TENSE, meaning the word has two E's).
- **T** is absent (from Guess 3: TENSE), adding to the absent letters: C, R, A, I, P, T.
- The secret word pattern is: `? E N S E`.

The only unknown is the first letter, which must:
- Be a valid English letter not in the absent set (C, R, A, I, P, T).
- Form a real 5-letter word ending in `ENSE`.

Possible candidates include:
- **DENSE**: D is not absent, and ""dense"" is a common word.
- **LENSE**: L is not absent, and ""lense"" is a valid variant of ""lens"" (though less common).
- **MENSA**: Not applicable (ends with A, not E).
- Other options like ""pense"" (P is absent) or ""cense"" (C is absent) are invalid.

Given that ""dense"" is the most common and likely candidate, it is the optimal guess to confirm the first letter. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, we eliminate D and proceed with ""lense"" or similar in the next guess.

<guess>dense</guess>",dense,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)

Wait, the feedback for TENSE is: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)

This means:
- T at position 1: absent (x) -> T is not in the word.
- E at position 2: correct (✓) -> so E is in position 2? But we also have E at position 5 which was already known to be correct.

This implies that the secret word has at least two E's: one at position 2 and one at position 5.

Also:
- N at position 3: correct (✓) -> so N is in position 3.
- S at position 4: correct (✓) -> so S is in position 4.
- E at position 5: correct (✓) -> already known.

So from TENSE feedback:
- E is at position 2 and 5 (so two E's).
- N is at position 3.
- S is at position 4.
- T is absent.

Now, we know the secret word has the following:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E

And position 1 is unknown, but we know it cannot be T (since T is absent), and cannot be C, R, A, I, P (from previous feedback).

Also, from the feedback, we know that the word has at least two E's.

Now, what about position 1? We need to find a letter that is not in the absent list: absent letters are C, R, A, I, P, T.

Possible letters for position 1: any letter except C, R, A, I, P, T, and it must be a letter that can form a valid English word with the pattern: ? E N S E

So the word is of the form: _ E N S E

But we are not guessing ""sense"", we are considering the secret word.

The secret word has position 1 unknown, position 2 E, position 3 N, position 4 S, position 5 E.

So the word is ? E N S E

What are the possibilities?
- dense: D E N S E -> D is not in the absent list (C,R,A,I,P,T)
- mense: M E N S E (archaic, but might be accepted? Not common)

- hense? Not common, usually ""hence"" but that has H and C? ""hence"" is H E N C E -> but C is absent, and it has C at position 4? Not matching our pattern.

""hence"" is H E N C E -> positions: H(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need S at position 4, not C.

So not.

""lense"": sometimes used for lens, but not standard; L E N S E -> L is not in absent list.

""pense"": P E N S E -> but P is absent (from SNIPE feedback, P(x)), so not.

""wense"": not a word.

So possible candidates: dense, lense, mense, etc.

But ""dense"" is a common word.

Also, ""cleanse"" is 6 letters? No, 7? Cleanse is 7? C-L-E-A-N-S-E, 7 letters.

5-letter words: 
- dense: D E N S E

- mense: M E N S E (Scottish, meaning dignity, but rare)

Also, ""fense"": not standard, usually fence.

""cense"": C E N S E -> but C is absent.

So the most common word is ""dense"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 1: must be a letter not in {C, R, A, I, P, T}
- The word must be ""?ENSE""

In ""dense"": D is not in the absent list, so it is a candidate.

Similarly, ""lense"" might be acceptable.

But we also have to consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""tense"" is out because T is absent.

So the secret word is likely ""dense"" or ""lense"" or ""mense"".

But we need to guess one.

Since we have only one position to determine, we can guess ""dense"" to confirm.

But note: in the previous guess, we used ""TENSE"", which has T at position 1 (absent) and E at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), S at 4 (correct), E at 5 (correct).

So for the next guess, we can try ""dense"".

But ""dense"" has D at position 1, which is new.

If we guess ""dense"", and it is correct, we win.

If not, then we try another.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 4.

Alternatively, we can think if there is any other constraint.

From the first guess, we had N in the word but not position 4, which is consistent because in ""dense"", N is at position 3.

Similarly, S was not in position 1, and in ""dense"", S is at position 4.

Also, E at position 5 and now also at position 2.

So ""dense"" fits all.

Similarly, ""lense"" also fits.

But ""dense"" is more common.

We can also consider the feedback from CRANE: we had N present but not position 4, which is satisfied.

In SNIPE: S present but not position 1, and N present but not position 2, which is satisfied for both ""dense"" and ""lense"".

So let's guess ""dense"".

But note: in the feedback for TENSE, we have E at position 2 correct, so the secret word has E at position 2. Therefore, in ""dense"", E at position 2 is correct.

Similarly, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

So the only unknown is position 1.

Therefore, we can guess ""dense"" to test D.

If it's not, then we try ""lense"" or ""mense"".

But since we are to make a guess, and ""dense"" is a common word, we'll go with that.

So the next guess is ""dense"".
