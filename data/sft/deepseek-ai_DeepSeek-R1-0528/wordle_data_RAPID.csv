 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We can eliminate any word that contains C, N, or E.
 Also, the word must contain R and A.

 Since R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively, we need to try a word that:
 - Has R in a position other than 2 (so positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
 - Has A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)

 We also want to use other common letters to test more letters.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Some common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has R and A in different positions and includes some new common letters.

 Possible words: 
 - We might try ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know: 
   R cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and that was wrong. So in the new word, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   Similarly, A cannot be in position 3.

 Let's consider ""ROAST"":
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, so that's allowed)
   O is new
   A in position 2 (which is allowed because previously A was in position 3 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
   S and T are new.

 But note: we don't know if O, S, T are in the word. This guess would test three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"":
   P is new
   A in position 2 (allowed)
   R in position 3 (allowed, because previously R was in position 2 and that was wrong, so position 3 is new)
   T and Y are new.

 However, we have to avoid using any of the eliminated letters (C, N, E). Both ""ROAST"" and ""PARTY"" are free of these.

 Another idea: We know that the word has R and A, so we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Let's choose ""ROAST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.

 But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (R and A) and we are including three new ones (O, S, T). This is efficient.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for R and A might be in the same positions as before? But we are changing the positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses R and A in positions that are more likely to be correct? But we don't have enough information.

 I think ""ROAST"" is a reasonable second guess.

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we must consider. However, since we are just starting, we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let me check: ""ROAST"" has unique letters.

 So, I'll go with ""ROAST"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked -).
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked -).

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, N, E** entirely.
- Include **R** and **A**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O**) to gather more information.

The word **""roast""** fits these criteria:
- Uses **R** (position 1, avoiding position 2).
- Uses **A** (position 2, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces **O, S, T** (untested letters).

- A: - (in word, but not in position 3? Wait, in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Let me check:

""roast"" is: 
Position 1: R
Position 2: O
Position 3: A
Position 4: S
Position 5: T

So feedback: 
R at pos1: ✓ -> so the secret word has R as the first letter.
O at pos2: x -> O is not in the word at all.
A at pos3: - -> A is in the word, but not at position 3.
S at pos4: x -> S not in word.
T at pos5: x -> T not in word.

From this, we know:
1. The first letter is R. So the word starts with R.
2. The word contains A, but not at position 3 (and also not at position 3 from the first guess? But in first guess A was at position 3 and was wrong, now again at position 3 is wrong. So A is not at position 3).
3. The following letters are NOT in the word: C, N, E, O, S, T.

We also know from first guess that the word has R (now we know it's at position 1) and A (somewhere, but not position 3). Also, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and that was wrong, but now we know R is at position 1.

So eliminated letters: C, E, N, O, S, T.

We must form a word that:
- Starts with R (since R at pos1 is correct).
- Contains the letter A (but not at position 3).
- Does not contain any of C, E, N, O, S, T.

What other letters can we use? We have most vowels eliminated: A is present, but O and E are out. So vowels left: A, I, U? And consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we need 5-letter words.

We know the word has A (at least one occurrence) and R at the start.

Since A must be in the word but cannot be at position 3, and the first letter is R, let's think about possible positions for A: positions 2, 4, or 5.

We also need to choose a word that doesn't use the eliminated letters.

Let me list some words that start with R and contain A, and don't have C,E,N,O,S,T.

Possible words:
- ""RABBI"" -> but has double B? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicates, but let's see: we haven't encountered duplicates so far. However, note that the feedback symbols don't account for duplicates? Actually, if there were duplicates, it might complicate. But let's avoid for now.

Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence independently? But in Wordle-style games, if a letter appears more than once, it can get tricky. But to keep it simple, let's assume we avoid duplicates until we see evidence.

But we must include A and avoid the eliminated letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""RADAR"": has R and A, but it has double R and double A? Also has D and R. Eliminated letters? D is allowed. But let's check: letters: R, A, D -> R and A are known, D is new. But note: feedback from our first guess showed R at pos2 was wrong, but now we have R at pos1 (correct) and also R at pos4? That might be possible? But wait, we don't know if R appears twice. Similarly, A at pos2 and pos4? But the feedback for A in ""crane"" said it was present but not at 3, so it could be at other positions.

But ""RADAR"": 
- First letter R (correct)
- Second letter A (possible because it's a new position for A? We don't know if it's correct yet)
- But ""RADAR"" has A at position 2 and 4? Also R at position 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Moreover, we have eliminated letters: D is allowed? C,E,N,O,S,T are eliminated, so D is okay.

But let's see if it fits the known constraints. However, we have to test new letters to get information. Using a word with duplicates might not be ideal because we get less information per letter.

We know the word starts with R and has an A somewhere (not position 3). The word must be 5 letters without C,E,N,O,S,T.

So available letters: vowels: A, I, U (since E and O are out). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word with R at the start and A somewhere else.

Possible words:
- ""RABID"": R at 1, A at 2. Letters: R, A, B, I, D -> all new except R and A? But B, I, D are new. 
- ""RADII"": has duplicate I? and also A at position 2. 
- ""RALLY"": has double L? 
- ""RAMPA"": not a word? 
- ""RAPID"": R at 1, A at 2? 
- ""RAVIN"": but not very common? 

We need valid English words.

But note: we must avoid position 3 for A? Or in the new word we can test it? Actually, A can be anywhere except position 3? We don't know that exactly. It could be that A is in the word and the reason it wasn't in position 3 in two guesses doesn't necessarily mean it can't be at 3? Actually, if A were at position 3, then in the first guess (position 3) it would have been marked ✓, but it was marked -, meaning it is present but not in that position. Similarly in the second guess, at position 3 it was marked -, meaning it is present but not at position 3. So yes, A cannot be at position 3 in the secret word.

So A must be at position 2, 4, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a word that has R at the start and A at one of these positions: 2,4,5.

Let's consider ""RAPID"":
R at 1, A at 2 (position 2), P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

But wait: position 3 is P? We don't know about that.

But also, since in the second guess we had O at position 2 and got x (so O is out) and A at position 3 got -, we now put A at position 2? That's a new position.

We want to test new letters: P, I, D.

But how about letters that haven't been tested? We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

We can try to use common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to place A at position 4 or 5 to see if it's there? But since position 2 is also possible, we might choose a word that uses A at position 2 to see if that is correct.

I propose ""RAPID"": 
- R (first, correct) 
- A at position 2: if it turns out ✓, we know A is at position 2. If -, then we know A is at position 4 or 5. And we test P, I, D.

Alternatively, we could try to place A in position 4 or 5 to rule out or confirm.

But to get maximum information, we might want to test A in a position that hasn't been eliminated and test several new letters.

Another idea: we can try ""RAVIN"" but it's less common? Or ""RAYON"" but O is out? eliminated, so no.

We must avoid O, because we know it is not in the word.

Another word: ""RACER""? But C is eliminated? So no.

""RALLY"": R, A, L, L, Y -> double L? but it's a word. A at position 2? We don't know about L and Y. But duplicate L? In feedback, we might not get full information if we double letters? For example, if we have two L's and there is only one in the word, we might get one mark and one x? It can be messy.

Therefore, I prefer ""RAPID"" because it has all unique letters: R, A, P, I, D.

Let me confirm: 
- R is first (known correct)
- A at 2: if the secret word has A at 2, we get ✓; if not, we get - (meaning A is at 4 or 5) and then we know it's not at 2.
- P, I, D are new letters.

Therefore, I think ""RAPID"" is a good guess.

But note: we have eliminated letters: C, E, N, O, S, T. ""RAPID"" doesn't contain any of these? R, A, P, I, D. So okay.

So I will guess ""RAPID"".

However, what if the word is ""R"" at 1 and then A at 4 or 5? Then in ""RAPID"", A at position 2 would be marked - (because A is in word but not at that position). And then we know A is at 4 or 5? And we get information about P, I, D.

Yes.

Another possibility: we could try ""R"" at 1 and A at 4? Like ""GUARD"" but G is a letter? But wait, we don't know. We have to use only available letters.

But we don't know what the word is. We are testing.

So ""RAPID"" is a valid choice.

Perhaps ""RAVIN""? But V and I? Both acceptable.

But ""RAPID"" is more common.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAPID"".

After analyzing the previous feedback:  

- **First guess ""crane""**: Eliminated letters C, N, E (✗). R and A are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  
- **Second guess ""roast""**: Confirmed R is the first letter (✓). Eliminated O, S, T (✗). A is still misplaced (and cannot be in position 3, as previously indicated).  

### Current Constraints:
1. Secret word starts with **R**.  
2. **A** must be present, but **not in position 3**. Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.  
3. Eliminated letters: **C, E, N, O, S, T**.  
4. Untested letters: Most consonants (B, D, F, G, H, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, U).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize placing **A** in a new position (position 2) to test if correct. If wrong, it must be at positions 4/5.  
- Include new high-frequency letters (P, I, D) to maximize information.  
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters for clarity.  
- ""RAPID"" fits, as it starts with R (correct), places A in position 2 (untested), and introduces three new letters (P, I, D).  

<guess>rapid</guess>",rapid,"We have feedback from two guesses:

- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)

Position 2: O
