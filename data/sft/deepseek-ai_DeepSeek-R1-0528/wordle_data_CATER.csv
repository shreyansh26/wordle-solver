We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2.
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in position 5.

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word contains R, A, and E, but not N.
 - R was in position 2 of our guess, so it cannot be in position 2 of the secret word.
 - A was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3.
 - E was in position 5, so it cannot be in position 5.

 Since the first letter is C, we can form a new guess that starts with C.

 We also need to include R, A, and E (but in different positions than in the first guess).
 We must avoid using N.

 We know:
 - R cannot be in position 2.
 - A cannot be in position 3.
 - E cannot be in position 5.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 -> but position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 -> but position 1 is C, so A can be in 2, 4, 5.
 And E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 -> position 1 is C, so E can be 2, 3, 4.

 However, note: we must use distinct positions? Not necessarily, but the feedback doesn't reveal duplicates. We assume the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback given doesn't indicate duplicates, so for now, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

 So, let's form a word that starts with C and includes R, A, E and one more letter (but avoid N).

 We need a 5-letter word: C _ _ _ _

 We'll try to assign:
 - R could be in position 3, 4, or 5.
 - A could be in 2, 4, or 5.
 - E could be in 2, 3, or 4.

 Let's think of common words starting with C that contain R, A, E.

 Some ideas:
 - ""CRAVE"" ? But in our first guess we had A at position 3 and now we would put A at position 3? Wait, we know A cannot be at position 3 because in the first guess we had A at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So A must be in 2,4, or5.

 But in ""CRAVE"": 
   positions: C, R, A, V, E
   We have R at position 2 -> but feedback told us that R is not in position 2 (since it was marked as ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not position 2). So that's a problem.

 Alternatively, consider ""CARVE"":
   C, A, R, V, E
   Here:
     A is at position 2 -> okay (since we didn't try A at position 2 before? Actually, in the first guess we only know A isn't at 3, but 2 is new).
     R is at position 3 -> okay (since it wasn't tried at 3 before? We had it at 2 initially, now at 3 is new).
     E is at position 5 -> but feedback said E is not at position 5? Wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and marked as not in that position, so it cannot be at 5.

 Therefore, ""CARVE"" has E at position 5 which is forbidden.

 Let's try ""CREAM"":
   C, R, E, A, M
   Position 2: R -> but we cannot have R at position 2 (because previously we had R at 2 and got '-', meaning it's not there). So invalid.

 How about ""CRATE"":
   C, R, A, T, E
   Position 2: R -> again, we cannot have R at position 2.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try moving R to a different position.

 How about placing R at position 3? Then we can have: C, _, R, _, _

 We also need A and E. And we cannot use N.

 Let's consider:
 Option 1: R at position 3, A at position 2, and E at position 4? Then we have C, A, R, E, [last letter] -> but what word? ""CAREX""? Not a word.

 Option 2: R at position 4, and A at position 2, E at position 3: then we have C, A, E, R, [last] -> ""CAERx""? Not common.

 Another idea: place A at position 4 and E at position 2? Then we have C, E, [?], A, [?]

 Example: C, E, L, A, R? -> ""CELAR"" is not a word.

 We can try ""CLEAR"": 
   C, L, E, A, R
   Let's check the positions:
     R is at position 5 -> okay (was never at 5 in the first guess? And we don't have feedback about position 5 for R, only that R was at 2 which was wrong).
     A is at position 4 -> okay (was at 3 in the first guess, so this is new).
     E is at position 3 -> in the first guess, E was at 5, which is different, so okay.

 But what about the letter L? We don't know if it is in the word? We have to try.

 However, note that we must avoid using the letter N. But L isn't N, so okay.

 So ""CLEAR"" seems possible.

 Alternatively, consider ""CAULK"", but that has U and L, and no E (but we must include E? because the feedback said E is in the word and we haven't placed it yet?).

 Actually, we know E is in the word because we got feedback that E is present (but not at position 5). So we must include E in this guess? Actually, not necessarily in every guess? But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information.

 We have confirmed letters: C (fixed at 1), and R, A, E are somewhere.

 So our guess must include R, A, E? Actually, we are allowed to guess words that may not include all the known letters? But it's better to use them to get more information.

 Therefore, we should try to include R, A, E and C (which is fixed).

 So a word of the form: C, ?, ?, ?, ? with exactly the letters we know: C and three of the four (R, A, E) plus one new letter? Actually, we know the word has R, A, E (because they are confirmed). So it must have at least these four and one more? But we don't know the fifth letter.

 We don't know the fifth letter, so we can try to use a word that has C, R, A, E and one more letter we haven't tried.

 However, we must find a valid word.

 Let me think of words that start with C, and contain R, A, E.

 One such word: ""CRATE"" -> but we saw R is forced to position 2, which we cannot do.

 Another: ""CARVE"" -> we placed E at 5 which is bad.

 Another: ""CAREY""? Not a word.

 ""CARLE""? Not common.

 How about ""CREAM"": but R is at position 2 and E at 3? We have:
   C, R, E, A, M -> but R at 2 is invalid.

 Let me rearrange: if we place R at 4? Then we can have:

 Word: C, [letter1], [letter2], R, [letter3]

 And we need A and E placed in positions ?.

 We have two spots for A and E? Actually, we have positions 2,3, and 5 for A and E? And the fifth letter.

 Consider ""CLEAR"" again: 
   C, L, E, A, R -> 
   Here:
     Position 1: C (fixed) -> correct.
     Position 2: L -> new, not tested.
     Position 3: E -> can we put E at position 3? Yes, because previously E was at 5 (so not 3) and we didn't try E at 3.
     Position 4: A -> new position for A (was at 3, now at 4).
     Position 5: R -> new position for R (was at 2, now at 5).

 So ""CLEAR"" seems valid.

 But note: the word must be in the word list. ""CLEAR"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"", but that doesn't have A or E.

 Another option: ""CREPE"": 
   C, R, E, P, E -> but duplicates? And R is at position 2 which is not allowed.

 After reevaluating, I think ""CLEAR"" is a reasonable choice.

 But wait, what if the word is ""CATER""? But in ""CATER"", we have:
   C, A, T, E, R -> 
   Position 2: A -> okay? We haven't tried A at position 2? And it's allowed because previously A was at position 3 (wrong) and position 2 is new.
   Position 5: R -> okay.
   Also, E is at position 4 -> okay.

 And we have T as the new letter.

 However, note: we have R in the word? Yes, R is at position 5. And A at 2. E at 4.

 But we must avoid using the letter N? We didn't use N. Also, we haven't tried T.

 However, in our first guess, the letter in position 4 was N? But it was marked as not present, so that doesn't forbid T.

 So ""CATER"" is also acceptable.

 But wait: the feedback told us that we have E, but we don't know its position. In ""CATER"", E is at position 4, which we haven't tested.

 Let's compare ""CLEAR"" and ""CATER"".

 Both are valid words.

 We need to choose one that maximizes information? Since we know the word has R, A, E, and we haven't tested many letters.

 In ""CLEAR"", we have letters: C, L, E, A, R -> which includes L, which is new.

 In ""CATER"", we have: C, A, T, E, R -> T is new.

 We might also consider ""CANER"" but we cannot use N? We know N is not in the word, so ""CANER"" is invalid because it has N.

 Therefore, we choose between ""CLEAR"" and ""CATER"".

 Alternatively, ""CARET"":
   C, A, R, E, T -> 
   Position 2: A -> okay? 
   Position 3: R -> but wait: R was in position 2 in the first guess and we were told it's not at 2, but we don't know about position 3? Actually, in ""CARET"", R is at position 3 -> which was not tried before? 

   However, note: we have A at position 2: we haven't tried A at position 2? 
   And R at position 3: we haven't tried R at position 3? 
   E at position 4: we haven't tried E at position 4? 
   T at position 5.

   But we must avoid: 
     R cannot be at position 2 -> which is fine because R is at 3.
     A cannot be at position 3 -> we have A at 2, which is fine.

   So ""CARET"" is acceptable.

 In fact, ""CARET"" and ""CATER"" are both similarly structured.

 However, note that ""CARET"" uses R at position 3 and ""CATER"" uses R at position 5? Actually, in ""CARET"": 
   C (1), A (2), R (3), E (4), T (5)

 And in ""CATER"":
   C (1), A (2), T (3), E (4), R (5)

 Both words have E at position 4? But we have to see if E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because in the first guess E was at 5 (which doesn't conflict).

 Actually, both words are anagrams of each other? They are permutations of the same letters? But they are different words.

 However, we don't know the positions of A, R, E exactly, so both are possibilities.

 But note: we also have the feedback about A: it was at position 3 in the first guess and marked as present but wrong position. Now putting it at position 2: if the secret word had A at position 2, then we would get a ✓ for A at position 2.

 Similarly for R: if we put it at position 3, we might get ✓ or -.

 Which word to choose? We don't know. We can pick one arbitrarily.

 Alternatively, we can pick a word that tests a letter that hasn't been tested? We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E -> so we haven't tested about 21 other letters? 

 We want to rule in or rule out common letters.

 So perhaps a word that uses a common letter? 

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: CLEAR -> uses letter L (which hasn't been tested) and also gets the known letters in new positions.

 Option 2: CARET or CATER -> uses T (which hasn't been tested).

 Which letter is more common? Both L and T are common.

 We can choose either.

 I think I'll go with ""CLEAR"" because it puts E at position 3 and A at position 4? Actually, in CLEAR:
   position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: R.

 Alternatively, ""CARVE"" was rejected because E at 5.

 But note: we must avoid E at position 5? So we have to avoid placing E at position 5.

 In ""CARET"" and ""CATER"", we don't place E at position 5? They both have E at position 4? Yes.

 Therefore, both are valid.

 Given the analysis, let me pick ""CATER"" because it is common and covers T.

 But wait: in ""CATER"", we have:
   C at 1 -> correct
   A at 2 -> if the secret word has A at 2, then we get a green A. Otherwise, we get an amber.
   T at 3 -> new letter
   E at 4 -> new position for E
   R at 5 -> new position for R

 Similarly, ""CLEAR"" has:
   C at 1 -> correct
   L at 2 -> new letter
   E at 3 -> new position
   A at 4 -> new position
   R at 5 -> new position

 Both are acceptable.

 But note the previous feedback: we know that in the first guess, the letter at position 2 was R (and it was wrong) and now we try A at position 2? We might get either green or amber. Similarly, R at 5 in ""CATER"" might be amber or green.

 I'll choose ""CATER"" because it uses T, which is a common letter, and I can get information.

 Alternatively, to maximize information, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried? We have used: C,R,A,N,E. So avoiding N, we have 25 others.

 Since we are on the second guess, I think ""CATER"" is good.

 But note: if the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 5? Then we get two greens? We hope so.

 However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARTE"", but that might be less common? I think ""CATER"" is more common.

 How about ""COATE""? Not common.

 I think ""CATER"" is acceptable.

 But let me confirm: is ""CATER"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to provide food and drink at a social event.

 Hence, I will guess ""CATER"".

 Alternatively, if we want to use a word that might position R correctly? We don't know. But I think ""CATER"" is fine.

 However, wait: we have two more possibilities for R: position 3,4, or5? And we are trying R at 5.

 Similarly, we are trying A at 2.

 But note: if the secret word has A at position 2, then we get a green. Otherwise, we get an amber meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's not at position 3? So if we don't get green for A at2, then A must be at 4 or5.

 Similarly, R: if we don't get green at5, then R must be at3 or4.

 So this guess will provide more constraints.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""CATER"".

<guess>cater</guess> 
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C✓, R-, A-, Nx, E-), we know:

1. The first letter is **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively.
3. **N** is not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **R**, **A**, and **E** in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
- Avoid using **N**.

Considering these constraints, valid words like ""CLEAR"" and ""CATER"" were evaluated. ""CATER"" was chosen because:
- It tests common unseen letters (like **T**).
- It positions:
  - **A** at position 2 (new position to test).
  - **R** at position 5 (new position, avoiding conflict).
  - **E** at position 4 (new position).
- This maximizes information by testing likely placements of confirmed letters and introducing a high-frequency untested consonant (**T**).

<guess>cater</guess>",cater,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2.
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in position 5.

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word contains R, A, and E, but not N.
 - R was in position 2 of our guess, so it cannot be in position 2 of the secret word.
 - A was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3.
 - E was in position 5, so it cannot be in position 5.

 Since the first letter is C, we can form a new guess that starts with C.

 We also need to include R, A, and E (but in different positions than in the first guess).
 We must avoid using N.

 We know:
 - R cannot be in position 2.
 - A cannot be in position 3.
 - E cannot be in position 5.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 -> but position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 -> but position 1 is C, so A can be in 2, 4, 5.
 And E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 -> position 1 is C, so E can be 2, 3, 4.

 However, note: we must use distinct positions? Not necessarily, but the feedback doesn't reveal duplicates. We assume the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback given doesn't indicate duplicates, so for now, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

 So, let's form a word that starts with C and includes R, A, E and one more letter (but avoid N).

 We need a 5-letter word: C _ _ _ _

 We'll try to assign:
 - R could be in position 3, 4, or 5.
 - A could be in 2, 4, or 5.
 - E could be in 2, 3, or 4.

 Let's think of common words starting with C that contain R, A, E.

 Some ideas:
 - ""CRAVE"" ? But in our first guess we had A at position 3 and now we would put A at position 3? Wait, we know A cannot be at position 3 because in the first guess we had A at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So A must be in 2,4, or5.

 But in ""CRAVE"": 
   positions: C, R, A, V, E
   We have R at position 2 -> but feedback told us that R is not in position 2 (since it was marked as ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not position 2). So that's a problem.

 Alternatively, consider ""CARVE"":
   C, A, R, V, E
   Here:
     A is at position 2 -> okay (since we didn't try A at position 2 before? Actually, in the first guess we only know A isn't at 3, but 2 is new).
     R is at position 3 -> okay (since it wasn't tried at 3 before? We had it at 2 initially, now at 3 is new).
     E is at position 5 -> but feedback said E is not at position 5? Wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and marked as not in that position, so it cannot be at 5.

 Therefore, ""CARVE"" has E at position 5 which is forbidden.

 Let's try ""CREAM"":
   C, R, E, A, M
   Position 2: R -> but we cannot have R at position 2 (because previously we had R at 2 and got '-', meaning it's not there). So invalid.

 How about ""CRATE"":
   C, R, A, T, E
   Position 2: R -> again, we cannot have R at position 2.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try moving R to a different position.

 How about placing R at position 3? Then we can have: C, _, R, _, _

 We also need A and E. And we cannot use N.

 Let's consider:
 Option 1: R at position 3, A at position 2, and E at position 4? Then we have C, A, R, E, [last letter] -> but what word? ""CAREX""? Not a word.

 Option 2: R at position 4, and A at position 2, E at position 3: then we have C, A, E, R, [last] -> ""CAERx""? Not common.

 Another idea: place A at position 4 and E at position 2? Then we have C, E, [?], A, [?]

 Example: C, E, L, A, R? -> ""CELAR"" is not a word.

 We can try ""CLEAR"": 
   C, L, E, A, R
   Let's check the positions:
     R is at position 5 -> okay (was never at 5 in the first guess? And we don't have feedback about position 5 for R, only that R was at 2 which was wrong).
     A is at position 4 -> okay (was at 3 in the first guess, so this is new).
     E is at position 3 -> in the first guess, E was at 5, which is different, so okay.

 But what about the letter L? We don't know if it is in the word? We have to try.

 However, note that we must avoid using the letter N. But L isn't N, so okay.

 So ""CLEAR"" seems possible.

 Alternatively, consider ""CAULK"", but that has U and L, and no E (but we must include E? because the feedback said E is in the word and we haven't placed it yet?).

 Actually, we know E is in the word because we got feedback that E is present (but not at position 5). So we must include E in this guess? Actually, not necessarily in every guess? But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information.

 We have confirmed letters: C (fixed at 1), and R, A, E are somewhere.

 So our guess must include R, A, E? Actually, we are allowed to guess words that may not include all the known letters? But it's better to use them to get more information.

 Therefore, we should try to include R, A, E and C (which is fixed).

 So a word of the form: C, ?, ?, ?, ? with exactly the letters we know: C and three of the four (R, A, E) plus one new letter? Actually, we know the word has R, A, E (because they are confirmed). So it must have at least these four and one more? But we don't know the fifth letter.

 We don't know the fifth letter, so we can try to use a word that has C, R, A, E and one more letter we haven't tried.

 However, we must find a valid word.

 Let me think of words that start with C, and contain R, A, E.

 One such word: ""CRATE"" -> but we saw R is forced to position 2, which we cannot do.

 Another: ""CARVE"" -> we placed E at 5 which is bad.

 Another: ""CAREY""? Not a word.

 ""CARLE""? Not common.

 How about ""CREAM"": but R is at position 2 and E at 3? We have:
   C, R, E, A, M -> but R at 2 is invalid.

 Let me rearrange: if we place R at 4? Then we can have:

 Word: C, [letter1], [letter2], R, [letter3]

 And we need A and E placed in positions ?.

 We have two spots for A and E? Actually, we have positions 2,3, and 5 for A and E? And the fifth letter.

 Consider ""CLEAR"" again: 
   C, L, E, A, R -> 
   Here:
     Position 1: C (fixed) -> correct.
     Position 2: L -> new, not tested.
     Position 3: E -> can we put E at position 3? Yes, because previously E was at 5 (so not 3) and we didn't try E at 3.
     Position 4: A -> new position for A (was at 3, now at 4).
     Position 5: R -> new position for R (was at 2, now at 5).

 So ""CLEAR"" seems valid.

 But note: the word must be in the word list. ""CLEAR"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"", but that doesn't have A or E.

 Another option: ""CREPE"": 
   C, R, E, P, E -> but duplicates? And R is at position 2 which is not allowed.

 After reevaluating, I think ""CLEAR"" is a reasonable choice.

 But wait, what if the word is ""CATER""? But in ""CATER"", we have:
   C, A, T, E, R -> 
   Position 2: A -> okay? We haven't tried A at position 2? And it's allowed because previously A was at position 3 (wrong) and position 2 is new.
   Position 5: R -> okay.
   Also, E is at position 4 -> okay.

 And we have T as the new letter.

 However, note: we have R in the word? Yes, R is at position 5. And A at 2. E at 4.

 But we must avoid using the letter N? We didn't use N. Also, we haven't tried T.

 However, in our first guess, the letter in position 4 was N? But it was marked as not present, so that doesn't forbid T.

 So ""CATER"" is also acceptable.

 But wait: the feedback told us that we have E, but we don't know its position. In ""CATER"", E is at position 4, which we haven't tested.

 Let's compare ""CLEAR"" and ""CATER"".

 Both are valid words.

 We need to choose one that maximizes information? Since we know the word has R, A, E, and we haven't tested many letters.

 In ""CLEAR"", we have letters: C, L, E, A, R -> which includes L, which is new.

 In ""CATER"", we have: C, A, T, E, R -> T is new.

 We might also consider ""CANER"" but we cannot use N? We know N is not in the word, so ""CANER"" is invalid because it has N.

 Therefore, we choose between ""CLEAR"" and ""CATER"".

 Alternatively, ""CARET"":
   C, A, R, E, T -> 
   Position 2: A -> okay? 
   Position 3: R -> but wait: R was in position 2 in the first guess and we were told it's not at 2, but we don't know about position 3? Actually, in ""CARET"", R is at position 3 -> which was not tried before? 

   However, note: we have A at position 2: we haven't tried A at position 2? 
   And R at position 3: we haven't tried R at position 3? 
   E at position 4: we haven't tried E at position 4? 
   T at position 5.

   But we must avoid: 
     R cannot be at position 2 -> which is fine because R is at 3.
     A cannot be at position 3 -> we have A at 2, which is fine.

   So ""CARET"" is acceptable.

 In fact, ""CARET"" and ""CATER"" are both similarly structured.

 However, note that ""CARET"" uses R at position 3 and ""CATER"" uses R at position 5? Actually, in ""CARET"": 
   C (1), A (2), R (3), E (4), T (5)

 And in ""CATER"":
   C (1), A (2), T (3), E (4), R (5)

 Both words have E at position 4? But we have to see if E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because in the first guess E was at 5 (which doesn't conflict).

 Actually, both words are anagrams of each other? They are permutations of the same letters? But they are different words.

 However, we don't know the positions of A, R, E exactly, so both are possibilities.

 But note: we also have the feedback about A: it was at position 3 in the first guess and marked as present but wrong position. Now putting it at position 2: if the secret word had A at position 2, then we would get a ✓ for A at position 2.

 Similarly for R: if we put it at position 3, we might get ✓ or -.

 Which word to choose? We don't know. We can pick one arbitrarily.

 Alternatively, we can pick a word that tests a letter that hasn't been tested? We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E -> so we haven't tested about 21 other letters? 

 We want to rule in or rule out common letters.

 So perhaps a word that uses a common letter? 

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: CLEAR -> uses letter L (which hasn't been tested) and also gets the known letters in new positions.

 Option 2: CARET or CATER -> uses T (which hasn't been tested).

 Which letter is more common? Both L and T are common.

 We can choose either.

 I think I'll go with ""CLEAR"" because it puts E at position 3 and A at position 4? Actually, in CLEAR:
   position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: R.

 Alternatively, ""CARVE"" was rejected because E at 5.

 But note: we must avoid E at position 5? So we have to avoid placing E at position 5.

 In ""CARET"" and ""CATER"", we don't place E at position 5? They both have E at position 4? Yes.

 Therefore, both are valid.

 Given the analysis, let me pick ""CATER"" because it is common and covers T.

 But wait: in ""CATER"", we have:
   C at 1 -> correct
   A at 2 -> if the secret word has A at 2, then we get a green A. Otherwise, we get an amber.
   T at 3 -> new letter
   E at 4 -> new position for E
   R at 5 -> new position for R

 Similarly, ""CLEAR"" has:
   C at 1 -> correct
   L at 2 -> new letter
   E at 3 -> new position
   A at 4 -> new position
   R at 5 -> new position

 Both are acceptable.

 But note the previous feedback: we know that in the first guess, the letter at position 2 was R (and it was wrong) and now we try A at position 2? We might get either green or amber. Similarly, R at 5 in ""CATER"" might be amber or green.

 I'll choose ""CATER"" because it uses T, which is a common letter, and I can get information.

 Alternatively, to maximize information, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried? We have used: C,R,A,N,E. So avoiding N, we have 25 others.

 Since we are on the second guess, I think ""CATER"" is good.

 But note: if the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 5? Then we get two greens? We hope so.

 However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARTE"", but that might be less common? I think ""CATER"" is more common.

 How about ""COATE""? Not common.

 I think ""CATER"" is acceptable.

 But let me confirm: is ""CATER"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to provide food and drink at a social event.

 Hence, I will guess ""CATER"".

 Alternatively, if we want to use a word that might position R correctly? We don't know. But I think ""CATER"" is fine.

 However, wait: we have two more possibilities for R: position 3,4, or5? And we are trying R at 5.

 Similarly, we are trying A at 2.

 But note: if the secret word has A at position 2, then we get a green. Otherwise, we get an amber meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's not at position 3? So if we don't get green for A at2, then A must be at 4 or5.

 Similarly, R: if we don't get green at5, then R must be at3 or4.

 So this guess will provide more constraints.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""CATER"".

<guess>cater</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C✓, R-, A-, Nx, E-), we know:

1. The first letter is **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively.
3. **N** is not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **R**, **A**, and **E** in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
- Avoid using **N**.

Considering these constraints, valid words like ""CLEAR"" and ""CATER"" were evaluated. ""CATER"" was chosen because:
- It tests common unseen letters (like **T**).
- It positions:
  - **A** at position 2 (new position to test).
  - **R** at position 5 (new position, avoiding conflict).
  - **E** at position 4 (new position).
- This maximizes information by testing likely placements of confirmed letters and introducing a high-frequency untested consonant (**T**).",Guess 2: cater -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
