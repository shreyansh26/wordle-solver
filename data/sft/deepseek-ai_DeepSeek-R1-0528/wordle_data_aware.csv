We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, words with common letters and no repeating letters are ideal for the first guess.

Considering common letters in English 5-letter words, vowels and frequent consonants like R, E, S, T, etc., are helpful.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. I will go with ""CRANE"".

Note: The feedback will tell us which letters are in the word and where. Since we are at the beginning, we have no prior information.

So, my first guess: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the letter 'A' in the third position and 'E' in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (since we put it in the second position and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, for the second guess, we want to use this information to narrow down possibilities.

We know:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- The word contains 'R' but not in position 2 (and also not in position 1 because we haven't tried it there? Actually, we don't know about position 1 yet).

We also know that 'C' and 'N' are absent.

We can think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and contain the letter 'R'. Also, we should avoid using 'C' and 'N' again.

Let's consider possible letters for the other positions.

We have two positions to fill: 1, 2, and 4 (but note that position 4 is the fourth letter, and we know the fifth is E).

The word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We know the word has an 'R' that is not in position 2. So it could be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

We can try to use a word that has:
- 'R' in a different position (like position 1 or 4) to test.
- Also, we can include other common letters to get more information.

But note: we already have two confirmed letters (A and E) and one confirmed present but misplaced (R). So we have at least three letters: R, A, E.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent (C and N).

Let me think of words that fit _ _ A _ E and have an 'R'. Also, we want to test other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""GRACE"" but we know 'C' is absent, so that's out.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E -> but we have A in position 3 and E in position 5, so that would be T R A D E. Let's check the feedback we would get? Actually, we are making a guess.

But note: we don't know if 'T' or 'D' are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts 'R' in a different position. Since we know 'R' is not in position 2, we can try putting it in position 1 or 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is the fourth letter. So if we put 'R' in position 1, then the word would be R _ A _ E.

Or if we put it in position 4, then _ _ A R E.

We also want to test other letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and contain 'R':

- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E -> but we have R in position 2 again? We already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about where R actually is. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

We need to try R in a new position. So we can try:

Option 1: Put R in position 1 -> R _ A _ E
Option 2: Put R in position 4 -> _ _ A R E

We also need to choose letters for the other positions that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and N).

But we want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are common and that we haven't ruled out.

Let me think of words for each option:

Option 1: R _ A _ E
- Possible words: ""ROATE"" (but we know E is at the end, and A is in the middle, so ""ROATE"" is R O A T E -> but that has O in position 2 and T in position 4). However, we don't know about O and T.

But note: ""ROATE"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some word lists. Alternatively, ""REATE"" is not a word.

Another word: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.

""RAISE"": R A I S E -> but that would put A in position 2, but we need A in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E. So for R _ A _ E, the second letter must be something else.

Examples:
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> but that's R O U S E, so third letter is U, not A. Doesn't fit.
- ""RELAX"": R E L A X -> but that has A in position 4, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 1, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

Let me try: ""R"" in 1, then any letter in 2, then ""A"" in 3, then any letter in 4, then ""E"" in 5.

Possible words: 
- ""ROATE"" (if accepted) -> R O A T E
- ""REAVE"" -> R E A V E
- ""RABBE"" -> not a word.
- ""RACEY"" -> but C is absent, and not a word.

More common: ""RAISE"" doesn't work because A is in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""ROATE"" (R O A T E) - meaning a financial term? Or ""orate"" without the first letter? Actually, ""roate"" might not be valid. Let me think of valid words.

""REUSE"" -> R E U S E -> third letter is U, not A.

""RINSE"" -> R I N S E -> but N is absent, and third letter is N? Also, we have N absent.

Another: ""RAZED"" -> R A Z E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

It seems difficult. Let me try the other option: put R in position 4.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

Now, we can choose letters for positions 1 and 2.

We know that the word has an R, and we are putting it in position 4. Also, we have A in 3 and E in 5.

So the word is [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Now, we need to choose two letters for the first two positions.

Common words: 
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). This fits.
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SCARE"": but C is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"": but N is absent, so no.

Other possibilities: ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"", etc.

But we haven't tested many letters. We want to test new letters to get more information.

We know that the secret word has an R, and we are going to put it in position 4. So if we choose a word that has R in position 4, then we can use the first two positions to test other common letters.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent (C and N).

So let's choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

For example, ""STARE"" uses S and T. If we use ""STARE"", then:

- If the secret word has S, we'll get feedback on its position.
- Similarly for T.

But note: we already know that the word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and R in position 4? We don't know that R is in position 4, we are just testing it.

In ""STARE"", we are putting R in position 4. If the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we'll get a minus for R.

But we are also testing S and T.

Alternatively, we could use ""PARLE"" or ""BARGE"", but let's stick to common words.

Another option: ""LARGE"" -> L A R G E -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

So ""STARE"" is a good candidate.

But let's check: in ""STARE"", we have:
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- A in position 3 (which we know is correct)
- R in position 4 (which we are testing)
- E in position 5 (correct)

We know A and E are correct, so they will get ✓. R, if it is in position 4, will get ✓. If not, it will get - because we know R is in the word. But we are trying to find where R is.

However, we also get information about S and T.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another idea: we could use a word that doesn't have R in it? But we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be inefficient because we know R is present, so we should use it to find its position.

But if we don't include R, then we might get an x for a letter that we know should be present? Actually, the feedback will show for each letter. But if we don't include R, we don't get information about where R is.

So we should include R.

Back to ""STARE"": it uses S and T, which are common and we haven't tested them.

We could also consider ""SHARE"" (S H A R E) or ""SPARE"" (S P A R E), but we don't know about P or H.

""STARE"" is a good choice because it has two very common letters (S and T).

But note: we already have A and E fixed, so we are only guessing the first two letters and the fourth? Actually, in this pattern, the fourth is R in this guess, but we are testing if R is in position 4.

If we guess ""STARE"", the feedback might be:

- If the secret word has S in position 1: ✓
- Else if S is in the word but not position 1: -
- Else: x

Similarly for T in position 2.

And for R in position 4: if it is the correct position, ✓; if not, - (since we know R is in the word).

But we don't know if S and T are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a different position? But we only have two options: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 2 we already tried and it was wrong).

We tried R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R must be in position 1 or 4.

So by putting R in position 4, we are testing one of the two possibilities.

If we get a ✓ for R, then we know R is in position 4. If we get a -, then R is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.

So this guess will tell us exactly where R is.

Moreover, we get information about S and T.

Therefore, ""STARE"" seems a good guess.

But what if the secret word is, for example, ""ROGUE""? But that doesn't have A in position 3? We know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so the word must be _ _ A _ E.

So ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit.

Another possibility: ""URAEI"" - not a common word.

So let's go with ""STARE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern _ _ A _ E in the guess? We can guess any 5-letter word. We don't have to have A and E in the same positions? Actually, we can, but it might be beneficial to move them to test? But we know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so if we put them elsewhere, we would get minuses or x's, which we already know they are fixed.

But to save time, we can keep them fixed and only change the other letters.

So I think ""STARE"" is a good second guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""STARE"" is valid.

So we'll guess ""STARE"".

If we get feedback:
- S: if in position 1, ✓; else if in word, -; else x.
- T: similarly for position 2.
- A: ✓ (we know)
- R: if in position 4, ✓; else - (because we know R is in the word, just not where)
- E: ✓

This will give us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""STARE"" as the second guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: ✓, N: x, E: ✓), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (pattern: _ _ A _ E).
- 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

For the second guess, we want to:
1. Maintain the known correct letters 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5.
2. Test the position of 'R' (which must be in position 1 or 4, since position 2 is incorrect and positions 3/5 are fixed).
3. Introduce new common letters (like 'S' and 'T') to gather more information.

The word ""stare"" fits this strategy:
- It follows the pattern _ _ A _ E (S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4, E in position 5).
- It places 'R' in position 4 to test if that is the correct location.
- It uses 'S' and 'T' (common letters not yet tested) to maximize feedback.

<guess>stare</guess>",stare,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the letter 'A' in the third position and 'E' in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (since we put it in the second position and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

- Position 5: E
- The word contains 'R' but not in position 2 (and also not in position 1 because we haven't tried it there? Actually, we don't know about position 1 yet).

We also know that 'C' and 'N' are absent.

We can think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and contain the letter 'R'. Also, we should avoid using 'C' and 'N' again.

Let's consider possible letters for the other positions.

We have two positions to fill: 1, 2, and 4 (but note that position 4 is the fourth letter, and we know the fifth is E).

The word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We know the word has an 'R' that is not in position 2. So it could be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

We can try to use a word that has:
- 'R' in a different position (like position 1 or 4) to test.
- Also, we can include other common letters to get more information.

But note: we already have two confirmed letters (A and E) and one confirmed present but misplaced (R). So we have at least three letters: R, A, E.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent (C and N).

Let me think of words that fit _ _ A _ E and have an 'R'. Also, we want to test other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""GRACE"" but we know 'C' is absent, so that's out.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E -> but we have A in position 3 and E in position 5, so that would be T R A D E. Let's check the feedback we would get? Actually, we are making a guess.

But note: we don't know if 'T' or 'D' are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts 'R' in a different position. Since we know 'R' is not in position 2, we can try putting it in position 1 or 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is the fourth letter. So if we put 'R' in position 1, then the word would be R _ A _ E.

Or if we put it in position 4, then _ _ A R E.

We also want to test other letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and contain 'R':

- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E -> but we have R in position 2 again? We already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about where R actually is. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

We also need to choose letters for the other positions that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and N).

But we want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are common and that we haven't ruled out.

Let me think of words for each option:

Option 1: R _ A _ E
- Possible words: ""ROATE"" (but we know E is at the end, and A is in the middle, so ""ROATE"" is R O A T E -> but that has O in position 2 and T in position 4). However, we don't know about O and T.

But note: ""ROATE"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some word lists. Alternatively, ""REATE"" is not a word.

Another word: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.

""RAISE"": R A I S E -> but that would put A in position 2, but we need A in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E. So for R _ A _ E, the second letter must be something else.

Examples:
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> but that's R O U S E, so third letter is U, not A. Doesn't fit.
- ""RELAX"": R E L A X -> but that has A in position 4, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 1, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

Let me try: ""R"" in 1, then any letter in 2, then ""A"" in 3, then any letter in 4, then ""E"" in 5.

Possible words: 
- ""ROATE"" (if accepted) -> R O A T E
- ""REAVE"" -> R E A V E
- ""RABBE"" -> not a word.
- ""RACEY"" -> but C is absent, and not a word.

More common: ""RAISE"" doesn't work because A is in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""ROATE"" (R O A T E) - meaning a financial term? Or ""orate"" without the first letter? Actually, ""roate"" might not be valid. Let me think of valid words.

""REUSE"" -> R E U S E -> third letter is U, not A.

""RINSE"" -> R I N S E -> but N is absent, and third letter is N? Also, we have N absent.

Another: ""RAZED"" -> R A Z E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

It seems difficult. Let me try the other option: put R in position 4.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

Now, we can choose letters for positions 1 and 2.

We know that the word has an R, and we are putting it in position 4. Also, we have A in 3 and E in 5.

So the word is [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Now, we need to choose two letters for the first two positions.

Common words: 
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). This fits.
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SCARE"": but C is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"": but N is absent, so no.

Other possibilities: ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"", etc.

But we haven't tested many letters. We want to test new letters to get more information.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent (C and N).

So let's choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

- If the secret word has S, we'll get feedback on its position.
- Similarly for T.

But note: we already know that the word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and R in position 4? We don't know that R is in position 4, we are just testing it.

In ""STARE"", we are putting R in position 4. If the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we'll get a minus for R.

But we are also testing S and T.

Alternatively, we could use ""PARLE"" or ""BARGE"", but let's stick to common words.

Another option: ""LARGE"" -> L A R G E -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

So ""STARE"" is a good candidate.

But let's check: in ""STARE"", we have:
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- A in position 3 (which we know is correct)
- R in position 4 (which we are testing)
- E in position 5 (correct)

We know A and E are correct, so they will get ✓. R, if it is in position 4, will get ✓. If not, it will get - because we know R is in the word. But we are trying to find where R is.

However, we also get information about S and T.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another idea: we could use a word that doesn't have R in it? But we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be inefficient because we know R is present, so we should use it to find its position.

But if we don't include R, then we might get an x for a letter that we know should be present? Actually, the feedback will show for each letter. But if we don't include R, we don't get information about where R is.

So we should include R.

Back to ""STARE"": it uses S and T, which are common and we haven't tested them.

We could also consider ""SHARE"" (S H A R E) or ""SPARE"" (S P A R E), but we don't know about P or H.

""STARE"" is a good choice because it has two very common letters (S and T).

But note: we already have A and E fixed, so we are only guessing the first two letters and the fourth? Actually, in this pattern, the fourth is R in this guess, but we are testing if R is in position 4.

If we guess ""STARE"", the feedback might be:

- If the secret word has S in position 1: ✓
- Else if S is in the word but not position 1: -
- Else: x

Similarly for T in position 2.

And for R in position 4: if it is the correct position, ✓; if not, - (since we know R is in the word).

But we don't know if S and T are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a different position? But we only have two options: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 2 we already tried and it was wrong).

We tried R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R must be in position 1 or 4.

So by putting R in position 4, we are testing one of the two possibilities.

If we get a ✓ for R, then we know R is in position 4. If we get a -, then R is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.

So this guess will tell us exactly where R is.

Moreover, we get information about S and T.

Therefore, ""STARE"" seems a good guess.

But what if the secret word is, for example, ""ROGUE""? But that doesn't have A in position 3? We know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so the word must be _ _ A _ E.

So ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit.

Another possibility: ""URAEI"" - not a common word.

So let's go with ""STARE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern _ _ A _ E in the guess? We can guess any 5-letter word. We don't have to have A and E in the same positions? Actually, we can, but it might be beneficial to move them to test? But we know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so if we put them elsewhere, we would get minuses or x's, which we already know they are fixed.

But to save time, we can keep them fixed and only change the other letters.

So I think ""STARE"" is a good second guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""STARE"" is valid.

So we'll guess ""STARE"".

If we get feedback:
- S: if in position 1, ✓; else if in word, -; else x.
- T: similarly for position 2.
- A: ✓ (we know)
- R: if in position 4, ✓; else - (because we know R is in the word, just not where)
- E: ✓

This will give us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""STARE"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: ✓, N: x, E: ✓), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (pattern: _ _ A _ E).
- 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

For the second guess, we want to:
1. Maintain the known correct letters 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5.
2. Test the position of 'R' (which must be in position 1 or 4, since position 2 is incorrect and positions 3/5 are fixed).
3. Introduce new common letters (like 'S' and 'T') to gather more information.

The word ""stare"" fits this strategy:
- It follows the pattern _ _ A _ E (S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4, E in position 5).
- It places 'R' in position 4 to test if that is the correct location.
- It uses 'S' and 'T' (common letters not yet tested) to maximize feedback.",Guess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,aware,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, words with common letters and no repeating letters are ideal for the first guess.

Considering common letters in English 5-letter words, vowels and frequent consonants like R, E, S, T, etc., are helpful.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. I will go with ""CRANE"".

Note: The feedback will tell us which letters are in the word and where. Since we are at the beginning, we have no prior information.

So, my first guess: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the letter 'A' in the third position and 'E' in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (since we put it in the second position and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, for the second guess, we want to use this information to narrow down possibilities.

We know:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- The word contains 'R' but not in position 2 (and also not in position 1 because we haven't tried it there? Actually, we don't know about position 1 yet).

We also know that 'C' and 'N' are absent.

We can think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and contain the letter 'R'. Also, we should avoid using 'C' and 'N' again.

Let's consider possible letters for the other positions.

We have two positions to fill: 1, 2, and 4 (but note that position 4 is the fourth letter, and we know the fifth is E).

The word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We know the word has an 'R' that is not in position 2. So it could be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

We can try to use a word that has:
- 'R' in a different position (like position 1 or 4) to test.
- Also, we can include other common letters to get more information.

But note: we already have two confirmed letters (A and E) and one confirmed present but misplaced (R). So we have at least three letters: R, A, E.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent (C and N).

Let me think of words that fit _ _ A _ E and have an 'R'. Also, we want to test other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""GRACE"" but we know 'C' is absent, so that's out.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E -> but we have A in position 3 and E in position 5, so that would be T R A D E. Let's check the feedback we would get? Actually, we are making a guess.

But note: we don't know if 'T' or 'D' are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts 'R' in a different position. Since we know 'R' is not in position 2, we can try putting it in position 1 or 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is the fourth letter. So if we put 'R' in position 1, then the word would be R _ A _ E.

Or if we put it in position 4, then _ _ A R E.

We also want to test other letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and contain 'R':

- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E -> but we have R in position 2 again? We already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about where R actually is. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

We need to try R in a new position. So we can try:

Option 1: Put R in position 1 -> R _ A _ E
Option 2: Put R in position 4 -> _ _ A R E

We also need to choose letters for the other positions that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and N).

But we want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are common and that we haven't ruled out.

Let me think of words for each option:

Option 1: R _ A _ E
- Possible words: ""ROATE"" (but we know E is at the end, and A is in the middle, so ""ROATE"" is R O A T E -> but that has O in position 2 and T in position 4). However, we don't know about O and T.

But note: ""ROATE"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some word lists. Alternatively, ""REATE"" is not a word.

Another word: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.

""RAISE"": R A I S E -> but that would put A in position 2, but we need A in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E. So for R _ A _ E, the second letter must be something else.

Examples:
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> but that's R O U S E, so third letter is U, not A. Doesn't fit.
- ""RELAX"": R E L A X -> but that has A in position 4, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 1, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

Let me try: ""R"" in 1, then any letter in 2, then ""A"" in 3, then any letter in 4, then ""E"" in 5.

Possible words: 
- ""ROATE"" (if accepted) -> R O A T E
- ""REAVE"" -> R E A V E
- ""RABBE"" -> not a word.
- ""RACEY"" -> but C is absent, and not a word.

More common: ""RAISE"" doesn't work because A is in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""ROATE"" (R O A T E) - meaning a financial term? Or ""orate"" without the first letter? Actually, ""roate"" might not be valid. Let me think of valid words.

""REUSE"" -> R E U S E -> third letter is U, not A.

""RINSE"" -> R I N S E -> but N is absent, and third letter is N? Also, we have N absent.

Another: ""RAZED"" -> R A Z E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

It seems difficult. Let me try the other option: put R in position 4.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

Now, we can choose letters for positions 1 and 2.

We know that the word has an R, and we are putting it in position 4. Also, we have A in 3 and E in 5.

So the word is [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Now, we need to choose two letters for the first two positions.

Common words: 
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). This fits.
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SCARE"": but C is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"": but N is absent, so no.

Other possibilities: ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"", etc.

But we haven't tested many letters. We want to test new letters to get more information.

We know that the secret word has an R, and we are going to put it in position 4. So if we choose a word that has R in position 4, then we can use the first two positions to test other common letters.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent (C and N).

So let's choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

For example, ""STARE"" uses S and T. If we use ""STARE"", then:

- If the secret word has S, we'll get feedback on its position.
- Similarly for T.

But note: we already know that the word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and R in position 4? We don't know that R is in position 4, we are just testing it.

In ""STARE"", we are putting R in position 4. If the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we'll get a minus for R.

But we are also testing S and T.

Alternatively, we could use ""PARLE"" or ""BARGE"", but let's stick to common words.

Another option: ""LARGE"" -> L A R G E -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

So ""STARE"" is a good candidate.

But let's check: in ""STARE"", we have:
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- A in position 3 (which we know is correct)
- R in position 4 (which we are testing)
- E in position 5 (correct)

We know A and E are correct, so they will get ✓. R, if it is in position 4, will get ✓. If not, it will get - because we know R is in the word. But we are trying to find where R is.

However, we also get information about S and T.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another idea: we could use a word that doesn't have R in it? But we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be inefficient because we know R is present, so we should use it to find its position.

But if we don't include R, then we might get an x for a letter that we know should be present? Actually, the feedback will show for each letter. But if we don't include R, we don't get information about where R is.

So we should include R.

Back to ""STARE"": it uses S and T, which are common and we haven't tested them.

We could also consider ""SHARE"" (S H A R E) or ""SPARE"" (S P A R E), but we don't know about P or H.

""STARE"" is a good choice because it has two very common letters (S and T).

But note: we already have A and E fixed, so we are only guessing the first two letters and the fourth? Actually, in this pattern, the fourth is R in this guess, but we are testing if R is in position 4.

If we guess ""STARE"", the feedback might be:

- If the secret word has S in position 1: ✓
- Else if S is in the word but not position 1: -
- Else: x

Similarly for T in position 2.

And for R in position 4: if it is the correct position, ✓; if not, - (since we know R is in the word).

But we don't know if S and T are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a different position? But we only have two options: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 2 we already tried and it was wrong).

We tried R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R must be in position 1 or 4.

So by putting R in position 4, we are testing one of the two possibilities.

If we get a ✓ for R, then we know R is in position 4. If we get a -, then R is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.

So this guess will tell us exactly where R is.

Moreover, we get information about S and T.

Therefore, ""STARE"" seems a good guess.

But what if the secret word is, for example, ""ROGUE""? But that doesn't have A in position 3? We know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so the word must be _ _ A _ E.

So ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit.

Another possibility: ""URAEI"" - not a common word.

So let's go with ""STARE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern _ _ A _ E in the guess? We can guess any 5-letter word. We don't have to have A and E in the same positions? Actually, we can, but it might be beneficial to move them to test? But we know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so if we put them elsewhere, we would get minuses or x's, which we already know they are fixed.

But to save time, we can keep them fixed and only change the other letters.

So I think ""STARE"" is a good second guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""STARE"" is valid.

So we'll guess ""STARE"".

If we get feedback:
- S: if in position 1, ✓; else if in word, -; else x.
- T: similarly for position 2.
- A: ✓ (we know)
- R: if in position 4, ✓; else - (because we know R is in the word, just not where)
- E: ✓

This will give us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""STARE"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: ✓, N: x, E: ✓), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (pattern: _ _ A _ E).
- 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

For the second guess, we want to:
1. Maintain the known correct letters 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5.
2. Test the position of 'R' (which must be in position 1 or 4, since position 2 is incorrect and positions 3/5 are fixed).
3. Introduce new common letters (like 'S' and 'T') to gather more information.

- It follows the pattern _ _ A _ E (S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4, E in position 5).
- It places 'R' in position 4 to test if that is the correct location.
- It uses 'S' and 'T' (common letters not yet tested) to maximize feedback.

Let me try the other option: put R in position 4.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ A R E\n\nNow, we can choose letters for positions 1 and 2.\n\nWe know that the word has an R, and we are putting it in position 4. Also, we have A in 3 and E in 5.\n\nSo the word is [letter1] [letter2] A R E\n\nNow, we need to choose two letters for the first two positions.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). This fits.\n- ""SHARE"": S H A R E\n- ""SCARE"": but C is absent, so no.\n- ""SNARE"": but N is absent, so no.\n\nOther possibilities: ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"", etc.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters. We want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWe know that the secret word has an R, and we are going to put it in position 4. So if we choose a word that has R in position 4, then we can use the first two positions to test other common letters.\n\nWe should avoid using letters we know are absent (C and N).\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that uses common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nFor example, ""STARE"" uses S and T. If we use ""STARE"", then:\n\n- If the secret word has S, we\'ll get feedback on its position.\n- Similarly for T.\n\nBut note: we already know that the word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and R in position 4? We don\'t know that R is in position 4, we are just testing it.\n\nIn ""STARE"", we are putting R in position 4. If the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it\'s not in position 4, we\'ll get a minus for R.\n\nBut we are also testing S and T.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""PARLE"" or ""BARGE"", but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother option: ""LARGE"" -> L A R G E -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1] [letter2] A R E.\n\nSo ""STARE"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check: in ""STARE"", we have:\n- S in position 1\n- T in position 2\n- A in position 3 (which we know is correct)\n- R in position 4 (which we are testing)\n- E in position 5 (correct)\n\nWe know A and E are correct, so they will get ✓. R, if it is in position 4, will get ✓. If not, it will get - because we know R is in the word. But we are trying to find where R is.\n\nHowever, we also get information about S and T.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: we could use a word that doesn\'t have R in it? But we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it would be inefficient because we know R is present, so we should use it to find its position.\n\nBut if we don\'t include R, then we might get an x for a letter that we know should be present? Actually, the feedback will show for each letter. But if we don\'t include R, we don\'t get information about where R is.\n\nSo we should include R.\n\nBack to ""STARE"": it uses S and T, which are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\nWe could also consider ""SHARE"" (S H A R E) or ""SPARE"" (S P A R E), but we don\'t know about P or H.\n\n""STARE"" is a good choice because it has two very common letters (S and T).\n\nBut note: we already have A and E fixed, so we are only guessing the first two letters and the fourth? Actually, in this pattern, the fourth is R in this guess, but we are testing if R is in position 4.\n\nIf we guess ""STARE"", the feedback might be:\n\n- If the secret word has S in position 1: ✓\n- Else if S is in the word but not position 1: -\n- Else: x\n\nSimilarly for T in position 2.\n\nAnd for R in position 4: if it is the correct position, ✓; if not, - (since we know R is in the word).\n\nBut we don\'t know if S and T are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a different position? But we only have two options: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 2 we already tried and it was wrong).\n\nWe tried R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R must be in position 1 or 4.\n\nSo by putting R in position 4, we are testing one of the two possibilities.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for R, then we know R is in position 4. If we get a -, then R is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.\n\nSo this guess will tell us exactly where R is.\n\nMoreover, we get information about S and T.\n\nTherefore, ""STARE"" seems a good guess.\n\nBut what if the secret word is, for example, ""ROGUE""? But that doesn\'t have A in position 3? We know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so the word must be _ _ A _ E.\n\nSo ""ROGUE"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother possibility: ""URAEI"" - not a common word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the pattern _ _ A _ E in the guess? We can guess any 5-letter word. We don\'t have to have A and E in the same positions? Actually, we can, but it might be beneficial to move them to test? But we know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so if we put them elsewhere, we would get minuses or x\'s, which we already know they are fixed.\n\nBut to save time, we can keep them fixed and only change the other letters.\n\nSo I think ""STARE"" is a good second guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""STARE"" is valid.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""STARE"".\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- S: if in position 1, ✓; else if in word, -; else x.\n- T: similarly for position 2.\n- A: ✓ (we know)\n- R: if in position 4, ✓; else - (because we know R is in the word, just not where)\n- E: ✓\n\nThis will give us a lot of information.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""STARE"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: ✓, N: x, E: ✓), we know:\n- The secret word has \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5 (pattern: _ _ A _ E).\n- \'R\' is in the word but not in position 2.\n- \'C\' and \'N\' are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess, we want to:\n1. Maintain the known correct letters \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5.\n2. Test the position of \'R\' (which must be in position 1 or 4, since position 2 is incorrect and positions 3/5 are fixed).\n3. Introduce new common letters (like \'S\' and \'T\') to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""stare"" fits this strategy:\n- It follows the pattern _ _ A _ E (S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4, E in position 5).\n- It places \'R\' in position 4 to test if that is the correct location.\n- It uses \'S\' and \'T\' (common letters not yet tested) to maximize feedback.\n\n<guess>stare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 4)  [This is new information!]
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3, 'R' in position 4, and 'E' in position 5. So the pattern is: _ _ A R E
- We also know that 'R' is confirmed to be in position 4 (from the second guess).
- We know that 'C', 'N', 'S', and 'T' are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

We need to find the first two letters. They cannot be C, N, S, T (from the absent letters) and also not the letters we already know (A, R, E) because we have no duplicates? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, so we might assume no duplicates for now, but we should be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had R and in the second guess we had R again, and it was marked as correct in position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, if there were two R's, then in the first guess when we put R in position 2, it would have been marked as present (which it was) and in the second guess, when we put R in position 4, it would be correct. But if there were only one R, then the first guess R in position 2 would be present but wrong position, and the second guess R in position 4 would be correct, which is consistent. So it's possible that there is only one R.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we can assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the first two letters must be two distinct letters that are not C, N, S, T, and also not A, R, E (since they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates).

So available letters: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

But we have to form a valid English word.

The word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

We need to choose letter1 and letter2 from the remaining letters.

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""BLARE"" (B L A R E)
- ""FLARE"" (F L A R E)
- ""GLARE"" (G L A R E)
- ""SHARE"" but S is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"" but S and N are absent, no.
- ""SPARE"" but S is absent, no.
- ""STARE"" we already tried, and S and T are absent.

Other possibilities: ""AWARE"" but A is already in position 3, and we are assuming no duplicates, so A cannot be used again. Also, in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate, so it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's, but we don't have evidence for duplicates.

So let's stick to words without duplicates and without the forbidden letters.

So ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"" are candidates.

But we haven't tested B, F, G, L, etc.

We have to make a guess that can help us distinguish between these possibilities.

We have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We can try one of these, but if we try ""BLARE"", for example, and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and L.

Similarly for the others.

But we can also try a word that uses more new letters? However, the pattern is fixed for the last three letters: A R E.

So we must have A in 3, R in 4, E in 5.

The only flexibility is in the first two letters.

We can try a word that has two new common letters to test.

But note: we are constrained by the pattern. We must have a word that ends with ""ARE"".

So the first two letters must form a valid word with ""ARE"".

We can list possible words:

- ""BLARE""
- ""FLARE""
- ""GLARE""
- ""AWARE"" (if duplicates allowed, but we avoid for now)
- ""SCARE"" (but S and C are absent)
- ""SHARE"" (S absent)
- ""SNARE"" (S and N absent)
- ""SPARE"" (S absent)
- ""STARE"" (tried, S and T absent)
- ""WHARE"" (not common, but ""whare"" is a Maori word, might not be in word list)
- ""CHARE"" (C absent, and not common)

Other words: ""PARER"" (but has two R's and ends with ER, not ARE) -> no.

""BARRE"" (B A R R E) -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

So the main candidates are ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"".

We also have ""DWARE"" or ""KWARE""? Not words.

""OARED"" -> O A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

So it seems the common ones are the ones with L: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

But there might be others: ""AWARE"" (if we consider duplicates) or ""ALARE"" not a word.

Another one: ""URARE"" not a word.

So we have three strong candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

We need to choose one that can help us. Since we have to guess one, and if it's wrong, we get feedback on the first two letters.

But we can also think of a word that uses letters that are in many of these possibilities? But they all have L in the second position? Actually:

- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L

So they all have L in the second position? Let's see:

BLARE: B (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)
FLARE: F (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)
GLARE: G (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)

So in all three, the second letter is L.

Therefore, if we assume that the second letter is L, then we only need to find the first letter.

But we don't know that for sure. There might be other words without L.

For example, ""AWARE"": A (1), W (2), A (3) -> but duplicate A? And we have A in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

""CARED"" -> C absent, and A in position 2.

""BARED"" -> B A R E D -> A in position 2.

I think the only words that fit _ _ A R E with no duplicates and without the forbidden letters are the ones with L in position 2.

But let me think: ""QUARE"" is not a word.

""DIARY"" -> D I A R Y -> but that ends with Y, not E.

""HAIRE"" not a word.

So probably, the word is one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, the second letter is L.

So we can fix the second letter as L? But we need to confirm.

We don't know for sure, but it's highly likely.

We can make a guess that has L in position 2 and a new letter in position 1.

But we have to choose one: B, F, or G.

We can try, for example, ""BLARE"". If it's not the word, we get feedback that B is not in the word (if x) or in the word but wrong position (if -), but since position 1 is the only position for B, if it's not correct, then it would be absent? Because we have no other positions for B.

In ""BLARE"", if we guess it and the secret word is ""FLARE"", then:

- B: x (because F is the first letter, not B)
- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2 in both, then correct)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

But we know A, R, E are correct, so they will be ✓. L would be ✓ if it is in position 2. B would be x if not in the word.

Similarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", same thing.

But if we guess ""BLARE"" and it's wrong, we know that the first letter is not B, so it must be F or G.

Then we can guess between FLARE and GLARE.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can do that.

To save a guess, we might try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have L in position 2? But then we risk missing the pattern.

But let's see: is there a word that fits _ _ A R E without L in position 2?

For example, ""AWARE"": if we allow duplicate A, then A(1) W(2) A(3) R(4) E(5). But we have A in position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered one yet.

In the feedback, if there is a duplicate, the feedback would indicate it. For example, if the word has two A's, and we guess an A in a wrong position, it would show as present (yellow) if there is another A that is not accounted for.

But in our first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn't have A elsewhere. In the second guess, we didn't have A elsewhere. So we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's, but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M A R R Y -> not ending with E.

""TARRE"" not a word.

""VARVE"" -> V A R V E -> A in position 2, not 3.

I think it's safe to assume that the second letter is L for now.

But let's check the dictionary: are there other words?

- ""BLARE"" (valid)
- ""FLARE"" (valid)
- ""GLARE"" (valid)
- ""ULARE"" not a word
- ""ILARE"" not a word
- ""ALARE"" not a word
- ""ELARE"" not a word
- ""OLARE"" not a word

""WARE"" is 4 letters.

So yes, the common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, we can guess one of them.

To choose which one, we can pick the one with the most common letters. But B, F, G are all consonants.

We can also consider that we haven't tested B, F, G, L.

But we know L must be in position 2 if one of these words.

So let's guess ""GLARE"" because G is a common letter? Or ""BLARE""?

We can also think of the frequency.

But to be systematic, we can guess ""BLARE"".

If it's not, then we know it's either FLARE or GLARE.

But we have to use a guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without committing to L? But we don't have such a word because the pattern requires the last three to be A, R, E.

We could guess a word that is not of the form _ _ A R E? But that would be inefficient because we know three positions are fixed.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we might get information about other letters, but we already have three fixed, so it's better to use the pattern.

I think we should guess one of the candidates.

Let me choose ""FLARE"" because F is a common letter.

But no particular reason.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no F, so we don't know about F.

Similarly for B and G.

So let's go with ""FLARE"".

But note: we have to make a guess.

We can also think: if we guess ""BLARE"", and it's wrong, we eliminate B, and then we can guess ""FLARE"" next, and if that's wrong, then ""GLARE"" must be it.

But we have 4 guesses, so we can do that.

To be safe, let's guess ""BLARE"".

But I think any of them is fine.

I'll go with ""GLARE"" because G is less common? Or more common? Actually, in English, B, F, G are all fairly common.

But let's pick ""FLARE"".

So the third guess: FLARE

But let's see the feedback we would get if it's not the word.

If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then for ""FLARE"":
- F: x (because B is the first letter, not F)
- L: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Similarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", then F would be x.

But if the word is ""FLARE"", then all correct.

So we'll know.

But we can do the same with any.

I think it's fine.

But note: we haven't tested L at all. We are assuming L is in the word and in position 2.

But what if the word is not one of these? For example, if duplicates are allowed, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.

To cover that, we might need to consider it.

But let's check: ""AWARE"" has two A's. In the first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn't have A in other positions, so we don't know if there is another A.

Similarly, in the second guess, same.

So it's possible.

If the word is ""AWARE"", then the pattern is A W A R E.

Then our feedback for ""crane"": 
- C: x
- R: - (because R is in position 4, but we put it in position 2, so it's present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- N: x
- E: ✓ (position 5)

And for ""stare"":
- S: x
- T: x
- A: ✓ (position 3) — but note, in ""stare"", we have A in position 3, which is correct. But the secret word ""AWARE"" has A in position 1 and 3. So when we put A in position 3, it gets a check, which is correct. The first A in ""stare"" is S, not A, so we don't have A in position 1 in the guess.
- R: ✓ (position 4) — in ""stare"", we have R in position 4, which is correct for ""AWARE"".
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So the feedback for ""stare"" would be: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓), which matches what we have.

Therefore, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.

Similarly, are there other words with duplicate A? Like ""ALARM"" but that ends with M, not E.

""ALATE"" -> A L A T E -> but T is absent, and E is in position 5? ""ALATE"" has E in position 5, but the pattern is A L A T E, so position 3 is A (correct), position 4 is T (but we have R in position 4 from feedback? No, we have R in position 4 from the second guess feedback: R(✓) in position 4. So the secret word must have R in position 4. But ""ALATE"" has T in position 4, not R. So not.

""ARARE"" not a word.

So only ""AWARE"" is a possibility with duplicate A.

But in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which we haven't tested in position 1.

And the second letter is W.

We also know that S, T, C, N are absent.

So ""AWARE"" is a valid candidate.

Therefore, we have four possibilities: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE.

Now, we need to distinguish among these.

We can try a guess that tests the first position and the second position.

But the pattern is fixed: positions 3,4,5 are A,R,E.

So we must guess a word of the form [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

We can choose a word that is one of the candidates.

But if we guess ""AWARE"", for example, and it's not, then we get feedback.

But ""AWARE"" has A in position 1, which might be a duplicate.

If we guess ""AWARE"":
- If the secret word is ""AWARE"", all correct.
- If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then:
  - A in position 1: but ""BLARE"" has B in position 1, so A would be x (since no other A except position 3, and that is already accounted for? In ""BLARE"", there is only one A, in position 3. So if we put A in position 1, it would be not in the word? Or if the word has only one A, then A in position 1 would be x, because the only A is in position 3.

Similarly, W in position 2: not in the word, so x.

Then A in position 3: ✓, R: ✓, E: ✓.

So feedback: A(x) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but we have two A's in the guess. The first A is not in the word (since the only A is in position 3), so it should be x. The second A is in position 3, so ✓.

Similarly, for ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same thing.

So if we guess ""AWARE"" and the secret word is ""BLARE"", we get: A(x) for the first A, W(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓).

Similarly, if the word is ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same feedback.

If the word is ""AWARE"", then we get A(✓) for position 1? But we have two A's: the first A in position 1 would be ✓, and the second A in position 3 would be ✓? But in ""AWARE"", there are two A's, so both should be correct? But in the feedback, for duplicate letters, if both are correct, both get ✓.

But in our case, for ""AWARE"" guess on ""AWARE"" secret: position 1 A is correct, position 2 W is correct, position 3 A is correct, etc. So all ✓.

But the feedback for the two A's: the first A is in position 1, which is correct, so ✓. The second A is in position 3, which is also correct, so ✓.

So the feedback would be A(✓) W(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but that's five ✓, which means we won.

But if not, we get the feedback with the first A x and W x.

So it's distinguishable.

But we don't gain much by guessing ""AWARE"" if it's not the word, because we still don't know between BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, it's better to guess one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE first.

If we guess ""BLARE"" and it's wrong, then we know it's not B, so it must be F, G, or A (if AWARE).

But if we get feedback for ""BLARE"" as:
- B: x (if not B)
- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Then we know that the first letter is not B, and L is in position 2 (because we got ✓ for L in position 2). So the word must be FLARE or GLARE or AWARE? But AWARE does not have L, it has W in position 2.

If the secret word is ""AWARE"", and we guess ""BLARE"", then:
- B: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word, because ""AWARE"" has no L)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- R: ✓ (position 4)
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

This is different from if the word had L.

So if we guess ""BLARE"" and we get L(x), then we know there is no L, so it must be ""AWARE"".

If we get L(✓), then it must be one of FLARE or GLARE (since BLARE would have B correct, but if B is x, then not BLARE).

Let's clarify:

Case 1: Secret word is ""BLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": all ✓, we win.

Case 2: Secret word is ""FLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) because F is first, L(✓), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)

Case 3: Secret word is ""GLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

Case 4: Secret word is ""AWARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

So the feedback on L tells us:
- If L(✓), then the word is FLARE or GLARE (and B is not the first letter, so not BLARE)
- If L(x), then the word is AWARE (since no other candidates)

Therefore, by guessing ""BLARE"", we can distinguish all cases.

If we get all ✓, we win.

If we get B(x) L(✓) ... then we know it's FLARE or GLARE, and we can guess between them next.

If we get B(x) L(x) ... then it must be AWARE, and we can guess that next.

So it's a good diagnostic guess.

We can do the same with ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", but ""BLARE"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""BLARE"" as the third guess.

<guess>blare</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  This tells us:  
  - 'A' is in position 3.  
  - 'E' is in position 5.  
  - 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: stare** → Feedback: S(x), T(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)  
  This tells us:  
  - 'A' (position 3), 'R' (position 4), and 'E' (position 5) are confirmed correct.  
  - 'S' and 'T' are not in the word.  
  - Combined with Guess 1, 'R' is now confirmed to be in position 4 (previously misplaced in position 2).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A R E` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as 'A', 'R', 'E').  
- Absent letters: C, N, S, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- Present letters: A, R, E (with positions known), and one additional letter from Guess 1 ('R' was present but misplaced, now placed).  
- Since 'R' was misplaced in position 2 in Guess 1 but correct in position 4 in Guess 2, and no duplicates were indicated in feedback, we assume no duplicate letters for now.  
- Possible words fitting `_ _ A R E` and excluding absent letters:  
  - **BLARE** (B in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **FLARE** (F in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **GLARE** (G in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **AWARE** (A in position 1, W in position 2; but this would require a duplicate 'A', which is possible but unconfirmed).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **BLARE** to efficiently narrow down possibilities:  
  - If correct, we solve the word.  
  - If not, the feedback on 'B' and 'L' will distinguish between the remaining options:  
    - If 'L' is correct (✓), the word is either **FLARE** or **GLARE** (since 'B' would be absent).  
    - If 'L' is absent (x), the word must be **AWARE** (since no other common words fit the pattern).  
- This guess maximizes information gain by testing two key letters (B and L) in one move, leveraging the fixed pattern.

<guess>blare</guess>",blare,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 4)  [This is new information!]
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3, 'R' in position 4, and 'E' in position 5. So the pattern is: _ _ A R E
- We also know that 'R' is confirmed to be in position 4 (from the second guess).
- We know that 'C', 'N', 'S', and 'T' are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

We need to find the first two letters. They cannot be C, N, S, T (from the absent letters) and also not the letters we already know (A, R, E) because we have no duplicates? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, so we might assume no duplicates for now, but we should be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had R and in the second guess we had R again, and it was marked as correct in position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, if there were two R's, then in the first guess when we put R in position 2, it would have been marked as present (which it was) and in the second guess, when we put R in position 4, it would be correct. But if there were only one R, then the first guess R in position 2 would be present but wrong position, and the second guess R in position 4 would be correct, which is consistent. So it's possible that there is only one R.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we can assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the first two letters must be two distinct letters that are not C, N, S, T, and also not A, R, E (since they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates).

So available letters: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

But we have to form a valid English word.

The word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

We need to choose letter1 and letter2 from the remaining letters.

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""BLARE"" (B L A R E)
- ""FLARE"" (F L A R E)
- ""GLARE"" (G L A R E)
- ""SHARE"" but S is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"" but S and N are absent, no.
- ""SPARE"" but S is absent, no.
- ""STARE"" we already tried, and S and T are absent.

Other possibilities: ""AWARE"" but A is already in position 3, and we are assuming no duplicates, so A cannot be used again. Also, in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate, so it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's, but we don't have evidence for duplicates.

So let's stick to words without duplicates and without the forbidden letters.

So ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"" are candidates.

But we haven't tested B, F, G, L, etc.

We have to make a guess that can help us distinguish between these possibilities.

We have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We can try one of these, but if we try ""BLARE"", for example, and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and L.

Similarly for the others.

But we can also try a word that uses more new letters? However, the pattern is fixed for the last three letters: A R E.

So we must have A in 3, R in 4, E in 5.

The only flexibility is in the first two letters.

We can try a word that has two new common letters to test.

But note: we are constrained by the pattern. We must have a word that ends with ""ARE"".

So the first two letters must form a valid word with ""ARE"".

We can list possible words:

- ""BLARE""
- ""FLARE""
- ""GLARE""
- ""AWARE"" (if duplicates allowed, but we avoid for now)
- ""SCARE"" (but S and C are absent)
- ""SHARE"" (S absent)
- ""SNARE"" (S and N absent)
- ""SPARE"" (S absent)
- ""STARE"" (tried, S and T absent)
- ""WHARE"" (not common, but ""whare"" is a Maori word, might not be in word list)
- ""CHARE"" (C absent, and not common)

Other words: ""PARER"" (but has two R's and ends with ER, not ARE) -> no.

""BARRE"" (B A R R E) -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

So the main candidates are ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"".

We also have ""DWARE"" or ""KWARE""? Not words.

""OARED"" -> O A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

So it seems the common ones are the ones with L: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

But there might be others: ""AWARE"" (if we consider duplicates) or ""ALARE"" not a word.

Another one: ""URARE"" not a word.

So we have three strong candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

We need to choose one that can help us. Since we have to guess one, and if it's wrong, we get feedback on the first two letters.

But we can also think of a word that uses letters that are in many of these possibilities? But they all have L in the second position? Actually:

- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L

So they all have L in the second position? Let's see:

BLARE: B (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)
FLARE: F (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)
GLARE: G (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)

So in all three, the second letter is L.

Therefore, if we assume that the second letter is L, then we only need to find the first letter.

But we don't know that for sure. There might be other words without L.

For example, ""AWARE"": A (1), W (2), A (3) -> but duplicate A? And we have A in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

""CARED"" -> C absent, and A in position 2.

""BARED"" -> B A R E D -> A in position 2.

I think the only words that fit _ _ A R E with no duplicates and without the forbidden letters are the ones with L in position 2.

But let me think: ""QUARE"" is not a word.

""DIARY"" -> D I A R Y -> but that ends with Y, not E.

""HAIRE"" not a word.

So probably, the word is one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, the second letter is L.

So we can fix the second letter as L? But we need to confirm.

We don't know for sure, but it's highly likely.

We can make a guess that has L in position 2 and a new letter in position 1.

But we have to choose one: B, F, or G.

We can try, for example, ""BLARE"". If it's not the word, we get feedback that B is not in the word (if x) or in the word but wrong position (if -), but since position 1 is the only position for B, if it's not correct, then it would be absent? Because we have no other positions for B.

In ""BLARE"", if we guess it and the secret word is ""FLARE"", then:

- B: x (because F is the first letter, not B)
- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2 in both, then correct)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

But we know A, R, E are correct, so they will be ✓. L would be ✓ if it is in position 2. B would be x if not in the word.

Similarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", same thing.

But if we guess ""BLARE"" and it's wrong, we know that the first letter is not B, so it must be F or G.

Then we can guess between FLARE and GLARE.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can do that.

To save a guess, we might try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have L in position 2? But then we risk missing the pattern.

But let's see: is there a word that fits _ _ A R E without L in position 2?

For example, ""AWARE"": if we allow duplicate A, then A(1) W(2) A(3) R(4) E(5). But we have A in position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered one yet.

In the feedback, if there is a duplicate, the feedback would indicate it. For example, if the word has two A's, and we guess an A in a wrong position, it would show as present (yellow) if there is another A that is not accounted for.

But in our first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn't have A elsewhere. In the second guess, we didn't have A elsewhere. So we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's, but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M A R R Y -> not ending with E.

""TARRE"" not a word.

""VARVE"" -> V A R V E -> A in position 2, not 3.

I think it's safe to assume that the second letter is L for now.

But let's check the dictionary: are there other words?

- ""BLARE"" (valid)
- ""FLARE"" (valid)
- ""GLARE"" (valid)
- ""ULARE"" not a word
- ""ILARE"" not a word
- ""ALARE"" not a word
- ""ELARE"" not a word
- ""OLARE"" not a word

""WARE"" is 4 letters.

So yes, the common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, we can guess one of them.

To choose which one, we can pick the one with the most common letters. But B, F, G are all consonants.

We can also consider that we haven't tested B, F, G, L.

But we know L must be in position 2 if one of these words.

So let's guess ""GLARE"" because G is a common letter? Or ""BLARE""?

We can also think of the frequency.

But to be systematic, we can guess ""BLARE"".

If it's not, then we know it's either FLARE or GLARE.

But we have to use a guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without committing to L? But we don't have such a word because the pattern requires the last three to be A, R, E.

We could guess a word that is not of the form _ _ A R E? But that would be inefficient because we know three positions are fixed.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we might get information about other letters, but we already have three fixed, so it's better to use the pattern.

I think we should guess one of the candidates.

Let me choose ""FLARE"" because F is a common letter.

But no particular reason.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no F, so we don't know about F.

Similarly for B and G.

So let's go with ""FLARE"".

But note: we have to make a guess.

We can also think: if we guess ""BLARE"", and it's wrong, we eliminate B, and then we can guess ""FLARE"" next, and if that's wrong, then ""GLARE"" must be it.

But we have 4 guesses, so we can do that.

To be safe, let's guess ""BLARE"".

But I think any of them is fine.

I'll go with ""GLARE"" because G is less common? Or more common? Actually, in English, B, F, G are all fairly common.

But let's pick ""FLARE"".

So the third guess: FLARE

But let's see the feedback we would get if it's not the word.

If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then for ""FLARE"":
- F: x (because B is the first letter, not F)
- L: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Similarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", then F would be x.

But if the word is ""FLARE"", then all correct.

So we'll know.

But we can do the same with any.

I think it's fine.

But note: we haven't tested L at all. We are assuming L is in the word and in position 2.

But what if the word is not one of these? For example, if duplicates are allowed, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.

To cover that, we might need to consider it.

But let's check: ""AWARE"" has two A's. In the first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn't have A in other positions, so we don't know if there is another A.

Similarly, in the second guess, same.

So it's possible.

If the word is ""AWARE"", then the pattern is A W A R E.

Then our feedback for ""crane"": 
- C: x
- R: - (because R is in position 4, but we put it in position 2, so it's present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- N: x
- E: ✓ (position 5)

And for ""stare"":
- S: x
- T: x
- A: ✓ (position 3) — but note, in ""stare"", we have A in position 3, which is correct. But the secret word ""AWARE"" has A in position 1 and 3. So when we put A in position 3, it gets a check, which is correct. The first A in ""stare"" is S, not A, so we don't have A in position 1 in the guess.
- R: ✓ (position 4) — in ""stare"", we have R in position 4, which is correct for ""AWARE"".
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So the feedback for ""stare"" would be: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓), which matches what we have.

Therefore, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.

Similarly, are there other words with duplicate A? Like ""ALARM"" but that ends with M, not E.

""ALATE"" -> A L A T E -> but T is absent, and E is in position 5? ""ALATE"" has E in position 5, but the pattern is A L A T E, so position 3 is A (correct), position 4 is T (but we have R in position 4 from feedback? No, we have R in position 4 from the second guess feedback: R(✓) in position 4. So the secret word must have R in position 4. But ""ALATE"" has T in position 4, not R. So not.

""ARARE"" not a word.

So only ""AWARE"" is a possibility with duplicate A.

But in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which we haven't tested in position 1.

And the second letter is W.

We also know that S, T, C, N are absent.

So ""AWARE"" is a valid candidate.

Therefore, we have four possibilities: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE.

Now, we need to distinguish among these.

We can try a guess that tests the first position and the second position.

But the pattern is fixed: positions 3,4,5 are A,R,E.

So we must guess a word of the form [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

We can choose a word that is one of the candidates.

But if we guess ""AWARE"", for example, and it's not, then we get feedback.

But ""AWARE"" has A in position 1, which might be a duplicate.

If we guess ""AWARE"":
- If the secret word is ""AWARE"", all correct.
- If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then:
  - A in position 1: but ""BLARE"" has B in position 1, so A would be x (since no other A except position 3, and that is already accounted for? In ""BLARE"", there is only one A, in position 3. So if we put A in position 1, it would be not in the word? Or if the word has only one A, then A in position 1 would be x, because the only A is in position 3.

Similarly, W in position 2: not in the word, so x.

Then A in position 3: ✓, R: ✓, E: ✓.

So feedback: A(x) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but we have two A's in the guess. The first A is not in the word (since the only A is in position 3), so it should be x. The second A is in position 3, so ✓.

Similarly, for ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same thing.

So if we guess ""AWARE"" and the secret word is ""BLARE"", we get: A(x) for the first A, W(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓).

Similarly, if the word is ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same feedback.

If the word is ""AWARE"", then we get A(✓) for position 1? But we have two A's: the first A in position 1 would be ✓, and the second A in position 3 would be ✓? But in ""AWARE"", there are two A's, so both should be correct? But in the feedback, for duplicate letters, if both are correct, both get ✓.

But in our case, for ""AWARE"" guess on ""AWARE"" secret: position 1 A is correct, position 2 W is correct, position 3 A is correct, etc. So all ✓.

But the feedback for the two A's: the first A is in position 1, which is correct, so ✓. The second A is in position 3, which is also correct, so ✓.

So the feedback would be A(✓) W(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but that's five ✓, which means we won.

But if not, we get the feedback with the first A x and W x.

So it's distinguishable.

But we don't gain much by guessing ""AWARE"" if it's not the word, because we still don't know between BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, it's better to guess one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE first.

If we guess ""BLARE"" and it's wrong, then we know it's not B, so it must be F, G, or A (if AWARE).

But if we get feedback for ""BLARE"" as:
- B: x (if not B)
- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Then we know that the first letter is not B, and L is in position 2 (because we got ✓ for L in position 2). So the word must be FLARE or GLARE or AWARE? But AWARE does not have L, it has W in position 2.

If the secret word is ""AWARE"", and we guess ""BLARE"", then:
- B: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word, because ""AWARE"" has no L)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- R: ✓ (position 4)
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

This is different from if the word had L.

So if we guess ""BLARE"" and we get L(x), then we know there is no L, so it must be ""AWARE"".

If we get L(✓), then it must be one of FLARE or GLARE (since BLARE would have B correct, but if B is x, then not BLARE).

Let's clarify:

Case 1: Secret word is ""BLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": all ✓, we win.

Case 2: Secret word is ""FLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) because F is first, L(✓), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)

Case 3: Secret word is ""GLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

Case 4: Secret word is ""AWARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

So the feedback on L tells us:
- If L(✓), then the word is FLARE or GLARE (and B is not the first letter, so not BLARE)
- If L(x), then the word is AWARE (since no other candidates)

Therefore, by guessing ""BLARE"", we can distinguish all cases.

If we get all ✓, we win.

If we get B(x) L(✓) ... then we know it's FLARE or GLARE, and we can guess between them next.

If we get B(x) L(x) ... then it must be AWARE, and we can guess that next.

So it's a good diagnostic guess.

We can do the same with ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", but ""BLARE"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""BLARE"" as the third guess.

<guess>blare</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  This tells us:  
  - 'A' is in position 3.  
  - 'E' is in position 5.  
  - 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: stare** → Feedback: S(x), T(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)  
  This tells us:  
  - 'A' (position 3), 'R' (position 4), and 'E' (position 5) are confirmed correct.  
  - 'S' and 'T' are not in the word.  
  - Combined with Guess 1, 'R' is now confirmed to be in position 4 (previously misplaced in position 2).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A R E` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as 'A', 'R', 'E').  
- Absent letters: C, N, S, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- Present letters: A, R, E (with positions known), and one additional letter from Guess 1 ('R' was present but misplaced, now placed).  
- Since 'R' was misplaced in position 2 in Guess 1 but correct in position 4 in Guess 2, and no duplicates were indicated in feedback, we assume no duplicate letters for now.  
- Possible words fitting `_ _ A R E` and excluding absent letters:  
  - **BLARE** (B in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **FLARE** (F in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **GLARE** (G in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **AWARE** (A in position 1, W in position 2; but this would require a duplicate 'A', which is possible but unconfirmed).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **BLARE** to efficiently narrow down possibilities:  
  - If correct, we solve the word.  
  - If not, the feedback on 'B' and 'L' will distinguish between the remaining options:  
    - If 'L' is correct (✓), the word is either **FLARE** or **GLARE** (since 'B' would be absent).  
    - If 'L' is absent (x), the word must be **AWARE** (since no other common words fit the pattern).  
- This guess maximizes information gain by testing two key letters (B and L) in one move, leveraging the fixed pattern.",Guess 3: blare -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,aware,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, words with common letters and no repeating letters are ideal for the first guess.

Considering common letters in English 5-letter words, vowels and frequent consonants like R, E, S, T, etc., are helpful.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. I will go with ""CRANE"".

Note: The feedback will tell us which letters are in the word and where. Since we are at the beginning, we have no prior information.

So, my first guess: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the letter 'A' in the third position and 'E' in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (since we put it in the second position and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, for the second guess, we want to use this information to narrow down possibilities.

We know:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- The word contains 'R' but not in position 2 (and also not in position 1 because we haven't tried it there? Actually, we don't know about position 1 yet).

We also know that 'C' and 'N' are absent.

We can think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and contain the letter 'R'. Also, we should avoid using 'C' and 'N' again.

Let's consider possible letters for the other positions.

We have two positions to fill: 1, 2, and 4 (but note that position 4 is the fourth letter, and we know the fifth is E).

The word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We know the word has an 'R' that is not in position 2. So it could be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.

We can try to use a word that has:
- 'R' in a different position (like position 1 or 4) to test.
- Also, we can include other common letters to get more information.

But note: we already have two confirmed letters (A and E) and one confirmed present but misplaced (R). So we have at least three letters: R, A, E.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent (C and N).

Let me think of words that fit _ _ A _ E and have an 'R'. Also, we want to test other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""GRACE"" but we know 'C' is absent, so that's out.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E -> but we have A in position 3 and E in position 5, so that would be T R A D E. Let's check the feedback we would get? Actually, we are making a guess.

But note: we don't know if 'T' or 'D' are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts 'R' in a different position. Since we know 'R' is not in position 2, we can try putting it in position 1 or 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is the fourth letter. So if we put 'R' in position 1, then the word would be R _ A _ E.

Or if we put it in position 4, then _ _ A R E.

We also want to test other letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and contain 'R':

- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E -> but we have R in position 2 again? We already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about where R actually is. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

We need to try R in a new position. So we can try:

Option 1: Put R in position 1 -> R _ A _ E
Option 2: Put R in position 4 -> _ _ A R E

We also need to choose letters for the other positions that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and N).

But we want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are common and that we haven't ruled out.

Let me think of words for each option:

Option 1: R _ A _ E
- Possible words: ""ROATE"" (but we know E is at the end, and A is in the middle, so ""ROATE"" is R O A T E -> but that has O in position 2 and T in position 4). However, we don't know about O and T.

But note: ""ROATE"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some word lists. Alternatively, ""REATE"" is not a word.

Another word: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.

""RAISE"": R A I S E -> but that would put A in position 2, but we need A in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E. So for R _ A _ E, the second letter must be something else.

Examples:
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> but that's R O U S E, so third letter is U, not A. Doesn't fit.
- ""RELAX"": R E L A X -> but that has A in position 4, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 1, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

Let me try: ""R"" in 1, then any letter in 2, then ""A"" in 3, then any letter in 4, then ""E"" in 5.

Possible words: 
- ""ROATE"" (if accepted) -> R O A T E
- ""REAVE"" -> R E A V E
- ""RABBE"" -> not a word.
- ""RACEY"" -> but C is absent, and not a word.

More common: ""RAISE"" doesn't work because A is in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""ROATE"" (R O A T E) - meaning a financial term? Or ""orate"" without the first letter? Actually, ""roate"" might not be valid. Let me think of valid words.

""REUSE"" -> R E U S E -> third letter is U, not A.

""RINSE"" -> R I N S E -> but N is absent, and third letter is N? Also, we have N absent.

Another: ""RAZED"" -> R A Z E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

It seems difficult. Let me try the other option: put R in position 4.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

Now, we can choose letters for positions 1 and 2.

We know that the word has an R, and we are putting it in position 4. Also, we have A in 3 and E in 5.

So the word is [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Now, we need to choose two letters for the first two positions.

Common words: 
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). This fits.
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SCARE"": but C is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"": but N is absent, so no.

Other possibilities: ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"", etc.

But we haven't tested many letters. We want to test new letters to get more information.

We know that the secret word has an R, and we are going to put it in position 4. So if we choose a word that has R in position 4, then we can use the first two positions to test other common letters.

We should avoid using letters we know are absent (C and N).

So let's choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

For example, ""STARE"" uses S and T. If we use ""STARE"", then:

- If the secret word has S, we'll get feedback on its position.
- Similarly for T.

But note: we already know that the word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and R in position 4? We don't know that R is in position 4, we are just testing it.

In ""STARE"", we are putting R in position 4. If the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we'll get a minus for R.

But we are also testing S and T.

Alternatively, we could use ""PARLE"" or ""BARGE"", but let's stick to common words.

Another option: ""LARGE"" -> L A R G E -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

So ""STARE"" is a good candidate.

But let's check: in ""STARE"", we have:
- S in position 1
- T in position 2
- A in position 3 (which we know is correct)
- R in position 4 (which we are testing)
- E in position 5 (correct)

We know A and E are correct, so they will get ✓. R, if it is in position 4, will get ✓. If not, it will get - because we know R is in the word. But we are trying to find where R is.

However, we also get information about S and T.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another idea: we could use a word that doesn't have R in it? But we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be inefficient because we know R is present, so we should use it to find its position.

But if we don't include R, then we might get an x for a letter that we know should be present? Actually, the feedback will show for each letter. But if we don't include R, we don't get information about where R is.

So we should include R.

Back to ""STARE"": it uses S and T, which are common and we haven't tested them.

We could also consider ""SHARE"" (S H A R E) or ""SPARE"" (S P A R E), but we don't know about P or H.

""STARE"" is a good choice because it has two very common letters (S and T).

But note: we already have A and E fixed, so we are only guessing the first two letters and the fourth? Actually, in this pattern, the fourth is R in this guess, but we are testing if R is in position 4.

If we guess ""STARE"", the feedback might be:

- If the secret word has S in position 1: ✓
- Else if S is in the word but not position 1: -
- Else: x

Similarly for T in position 2.

And for R in position 4: if it is the correct position, ✓; if not, - (since we know R is in the word).

But we don't know if S and T are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a different position? But we only have two options: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 2 we already tried and it was wrong).

We tried R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R must be in position 1 or 4.

So by putting R in position 4, we are testing one of the two possibilities.

If we get a ✓ for R, then we know R is in position 4. If we get a -, then R is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.

So this guess will tell us exactly where R is.

Moreover, we get information about S and T.

Therefore, ""STARE"" seems a good guess.

But what if the secret word is, for example, ""ROGUE""? But that doesn't have A in position 3? We know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so the word must be _ _ A _ E.

So ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit.

Another possibility: ""URAEI"" - not a common word.

So let's go with ""STARE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern _ _ A _ E in the guess? We can guess any 5-letter word. We don't have to have A and E in the same positions? Actually, we can, but it might be beneficial to move them to test? But we know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so if we put them elsewhere, we would get minuses or x's, which we already know they are fixed.

But to save time, we can keep them fixed and only change the other letters.

So I think ""STARE"" is a good second guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""STARE"" is valid.

So we'll guess ""STARE"".

If we get feedback:
- S: if in position 1, ✓; else if in word, -; else x.
- T: similarly for position 2.
- A: ✓ (we know)
- R: if in position 4, ✓; else - (because we know R is in the word, just not where)
- E: ✓

This will give us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""STARE"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: ✓, N: x, E: ✓), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (pattern: _ _ A _ E).
- 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.

For the second guess, we want to:
1. Maintain the known correct letters 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5.
2. Test the position of 'R' (which must be in position 1 or 4, since position 2 is incorrect and positions 3/5 are fixed).
3. Introduce new common letters (like 'S' and 'T') to gather more information.

The word ""stare"" fits this strategy:
- It follows the pattern _ _ A _ E (S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4, E in position 5).
- It places 'R' in position 4 to test if that is the correct location.
- It uses 'S' and 'T' (common letters not yet tested) to maximize feedback.

<guess>stare</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 4)  [This is new information!]
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3, 'R' in position 4, and 'E' in position 5. So the pattern is: _ _ A R E
- We also know that 'R' is confirmed to be in position 4 (from the second guess).
- We know that 'C', 'N', 'S', and 'T' are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

We need to find the first two letters. They cannot be C, N, S, T (from the absent letters) and also not the letters we already know (A, R, E) because we have no duplicates? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, so we might assume no duplicates for now, but we should be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had R and in the second guess we had R again, and it was marked as correct in position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, if there were two R's, then in the first guess when we put R in position 2, it would have been marked as present (which it was) and in the second guess, when we put R in position 4, it would be correct. But if there were only one R, then the first guess R in position 2 would be present but wrong position, and the second guess R in position 4 would be correct, which is consistent. So it's possible that there is only one R.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we can assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the first two letters must be two distinct letters that are not C, N, S, T, and also not A, R, E (since they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates).

So available letters: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

But we have to form a valid English word.

The word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

We need to choose letter1 and letter2 from the remaining letters.

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""BLARE"" (B L A R E)
- ""FLARE"" (F L A R E)
- ""GLARE"" (G L A R E)
- ""SHARE"" but S is absent, so no.
- ""SNARE"" but S and N are absent, no.
- ""SPARE"" but S is absent, no.
- ""STARE"" we already tried, and S and T are absent.

Other possibilities: ""AWARE"" but A is already in position 3, and we are assuming no duplicates, so A cannot be used again. Also, in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate, so it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's, but we don't have evidence for duplicates.

So let's stick to words without duplicates and without the forbidden letters.

So ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"" are candidates.

But we haven't tested B, F, G, L, etc.

We have to make a guess that can help us distinguish between these possibilities.

We have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We can try one of these, but if we try ""BLARE"", for example, and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and L.

Similarly for the others.

But we can also try a word that uses more new letters? However, the pattern is fixed for the last three letters: A R E.

So we must have A in 3, R in 4, E in 5.

The only flexibility is in the first two letters.

We can try a word that has two new common letters to test.

But note: we are constrained by the pattern. We must have a word that ends with ""ARE"".

So the first two letters must form a valid word with ""ARE"".

We can list possible words:

- ""BLARE""
- ""FLARE""
- ""GLARE""
- ""AWARE"" (if duplicates allowed, but we avoid for now)
- ""SCARE"" (but S and C are absent)
- ""SHARE"" (S absent)
- ""SNARE"" (S and N absent)
- ""SPARE"" (S absent)
- ""STARE"" (tried, S and T absent)
- ""WHARE"" (not common, but ""whare"" is a Maori word, might not be in word list)
- ""CHARE"" (C absent, and not common)

Other words: ""PARER"" (but has two R's and ends with ER, not ARE) -> no.

""BARRE"" (B A R R E) -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

So the main candidates are ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"".

We also have ""DWARE"" or ""KWARE""? Not words.

""OARED"" -> O A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

So it seems the common ones are the ones with L: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

But there might be others: ""AWARE"" (if we consider duplicates) or ""ALARE"" not a word.

Another one: ""URARE"" not a word.

So we have three strong candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

We need to choose one that can help us. Since we have to guess one, and if it's wrong, we get feedback on the first two letters.

But we can also think of a word that uses letters that are in many of these possibilities? But they all have L in the second position? Actually:

- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L

So they all have L in the second position? Let's see:

BLARE: B (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)
FLARE: F (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)
GLARE: G (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)

So in all three, the second letter is L.

Therefore, if we assume that the second letter is L, then we only need to find the first letter.

But we don't know that for sure. There might be other words without L.

For example, ""AWARE"": A (1), W (2), A (3) -> but duplicate A? And we have A in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.

""CARED"" -> C absent, and A in position 2.

""BARED"" -> B A R E D -> A in position 2.

I think the only words that fit _ _ A R E with no duplicates and without the forbidden letters are the ones with L in position 2.

But let me think: ""QUARE"" is not a word.

""DIARY"" -> D I A R Y -> but that ends with Y, not E.

""HAIRE"" not a word.

So probably, the word is one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, the second letter is L.

So we can fix the second letter as L? But we need to confirm.

We don't know for sure, but it's highly likely.

We can make a guess that has L in position 2 and a new letter in position 1.

But we have to choose one: B, F, or G.

We can try, for example, ""BLARE"". If it's not the word, we get feedback that B is not in the word (if x) or in the word but wrong position (if -), but since position 1 is the only position for B, if it's not correct, then it would be absent? Because we have no other positions for B.

In ""BLARE"", if we guess it and the secret word is ""FLARE"", then:

- B: x (because F is the first letter, not B)
- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2 in both, then correct)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

But we know A, R, E are correct, so they will be ✓. L would be ✓ if it is in position 2. B would be x if not in the word.

Similarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", same thing.

But if we guess ""BLARE"" and it's wrong, we know that the first letter is not B, so it must be F or G.

Then we can guess between FLARE and GLARE.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can do that.

To save a guess, we might try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have L in position 2? But then we risk missing the pattern.

But let's see: is there a word that fits _ _ A R E without L in position 2?

For example, ""AWARE"": if we allow duplicate A, then A(1) W(2) A(3) R(4) E(5). But we have A in position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered one yet.

In the feedback, if there is a duplicate, the feedback would indicate it. For example, if the word has two A's, and we guess an A in a wrong position, it would show as present (yellow) if there is another A that is not accounted for.

But in our first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn't have A elsewhere. In the second guess, we didn't have A elsewhere. So we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's, but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M A R R Y -> not ending with E.

""TARRE"" not a word.

""VARVE"" -> V A R V E -> A in position 2, not 3.

I think it's safe to assume that the second letter is L for now.

But let's check the dictionary: are there other words?

- ""BLARE"" (valid)
- ""FLARE"" (valid)
- ""GLARE"" (valid)
- ""ULARE"" not a word
- ""ILARE"" not a word
- ""ALARE"" not a word
- ""ELARE"" not a word
- ""OLARE"" not a word

""WARE"" is 4 letters.

So yes, the common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, we can guess one of them.

To choose which one, we can pick the one with the most common letters. But B, F, G are all consonants.

We can also consider that we haven't tested B, F, G, L.

But we know L must be in position 2 if one of these words.

So let's guess ""GLARE"" because G is a common letter? Or ""BLARE""?

We can also think of the frequency.

But to be systematic, we can guess ""BLARE"".

If it's not, then we know it's either FLARE or GLARE.

But we have to use a guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without committing to L? But we don't have such a word because the pattern requires the last three to be A, R, E.

We could guess a word that is not of the form _ _ A R E? But that would be inefficient because we know three positions are fixed.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we might get information about other letters, but we already have three fixed, so it's better to use the pattern.

I think we should guess one of the candidates.

Let me choose ""FLARE"" because F is a common letter.

But no particular reason.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no F, so we don't know about F.

Similarly for B and G.

So let's go with ""FLARE"".

But note: we have to make a guess.

We can also think: if we guess ""BLARE"", and it's wrong, we eliminate B, and then we can guess ""FLARE"" next, and if that's wrong, then ""GLARE"" must be it.

But we have 4 guesses, so we can do that.

To be safe, let's guess ""BLARE"".

But I think any of them is fine.

I'll go with ""GLARE"" because G is less common? Or more common? Actually, in English, B, F, G are all fairly common.

But let's pick ""FLARE"".

So the third guess: FLARE

But let's see the feedback we would get if it's not the word.

If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then for ""FLARE"":
- F: x (because B is the first letter, not F)
- L: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Similarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", then F would be x.

But if the word is ""FLARE"", then all correct.

So we'll know.

But we can do the same with any.

I think it's fine.

But note: we haven't tested L at all. We are assuming L is in the word and in position 2.

But what if the word is not one of these? For example, if duplicates are allowed, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.

To cover that, we might need to consider it.

But let's check: ""AWARE"" has two A's. In the first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn't have A in other positions, so we don't know if there is another A.

Similarly, in the second guess, same.

So it's possible.

If the word is ""AWARE"", then the pattern is A W A R E.

Then our feedback for ""crane"": 
- C: x
- R: - (because R is in position 4, but we put it in position 2, so it's present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- N: x
- E: ✓ (position 5)

And for ""stare"":
- S: x
- T: x
- A: ✓ (position 3) — but note, in ""stare"", we have A in position 3, which is correct. But the secret word ""AWARE"" has A in position 1 and 3. So when we put A in position 3, it gets a check, which is correct. The first A in ""stare"" is S, not A, so we don't have A in position 1 in the guess.
- R: ✓ (position 4) — in ""stare"", we have R in position 4, which is correct for ""AWARE"".
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So the feedback for ""stare"" would be: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓), which matches what we have.

Therefore, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.

Similarly, are there other words with duplicate A? Like ""ALARM"" but that ends with M, not E.

""ALATE"" -> A L A T E -> but T is absent, and E is in position 5? ""ALATE"" has E in position 5, but the pattern is A L A T E, so position 3 is A (correct), position 4 is T (but we have R in position 4 from feedback? No, we have R in position 4 from the second guess feedback: R(✓) in position 4. So the secret word must have R in position 4. But ""ALATE"" has T in position 4, not R. So not.

""ARARE"" not a word.

So only ""AWARE"" is a possibility with duplicate A.

But in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which we haven't tested in position 1.

And the second letter is W.

We also know that S, T, C, N are absent.

So ""AWARE"" is a valid candidate.

Therefore, we have four possibilities: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE.

Now, we need to distinguish among these.

We can try a guess that tests the first position and the second position.

But the pattern is fixed: positions 3,4,5 are A,R,E.

So we must guess a word of the form [letter1] [letter2] A R E.

We can choose a word that is one of the candidates.

But if we guess ""AWARE"", for example, and it's not, then we get feedback.

But ""AWARE"" has A in position 1, which might be a duplicate.

If we guess ""AWARE"":
- If the secret word is ""AWARE"", all correct.
- If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then:
  - A in position 1: but ""BLARE"" has B in position 1, so A would be x (since no other A except position 3, and that is already accounted for? In ""BLARE"", there is only one A, in position 3. So if we put A in position 1, it would be not in the word? Or if the word has only one A, then A in position 1 would be x, because the only A is in position 3.

Similarly, W in position 2: not in the word, so x.

Then A in position 3: ✓, R: ✓, E: ✓.

So feedback: A(x) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but we have two A's in the guess. The first A is not in the word (since the only A is in position 3), so it should be x. The second A is in position 3, so ✓.

Similarly, for ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same thing.

So if we guess ""AWARE"" and the secret word is ""BLARE"", we get: A(x) for the first A, W(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓).

Similarly, if the word is ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same feedback.

If the word is ""AWARE"", then we get A(✓) for position 1? But we have two A's: the first A in position 1 would be ✓, and the second A in position 3 would be ✓? But in ""AWARE"", there are two A's, so both should be correct? But in the feedback, for duplicate letters, if both are correct, both get ✓.

But in our case, for ""AWARE"" guess on ""AWARE"" secret: position 1 A is correct, position 2 W is correct, position 3 A is correct, etc. So all ✓.

But the feedback for the two A's: the first A is in position 1, which is correct, so ✓. The second A is in position 3, which is also correct, so ✓.

So the feedback would be A(✓) W(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but that's five ✓, which means we won.

But if not, we get the feedback with the first A x and W x.

So it's distinguishable.

But we don't gain much by guessing ""AWARE"" if it's not the word, because we still don't know between BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.

Therefore, it's better to guess one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE first.

If we guess ""BLARE"" and it's wrong, then we know it's not B, so it must be F, G, or A (if AWARE).

But if we get feedback for ""BLARE"" as:
- B: x (if not B)
- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2)
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Then we know that the first letter is not B, and L is in position 2 (because we got ✓ for L in position 2). So the word must be FLARE or GLARE or AWARE? But AWARE does not have L, it has W in position 2.

If the secret word is ""AWARE"", and we guess ""BLARE"", then:
- B: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word, because ""AWARE"" has no L)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- R: ✓ (position 4)
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

This is different from if the word had L.

So if we guess ""BLARE"" and we get L(x), then we know there is no L, so it must be ""AWARE"".

If we get L(✓), then it must be one of FLARE or GLARE (since BLARE would have B correct, but if B is x, then not BLARE).

Let's clarify:

Case 1: Secret word is ""BLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": all ✓, we win.

Case 2: Secret word is ""FLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) because F is first, L(✓), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)

Case 3: Secret word is ""GLARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

Case 4: Secret word is ""AWARE""
- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

So the feedback on L tells us:
- If L(✓), then the word is FLARE or GLARE (and B is not the first letter, so not BLARE)
- If L(x), then the word is AWARE (since no other candidates)

Therefore, by guessing ""BLARE"", we can distinguish all cases.

If we get all ✓, we win.

If we get B(x) L(✓) ... then we know it's FLARE or GLARE, and we can guess between them next.

If we get B(x) L(x) ... then it must be AWARE, and we can guess that next.

So it's a good diagnostic guess.

We can do the same with ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", but ""BLARE"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""BLARE"" as the third guess.

<guess>blare</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  This tells us:  
  - 'A' is in position 3.  
  - 'E' is in position 5.  
  - 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - 'C' and 'N' are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: stare** → Feedback: S(x), T(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)  
  This tells us:  
  - 'A' (position 3), 'R' (position 4), and 'E' (position 5) are confirmed correct.  
  - 'S' and 'T' are not in the word.  
  - Combined with Guess 1, 'R' is now confirmed to be in position 4 (previously misplaced in position 2).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A R E` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as 'A', 'R', 'E').  
- Absent letters: C, N, S, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- Present letters: A, R, E (with positions known), and one additional letter from Guess 1 ('R' was present but misplaced, now placed).  
- Since 'R' was misplaced in position 2 in Guess 1 but correct in position 4 in Guess 2, and no duplicates were indicated in feedback, we assume no duplicate letters for now.  
- Possible words fitting `_ _ A R E` and excluding absent letters:  
  - **BLARE** (B in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **FLARE** (F in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **GLARE** (G in position 1, L in position 2)  
  - **AWARE** (A in position 1, W in position 2; but this would require a duplicate 'A', which is possible but unconfirmed).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **BLARE** to efficiently narrow down possibilities:  
  - If correct, we solve the word.  
  - If not, the feedback on 'B' and 'L' will distinguish between the remaining options:  
    - If 'L' is correct (✓), the word is either **FLARE** or **GLARE** (since 'B' would be absent).  
    - If 'L' is absent (x), the word must be **AWARE** (since no other common words fit the pattern).  
- This guess maximizes information gain by testing two key letters (B and L) in one move, leveraging the fixed pattern.

So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E\n- The letter \'R\' is in the word but not in the second position (since we put it in the second position and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but misplaced).\n- The letters \'C\' and \'N\' are not in the word.\n\nWe also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nNow, for the second guess, we want to use this information to narrow down possibilities.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 5: E\n- The word contains \'R\' but not in position 2 (and also not in position 1 because we haven\'t tried it there? Actually, we don\'t know about position 1 yet).\n\nWe also know that \'C\' and \'N\' are absent.\n\nWe can think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and contain the letter \'R\'. Also, we should avoid using \'C\' and \'N\' again.\n\nLet\'s consider possible letters for the other positions.\n\nWe have two positions to fill: 1, 2, and 4 (but note that position 4 is the fourth letter, and we know the fifth is E).\n\nThe word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E\n\nWe know the word has an \'R\' that is not in position 2. So it could be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has:\n- \'R\' in a different position (like position 1 or 4) to test.\n- Also, we can include other common letters to get more information.\n\nBut note: we already have two confirmed letters (A and E) and one confirmed present but misplaced (R). So we have at least three letters: R, A, E.\n\nWe should avoid using the letters we know are absent (C and N).\n\nLet me think of words that fit _ _ A _ E and have an \'R\'. Also, we want to test other common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- We could try ""GRACE"" but we know \'C\' is absent, so that\'s out.\n- ""TRADE"": T R A D E -> but we have A in position 3 and E in position 5, so that would be T R A D E. Let\'s check the feedback we would get? Actually, we are making a guess.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if \'T\' or \'D\' are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that puts \'R\' in a different position. Since we know \'R\' is not in position 2, we can try putting it in position 1 or 4.\n\nBut in the pattern, position 4 is the fourth letter. So if we put \'R\' in position 1, then the word would be R _ A _ E.\n\nOr if we put it in position 4, then _ _ A R E.\n\nWe also want to test other letters for the remaining positions.\n\nLet me list some words that fit the pattern and contain \'R\':\n\n- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E -> but we have R in position 2 again? We already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give us new information about where R actually is. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nWe need to try R in a new position. So we can try:\n\nOption 1: Put R in position 1 -> R _ A _ E\nOption 2: Put R in position 4 -> _ _ A R E\n\nWe also need to choose letters for the other positions that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and N).\n\nBut we want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are common and that we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nLet me think of words for each option:\n\nOption 1: R _ A _ E\n- Possible words: ""ROATE"" (but we know E is at the end, and A is in the middle, so ""ROATE"" is R O A T E -> but that has O in position 2 and T in position 4). However, we don\'t know about O and T.\n\nBut note: ""ROATE"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s not very common, but it is accepted in some word lists. Alternatively, ""REATE"" is not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.\n\n""RAISE"": R A I S E -> but that would put A in position 2, but we need A in position 3. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E. So for R _ A _ E, the second letter must be something else.\n\nExamples:\n- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> but that\'s R O U S E, so third letter is U, not A. Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""RELAX"": R E L A X -> but that has A in position 4, not 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find words with R in position 1, A in position 3, and E in position 5.\n\nLet me try: ""R"" in 1, then any letter in 2, then ""A"" in 3, then any letter in 4, then ""E"" in 5.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ROATE"" (if accepted) -> R O A T E\n- ""REAVE"" -> R E A V E\n- ""RABBE"" -> not a word.\n- ""RACEY"" -> but C is absent, and not a word.\n\nMore common: ""RAISE"" doesn\'t work because A is in position 2.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A. So:\n\n- ""ROATE"" (R O A T E) - meaning a financial term? Or ""orate"" without the first letter? Actually, ""roate"" might not be valid. Let me think of valid words.\n\n""REUSE"" -> R E U S E -> third letter is U, not A.\n\n""RINSE"" -> R I N S E -> but N is absent, and third letter is N? Also, we have N absent.\n\nAnother: ""RAZED"" -> R A Z E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.\n\nIt seems difficult. Let me try the other option: put R in position 4.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ A R E\n\nNow, we can choose letters for positions 1 and 2.\n\nWe know that the word has an R, and we are putting it in position 4. Also, we have A in 3 and E in 5.\n\nSo the word is [letter1] [letter2] A R E\n\nNow, we need to choose two letters for the first two positions.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). This fits.\n- ""SHARE"": S H A R E\n- ""SCARE"": but C is absent, so no.\n- ""SNARE"": but N is absent, so no.\n\nOther possibilities: ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"", etc.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters. We want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWe know that the secret word has an R, and we are going to put it in position 4. So if we choose a word that has R in position 4, then we can use the first two positions to test other common letters.\n\nWe should avoid using letters we know are absent (C and N).\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that uses common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nFor example, ""STARE"" uses S and T. If we use ""STARE"", then:\n\n- If the secret word has S, we\'ll get feedback on its position.\n- Similarly for T.\n\nBut note: we already know that the word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, and R in position 4? We don\'t know that R is in position 4, we are just testing it.\n\nIn ""STARE"", we are putting R in position 4. If the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it\'s not in position 4, we\'ll get a minus for R.\n\nBut we are also testing S and T.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""PARLE"" or ""BARGE"", but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother option: ""LARGE"" -> L A R G E -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1] [letter2] A R E.\n\nSo ""STARE"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check: in ""STARE"", we have:\n- S in position 1\n- T in position 2\n- A in position 3 (which we know is correct)\n- R in position 4 (which we are testing)\n- E in position 5 (correct)\n\nWe know A and E are correct, so they will get ✓. R, if it is in position 4, will get ✓. If not, it will get - because we know R is in the word. But we are trying to find where R is.\n\nHowever, we also get information about S and T.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: we could use a word that doesn\'t have R in it? But we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it would be inefficient because we know R is present, so we should use it to find its position.\n\nBut if we don\'t include R, then we might get an x for a letter that we know should be present? Actually, the feedback will show for each letter. But if we don\'t include R, we don\'t get information about where R is.\n\nSo we should include R.\n\nBack to ""STARE"": it uses S and T, which are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\nWe could also consider ""SHARE"" (S H A R E) or ""SPARE"" (S P A R E), but we don\'t know about P or H.\n\n""STARE"" is a good choice because it has two very common letters (S and T).\n\nBut note: we already have A and E fixed, so we are only guessing the first two letters and the fourth? Actually, in this pattern, the fourth is R in this guess, but we are testing if R is in position 4.\n\nIf we guess ""STARE"", the feedback might be:\n\n- If the secret word has S in position 1: ✓\n- Else if S is in the word but not position 1: -\n- Else: x\n\nSimilarly for T in position 2.\n\nAnd for R in position 4: if it is the correct position, ✓; if not, - (since we know R is in the word).\n\nBut we don\'t know if S and T are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a different position? But we only have two options: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 2 we already tried and it was wrong).\n\nWe tried R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R must be in position 1 or 4.\n\nSo by putting R in position 4, we are testing one of the two possibilities.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for R, then we know R is in position 4. If we get a -, then R is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.\n\nSo this guess will tell us exactly where R is.\n\nMoreover, we get information about S and T.\n\nTherefore, ""STARE"" seems a good guess.\n\nBut what if the secret word is, for example, ""ROGUE""? But that doesn\'t have A in position 3? We know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so the word must be _ _ A _ E.\n\nSo ""ROGUE"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother possibility: ""URAEI"" - not a common word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the pattern _ _ A _ E in the guess? We can guess any 5-letter word. We don\'t have to have A and E in the same positions? Actually, we can, but it might be beneficial to move them to test? But we know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so if we put them elsewhere, we would get minuses or x\'s, which we already know they are fixed.\n\nBut to save time, we can keep them fixed and only change the other letters.\n\nSo I think ""STARE"" is a good second guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""STARE"" is valid.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""STARE"".\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- S: if in position 1, ✓; else if in word, -; else x.\n- T: similarly for position 2.\n- A: ✓ (we know)\n- R: if in position 4, ✓; else - (because we know R is in the word, just not where)\n- E: ✓\n\nThis will give us a lot of information.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""STARE"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: ✓, N: x, E: ✓), we know:\n- The secret word has \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5 (pattern: _ _ A _ E).\n- \'R\' is in the word but not in position 2.\n- \'C\' and \'N\' are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess, we want to:\n1. Maintain the known correct letters \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5.\n2. Test the position of \'R\' (which must be in position 1 or 4, since position 2 is incorrect and positions 3/5 are fixed).\n3. Introduce new common letters (like \'S\' and \'T\') to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""stare"" fits this strategy:\n- It follows the pattern _ _ A _ E (S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, R in position 4, E in position 5).\n- It places \'R\' in position 4 to test if that is the correct location.\n- It uses \'S\' and \'T\' (common letters not yet tested) to maximize feedback.\n\n<guess>stare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""stare""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)\n- R: ✓ (correct, position 4)  [This is new information!]\n- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has \'A\' in position 3, \'R\' in position 4, and \'E\' in position 5. So the pattern is: _ _ A R E\n- We also know that \'R\' is confirmed to be in position 4 (from the second guess).\n- We know that \'C\', \'N\', \'S\', and \'T\' are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A R E\n\nWe need to find the first two letters. They cannot be C, N, S, T (from the absent letters) and also not the letters we already know (A, R, E) because we have no duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any duplicate, so we might assume no duplicates for now, but we should be cautious.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R and in the second guess we had R again, and it was marked as correct in position 4. So if there were two R\'s, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, if there were two R\'s, then in the first guess when we put R in position 2, it would have been marked as present (which it was) and in the second guess, when we put R in position 4, it would be correct. But if there were only one R, then the first guess R in position 2 would be present but wrong position, and the second guess R in position 4 would be correct, which is consistent. So it\'s possible that there is only one R.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, so we can assume no duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, the first two letters must be two distinct letters that are not C, N, S, T, and also not A, R, E (since they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates).\n\nSo available letters: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, S, T.\n\nBut we have to form a valid English word.\n\nThe word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A R E\n\nWe need to choose letter1 and letter2 from the remaining letters.\n\nCommon words that fit this pattern:\n- ""BLARE"" (B L A R E)\n- ""FLARE"" (F L A R E)\n- ""GLARE"" (G L A R E)\n- ""SHARE"" but S is absent, so no.\n- ""SNARE"" but S and N are absent, no.\n- ""SPARE"" but S is absent, no.\n- ""STARE"" we already tried, and S and T are absent.\n\nOther possibilities: ""AWARE"" but A is already in position 3, and we are assuming no duplicates, so A cannot be used again. Also, in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate, so it\'s safer to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARER"" has two R\'s, but we don\'t have evidence for duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s stick to words without duplicates and without the forbidden letters.\n\nSo ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"" are candidates.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested B, F, G, L, etc.\n\nWe have to make a guess that can help us distinguish between these possibilities.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).\n\nWe can try one of these, but if we try ""BLARE"", for example, and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on B and L.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut we can also try a word that uses more new letters? However, the pattern is fixed for the last three letters: A R E.\n\nSo we must have A in 3, R in 4, E in 5.\n\nThe only flexibility is in the first two letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has two new common letters to test.\n\nBut note: we are constrained by the pattern. We must have a word that ends with ""ARE"".\n\nSo the first two letters must form a valid word with ""ARE"".\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\n- ""BLARE""\n- ""FLARE""\n- ""GLARE""\n- ""AWARE"" (if duplicates allowed, but we avoid for now)\n- ""SCARE"" (but S and C are absent)\n- ""SHARE"" (S absent)\n- ""SNARE"" (S and N absent)\n- ""SPARE"" (S absent)\n- ""STARE"" (tried, S and T absent)\n- ""WHARE"" (not common, but ""whare"" is a Maori word, might not be in word list)\n- ""CHARE"" (C absent, and not common)\n\nOther words: ""PARER"" (but has two R\'s and ends with ER, not ARE) -> no.\n\n""BARRE"" (B A R R E) -> but that has A in position 2, not 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""BLARE"", ""FLARE"", ""GLARE"".\n\nWe also have ""DWARE"" or ""KWARE""? Not words.\n\n""OARED"" -> O A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.\n\nSo it seems the common ones are the ones with L: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.\n\nBut there might be others: ""AWARE"" (if we consider duplicates) or ""ALARE"" not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""URARE"" not a word.\n\nSo we have three strong candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.\n\nWe need to choose one that can help us. Since we have to guess one, and if it\'s wrong, we get feedback on the first two letters.\n\nBut we can also think of a word that uses letters that are in many of these possibilities? But they all have L in the second position? Actually:\n\n- BLARE: B and L\n- FLARE: F and L\n- GLARE: G and L\n\nSo they all have L in the second position? Let\'s see:\n\nBLARE: B (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)\nFLARE: F (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)\nGLARE: G (1), L (2), A (3), R (4), E (5)\n\nSo in all three, the second letter is L.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the second letter is L, then we only need to find the first letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know that for sure. There might be other words without L.\n\nFor example, ""AWARE"": A (1), W (2), A (3) -> but duplicate A? And we have A in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, it would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""PARED"" -> P A R E D -> but that has A in position 2, not 3.\n\n""CARED"" -> C absent, and A in position 2.\n\n""BARED"" -> B A R E D -> A in position 2.\n\nI think the only words that fit _ _ A R E with no duplicates and without the forbidden letters are the ones with L in position 2.\n\nBut let me think: ""QUARE"" is not a word.\n\n""DIARY"" -> D I A R Y -> but that ends with Y, not E.\n\n""HAIRE"" not a word.\n\nSo probably, the word is one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.\n\nTherefore, the second letter is L.\n\nSo we can fix the second letter as L? But we need to confirm.\n\nWe don\'t know for sure, but it\'s highly likely.\n\nWe can make a guess that has L in position 2 and a new letter in position 1.\n\nBut we have to choose one: B, F, or G.\n\nWe can try, for example, ""BLARE"". If it\'s not the word, we get feedback that B is not in the word (if x) or in the word but wrong position (if -), but since position 1 is the only position for B, if it\'s not correct, then it would be absent? Because we have no other positions for B.\n\nIn ""BLARE"", if we guess it and the secret word is ""FLARE"", then:\n\n- B: x (because F is the first letter, not B)\n- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2 in both, then correct)\n- A: ✓\n- R: ✓\n- E: ✓\n\nBut we know A, R, E are correct, so they will be ✓. L would be ✓ if it is in position 2. B would be x if not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", same thing.\n\nBut if we guess ""BLARE"" and it\'s wrong, we know that the first letter is not B, so it must be F or G.\n\nThen we can guess between FLARE and GLARE.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left, so we can do that.\n\nTo save a guess, we might try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have L in position 2? But then we risk missing the pattern.\n\nBut let\'s see: is there a word that fits _ _ A R E without L in position 2?\n\nFor example, ""AWARE"": if we allow duplicate A, then A(1) W(2) A(3) R(4) E(5). But we have A in position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but we haven\'t encountered one yet.\n\nIn the feedback, if there is a duplicate, the feedback would indicate it. For example, if the word has two A\'s, and we guess an A in a wrong position, it would show as present (yellow) if there is another A that is not accounted for.\n\nBut in our first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn\'t have A elsewhere. In the second guess, we didn\'t have A elsewhere. So we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARER"" has two R\'s, but that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""MARRY"" -> M A R R Y -> not ending with E.\n\n""TARRE"" not a word.\n\n""VARVE"" -> V A R V E -> A in position 2, not 3.\n\nI think it\'s safe to assume that the second letter is L for now.\n\nBut let\'s check the dictionary: are there other words?\n\n- ""BLARE"" (valid)\n- ""FLARE"" (valid)\n- ""GLARE"" (valid)\n- ""ULARE"" not a word\n- ""ILARE"" not a word\n- ""ALARE"" not a word\n- ""ELARE"" not a word\n- ""OLARE"" not a word\n\n""WARE"" is 4 letters.\n\nSo yes, the common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.\n\nTherefore, we can guess one of them.\n\nTo choose which one, we can pick the one with the most common letters. But B, F, G are all consonants.\n\nWe can also consider that we haven\'t tested B, F, G, L.\n\nBut we know L must be in position 2 if one of these words.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""GLARE"" because G is a common letter? Or ""BLARE""?\n\nWe can also think of the frequency.\n\nBut to be systematic, we can guess ""BLARE"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we know it\'s either FLARE or GLARE.\n\nBut we have to use a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without committing to L? But we don\'t have such a word because the pattern requires the last three to be A, R, E.\n\nWe could guess a word that is not of the form _ _ A R E? But that would be inefficient because we know three positions are fixed.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we might get information about other letters, but we already have three fixed, so it\'s better to use the pattern.\n\nI think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\nLet me choose ""FLARE"" because F is a common letter.\n\nBut no particular reason.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had no F, so we don\'t know about F.\n\nSimilarly for B and G.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""FLARE"".\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess.\n\nWe can also think: if we guess ""BLARE"", and it\'s wrong, we eliminate B, and then we can guess ""FLARE"" next, and if that\'s wrong, then ""GLARE"" must be it.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses, so we can do that.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s guess ""BLARE"".\n\nBut I think any of them is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""GLARE"" because G is less common? Or more common? Actually, in English, B, F, G are all fairly common.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""FLARE"".\n\nSo the third guess: FLARE\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get if it\'s not the word.\n\nIf the secret word is ""BLARE"", then for ""FLARE"":\n- F: x (because B is the first letter, not F)\n- L: ✓ (position 2)\n- A: ✓\n- R: ✓\n- E: ✓\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""GLARE"", then F would be x.\n\nBut if the word is ""FLARE"", then all correct.\n\nSo we\'ll know.\n\nBut we can do the same with any.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested L at all. We are assuming L is in the word and in position 2.\n\nBut what if the word is not one of these? For example, if duplicates are allowed, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.\n\nTo cover that, we might need to consider it.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""AWARE"" has two A\'s. In the first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and we didn\'t have A in other positions, so we don\'t know if there is another A.\n\nSimilarly, in the second guess, same.\n\nSo it\'s possible.\n\nIf the word is ""AWARE"", then the pattern is A W A R E.\n\nThen our feedback for ""crane"": \n- C: x\n- R: - (because R is in position 4, but we put it in position 2, so it\'s present but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (position 3)\n- N: x\n- E: ✓ (position 5)\n\nAnd for ""stare"":\n- S: x\n- T: x\n- A: ✓ (position 3) — but note, in ""stare"", we have A in position 3, which is correct. But the secret word ""AWARE"" has A in position 1 and 3. So when we put A in position 3, it gets a check, which is correct. The first A in ""stare"" is S, not A, so we don\'t have A in position 1 in the guess.\n- R: ✓ (position 4) — in ""stare"", we have R in position 4, which is correct for ""AWARE"".\n- E: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo the feedback for ""stare"" would be: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓), which matches what we have.\n\nTherefore, ""AWARE"" is a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, are there other words with duplicate A? Like ""ALARM"" but that ends with M, not E.\n\n""ALATE"" -> A L A T E -> but T is absent, and E is in position 5? ""ALATE"" has E in position 5, but the pattern is A L A T E, so position 3 is A (correct), position 4 is T (but we have R in position 4 from feedback? No, we have R in position 4 from the second guess feedback: R(✓) in position 4. So the secret word must have R in position 4. But ""ALATE"" has T in position 4, not R. So not.\n\n""ARARE"" not a word.\n\nSo only ""AWARE"" is a possibility with duplicate A.\n\nBut in ""AWARE"", the first letter is A, which we haven\'t tested in position 1.\n\nAnd the second letter is W.\n\nWe also know that S, T, C, N are absent.\n\nSo ""AWARE"" is a valid candidate.\n\nTherefore, we have four possibilities: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE.\n\nNow, we need to distinguish among these.\n\nWe can try a guess that tests the first position and the second position.\n\nBut the pattern is fixed: positions 3,4,5 are A,R,E.\n\nSo we must guess a word of the form [letter1] [letter2] A R E.\n\nWe can choose a word that is one of the candidates.\n\nBut if we guess ""AWARE"", for example, and it\'s not, then we get feedback.\n\nBut ""AWARE"" has A in position 1, which might be a duplicate.\n\nIf we guess ""AWARE"":\n- If the secret word is ""AWARE"", all correct.\n- If the secret word is ""BLARE"", then:\n  - A in position 1: but ""BLARE"" has B in position 1, so A would be x (since no other A except position 3, and that is already accounted for? In ""BLARE"", there is only one A, in position 3. So if we put A in position 1, it would be not in the word? Or if the word has only one A, then A in position 1 would be x, because the only A is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, W in position 2: not in the word, so x.\n\nThen A in position 3: ✓, R: ✓, E: ✓.\n\nSo feedback: A(x) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but we have two A\'s in the guess. The first A is not in the word (since the only A is in position 3), so it should be x. The second A is in position 3, so ✓.\n\nSimilarly, for ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same thing.\n\nSo if we guess ""AWARE"" and the secret word is ""BLARE"", we get: A(x) for the first A, W(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓).\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", same feedback.\n\nIf the word is ""AWARE"", then we get A(✓) for position 1? But we have two A\'s: the first A in position 1 would be ✓, and the second A in position 3 would be ✓? But in ""AWARE"", there are two A\'s, so both should be correct? But in the feedback, for duplicate letters, if both are correct, both get ✓.\n\nBut in our case, for ""AWARE"" guess on ""AWARE"" secret: position 1 A is correct, position 2 W is correct, position 3 A is correct, etc. So all ✓.\n\nBut the feedback for the two A\'s: the first A is in position 1, which is correct, so ✓. The second A is in position 3, which is also correct, so ✓.\n\nSo the feedback would be A(✓) W(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) — but that\'s five ✓, which means we won.\n\nBut if not, we get the feedback with the first A x and W x.\n\nSo it\'s distinguishable.\n\nBut we don\'t gain much by guessing ""AWARE"" if it\'s not the word, because we still don\'t know between BLARE, FLARE, GLARE.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to guess one of BLARE, FLARE, GLARE first.\n\nIf we guess ""BLARE"" and it\'s wrong, then we know it\'s not B, so it must be F, G, or A (if AWARE).\n\nBut if we get feedback for ""BLARE"" as:\n- B: x (if not B)\n- L: ✓ (if L is in position 2)\n- A: ✓\n- R: ✓\n- E: ✓\n\nThen we know that the first letter is not B, and L is in position 2 (because we got ✓ for L in position 2). So the word must be FLARE or GLARE or AWARE? But AWARE does not have L, it has W in position 2.\n\nIf the secret word is ""AWARE"", and we guess ""BLARE"", then:\n- B: x (not in word)\n- L: x (not in word, because ""AWARE"" has no L)\n- A: ✓ (position 3)\n- R: ✓ (position 4)\n- E: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo feedback: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n\nThis is different from if the word had L.\n\nSo if we guess ""BLARE"" and we get L(x), then we know there is no L, so it must be ""AWARE"".\n\nIf we get L(✓), then it must be one of FLARE or GLARE (since BLARE would have B correct, but if B is x, then not BLARE).\n\nLet\'s clarify:\n\nCase 1: Secret word is ""BLARE""\n- Guess ""BLARE"": all ✓, we win.\n\nCase 2: Secret word is ""FLARE""\n- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) because F is first, L(✓), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)\n\nCase 3: Secret word is ""GLARE""\n- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n\nCase 4: Secret word is ""AWARE""\n- Guess ""BLARE"": B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n\nSo the feedback on L tells us:\n- If L(✓), then the word is FLARE or GLARE (and B is not the first letter, so not BLARE)\n- If L(x), then the word is AWARE (since no other candidates)\n\nTherefore, by guessing ""BLARE"", we can distinguish all cases.\n\nIf we get all ✓, we win.\n\nIf we get B(x) L(✓) ... then we know it\'s FLARE or GLARE, and we can guess between them next.\n\nIf we get B(x) L(x) ... then it must be AWARE, and we can guess that next.\n\nSo it\'s a good diagnostic guess.\n\nWe can do the same with ""FLARE"" or ""GLARE"", but ""BLARE"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BLARE"" as the third guess.\n\n<guess>blare</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  \n  This tells us:  \n  - \'A\' is in position 3.  \n  - \'E\' is in position 5.  \n  - \'R\' is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - \'C\' and \'N\' are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: stare** → Feedback: S(x), T(x), A(✓), R(✓), E(✓)  \n  This tells us:  \n  - \'A\' (position 3), \'R\' (position 4), and \'E\' (position 5) are confirmed correct.  \n  - \'S\' and \'T\' are not in the word.  \n  - Combined with Guess 1, \'R\' is now confirmed to be in position 4 (previously misplaced in position 2).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A R E` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as \'A\', \'R\', \'E\').  \n- Absent letters: C, N, S, T (cannot appear in the word).  \n- Present letters: A, R, E (with positions known), and one additional letter from Guess 1 (\'R\' was present but misplaced, now placed).  \n- Since \'R\' was misplaced in position 2 in Guess 1 but correct in position 4 in Guess 2, and no duplicates were indicated in feedback, we assume no duplicate letters for now.  \n- Possible words fitting `_ _ A R E` and excluding absent letters:  \n  - **BLARE** (B in position 1, L in position 2)  \n  - **FLARE** (F in position 1, L in position 2)  \n  - **GLARE** (G in position 1, L in position 2)  \n  - **AWARE** (A in position 1, W in position 2; but this would require a duplicate \'A\', which is possible but unconfirmed).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test **BLARE** to efficiently narrow down possibilities:  \n  - If correct, we solve the word.  \n  - If not, the feedback on \'B\' and \'L\' will distinguish between the remaining options:  \n    - If \'L\' is correct (✓), the word is either **FLARE** or **GLARE** (since \'B\' would be absent).  \n    - If \'L\' is absent (x), the word must be **AWARE** (since no other common words fit the pattern).  \n- This guess maximizes information gain by testing two key letters (B and L) in one move, leveraging the fixed pattern.\n\n<guess>blare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: blare -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from Guess 3: ""blare"" -> B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

This tells us:
- B is not in the word.
- L is not in the word.
- A, R, E are correct and in their positions (3, 4, 5).

Given that, the only remaining candidate from our previous list is ""AWARE"", because:
- We had four possibilities: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE.
- BLARE is eliminated because B and L are absent (so it can't be BLARE, FLARE, or GLARE, as they all require L in position 2).
- Therefore, the word must be ""AWARE"".

But let's confirm:
- ""AWARE"" has the pattern: A W A R E.
- Positions: 1: A, 2: W, 3: A, 4: R, 5: E.
- We know position 3 is A (correct), position 4 is R (correct), position 5 is E (correct).
- The first letter is A, which is a duplicate of the A in position 3. Since we got a check for A in position 3 in all guesses, but we never tested position 1 for A, it's possible.
- The second letter is W, which we haven't tested yet.

In the feedback for ""blare"", we got L(x) which is consistent because ""AWARE"" has no L.

Also, in previous guesses:
- ""crane"": R was misplaced (because in ""AWARE"", R is in position 4, not 2) and A and E correct.
- ""stare"": S and T absent (correct, ""AWARE"" has no S or T), A, R, E correct.

So ""AWARE"" fits all the feedback.

Therefore, we should guess ""AWARE"" next.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""AWARE"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

So the fourth guess is ""AWARE"".

If correct, we should get all ✓.

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  - 'A' in position 3, 'E' in position 5 are correct.  
  - 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - 'C' and 'N' are absent.  

- **Guess 2: stare** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - 'A' (position 3), 'R' (position 4), and 'E' (position 5) are confirmed correct.  
  - 'S' and 'T' are absent.  
  - The word pattern is now `_ _ A R E`.  

- **Guess 3: blare** → Feedback: B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - 'B' and 'L' are absent.  
  - 'A', 'R', and 'E' remain correct in positions 3, 4, and 5.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern `_ _ A R E` (positions 3, 4, 5: A, R, E).  
- Absent letters: **C, N, S, T, B, L** (cannot appear).  
- Present letters: **A, R, E** (positions known), with one additional letter (from Guess 1's feedback) still unplaced, now confirmed as **not B or L**.  
- The only remaining valid word fitting this pattern and constraints is **AWARE**:  
  - `A _ A R E` → Duplicate 'A' is possible (position 1 and 3).  
  - Position 2 must be 'W' (not yet tested and not in the absent list).  
- ""AWARE"" explains all feedback:  
  - Guess 1: 'R' is misplaced (position 2 vs. actual position 4).  
  - Guess 2: 'S' and 'T' absent, 'A'/'R'/'E' correct.  
  - Guess 3: 'B' and 'L' absent, 'A'/'R'/'E' correct.  

### Next Guess:
- **AWARE** is the only plausible candidate. If correct, it will show all ✓.

<guess>aware</guess>",aware,"We have the feedback from Guess 3: ""blare"" -> B(x) L(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)

This tells us:
- B is not in the word.
- L is not in the word.
- A, R, E are correct and in their positions (3, 4, 5).

Given that, the only remaining candidate from our previous list is ""AWARE"", because:
- We had four possibilities: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE.
- BLARE is eliminated because B and L are absent (so it can't be BLARE, FLARE, or GLARE, as they all require L in position 2).
- Therefore, the word must be ""AWARE"".

But let's confirm:
- ""AWARE"" has the pattern: A W A R E.
- Positions: 1: A, 2: W, 3: A, 4: R, 5: E.
- We know position 3 is A (correct), position 4 is R (correct), position 5 is E (correct).
- The first letter is A, which is a duplicate of the A in position 3. Since we got a check for A in position 3 in all guesses, but we never tested position 1 for A, it's possible.
- The second letter is W, which we haven't tested yet.

In the feedback for ""blare"", we got L(x) which is consistent because ""AWARE"" has no L.

Also, in previous guesses:
- ""crane"": R was misplaced (because in ""AWARE"", R is in position 4, not 2) and A and E correct.
- ""stare"": S and T absent (correct, ""AWARE"" has no S or T), A, R, E correct.

So ""AWARE"" fits all the feedback.

Therefore, we should guess ""AWARE"" next.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""AWARE"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

So the fourth guess is ""AWARE"".

If correct, we should get all ✓.

- Absent letters: **C, N, S, T, B, L** (cannot appear).  
- Present letters: **A, R, E** (positions known), with one additional letter (from Guess 1's feedback) still unplaced, now confirmed as **not B or L**.

  - Position 2 must be 'W' (not yet tested and not in the absent list).  
- ""AWARE"" explains all feedback:

  - Guess 2: 'S' and 'T' absent, 'A'/'R'/'E' correct.  
  - Guess 3: 'B' and 'L' absent, 'A'/'R'/'E' correct.
