We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 So, my first guess is: ROAST

We are given feedback for the first guess ""roast"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 S: - (in the word but wrong position)
 T: ✓ (correct position)

 This tells us:
 - The letter T is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with T.
 - The letter S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we placed it at position 4 and it's wrong). So S must be in one of the first four positions, but not position 4.
 - The letters R, O, A are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter S (somewhere in positions 1-3) and the letter T at position 5.
 - We must avoid using R, O, A in our next guess.

 Since T is fixed at the end, we can think of the word as _ _ _ _ T.

 We also know that S is present but not at position 4. Since position 5 is T, the only positions left for S are 1, 2, or 3.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter word.
 2. Ends with T (because T is correct and in position 5).
 3. Contains the letter S, but not at position 4 (and not at position 5 because that's T). So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
 4. Does not contain R, O, A.

 We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of words that end with T and have an S in one of the first three positions.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""INSET"": I, N, S, E, T -> S is at position 3, and ends with T. Also, no R, O, A.
 - ""ONSET"": but O is not allowed (we know O is not in the word) -> invalid.
 - ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> S at position 3, ends with T. No R, O, A.
 - ""ASSET"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.
 - ""BESET"": B, E, S, E, T -> S at position 3, ends with T. No R, O, A.

 However, we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let me consider the word ""INSET"". It has I, N, S, E, T. We know T is fixed, so we are testing I, N, S, E.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has S in a different position, such as position 1 or 2.

 Example with S at position 1: ""SPLIT"", but that ends with T? No, ""SPLIT"" ends with T? Wait, ""SPLIT"" is S-P-L-I-T -> ends with T, and S is at position 1. Also, no R, O, A.

 But note: we have to avoid using the known absent letters (R, O, A). So ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

 However, we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants. We already know that the word has S and T, and we have three new letters to test.

 Let me list a few options:
 1. ""SPLIT"": S at 1, P, L, I, T at 5. We test S (which we know is present, but we are checking position 1), and new letters P, L, I.
 2. ""SLEPT"": S at 1, L, E, P, T at 5. But E is a vowel we haven't tested. However, note that we have already tested A and O (absent) and E is another common vowel. Also, we avoid R, O, A.

 But wait, in ""SLEPT"", we have S at position 1. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. If we put it at position 1 and it's not, we'll get a '-' for S, which is still informative.

 Alternatively, we could put S in a position we haven't tried, such as position 2 or 3.

 Since in the first guess we had S at position 4 (which was wrong), we might try position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.

 Let me think of words with S at position 2 and ending with T:
 - ""USUAL"" doesn't end with T. 
 - ""MISTY"": M, I, S, T, Y -> but T is at position 4, not 5. We need T at position 5.
 - ""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> S at position 4? Actually, E-X-I-S-T: S is at position 4? But we know S cannot be at position 4 (from the first feedback: we had S at position 4 and it was wrong). So we must avoid putting S at position 4.

 Therefore, in ""EXIST"", S is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""MUSET""? Not a common word. 

 Another idea: ""SALET"" but A is not allowed.

 Let me try words with S at position 3 and ending with T:
 - ""INSET"": as before, I-N-S-E-T -> S at position 3.
 - ""ONSET"" has O -> invalid.
 - ""ASSET"" has A -> invalid.
 - ""BESET"": B-E-S-E-T -> S at position 3.

 So ""INSET"" and ""BESET"" are candidates.

 But note: we also want to test new letters. We haven't tested E, I, N, B, etc.

 Another candidate: ""UNLIT"" doesn't have S. 

 How about ""EXIST"" but we cannot because S is at position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in the same position as the first guess? But we know S is in the word, so we must include it.

 Since we have limited tries, we should include S and T (with T fixed at the end) and avoid R, O, A.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"":
 - S at position 1: if S is actually at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's not at 1 (so it must be at 2 or 3).
 - We also test P, L, I.

 But note: the word must end with T, so we are sure about the last letter.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""INSET"" to test the position 3 for S.

 However, I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it tests S at a new position (1) and introduces three new letters.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we don't know.

 However, since we are avoiding R, O, A, and including S and T, and testing new letters, let's go with ""SPLIT"".

 But note: if the word is ""SPLIT"", then we get:
  S at 1: if the secret word has S at 1, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at 2 or 3, then we get - for S and the rest.

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Another candidate: ""SLEPT"" has E, which is a common vowel we haven't tested. And we avoid R, O, A.

 Let me compare:
 - ""SPLIT"": tests S at 1, P, L, I, and T at 5 (known).
 - ""SLEPT"": tests S at 1, L, E, P, T at 5.

 Both are good. I'll choose ""SLEPT"" because it includes the vowel E, which we haven't tested, and we know that the word might have E.

 But note: we have already ruled out A and O, so the vowels left are E, I, U. Testing E is important.

 So I decide to go with ""SLEPT"".

 However, we must be cautious: the word must be valid. ""SLEPT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""SLEPT"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has S at position 1? Then we get a check for S. If not, we get a minus and know it's not at 1, so it must be at 2 or 3.

 Also, we test L, E, P.

 So let's go with ""SLEPT"".

<guess>slept</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""roast"":
- **R, O, A** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **S** is present but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").
- **T** is **correct and in position 5** (marked ""✓"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **ends with T** (position 5).
2. **S is in the word** but must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is incorrect and position 5 is T).
3. Avoid **R, O, A** entirely in the next guess.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Prioritize words ending with **T** and including **S** in positions 1–3.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **E, L, P**) to gather more information.
- **""SLEPT""** fits perfectly: 
  - Ends with **T** (position 5).
  - Places **S** in position 1 (testing if it belongs there).
  - Introduces new letters **E, L, P** (none are ruled out).
  - Avoids **R, O, A**.

 2. ""SLEPT"": S at 1, L, E, P, T at 5. But E is a vowel we haven't tested. However, note that we have already tested A and O (absent) and E is another common vowel. Also, we avoid R, O, A.

 But wait, in ""SLEPT"", we have S at position 1. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. If we put it at position 1 and it's not, we'll get a '-' for S, which is still informative.

 Alternatively, we could put S in a position we haven't tried, such as position 2 or 3.

 Since in the first guess we had S at position 4 (which was wrong), we might try position 2 or 3 to see if it fits there.

 Let me think of words with S at position 2 and ending with T:
 - ""USUAL"" doesn't end with T. 
 - ""MISTY"": M, I, S, T, Y -> but T is at position 4, not 5. We need T at position 5.
 - ""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> S at position 4? Actually, E-X-I-S-T: S is at position 4? But we know S cannot be at position 4 (from the first feedback: we had S at position 4 and it was wrong). So we must avoid putting S at position 4.

 Therefore, in ""EXIST"", S is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""MUSET""? Not a common word. 

 Another idea: ""SALET"" but A is not allowed.

 Let me try words with S at position 3 and ending with T:
 - ""INSET"": as before, I-N-S-E-T -> S at position 3.
 - ""ONSET"" has O -> invalid.
 - ""ASSET"" has A -> invalid.
 - ""BESET"": B-E-S-E-T -> S at position 3.

 So ""INSET"" and ""BESET"" are candidates.

 But note: we also want to test new letters. We haven't tested E, I, N, B, etc.

 Another candidate: ""UNLIT"" doesn't have S. 

 How about ""EXIST"" but we cannot because S is at position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in the same position as the first guess? But we know S is in the word, so we must include it.

 Since we have limited tries, we should include S and T (with T fixed at the end) and avoid R, O, A.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"":
 - S at position 1: if S is actually at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's not at 1 (so it must be at 2 or 3).
 - We also test P, L, I.

 But note: the word must end with T, so we are sure about the last letter.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""INSET"" to test the position 3 for S.

 However, I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it tests S at a new position (1) and introduces three new letters.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we don't know.

 However, since we are avoiding R, O, A, and including S and T, and testing new letters, let's go with ""SPLIT"".

 But note: if the word is ""SPLIT"", then we get:
  S at 1: if the secret word has S at 1, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at 2 or 3, then we get - for S and the rest.

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Another candidate: ""SLEPT"" has E, which is a common vowel we haven't tested. And we avoid R, O, A.

 Let me compare:
 - ""SPLIT"": tests S at 1, P, L, I, and T at 5 (known).
 - ""SLEPT"": tests S at 1, L, E, P, T at 5.

 Both are good. I'll choose ""SLEPT"" because it includes the vowel E, which we haven't tested, and we know that the word might have E.

 But note: we have already ruled out A and O, so the vowels left are E, I, U. Testing E is important.

 So I decide to go with ""SLEPT"".

 However, we must be cautious: the word must be valid. ""SLEPT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""SLEPT"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has S at position 1? Then we get a check for S. If not, we get a minus and know it's not at 1, so it must be at 2 or 3.

 Also, we test L, E, P.

 So let's go with ""SLEPT"".

<guess>slept</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""roast"":
- **R, O, A** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **S** is present but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").
- **T** is **correct and in position 5** (marked ""✓"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **ends with T** (position 5).
2. **S is in the word** but must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is incorrect and position 5 is T).
3. Avoid **R, O, A** entirely in the next guess.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Prioritize words ending with **T** and including **S** in positions 1–3.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **E, L, P**) to gather more information.
- **""SLEPT""** fits perfectly: 
  - Ends with **T** (position 5).
  - Places **S** in position 1 (testing if it belongs there).
  - Introduces new letters **E, L, P** (none are ruled out).
  - Avoids **R, O, A**.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- R, O, A are not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- T is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: ""slept"" -> S(✓) L(-) E(x) P(x) T(✓)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in position 1 (correct!).
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is not in the word.
- P is not in the word.
- T is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word starts with S and ends with T. So the word is S _ _ _ T.
2. The letter L is in the word, but not in position 2. Since the word is S _ _ _ T, L must be in position 3 or 4.
3. The letters R, O, A, E, P are not in the word.
4. We also know from the first guess that S is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 1, so that's consistent).

Therefore, the word is: S _ _ _ T, with L in position 3 or 4, and no R, O, A, E, P.

We need to find a word that fits: S _ X Y T, where one of X or Y is L (but not both, unless duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for duplicates yet). Also, the other letter must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out.

Available letters: We have to avoid R, O, A, E, P. Also, we have used S, L, T. So we can use other common letters like I, U, N, C, D, M, etc.

Possible positions for L:
- If L is in position 3: then the word is S _ L _ T
- If L is in position 4: then the word is S _ _ L T

We need to test both possibilities and also figure out the missing letters.

We also want to maximize information. Since we have two unknown positions (2 and either 3 or 4), we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that start with S and end with T, and have an L in position 3 or 4.

First, if L is in position 3: words like:
- S I L K T? -> ""SILKT"" not a word.
- S K I L T? -> ""SKILT"" not common, but ""SKIRT"" has R which is ruled out.
- S A L T? but A is ruled out.
- S U L T? ""SULKT"" not a word. ""SULKY"" doesn't end with T.

Actually, common words:
- ""SILT"" is 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""SALET"" has A and E ruled out.

What about ""SMELT""? But E is ruled out and M is new? ""SMELT"" has E -> ruled out.

Another: ""SPILT"" -> but P is ruled out.

With L in position 4: words like:
- S _ _ L T
Examples: ""STILT"" -> S T I L T. But we have T at the end and also T in position 2? Let's check: positions: S (1), T (2), I (3), L (4), T (5). But we have two T's? The feedback hasn't indicated any duplicate letters so far, but it's possible.

But note: in the first guess, we had T at position 5 and it was correct. In the second guess, we have T at position 5 again. We haven't tested T in other positions. So if the word has two T's, we wouldn't know yet.

However, in ""STILT"", we have T at position 2 and 5. We haven't tested position 2 for T? Actually, in the second guess, we had L at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So position 2 is not T? Because if it were T, then in the second guess, we would have had T at position 2? But we didn't have T at position 2 in the second guess. We had S, L, E, P, T. So position 2 was L, which is not T.

But in ""STILT"", if we put T at position 2, then in the second guess we didn't have T at position 2, so it would have been a different letter. But we don't know what is at position 2.

Let me list possible words:

Common words that start with S and end with T, and have L in the word (at position 3 or 4), and avoid R, O, A, E, P.

Possible words:
- ""STILT"": S T I L T -> letters: S, T, I, L, T. 
  - Position 1: S (correct)
  - Position 2: T (we haven't tested T in position 2? But we know T is in the word at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback for T in the first guess was only for position 5. In the second guess, we only had T at position 5. So we don't know if T appears elsewhere. However, in ""STILT"", there are two T's. The feedback for the second guess: we had L at position 2 (which was marked as present but wrong position). If the word is ""STILT"", then position 2 is T, so when we guessed L at position 2, it should have been marked as absent (x) because T is not L? But the feedback says L is present but wrong position. So if the word is ""STILT"", then L is at position 4, so the L in our guess at position 2 is not in the correct position, but it is present. So that matches. Also, the T at position 5 is correct. And S at position 1 is correct. The E and P are absent, which is correct because ""STILT"" has no E or P.

But what about the first guess? In the first guess, we had ""roast"" and S was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position. In ""STILT"", S is at position 1, so position 4 is L. So when we had S at position 4 in ""roast"", it was wrong because position 4 is L, not S. So that matches.

Also, ""STILT"" does not contain R (except we have R ruled out, and ""STILT"" has no R, O, A, E, P). So it's a candidate.

But we have to check if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""STULT""? Not common.

""SPILT"" has P, ruled out.

""SKILL"" doesn't end with T.

""STILL"" ends with L, not T.

""SMALT""? Not common, and has A.

""SWELL"" doesn't end with T.

Another possibility: L in position 3: S _ L _ T

Words: 
- ""SILKT"" not a word.
- ""SALET"" ruled out by letters.
- ""SOLID"" doesn't end with T and has O.
- ""SOLAR"" has O and A and R, and doesn't end with T.

What about ""SILTY""? But that ends with Y, not T.

""BUILT"" doesn't start with S.

How about ""SPELT""? But E and P are ruled out.

Another word: ""STILT"" is one. What about ""STOLT""? Not common and has O.

Or ""STINT"": S T I N T. This has no L. But we know L is in the word because of the feedback for the second guess: L is present. So ""STINT"" doesn't have L, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" has A, ruled out.

""SLIPT"" is a variant of ""slip"", but has P? ""SLIPT"" has P? S-L-I-P-T -> P is at position 4. But P is ruled out.

So back to ""STILT"". Are there other words?

Another word: ""STILT"" is one. What about ""STULT""? Not common.

Or ""STILT"" is the most common.

But we have to consider that L might be in position 4, and the word might be S _ _ L T.

Other than ""STILT"", what about:
- ""SHALT"": S H A L T -> but A is ruled out.
- ""SMELL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SPELL"" doesn't end with T and has P and E.

Another word: ""STILL"" doesn't end with T.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the only common word? But let's think of words with L in position 3: S _ L _ T

I can't think of any common 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with T, has L in position 3, and avoids R, O, A, E, P.

What about ""SILKT""? Not a word. ""SALET"" is not allowed.

Another idea: ""STOLL"" is not 5 letters and doesn't end with T.

So perhaps the word is ""STILT"".

But we have to confirm: in ""STILT"", the letters are S, T, I, L, T.

We know:
- S at position 1: correct.
- T at position 5: correct.
- L is at position 4. In our second guess, we had L at position 2, which is wrong position, but L is present (at position 4) so that matches.
- The letter I is new and hasn't been tested.

But we also have a T at position 2. We haven't tested T in position 2. In the second guess, we had L at position 2, which was marked as present but wrong position. Since the actual letter at position 2 is T, and T is not L, so L is not at position 2, which is consistent. And we know T is in the word (at position 5), but we don't know about a second T. The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly, but if there is a duplicate, it would be indicated by the presence. In the first guess, we had only one T (at position 5) and it was correct. In the second guess, we only had T at position 5. So if there is a T at position 2, we wouldn't know because we haven't guessed a T there. But the feedback for the second guess: for position 2, we guessed L and got a '-' meaning L is in the word but not there. It doesn't tell us about the actual letter at position 2.

So ""STILT"" is a strong candidate.

But are there other words? What about ""STULT""? It's a word but rare. Meaning: to make foolish or ineffectual. But let's stick to common words.

Another word: ""SWIFT""? But no L. We need L.

""SLIMY"" doesn't end with T.

""SLATE"" has A and E, ruled out.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's think of words with L in position 4: S _ _ L T

- ""STILL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SHILL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SKILL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SPILL"" doesn't end with T and has P.

What about ""STOLE""? But has O and E, and doesn't end with T? ""STOLE"" ends with E.

""STALK"" has A and ends with K.

I think ""STILT"" is the best candidate.

But we have one more possibility: what if the word has L in position 3? And the word is S _ L _ T.

Is there a word like S U L T? ""SULKT"" not a word. ""SULPH"" not 5 letters and doesn't end with T.

""SULFA"" not ends with T.

I think we can go with ""STILT"".

But to be safe, we might want to test if there is a T in position 2? We don't know. We can choose a word that tests the position 2 with a new letter.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 3. We can guess ""STILT"" and if it's not, we get more information.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has L in position 3 or 4 and tests the other positions with new letters.

For example, if we think L is in position 4, then we need to guess the letters for position 2 and 3.

We know position 1 is S, position 5 is T, and position 4 might be L? Or position 3 might be L.

We can try to guess a word that has L in position 3 to test that.

But we don't have to put L in the same position. We can put L in a different position to test.

But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Let me list the constraints again:
- Word: S _ _ _ T
- L is in the word, but not at position 2 (from the second guess). So L must be at position 3 or 4.
- We have to avoid R, O, A, E, P.

We can try to guess a word that has L at position 3 and a new letter at position 4, and a new letter at position 2.

For example, ""SILKT"" is not a word. ""SILTY"" is 5 letters but ends with Y, not T.

""BUILT"" doesn't start with S.

Another word: ""GUILT"" doesn't start with S.

""WILT"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the only common word.

Another common word: ""SPLIT"" but P is ruled out.

""SLIPT"" has P.

What about ""STILT"" and ""STILL"", but ""STILL"" doesn't end with T.

I found: ""STILT"" is a word. Also, ""STILL"" is not, but ""STILT"" is.

We can also consider ""STINT"": but no L.

Or ""STUNT"": S T U N T. This has no L? But we need L. And U is new.

But no L, so invalid.

""STOUT"" has O and no L.

I think we should go with ""STILT"".

But let's check the feedback we would get if the word is ""STILT"":

- Position 1: S -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: T -> but we are guessing T at position 2? In ""STILT"", position 2 is T. But in our guess, we are putting T at position 2. We haven't tested T at position 2 before. The feedback for T in the first guess was only for position 5. In the second guess, only for position 5. So if we guess ""STILT"", then:
  - S at 1: ✓
  - T at 2: ? We don't know if it's correct or not? But if the word is ""STILT"", then T at 2 is correct, so we get ✓ for T at 2? But we also have T at 5, which is also ✓.

But the feedback for the second guess told us that L is present but not at 2, so if the word has T at 2, that's fine.

But in our guess ""STILT"", we are putting:
- S at 1: should be ✓
- T at 2: if the word has T at 2, then ✓; if not, then it might be x or -? But we don't know.

But we are guessing ""STILT"" as a candidate for the entire word.

If the word is ""STILT"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But what if the word is not ""STILT""? For example, if L is in position 3, and the word is something else.

But I cannot think of any other common word.

Another possibility: ""SILLY"" doesn't end with T.

Or ""SILKY"" doesn't end with T.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the word.

To be thorough, let's consider if there is a word with L in position 4 and without T in position 2.

For example, ""SAINT"" has A and no L.

""SHIFT"" no L.

""SMITH"" no L.

""SNOUT"" has O and no L.

""SPOUT"" has P and O.

""SWIRL"" doesn't end with T.

I think ""STILT"" is the most likely.

So I will guess ""STILT"".

But note: in ""STILT"", we have two T's. We haven't tested T in position 2, so it's possible.

We can also consider ""STILL"", but it doesn't end with T.

Therefore, I choose ""STILT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(✓)  
  - **R, O, A** are absent from the secret word.  
  - **S** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""slept""** → S(✓), L(-), E(x), P(x), T(✓)  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - **L** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **E** and **P** are absent.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 5 (reconfirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **S** and ends with **T** (format: `S _ _ _ T`).  
2. **L** is in the word but must be in position 3 or 4 (since it's not in position 2).  
3. Absent letters: **R, O, A, E, P** (cannot appear in the word).  
4. We need to solve positions 2, 3, and 4, with one of them being **L** (position 3 or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **""STILT""** as a candidate:  
  - Fits the `S _ _ _ T` structure.  
  - Places **L** in position 4 (testing if it belongs there, as position 3 is also possible).  
  - Introduces **I** (a new vowel) and **T** in position 2 (untested position).  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm/reject **L** in position 4 and test **I**/**T** in position 2.  

<guess>stilt</guess>",stilt,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- R, O, A are not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- T is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: ""slept"" -> S(✓) L(-) E(x) P(x) T(✓)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in position 1 (correct!).
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is not in the word.
- P is not in the word.
- T is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word starts with S and ends with T. So the word is S _ _ _ T.
2. The letter L is in the word, but not in position 2. Since the word is S _ _ _ T, L must be in position 3 or 4.
3. The letters R, O, A, E, P are not in the word.
4. We also know from the first guess that S is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 1, so that's consistent).

Therefore, the word is: S _ _ _ T, with L in position 3 or 4, and no R, O, A, E, P.

We need to find a word that fits: S _ X Y T, where one of X or Y is L (but not both, unless duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for duplicates yet). Also, the other letter must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out.

Available letters: We have to avoid R, O, A, E, P. Also, we have used S, L, T. So we can use other common letters like I, U, N, C, D, M, etc.

Possible positions for L:
- If L is in position 3: then the word is S _ L _ T
- If L is in position 4: then the word is S _ _ L T

We need to test both possibilities and also figure out the missing letters.

We also want to maximize information. Since we have two unknown positions (2 and either 3 or 4), we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that start with S and end with T, and have an L in position 3 or 4.

First, if L is in position 3: words like:
- S I L K T? -> ""SILKT"" not a word.
- S K I L T? -> ""SKILT"" not common, but ""SKIRT"" has R which is ruled out.
- S A L T? but A is ruled out.
- S U L T? ""SULKT"" not a word. ""SULKY"" doesn't end with T.

Actually, common words:
- ""SILT"" is 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""SALET"" has A and E ruled out.

What about ""SMELT""? But E is ruled out and M is new? ""SMELT"" has E -> ruled out.

Another: ""SPILT"" -> but P is ruled out.

With L in position 4: words like:
- S _ _ L T
Examples: ""STILT"" -> S T I L T. But we have T at the end and also T in position 2? Let's check: positions: S (1), T (2), I (3), L (4), T (5). But we have two T's? The feedback hasn't indicated any duplicate letters so far, but it's possible.

But note: in the first guess, we had T at position 5 and it was correct. In the second guess, we have T at position 5 again. We haven't tested T in other positions. So if the word has two T's, we wouldn't know yet.

However, in ""STILT"", we have T at position 2 and 5. We haven't tested position 2 for T? Actually, in the second guess, we had L at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So position 2 is not T? Because if it were T, then in the second guess, we would have had T at position 2? But we didn't have T at position 2 in the second guess. We had S, L, E, P, T. So position 2 was L, which is not T.

But in ""STILT"", if we put T at position 2, then in the second guess we didn't have T at position 2, so it would have been a different letter. But we don't know what is at position 2.

Let me list possible words:

Common words that start with S and end with T, and have L in the word (at position 3 or 4), and avoid R, O, A, E, P.

Possible words:
- ""STILT"": S T I L T -> letters: S, T, I, L, T. 
  - Position 1: S (correct)
  - Position 2: T (we haven't tested T in position 2? But we know T is in the word at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback for T in the first guess was only for position 5. In the second guess, we only had T at position 5. So we don't know if T appears elsewhere. However, in ""STILT"", there are two T's. The feedback for the second guess: we had L at position 2 (which was marked as present but wrong position). If the word is ""STILT"", then position 2 is T, so when we guessed L at position 2, it should have been marked as absent (x) because T is not L? But the feedback says L is present but wrong position. So if the word is ""STILT"", then L is at position 4, so the L in our guess at position 2 is not in the correct position, but it is present. So that matches. Also, the T at position 5 is correct. And S at position 1 is correct. The E and P are absent, which is correct because ""STILT"" has no E or P.

But what about the first guess? In the first guess, we had ""roast"" and S was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position. In ""STILT"", S is at position 1, so position 4 is L. So when we had S at position 4 in ""roast"", it was wrong because position 4 is L, not S. So that matches.

Also, ""STILT"" does not contain R (except we have R ruled out, and ""STILT"" has no R, O, A, E, P). So it's a candidate.

But we have to check if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""STULT""? Not common.

""SPILT"" has P, ruled out.

""SKILL"" doesn't end with T.

""STILL"" ends with L, not T.

""SMALT""? Not common, and has A.

""SWELL"" doesn't end with T.

Another possibility: L in position 3: S _ L _ T

Words: 
- ""SILKT"" not a word.
- ""SALET"" ruled out by letters.
- ""SOLID"" doesn't end with T and has O.
- ""SOLAR"" has O and A and R, and doesn't end with T.

What about ""SILTY""? But that ends with Y, not T.

""BUILT"" doesn't start with S.

How about ""SPELT""? But E and P are ruled out.

Another word: ""STILT"" is one. What about ""STOLT""? Not common and has O.

Or ""STINT"": S T I N T. This has no L. But we know L is in the word because of the feedback for the second guess: L is present. So ""STINT"" doesn't have L, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" has A, ruled out.

""SLIPT"" is a variant of ""slip"", but has P? ""SLIPT"" has P? S-L-I-P-T -> P is at position 4. But P is ruled out.

So back to ""STILT"". Are there other words?

Another word: ""STILT"" is one. What about ""STULT""? Not common.

Or ""STILT"" is the most common.

But we have to consider that L might be in position 4, and the word might be S _ _ L T.

Other than ""STILT"", what about:
- ""SHALT"": S H A L T -> but A is ruled out.
- ""SMELL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SPELL"" doesn't end with T and has P and E.

Another word: ""STILL"" doesn't end with T.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the only common word? But let's think of words with L in position 3: S _ L _ T

I can't think of any common 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with T, has L in position 3, and avoids R, O, A, E, P.

What about ""SILKT""? Not a word. ""SALET"" is not allowed.

Another idea: ""STOLL"" is not 5 letters and doesn't end with T.

So perhaps the word is ""STILT"".

But we have to confirm: in ""STILT"", the letters are S, T, I, L, T.

We know:
- S at position 1: correct.
- T at position 5: correct.
- L is at position 4. In our second guess, we had L at position 2, which is wrong position, but L is present (at position 4) so that matches.
- The letter I is new and hasn't been tested.

But we also have a T at position 2. We haven't tested T in position 2. In the second guess, we had L at position 2, which was marked as present but wrong position. Since the actual letter at position 2 is T, and T is not L, so L is not at position 2, which is consistent. And we know T is in the word (at position 5), but we don't know about a second T. The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly, but if there is a duplicate, it would be indicated by the presence. In the first guess, we had only one T (at position 5) and it was correct. In the second guess, we only had T at position 5. So if there is a T at position 2, we wouldn't know because we haven't guessed a T there. But the feedback for the second guess: for position 2, we guessed L and got a '-' meaning L is in the word but not there. It doesn't tell us about the actual letter at position 2.

So ""STILT"" is a strong candidate.

But are there other words? What about ""STULT""? It's a word but rare. Meaning: to make foolish or ineffectual. But let's stick to common words.

Another word: ""SWIFT""? But no L. We need L.

""SLIMY"" doesn't end with T.

""SLATE"" has A and E, ruled out.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's think of words with L in position 4: S _ _ L T

- ""STILL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SHILL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SKILL"" doesn't end with T.
- ""SPILL"" doesn't end with T and has P.

What about ""STOLE""? But has O and E, and doesn't end with T? ""STOLE"" ends with E.

""STALK"" has A and ends with K.

I think ""STILT"" is the best candidate.

But we have one more possibility: what if the word has L in position 3? And the word is S _ L _ T.

Is there a word like S U L T? ""SULKT"" not a word. ""SULPH"" not 5 letters and doesn't end with T.

""SULFA"" not ends with T.

I think we can go with ""STILT"".

But to be safe, we might want to test if there is a T in position 2? We don't know. We can choose a word that tests the position 2 with a new letter.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 3. We can guess ""STILT"" and if it's not, we get more information.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has L in position 3 or 4 and tests the other positions with new letters.

For example, if we think L is in position 4, then we need to guess the letters for position 2 and 3.

We know position 1 is S, position 5 is T, and position 4 might be L? Or position 3 might be L.

We can try to guess a word that has L in position 3 to test that.

But we don't have to put L in the same position. We can put L in a different position to test.

But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Let me list the constraints again:
- Word: S _ _ _ T
- L is in the word, but not at position 2 (from the second guess). So L must be at position 3 or 4.
- We have to avoid R, O, A, E, P.

We can try to guess a word that has L at position 3 and a new letter at position 4, and a new letter at position 2.

For example, ""SILKT"" is not a word. ""SILTY"" is 5 letters but ends with Y, not T.

""BUILT"" doesn't start with S.

Another word: ""GUILT"" doesn't start with S.

""WILT"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the only common word.

Another common word: ""SPLIT"" but P is ruled out.

""SLIPT"" has P.

What about ""STILT"" and ""STILL"", but ""STILL"" doesn't end with T.

I found: ""STILT"" is a word. Also, ""STILL"" is not, but ""STILT"" is.

We can also consider ""STINT"": but no L.

Or ""STUNT"": S T U N T. This has no L? But we need L. And U is new.

But no L, so invalid.

""STOUT"" has O and no L.

I think we should go with ""STILT"".

But let's check the feedback we would get if the word is ""STILT"":

- Position 1: S -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: T -> but we are guessing T at position 2? In ""STILT"", position 2 is T. But in our guess, we are putting T at position 2. We haven't tested T at position 2 before. The feedback for T in the first guess was only for position 5. In the second guess, only for position 5. So if we guess ""STILT"", then:
  - S at 1: ✓
  - T at 2: ? We don't know if it's correct or not? But if the word is ""STILT"", then T at 2 is correct, so we get ✓ for T at 2? But we also have T at 5, which is also ✓.

But the feedback for the second guess told us that L is present but not at 2, so if the word has T at 2, that's fine.

But in our guess ""STILT"", we are putting:
- S at 1: should be ✓
- T at 2: if the word has T at 2, then ✓; if not, then it might be x or -? But we don't know.

But we are guessing ""STILT"" as a candidate for the entire word.

If the word is ""STILT"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But what if the word is not ""STILT""? For example, if L is in position 3, and the word is something else.

But I cannot think of any other common word.

Another possibility: ""SILLY"" doesn't end with T.

Or ""SILKY"" doesn't end with T.

Perhaps ""STILT"" is the word.

To be thorough, let's consider if there is a word with L in position 4 and without T in position 2.

For example, ""SAINT"" has A and no L.

""SHIFT"" no L.

""SMITH"" no L.

""SNOUT"" has O and no L.

""SPOUT"" has P and O.

""SWIRL"" doesn't end with T.

I think ""STILT"" is the most likely.

So I will guess ""STILT"".

But note: in ""STILT"", we have two T's. We haven't tested T in position 2, so it's possible.

We can also consider ""STILL"", but it doesn't end with T.

Therefore, I choose ""STILT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(✓)  
  - **R, O, A** are absent from the secret word.  
  - **S** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""slept""** → S(✓), L(-), E(x), P(x), T(✓)  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - **L** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **E** and **P** are absent.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 5 (reconfirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **S** and ends with **T** (format: `S _ _ _ T`).  
2. **L** is in the word but must be in position 3 or 4 (since it's not in position 2).  
3. Absent letters: **R, O, A, E, P** (cannot appear in the word).  
4. We need to solve positions 2, 3, and 4, with one of them being **L** (position 3 or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **""STILT""** as a candidate:  
  - Fits the `S _ _ _ T` structure.  
  - Places **L** in position 4 (testing if it belongs there, as position 3 is also possible).  
  - Introduces **I** (a new vowel) and **T** in position 2 (untested position).  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm/reject **L** in position 4 and test **I**/**T** in position 2.",Guess 3: stilt -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
