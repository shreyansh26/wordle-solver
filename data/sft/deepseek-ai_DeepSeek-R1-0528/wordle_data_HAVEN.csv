We are at the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need an initial starting word.
 Common strategies often start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants.
 A recommended starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" since they have common letters.

 However, note that Wordle allows any valid English word. Let me choose a word that maximizes information gain.

 Considering different choices, I'll choose ""ROATE"" (a variant spelling, but acceptable) or ""SLATE"".

 But to be safe and use a very common word, let's choose ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, I can also choose ""SLATE"". Let me decide on ""CRANE"":

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). The vowels are common, and the consonants are reasonably common.

 So my first guess will be: ""CRANE""

For the first guess, I need a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Popular starting words often include letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, O. A strong choice is ""CRANE"" because it covers three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), allowing me to test multiple high-frequency letters. This helps narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"".

 In ""CRANE"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

 We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

 Since we have three confirmed letters (A, N, E) and two exclusions (C, R), we can try to form a new word that:
 - Includes A, N, E (each at least once, but note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have duplicates in the guess, so we'll assume the secret word has no duplicates for now).
 - Avoids C and R.

 Also, we must avoid placing A in position 3, N in position 4, and E in position 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We want to maximize information by trying new letters that we haven't tested yet. The remaining letters we haven't tested are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we also have to include A, N, E in the word, but in different positions.

 Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two new letters, and avoid positions 3 for A, 4 for N, and 5 for E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
 Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that places the known letters in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

 Let's try to form such a word.

 Example: 
  We can try putting A in position 1? But then we have to avoid position 3 for A, which is already satisfied. However, we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. Similarly for others.

 We can consider words like:
  ""ADIEU"" - but that has D, I, E, U and A. But note: we must include N as well? We know the word has N, so we cannot omit N.

 We must include A, N, and E.

 Let's think of words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

 Some possibilities:
  ""SANE?"" -> but S is new, and we have A, N, E. But in ""SANE"", the positions would be:
      S at 1, A at 2, N at 3, E at 4.
  However, we have constraints: 
      A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in our guess, A was in position 3 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So in ""SANE"", A is at 2 (which is allowed) and N is at 3 (which is allowed because the constraint for N is only that it cannot be at position 4) and E is at 4 (which is allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay). 

  But wait, we also have to avoid the positions we know they are not in? The feedback only tells us that in the first guess, A was not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5. They could be in other positions.

  However, we must also note that the word ""SANE"" has the letter S which we haven't tested. Also, it doesn't have C or R (which we know are excluded).

  But let's check the positions for A, N, E in ""SANE"":
      Position 1: S (new)
      Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, and this is a new position for A, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, and this is a new position for N, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 4: E (we know E is in the word, and this is a new position for E, so it might be correct or not)

  This word uses three of the known letters and one new letter (S). But we have only four letters? Actually, ""SANE"" is 5 letters? No, it's 4. So we need 5-letter words.

  We need 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

  Let's try ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.

  How about ""SNAKE""? 
      S, N, A, K, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions: 
          1: S (new)
          2: N (we know N is in the word, but in the first guess N was at position 4 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at 4)
          3: A (we know A is in the word, but in the first guess A was at 3 and now we put it at 3 again? But wait, the feedback said A was not at 3, so we cannot put A at 3 again. So this is invalid for position 3.

  Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3.

  In ""SNAKE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""NAIVE""? 
      N, A, I, V, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed because N was not at 4, but 1 is new)
          2: A (allowed because A was not at 3, and 2 is new)
          3: I (new)
          4: V (new)
          5: E (but we know E cannot be at 5? Because in the first guess E was at 5 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can put it at 5 to test? But the feedback already told us it's not at 5, so if we put it at 5 again, we know it will be a minus. But we want to use the E in a new position to see if it is at 5? Actually, we already know it's not at 5, so we should avoid putting it at 5 to save a position for a new letter? 

  However, we have to include E, and we have to put it in one of the positions 1,2,3,4 (because 5 is forbidden). So in ""NAIVE"", E is at 5 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we would get a minus for E again, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

  We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4). So we should avoid position 5 for E.

  Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is not ideal because E is at 5.

  How about ""ANVIL""? 
      A, N, V, I, L -> but missing E? We know the word has E, so we must include E.

  We must include E.

  How about ""LEARN""? -> but we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""PLANE""? 
      P, L, A, N, E -> 
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: L (new)
          3: A -> but we cannot put A at 3 (because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong). So invalid.

  How about ""PANEL""? 
      P, A, N, E, L
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: N (allowed, because not 4) -> but wait, we have to check: the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4? Yes, but 3 is allowed. However, we don't have a constraint for N at 3? Actually, the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, so 3 is a new position for N and allowed.
          4: E -> but we know E cannot be at 5? Actually, we can put E at 4? Yes, because the constraint for E is only that it cannot be at 5. Position 4 is allowed.
          5: L (new)

  This word ""PANEL"" has:
      P, A, N, E, L
      A is at 2 (new position), N at 3 (new position), E at 4 (new position). And we are testing two new letters: P and L.

  This seems good.

  But note: we are not required to put all known letters? Actually, we know the word has A, N, and E, so we must include them. And we are including them.

  Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have N. We must include N.

  Another option: ""SANDY"" -> 
      S, A, N, D, Y
      But missing E? We must include E.

  How about ""SENTA""? Not a common word. We need valid English words.

  Another idea: ""STAIN"" -> but missing E.

  We need a word with A, N, E.

  Let me list some words: 
      ""ANODE"", ""ATONE"", ""DAVEN"", ""EVADE"", ""MANED"", ""NAMED"", ""PANED"", ""PEAN"", ""WANED"", etc.

  But we have to avoid C and R.

  Consider ""ANODE"": 
      A, N, O, D, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: N (allowed) -> but note: we are putting N at 2, which is new.
          3: O (new)
          4: D (new)
          5: E -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5). So we get a minus for E again, which we already know.

  How about ""ATONE"":
      A, T, O, N, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: T (new)
          3: O (new)
          4: N -> but wait, we know N cannot be at 4? Because in the first guess N was at 4 and got a minus. So we cannot put N at 4. This is invalid.

  How about ""MANED"":
      M, A, N, E, D
      Positions:
          1: M (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: N -> but we are putting N at 3? That's allowed because the constraint is only for position 4. 
          4: E -> allowed (because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
          5: D (new)

  This word ""MANED"" has:
      M, A, N, E, D
      A at 2 (new), N at 3 (new), E at 4 (new). And we test M and D.

  This is a valid English word (meaning: having a mane).

  Alternatively, ""NAMED"":
      N, A, M, E, D
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed, because not 4)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: M (new)
          4: E (allowed, because not 5)
          5: D (new)

  This is also valid.

  But note: we have two options: ""MANED"" and ""NAMED"". Which one to choose?

  We want to maximize information. We don't know the positions of A, N, E. In ""MANED"", we are putting A at 2, N at 3, E at 4. In ""NAMED"", we are putting N at 1, A at 2, E at 4.

  We also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates.

  Both words test two new letters (M and D) and use the known letters in new positions.

  Another word: ""PAVED"" -> but that has V and D, but missing N? We need N.

  How about ""WAXEN""? 
      W, A, X, E, N
      Positions:
          1: W (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: X (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N -> but we know N cannot be at 4? Actually, the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4, but 5 is allowed. However, we have E at 4: that's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay.

  But note: we are putting N at 5? That's allowed because the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, but 5 is a new position.

  However, we have to check if ""WAXEN"" is a common word? It means made of wax, and it's acceptable.

  But we are testing X which is a less common letter. Maybe we should choose a word with more common letters.

  Considering common letters, let's try to use S, T, L, etc.

  How about ""STALE""? But we don't have N? We must include N.

  How about ""STANE""? Not a common word.

  How about ""SNARE""? But we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""SLANE""? Not common.

  How about ""LEANT""? 
      L, E, A, N, T
      Positions:
          1: L (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> but we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: A -> not allowed! Because we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess). So invalid.

  How about ""LATEN""? Not common.

  After considering, let's go with ""MANED"" or ""NAMED"". 

  I think ""NAMED"" is a more common word. Also, it tests N at position 1, which we haven't tested before.

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for the letters. For A, we avoid position 3; for N, avoid position 4; for E, avoid position 5.

  In ""NAMED"":
      N at 1: allowed (because we only know N is not at 4)
      A at 2: allowed (because we only know A is not at 3)
      M at 3: new
      E at 4: allowed (because we only know E is not at 5)
      D at 5: new

  This is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""PANED"" (if it's a word? It means having panes, like a window) but we don't have that in our vocabulary? 

  Another common word: ""ADIEU"" is not possible because it doesn't have N.

  Let me check: we must include A, N, E. So ""ADIEU"" is out.

  I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's also consider ""OAKEN"" (made of oak) -> 
      O, A, K, E, N
      Positions:
          1: O (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: K (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N (allowed) -> because N was not at 4, but 5 is new.

  This is also valid.

  However, we are testing O and K, which are common? 

  But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common consonants in English are T, S, L, etc. 

  How about ""TANGO""? -> but missing E.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that has two N's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it doesn't have E? Wait, ""SENNA"" has two N's and an E? 
      S, E, N, N, A -> but that's two N's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. The feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, we have no evidence. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

  How about ""STADE""? -> but missing N.

  How about ""STEAN""? Not common.

  How about ""MEAN""? Only 4 letters.

  After reconsideration, I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's see if we can include more common letters. The letters we haven't tested and are common: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

  We are testing M and D in ""NAMED"". M and D are moderately common.

  Another word: ""SALET"" (a historical word for a helmet) -> but missing N and E? We need both.

  How about ""SANE?"" -> too short.

  How about ""SNEAD""? (a surname) -> 
      S, N, E, A, D
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: N (allowed) -> but we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.
          3: E (new) -> but we are putting E at 3? That's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 3 is okay.
          4: A -> but we know A cannot be at 3? Actually, we can put A at 4? There is no constraint for A at 4. The constraint is only for position 3. So allowed.
          5: D (new)

  This word ""SNEAD"" has S, N, E, A, D. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  But note: we are putting A at position 4? That's allowed. And we are putting E at 3? That's allowed.

  However, we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.

  This word tests two common letters: S and D.

  But is ""SNEAD"" a valid word? It is a proper noun (golfer) but sometimes Wordle accepts proper nouns? Actually, the original Wordle uses common words, and SNEAD might be accepted? But to be safe, we should use more common words.

  How about ""SEDAN""? 
      S, E, D, A, N
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> and we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: D (new)
          4: A (allowed, because not 3) -> 4 is new for A.
          5: N (allowed, because not 4) -> 5 is new for N.

  This word ""SEDAN"" is a common word. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  And it places the known letters in all new positions: 
      E at 2 (was at 5 in first guess, now 2)
      A at 4 (was at 3, now 4)
      N at 5 (was at 4, now 5)

  This is ideal because we are testing all known letters in positions that we haven't tried before.

  Therefore, I choose ""SEDAN"".

  Let me confirm the constraints:
      A: was at 3 (wrong), now at 4 -> allowed.
      N: was at 4 (wrong), now at 5 -> allowed.
      E: was at 5 (wrong), now at 2 -> allowed.

  And we are testing two new common letters: S and D.

  Also, we avoid C and R.

  So, the next guess: ""SEDAN""

  We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

  But note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more tries.

  Therefore, I will guess ""SEDAN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are not in the secret word (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), meaning:
  - A is not in position 3.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoids C and R (excluded letters).
- Places A, N, and E in new positions (A not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""SEDAN"" fits perfectly:
- Contains A, N, and E.
- Uses new letters S and D (common consonants).
- Positions:
  - S (new) at position 1.
  - E at position 2 (new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - D (new) at position 3.
  - A at position 4 (new position for A, avoiding position 3).
  - N at position 5 (new position for N, avoiding position 4).

This guess tests all known letters in untried positions and introduces two new letters, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SEDAN</guess>",SEDAN,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"".

 In ""CRANE"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

 We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

 Since we have three confirmed letters (A, N, E) and two exclusions (C, R), we can try to form a new word that:
 - Includes A, N, E (each at least once, but note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have duplicates in the guess, so we'll assume the secret word has no duplicates for now).
 - Avoids C and R.

 Also, we must avoid placing A in position 3, N in position 4, and E in position 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We want to maximize information by trying new letters that we haven't tested yet. The remaining letters we haven't tested are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we also have to include A, N, E in the word, but in different positions.

 Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two new letters, and avoid positions 3 for A, 4 for N, and 5 for E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
 Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that places the known letters in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

 Let's try to form such a word.

 Example: 
  We can try putting A in position 1? But then we have to avoid position 3 for A, which is already satisfied. However, we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. Similarly for others.

 We can consider words like:
  ""ADIEU"" - but that has D, I, E, U and A. But note: we must include N as well? We know the word has N, so we cannot omit N.

 We must include A, N, and E.

 Let's think of words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

 Some possibilities:
  ""SANE?"" -> but S is new, and we have A, N, E. But in ""SANE"", the positions would be:
      S at 1, A at 2, N at 3, E at 4.
  However, we have constraints: 
      A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in our guess, A was in position 3 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So in ""SANE"", A is at 2 (which is allowed) and N is at 3 (which is allowed because the constraint for N is only that it cannot be at position 4) and E is at 4 (which is allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay). 

  But wait, we also have to avoid the positions we know they are not in? The feedback only tells us that in the first guess, A was not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5. They could be in other positions.

  However, we must also note that the word ""SANE"" has the letter S which we haven't tested. Also, it doesn't have C or R (which we know are excluded).

  But let's check the positions for A, N, E in ""SANE"":
      Position 1: S (new)
      Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, and this is a new position for A, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, and this is a new position for N, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 4: E (we know E is in the word, and this is a new position for E, so it might be correct or not)

  This word uses three of the known letters and one new letter (S). But we have only four letters? Actually, ""SANE"" is 5 letters? No, it's 4. So we need 5-letter words.

  We need 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

  Let's try ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.

  How about ""SNAKE""? 
      S, N, A, K, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions: 
          1: S (new)
          2: N (we know N is in the word, but in the first guess N was at position 4 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at 4)
          3: A (we know A is in the word, but in the first guess A was at 3 and now we put it at 3 again? But wait, the feedback said A was not at 3, so we cannot put A at 3 again. So this is invalid for position 3.

  Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3.

  In ""SNAKE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""NAIVE""? 
      N, A, I, V, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed because N was not at 4, but 1 is new)
          2: A (allowed because A was not at 3, and 2 is new)
          3: I (new)
          4: V (new)
          5: E (but we know E cannot be at 5? Because in the first guess E was at 5 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can put it at 5 to test? But the feedback already told us it's not at 5, so if we put it at 5 again, we know it will be a minus. But we want to use the E in a new position to see if it is at 5? Actually, we already know it's not at 5, so we should avoid putting it at 5 to save a position for a new letter? 

  However, we have to include E, and we have to put it in one of the positions 1,2,3,4 (because 5 is forbidden). So in ""NAIVE"", E is at 5 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we would get a minus for E again, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

  We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4). So we should avoid position 5 for E.

  Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is not ideal because E is at 5.

  How about ""ANVIL""? 
      A, N, V, I, L -> but missing E? We know the word has E, so we must include E.

  We must include E.

  How about ""LEARN""? -> but we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""PLANE""? 
      P, L, A, N, E -> 
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: L (new)
          3: A -> but we cannot put A at 3 (because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong). So invalid.

  How about ""PANEL""? 
      P, A, N, E, L
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: N (allowed, because not 4) -> but wait, we have to check: the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4? Yes, but 3 is allowed. However, we don't have a constraint for N at 3? Actually, the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, so 3 is a new position for N and allowed.
          4: E -> but we know E cannot be at 5? Actually, we can put E at 4? Yes, because the constraint for E is only that it cannot be at 5. Position 4 is allowed.
          5: L (new)

  This word ""PANEL"" has:
      P, A, N, E, L
      A is at 2 (new position), N at 3 (new position), E at 4 (new position). And we are testing two new letters: P and L.

  This seems good.

  But note: we are not required to put all known letters? Actually, we know the word has A, N, and E, so we must include them. And we are including them.

  Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have N. We must include N.

  Another option: ""SANDY"" -> 
      S, A, N, D, Y
      But missing E? We must include E.

  How about ""SENTA""? Not a common word. We need valid English words.

  Another idea: ""STAIN"" -> but missing E.

  We need a word with A, N, E.

  Let me list some words: 
      ""ANODE"", ""ATONE"", ""DAVEN"", ""EVADE"", ""MANED"", ""NAMED"", ""PANED"", ""PEAN"", ""WANED"", etc.

  But we have to avoid C and R.

  Consider ""ANODE"": 
      A, N, O, D, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: N (allowed) -> but note: we are putting N at 2, which is new.
          3: O (new)
          4: D (new)
          5: E -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5). So we get a minus for E again, which we already know.

  How about ""ATONE"":
      A, T, O, N, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: T (new)
          3: O (new)
          4: N -> but wait, we know N cannot be at 4? Because in the first guess N was at 4 and got a minus. So we cannot put N at 4. This is invalid.

  How about ""MANED"":
      M, A, N, E, D
      Positions:
          1: M (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: N -> but we are putting N at 3? That's allowed because the constraint is only for position 4. 
          4: E -> allowed (because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
          5: D (new)

  This word ""MANED"" has:
      M, A, N, E, D
      A at 2 (new), N at 3 (new), E at 4 (new). And we test M and D.

  This is a valid English word (meaning: having a mane).

  Alternatively, ""NAMED"":
      N, A, M, E, D
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed, because not 4)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: M (new)
          4: E (allowed, because not 5)
          5: D (new)

  This is also valid.

  But note: we have two options: ""MANED"" and ""NAMED"". Which one to choose?

  We want to maximize information. We don't know the positions of A, N, E. In ""MANED"", we are putting A at 2, N at 3, E at 4. In ""NAMED"", we are putting N at 1, A at 2, E at 4.

  We also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates.

  Both words test two new letters (M and D) and use the known letters in new positions.

  Another word: ""PAVED"" -> but that has V and D, but missing N? We need N.

  How about ""WAXEN""? 
      W, A, X, E, N
      Positions:
          1: W (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: X (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N -> but we know N cannot be at 4? Actually, the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4, but 5 is allowed. However, we have E at 4: that's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay.

  But note: we are putting N at 5? That's allowed because the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, but 5 is a new position.

  However, we have to check if ""WAXEN"" is a common word? It means made of wax, and it's acceptable.

  But we are testing X which is a less common letter. Maybe we should choose a word with more common letters.

  Considering common letters, let's try to use S, T, L, etc.

  How about ""STALE""? But we don't have N? We must include N.

  How about ""STANE""? Not a common word.

  How about ""SNARE""? But we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""SLANE""? Not common.

  How about ""LEANT""? 
      L, E, A, N, T
      Positions:
          1: L (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> but we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: A -> not allowed! Because we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess). So invalid.

  How about ""LATEN""? Not common.

  After considering, let's go with ""MANED"" or ""NAMED"". 

  I think ""NAMED"" is a more common word. Also, it tests N at position 1, which we haven't tested before.

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for the letters. For A, we avoid position 3; for N, avoid position 4; for E, avoid position 5.

  In ""NAMED"":
      N at 1: allowed (because we only know N is not at 4)
      A at 2: allowed (because we only know A is not at 3)
      M at 3: new
      E at 4: allowed (because we only know E is not at 5)
      D at 5: new

  This is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""PANED"" (if it's a word? It means having panes, like a window) but we don't have that in our vocabulary? 

  Another common word: ""ADIEU"" is not possible because it doesn't have N.

  Let me check: we must include A, N, E. So ""ADIEU"" is out.

  I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's also consider ""OAKEN"" (made of oak) -> 
      O, A, K, E, N
      Positions:
          1: O (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: K (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N (allowed) -> because N was not at 4, but 5 is new.

  This is also valid.

  However, we are testing O and K, which are common? 

  But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common consonants in English are T, S, L, etc. 

  How about ""TANGO""? -> but missing E.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that has two N's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it doesn't have E? Wait, ""SENNA"" has two N's and an E? 
      S, E, N, N, A -> but that's two N's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. The feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, we have no evidence. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

  How about ""STADE""? -> but missing N.

  How about ""STEAN""? Not common.

  How about ""MEAN""? Only 4 letters.

  After reconsideration, I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's see if we can include more common letters. The letters we haven't tested and are common: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

  We are testing M and D in ""NAMED"". M and D are moderately common.

  Another word: ""SALET"" (a historical word for a helmet) -> but missing N and E? We need both.

  How about ""SANE?"" -> too short.

  How about ""SNEAD""? (a surname) -> 
      S, N, E, A, D
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: N (allowed) -> but we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.
          3: E (new) -> but we are putting E at 3? That's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 3 is okay.
          4: A -> but we know A cannot be at 3? Actually, we can put A at 4? There is no constraint for A at 4. The constraint is only for position 3. So allowed.
          5: D (new)

  This word ""SNEAD"" has S, N, E, A, D. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  But note: we are putting A at position 4? That's allowed. And we are putting E at 3? That's allowed.

  However, we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.

  This word tests two common letters: S and D.

  But is ""SNEAD"" a valid word? It is a proper noun (golfer) but sometimes Wordle accepts proper nouns? Actually, the original Wordle uses common words, and SNEAD might be accepted? But to be safe, we should use more common words.

  How about ""SEDAN""? 
      S, E, D, A, N
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> and we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: D (new)
          4: A (allowed, because not 3) -> 4 is new for A.
          5: N (allowed, because not 4) -> 5 is new for N.

  This word ""SEDAN"" is a common word. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  And it places the known letters in all new positions: 
      E at 2 (was at 5 in first guess, now 2)
      A at 4 (was at 3, now 4)
      N at 5 (was at 4, now 5)

  This is ideal because we are testing all known letters in positions that we haven't tried before.

  Therefore, I choose ""SEDAN"".

  Let me confirm the constraints:
      A: was at 3 (wrong), now at 4 -> allowed.
      N: was at 4 (wrong), now at 5 -> allowed.
      E: was at 5 (wrong), now at 2 -> allowed.

  And we are testing two new common letters: S and D.

  Also, we avoid C and R.

  So, the next guess: ""SEDAN""

  We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

  But note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more tries.

  Therefore, I will guess ""SEDAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are not in the secret word (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), meaning:
  - A is not in position 3.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoids C and R (excluded letters).
- Places A, N, and E in new positions (A not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""SEDAN"" fits perfectly:
- Contains A, N, and E.
- Uses new letters S and D (common consonants).
- Positions:
  - S (new) at position 1.
  - E at position 2 (new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - D (new) at position 3.
  - A at position 4 (new position for A, avoiding position 3).
  - N at position 5 (new position for N, avoiding position 4).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,HAVEN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need an initial starting word.
 Common strategies often start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants.
 A recommended starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" since they have common letters.

 However, note that Wordle allows any valid English word. Let me choose a word that maximizes information gain.

 Considering different choices, I'll choose ""ROATE"" (a variant spelling, but acceptable) or ""SLATE"".

 But to be safe and use a very common word, let's choose ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, I can also choose ""SLATE"". Let me decide on ""CRANE"":

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). The vowels are common, and the consonants are reasonably common.

 So my first guess will be: ""CRANE""

 Format: <guess>CRANE</guess>For the first guess, I need a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Popular starting words often include letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, O. A strong choice is ""CRANE"" because it covers three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), allowing me to test multiple high-frequency letters. This helps narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"".

 In ""CRANE"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

 We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

 Since we have three confirmed letters (A, N, E) and two exclusions (C, R), we can try to form a new word that:
 - Includes A, N, E (each at least once, but note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have duplicates in the guess, so we'll assume the secret word has no duplicates for now).
 - Avoids C and R.

 Also, we must avoid placing A in position 3, N in position 4, and E in position 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We want to maximize information by trying new letters that we haven't tested yet. The remaining letters we haven't tested are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we also have to include A, N, E in the word, but in different positions.

 Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two new letters, and avoid positions 3 for A, 4 for N, and 5 for E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
 Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that places the known letters in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

 Let's try to form such a word.

 Example: 
  We can try putting A in position 1? But then we have to avoid position 3 for A, which is already satisfied. However, we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. Similarly for others.

 We can consider words like:
  ""ADIEU"" - but that has D, I, E, U and A. But note: we must include N as well? We know the word has N, so we cannot omit N.

 We must include A, N, and E.

 Let's think of words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

 Some possibilities:
  ""SANE?"" -> but S is new, and we have A, N, E. But in ""SANE"", the positions would be:
      S at 1, A at 2, N at 3, E at 4.
  However, we have constraints: 
      A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in our guess, A was in position 3 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So in ""SANE"", A is at 2 (which is allowed) and N is at 3 (which is allowed because the constraint for N is only that it cannot be at position 4) and E is at 4 (which is allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay). 

  But wait, we also have to avoid the positions we know they are not in? The feedback only tells us that in the first guess, A was not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5. They could be in other positions.

  However, we must also note that the word ""SANE"" has the letter S which we haven't tested. Also, it doesn't have C or R (which we know are excluded).

  But let's check the positions for A, N, E in ""SANE"":
      Position 1: S (new)
      Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, and this is a new position for A, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, and this is a new position for N, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 4: E (we know E is in the word, and this is a new position for E, so it might be correct or not)

  This word uses three of the known letters and one new letter (S). But we have only four letters? Actually, ""SANE"" is 5 letters? No, it's 4. So we need 5-letter words.

  We need 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

  Let's try ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.

  How about ""SNAKE""? 
      S, N, A, K, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions: 
          1: S (new)
          2: N (we know N is in the word, but in the first guess N was at position 4 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at 4)
          3: A (we know A is in the word, but in the first guess A was at 3 and now we put it at 3 again? But wait, the feedback said A was not at 3, so we cannot put A at 3 again. So this is invalid for position 3.

  Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3.

  In ""SNAKE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""NAIVE""? 
      N, A, I, V, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed because N was not at 4, but 1 is new)
          2: A (allowed because A was not at 3, and 2 is new)
          3: I (new)
          4: V (new)
          5: E (but we know E cannot be at 5? Because in the first guess E was at 5 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can put it at 5 to test? But the feedback already told us it's not at 5, so if we put it at 5 again, we know it will be a minus. But we want to use the E in a new position to see if it is at 5? Actually, we already know it's not at 5, so we should avoid putting it at 5 to save a position for a new letter? 

  However, we have to include E, and we have to put it in one of the positions 1,2,3,4 (because 5 is forbidden). So in ""NAIVE"", E is at 5 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we would get a minus for E again, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

  We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4). So we should avoid position 5 for E.

  Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is not ideal because E is at 5.

  How about ""ANVIL""? 
      A, N, V, I, L -> but missing E? We know the word has E, so we must include E.

  We must include E.

  How about ""LEARN""? -> but we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""PLANE""? 
      P, L, A, N, E -> 
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: L (new)
          3: A -> but we cannot put A at 3 (because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong). So invalid.

  How about ""PANEL""? 
      P, A, N, E, L
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: N (allowed, because not 4) -> but wait, we have to check: the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4? Yes, but 3 is allowed. However, we don't have a constraint for N at 3? Actually, the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, so 3 is a new position for N and allowed.
          4: E -> but we know E cannot be at 5? Actually, we can put E at 4? Yes, because the constraint for E is only that it cannot be at 5. Position 4 is allowed.
          5: L (new)

  This word ""PANEL"" has:
      P, A, N, E, L
      A is at 2 (new position), N at 3 (new position), E at 4 (new position). And we are testing two new letters: P and L.

  This seems good.

  But note: we are not required to put all known letters? Actually, we know the word has A, N, and E, so we must include them. And we are including them.

  Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have N. We must include N.

  Another option: ""SANDY"" -> 
      S, A, N, D, Y
      But missing E? We must include E.

  How about ""SENTA""? Not a common word. We need valid English words.

  Another idea: ""STAIN"" -> but missing E.

  We need a word with A, N, E.

  Let me list some words: 
      ""ANODE"", ""ATONE"", ""DAVEN"", ""EVADE"", ""MANED"", ""NAMED"", ""PANED"", ""PEAN"", ""WANED"", etc.

  But we have to avoid C and R.

  Consider ""ANODE"": 
      A, N, O, D, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: N (allowed) -> but note: we are putting N at 2, which is new.
          3: O (new)
          4: D (new)
          5: E -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5). So we get a minus for E again, which we already know.

  How about ""ATONE"":
      A, T, O, N, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: T (new)
          3: O (new)
          4: N -> but wait, we know N cannot be at 4? Because in the first guess N was at 4 and got a minus. So we cannot put N at 4. This is invalid.

  How about ""MANED"":
      M, A, N, E, D
      Positions:
          1: M (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: N -> but we are putting N at 3? That's allowed because the constraint is only for position 4. 
          4: E -> allowed (because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
          5: D (new)

  This word ""MANED"" has:
      M, A, N, E, D
      A at 2 (new), N at 3 (new), E at 4 (new). And we test M and D.

  This is a valid English word (meaning: having a mane).

  Alternatively, ""NAMED"":
      N, A, M, E, D
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed, because not 4)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: M (new)
          4: E (allowed, because not 5)
          5: D (new)

  This is also valid.

  But note: we have two options: ""MANED"" and ""NAMED"". Which one to choose?

  We want to maximize information. We don't know the positions of A, N, E. In ""MANED"", we are putting A at 2, N at 3, E at 4. In ""NAMED"", we are putting N at 1, A at 2, E at 4.

  We also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates.

  Both words test two new letters (M and D) and use the known letters in new positions.

  Another word: ""PAVED"" -> but that has V and D, but missing N? We need N.

  How about ""WAXEN""? 
      W, A, X, E, N
      Positions:
          1: W (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: X (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N -> but we know N cannot be at 4? Actually, the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4, but 5 is allowed. However, we have E at 4: that's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay.

  But note: we are putting N at 5? That's allowed because the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, but 5 is a new position.

  However, we have to check if ""WAXEN"" is a common word? It means made of wax, and it's acceptable.

  But we are testing X which is a less common letter. Maybe we should choose a word with more common letters.

  Considering common letters, let's try to use S, T, L, etc.

  How about ""STALE""? But we don't have N? We must include N.

  How about ""STANE""? Not a common word.

  How about ""SNARE""? But we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""SLANE""? Not common.

  How about ""LEANT""? 
      L, E, A, N, T
      Positions:
          1: L (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> but we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: A -> not allowed! Because we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess). So invalid.

  How about ""LATEN""? Not common.

  After considering, let's go with ""MANED"" or ""NAMED"". 

  I think ""NAMED"" is a more common word. Also, it tests N at position 1, which we haven't tested before.

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for the letters. For A, we avoid position 3; for N, avoid position 4; for E, avoid position 5.

  In ""NAMED"":
      N at 1: allowed (because we only know N is not at 4)
      A at 2: allowed (because we only know A is not at 3)
      M at 3: new
      E at 4: allowed (because we only know E is not at 5)
      D at 5: new

  This is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""PANED"" (if it's a word? It means having panes, like a window) but we don't have that in our vocabulary? 

  Another common word: ""ADIEU"" is not possible because it doesn't have N.

  Let me check: we must include A, N, E. So ""ADIEU"" is out.

  I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's also consider ""OAKEN"" (made of oak) -> 
      O, A, K, E, N
      Positions:
          1: O (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: K (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N (allowed) -> because N was not at 4, but 5 is new.

  This is also valid.

  However, we are testing O and K, which are common? 

  But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common consonants in English are T, S, L, etc. 

  How about ""TANGO""? -> but missing E.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that has two N's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it doesn't have E? Wait, ""SENNA"" has two N's and an E? 
      S, E, N, N, A -> but that's two N's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. The feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, we have no evidence. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

  How about ""STADE""? -> but missing N.

  How about ""STEAN""? Not common.

  How about ""MEAN""? Only 4 letters.

  After reconsideration, I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's see if we can include more common letters. The letters we haven't tested and are common: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

  We are testing M and D in ""NAMED"". M and D are moderately common.

  Another word: ""SALET"" (a historical word for a helmet) -> but missing N and E? We need both.

  How about ""SANE?"" -> too short.

  How about ""SNEAD""? (a surname) -> 
      S, N, E, A, D
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: N (allowed) -> but we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.
          3: E (new) -> but we are putting E at 3? That's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 3 is okay.
          4: A -> but we know A cannot be at 3? Actually, we can put A at 4? There is no constraint for A at 4. The constraint is only for position 3. So allowed.
          5: D (new)

  This word ""SNEAD"" has S, N, E, A, D. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  But note: we are putting A at position 4? That's allowed. And we are putting E at 3? That's allowed.

  However, we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.

  This word tests two common letters: S and D.

  But is ""SNEAD"" a valid word? It is a proper noun (golfer) but sometimes Wordle accepts proper nouns? Actually, the original Wordle uses common words, and SNEAD might be accepted? But to be safe, we should use more common words.

  How about ""SEDAN""? 
      S, E, D, A, N
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> and we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: D (new)
          4: A (allowed, because not 3) -> 4 is new for A.
          5: N (allowed, because not 4) -> 5 is new for N.

  This word ""SEDAN"" is a common word. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  And it places the known letters in all new positions: 
      E at 2 (was at 5 in first guess, now 2)
      A at 4 (was at 3, now 4)
      N at 5 (was at 4, now 5)

  This is ideal because we are testing all known letters in positions that we haven't tried before.

  Therefore, I choose ""SEDAN"".

  Let me confirm the constraints:
      A: was at 3 (wrong), now at 4 -> allowed.
      N: was at 4 (wrong), now at 5 -> allowed.
      E: was at 5 (wrong), now at 2 -> allowed.

  And we are testing two new common letters: S and D.

  Also, we avoid C and R.

  So, the next guess: ""SEDAN""

  We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

  But note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more tries.

  Therefore, I will guess ""SEDAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are not in the secret word (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), meaning:
  - A is not in position 3.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoids C and R (excluded letters).
- Places A, N, and E in new positions (A not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""SEDAN"" fits perfectly:
- Contains A, N, and E.
- Uses new letters S and D (common consonants).
- Positions:
  - S (new) at position 1.
  - E at position 2 (new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - D (new) at position 3.
  - A at position 4 (new position for A, avoiding position 3).
  - N at position 5 (new position for N, avoiding position 4).

This guess tests all known letters in untried positions and introduces two new letters, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

So we need 5-letter words.\n\n  We need 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.\n\n  Let\'s try ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.\n\n  How about ""SNAKE""? \n      S, N, A, K, E -> 5 letters.\n      Positions: \n          1: S (new)\n          2: N (we know N is in the word, but in the first guess N was at position 4 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at 4)\n          3: A (we know A is in the word, but in the first guess A was at 3 and now we put it at 3 again? But wait, the feedback said A was not at 3, so we cannot put A at 3 again. So this is invalid for position 3.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n  In ""SNAKE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n  How about ""NAIVE""? \n      N, A, I, V, E -> 5 letters.\n      Positions:\n          1: N (allowed because N was not at 4, but 1 is new)\n          2: A (allowed because A was not at 3, and 2 is new)\n          3: I (new)\n          4: V (new)\n          5: E (but we know E cannot be at 5? Because in the first guess E was at 5 and got a minus, meaning it\'s in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can put it at 5 to test? But the feedback already told us it\'s not at 5, so if we put it at 5 again, we know it will be a minus. But we want to use the E in a new position to see if it is at 5? Actually, we already know it\'s not at 5, so we should avoid putting it at 5 to save a position for a new letter? \n\n  However, we have to include E, and we have to put it in one of the positions 1,2,3,4 (because 5 is forbidden). So in ""NAIVE"", E is at 5 -> that\'s the same as before and we know it\'s wrong. So we would get a minus for E again, which we already know. That doesn\'t give new information.\n\n  We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4). So we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\n  Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is not ideal because E is at 5.\n\n  How about ""ANVIL""? \n      A, N, V, I, L -> but missing E? We know the word has E, so we must include E.\n\n  We must include E.\n\n  How about ""LEARN""? -> but we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.\n\n  How about ""PLANE""? \n      P, L, A, N, E -> \n      Positions:\n          1: P (new)\n          2: L (new)\n          3: A -> but we cannot put A at 3 (because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong). So invalid.\n\n  How about ""PANEL""? \n      P, A, N, E, L\n      Positions:\n          1: P (new)\n          2: A (allowed, because not 3)\n          3: N (allowed, because not 4) -> but wait, we have to check: the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4? Yes, but 3 is allowed. However, we don\'t have a constraint for N at 3? Actually, the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, so 3 is a new position for N and allowed.\n          4: E -> but we know E cannot be at 5? Actually, we can put E at 4? Yes, because the constraint for E is only that it cannot be at 5. Position 4 is allowed.\n          5: L (new)\n\n  This word ""PANEL"" has:\n      P, A, N, E, L\n      A is at 2 (new position), N at 3 (new position), E at 4 (new position). And we are testing two new letters: P and L.\n\n  This seems good.\n\n  But note: we are not required to put all known letters? Actually, we know the word has A, N, and E, so we must include them. And we are including them.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn\'t have N. We must include N.\n\n  Another option: ""SANDY"" -> \n      S, A, N, D, Y\n      But missing E? We must include E.\n\n  How about ""SENTA""? Not a common word. We need valid English words.\n\n  Another idea: ""STAIN"" -> but missing E.\n\n  We need a word with A, N, E.\n\n  Let me list some words: \n      ""ANODE"", ""ATONE"", ""DAVEN"", ""EVADE"", ""MANED"", ""NAMED"", ""PANED"", ""PEAN"", ""WANED"", etc.\n\n  But we have to avoid C and R.\n\n  Consider ""ANODE"": \n      A, N, O, D, E\n      Positions:\n          1: A (allowed)\n          2: N (allowed) -> but note: we are putting N at 2, which is new.\n          3: O (new)\n          4: D (new)\n          5: E -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5). So we get a minus for E again, which we already know.\n\n  How about ""ATONE"":\n      A, T, O, N, E\n      Positions:\n          1: A (allowed)\n          2: T (new)\n          3: O (new)\n          4: N -> but wait, we know N cannot be at 4? Because in the first guess N was at 4 and got a minus. So we cannot put N at 4. This is invalid.\n\n  How about ""MANED"":\n      M, A, N, E, D\n      Positions:\n          1: M (new)\n          2: A (allowed)\n          3: N -> but we are putting N at 3? That\'s allowed because the constraint is only for position 4. \n          4: E -> allowed (because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)\n          5: D (new)\n\n  This word ""MANED"" has:\n      M, A, N, E, D\n      A at 2 (new), N at 3 (new), E at 4 (new). And we test M and D.\n\n  This is a valid English word (meaning: having a mane).\n\n  Alternatively, ""NAMED"":\n      N, A, M, E, D\n      Positions:\n          1: N (allowed, because not 4)\n          2: A (allowed, because not 3)\n          3: M (new)\n          4: E (allowed, because not 5)\n          5: D (new)\n\n  This is also valid.\n\n  But note: we have two options: ""MANED"" and ""NAMED"". Which one to choose?\n\n  We want to maximize information. We don\'t know the positions of A, N, E. In ""MANED"", we are putting A at 2, N at 3, E at 4. In ""NAMED"", we are putting N at 1, A at 2, E at 4.\n\n  We also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates.\n\n  Both words test two new letters (M and D) and use the known letters in new positions.\n\n  Another word: ""PAVED"" -> but that has V and D, but missing N? We need N.\n\n  How about ""WAXEN""? \n      W, A, X, E, N\n      Positions:\n          1: W (new)\n          2: A (allowed)\n          3: X (new)\n          4: E (allowed)\n          5: N -> but we know N cannot be at 4? Actually, the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4, but 5 is allowed. However, we have E at 4: that\'s allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay.\n\n  But note: we are putting N at 5? That\'s allowed because the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, but 5 is a new position.\n\n  However, we have to check if ""WAXEN"" is a common word? It means made of wax, and it\'s acceptable.\n\n  But we are testing X which is a less common letter. Maybe we should choose a word with more common letters.\n\n  Considering common letters, let\'s try to use S, T, L, etc.\n\n  How about ""STALE""? But we don\'t have N? We must include N.\n\n  How about ""STANE""? Not a common word.\n\n  How about ""SNARE""? But we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.\n\n  How about ""SLANE""? Not common.\n\n  How about ""LEANT""? \n      L, E, A, N, T\n      Positions:\n          1: L (new)\n          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> but we are putting E at 2, which is new.\n          3: A -> not allowed! Because we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess). So invalid.\n\n  How about ""LATEN""? Not common.\n\n  After considering, let\'s go with ""MANED"" or ""NAMED"". \n\n  I think ""NAMED"" is a more common word. Also, it tests N at position 1, which we haven\'t tested before.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for the letters. For A, we avoid position 3; for N, avoid position 4; for E, avoid position 5.\n\n  In ""NAMED"":\n      N at 1: allowed (because we only know N is not at 4)\n      A at 2: allowed (because we only know A is not at 3)\n      M at 3: new\n      E at 4: allowed (because we only know E is not at 5)\n      D at 5: new\n\n  This is valid.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose ""PANED"" (if it\'s a word? It means having panes, like a window) but we don\'t have that in our vocabulary? \n\n  Another common word: ""ADIEU"" is not possible because it doesn\'t have N.\n\n  Let me check: we must include A, N, E. So ""ADIEU"" is out.\n\n  I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.\n\n  But let\'s also consider ""OAKEN"" (made of oak) -> \n      O, A, K, E, N\n      Positions:\n          1: O (new)\n          2: A (allowed)\n          3: K (new)\n          4: E (allowed)\n          5: N (allowed) -> because N was not at 4, but 5 is new.\n\n  This is also valid.\n\n  However, we are testing O and K, which are common? \n\n  But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common consonants in English are T, S, L, etc. \n\n  How about ""TANGO""? -> but missing E.\n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that has two N\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it doesn\'t have E? Wait, ""SENNA"" has two N\'s and an E? \n      S, E, N, N, A -> but that\'s two N\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. The feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, we have no evidence. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.\n\n  How about ""STADE""? -> but missing N.\n\n  How about ""STEAN""? Not common.\n\n  How about ""MEAN""? Only 4 letters.\n\n  After reconsideration, I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.\n\n  But let\'s see if we can include more common letters. The letters we haven\'t tested and are common: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.\n\n  We are testing M and D in ""NAMED"". M and D are moderately common.\n\n  Another word: ""SALET"" (a historical word for a helmet) -> but missing N and E? We need both.\n\n  How about ""SANE?"" -> too short.\n\n  How about ""SNEAD""? (a surname) -> \n      S, N, E, A, D\n      Positions:\n          1: S (new)\n          2: N (allowed) -> but we are putting N at 2? That\'s allowed.\n          3: E (new) -> but we are putting E at 3? That\'s allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 3 is okay.\n          4: A -> but we know A cannot be at 3? Actually, we can put A at 4? There is no constraint for A at 4. The constraint is only for position 3. So allowed.\n          5: D (new)\n\n  This word ""SNEAD"" has S, N, E, A, D. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.\n\n  But note: we are putting A at position 4? That\'s allowed. And we are putting E at 3? That\'s allowed.\n\n  However, we are putting N at 2? That\'s allowed.\n\n  This word tests two common letters: S and D.\n\n  But is ""SNEAD"" a valid word? It is a proper noun (golfer) but sometimes Wordle accepts proper nouns? Actually, the original Wordle uses common words, and SNEAD might be accepted? But to be safe, we should use more common words.\n\n  How about ""SEDAN""? \n      S, E, D, A, N\n      Positions:\n          1: S (new)\n          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> and we are putting E at 2, which is new.\n          3: D (new)\n          4: A (allowed, because not 3) -> 4 is new for A.\n          5: N (allowed, because not 4) -> 5 is new for N.\n\n  This word ""SEDAN"" is a common word. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.\n\n  And it places the known letters in all new positions: \n      E at 2 (was at 5 in first guess, now 2)\n      A at 4 (was at 3, now 4)\n      N at 5 (was at 4, now 5)\n\n  This is ideal because we are testing all known letters in positions that we haven\'t tried before.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""SEDAN"".\n\n  Let me confirm the constraints:\n      A: was at 3 (wrong), now at 4 -> allowed.\n      N: was at 4 (wrong), now at 5 -> allowed.\n      E: was at 5 (wrong), now at 2 -> allowed.\n\n  And we are testing two new common letters: S and D.\n\n  Also, we avoid C and R.\n\n  So, the next guess: ""SEDAN""\n\n  We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n  But note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more tries.\n\n  Therefore, I will guess ""SEDAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C and R are not in the secret word (x).\n- A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), meaning:\n  - A is not in position 3.\n  - N is not in position 4.\n  - E is not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes A, N, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoids C and R (excluded letters).\n- Places A, N, and E in new positions (A not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""SEDAN"" fits perfectly:\n- Contains A, N, and E.\n- Uses new letters S and D (common consonants).\n- Positions:\n  - S (new) at position 1.\n  - E at position 2 (new position for E, avoiding position 5).\n  - D (new) at position 3.\n  - A at position 4 (new position for A, avoiding position 3).\n  - N at position 5 (new position for N, avoiding position 4).\n\nThis guess tests all known letters in untried positions and introduces two new letters, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>SEDAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: SEDAN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) D(x) A(-) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Second guess: SEDAN
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- N: ✓ (in the word and at position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and is at position 5 (from SEDAN: N is correct at position 5).

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from SEDAN).
   - E: present, but not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 2 (from SEDAN).

3. Letters not in the word:
   - C, R (from CRANE)
   - S, D (from SEDAN)

So the secret word has:
- A, E, and N (with N at position 5).
- We know N is at position 5, so the word ends with N.

The word structure: _ _ _ _ N

We know A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3,4 for A (and also not at 5 because that's N) and not at positions 2,5 for E (and position 5 is taken by N, so E cannot be there anyway).

Possible positions for A: since it cannot be at 3 or 4, and 5 is N, so A must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, for E: it cannot be at 2 or 5, and 5 is taken by N, so E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 and 2 are the only ones left for A? Actually, the positions are 1,2,3,4. We have:

- Position 5: N (fixed)

So the first four positions are open for A, E, and two other letters.

We know A cannot be at 3 or 4, so A must be at 1 or 2.

E cannot be at 2 or 5, so E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But note: if A is at 1, then E cannot be at 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 2, then E cannot be at 2 (which we already know).

We also have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we have A, E, N, so two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates indicated).

Excluded letters: C, R, S, D.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5 is N)
- Contains A and E (and two other letters that are not excluded)
- A is at 1 or 2
- E is at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 and not 5, which is already taken)
- Avoids C, R, S, D.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of possible words:

Since N is at the end, we can think of words ending with ""N"" that have A and E.

Possible patterns:

- If A is at 1: A _ _ _ N
- If A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

And E must be in one of the remaining positions.

We also know that in SEDAN, we had A at 4 and it was wrong, and E at 2 and it was wrong.

Now, let's list possible words.

First, if A is at 1: A _ _ _ N

The third and fourth positions are open. E can be at 3 or 4 (since it cannot be at 2 and 5, and 1 is taken by A).

So:
- A _ E _ N
- A _ _ E N

But note: in the first guess, A was at 3 and wrong, but that doesn't directly constrain E. Also, we have to avoid S, D, C, R.

Similarly, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

Then E can be at 1, 3, or 4? But position 1 is available, 3 and 4 are available. However, E cannot be at 2 (which is taken by A) and 5 (taken by N). So E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But if E is at 1: E A _ _ N
If E is at 3: _ A E _ N
If E is at 4: _ A _ E N

We need to test these possibilities.

We also have two more letters to fill, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, S, D.

We want to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tested: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Let's try to form words.

Option 1: A at 1, E at 3: A _ E _ N
The second and fourth positions need to be filled. The word would be A X E Y N, where X and Y are letters not in {C,R,S,D} and not A,E,N (but we can use other letters).

Possible words: 
- AVERN? Not a word.
- AHEAD? But H and D. D is excluded. So no.
- AWFUL? No E.

How about ""AGENT""? 
- A, G, E, N, T -> but N is at position 4? We need N at 5. In ""AGENT"", the N is at 4 and T at 5. But we need N at 5. So not.

We need the last letter to be N. So the word must end with N.

So for A _ E _ N: the fourth letter must be the one before N. So the word is A X E Y N.

But ""A _ E _ N"" means:
Position 1: A
Position 2: X
Position 3: E
Position 4: Y
Position 5: N

We need valid words. For example:
- ""AXIOM"" doesn't end with N.

Common words: 
- ""ABERN"" not a word.
- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> but that's A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). But we have E at 4? And we are in the pattern A _ E _ N? No, in ""ALIEN"", the E is at 4, so it would be A _ _ E N, not A _ E _ N.

Let me clarify:

Pattern A _ E _ N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.

Example: I can't think of a common word. ""AVEN""? Only 4 letters. ""HAVEN"" has H at 1, not A.

Another pattern: A _ _ E N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=N.

This is more common. Words like:
- ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> but S is excluded.
- ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.
- ""ARBEN"" not a word.
- ""AWAIT"" doesn't end with N.

How about ""AXMEN""? Not common.

Alternatively, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

And E at 1: E A _ _ N
- Example: ""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> but duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in EATEN, E is at 1 and 4? But we have E at 1 and then at 4? The word has two E's. But we don't have evidence for duplicates. Let's avoid for now.

- ""EARTH"": doesn't end with N.

E at 3: _ A E _ N
- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> but we need E at 4? In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4? Positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). So that's _ A _ E N, not _ A E _ N.

Pattern _ A E _ N: position 1=?, 2=A, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.

Example: ""TALEN"" not common. ""MAZEN"" not common. ""PAYEN"" not common.

E at 4: _ A _ E N
- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). This fits.

So ""HAVEN"" is a candidate. But we have to check excluded letters: H, A, V, E, N. We haven't excluded H or V. And A, E, N are in the word.

But we have feedback that in SEDAN, E was at position 2 and was wrong. In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4, which is allowed. Also, A is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3 or 4, and 2 is new).

But we also have to consider: in CRANE, A was at 3 and wrong, and in SEDAN, A was at 4 and wrong. So A is not at 3 or 4, so at 2 is possible.

Similarly, E is not at 2 or 5, so at 4 is possible.

But we have not tested H and V.

Another candidate: ""RAVEN"" but R is excluded.

""MAVEN"": M, A, V, E, N -> same as HAVEN but with M.

""WAVEN""? Not common.

""BAKEN""? Not common.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5). This fits the pattern _ A _ E N.

And T and K are not excluded.

Similarly, ""BAKER"" has R, excluded.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N.

""FAKEN""? Not common, but ""FAKEN"" might be a variant? Prefer common words.

Common words: TAKEN, WAKEN, HAVEN, MAVEN, RAVEN (but R excluded), etc.

Now, back to the possibility of A at 1.

Pattern A _ _ E N: 
- ""ASHEN"": but S excluded.
- ""AMEN"" too short.
- ""AWAKE"" doesn't end with N.
- ""AXIOM"" doesn't end with N.
- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). This fits A _ _ E N.

And L and I are not excluded.

Similarly, ""ARIEN"" not common.

So candidates: 
- For pattern _ A _ E N: TAKEN, WAKEN, MAVEN, HAVEN, etc.
- For pattern A _ _ E N: ALIEN.

We also have the pattern with E at position 1: E A _ _ N, but we couldn't find a common word without duplicates (like EATEN has two E's).

And pattern _ A E _ N: hard to find words.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

We have excluded: C, R, S, D.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, D.

New common letters: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

We know the word has A, E, N (with N at 5).

For the next guess, we can try:

Option 1: ""TAKEN"" - tests T and K, and has A at 2, E at 4, N at 5.
But we are not sure if A is at 2 or 1. If we guess ""TAKEN"" and A is actually at 1, then we might get A in the wrong position.

Similarly, if we guess ""ALIEN"", we test L and I, and have A at 1, E at 4, N at 5.

But we don't know which pattern.

We could also choose a word that doesn't put A at 1 or 2, but we know A must be at 1 or 2, so we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and E in the possible positions and tests new letters, even if it doesn't fit the exact pattern we think.

But we have to include A, E, and N (at 5).

We also have two more letters to guess.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has A at 1 and E at 3, for example, to test that pattern, but we couldn't find a common word for A _ E _ N.

Another idea: we know E can be at 1, 3, or 4. We haven't tested E at 1 or 3 yet.

Similarly, A at 1 or 2.

We can try to test E at 3.

For example, a word with E at 3: _ _ E _ N

And A at 1 or 2.

If A at 1: A _ E _ N -> no common word found.

If A at 2: _ A E _ N -> no common word found.

So maybe focus on the patterns we have.

Let's list the candidates we have:

1. ALIEN: A at 1, L, I, E at 4, N at 5. Tests L and I.
2. TAKEN: T at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests T and K.
3. HAVEN: H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests H and V.
4. MAVEN: M at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests M and V.

We can choose one that tests common letters.

T is a very common letter, so ""TAKEN"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, L and I are common, so ""ALIEN"" is good.

But note: in ""TAKEN"", we are putting A at 2. If A is actually at 1, then we will get A as '-' and know it's at 1.

Similarly, in ""ALIEN"", A is at 1, if A is at 2, we get A as '-'.

So either way, we get information.

We also need to consider that E is at 4 in both. We know E is not at 4? No, we don't know that. We only know E is not at 2 or 5. Position 4 is possible.

In fact, in SEDAN, E was at 2 and was wrong, but we haven't tested E at 4.

So let's choose ""TAKEN"". It tests T and K, which are common.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word.

Another candidate: ""WAKEN"" (W, A, K, E, N) same as TAKEN but with W.

""BAKEN"" not common.

""MAKEN"" not common.

""LAKEN"" not common.

So ""TAKEN"" is common.

Similarly, ""ALIEN"" is common.

But ""ALIEN"" has I, which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E). Consonants might give more information.

We can also consider ""OAKEN"" (O, A, K, E, N) but that has A at 2, E at 4, same as TAKEN, but with O and K. O is a vowel.

But we already know A and E are present, so testing consonants might be better.

Let's go with ""TAKEN"".

But wait, we have to avoid the excluded letters. T and K are not excluded.

So guess: ""TAKEN""

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in HAVEN -> x
- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we put A at 2 -> ✓? But in ""TAKEN"", A is at 2, and if the secret word has A at 2, then it would be correct.

But if the secret word is ""ALIEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in ALIEN -> x
- A: in ALIEN but at position 1, not 2 -> - (wrong position)
- K: not in ALIEN -> x
- E: in ALIEN at position 4, and we have E at 4 -> ✓
- N: ✓

So we would get: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

That would tell us that E and N are correct at 4 and 5, and A is present but not at 2, so A must be at 1.

Then we can guess ""ALIEN"" next.

Similarly, if the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we get all correct.

If the secret word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in HAVEN -> x
- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we have at 2 -> ✓
- K: not in HAVEN -> x
- E: in HAVEN at position 4, and we have at 4 -> ✓
- N: ✓

So we get T(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we know A, E, N are correct at 2,4,5, and the first letter is not T, and the third letter is not K. Then we can guess words like ""HAVEN"", ""MAVEN"", etc.

So ""TAKEN"" is a good guess because it tests two new consonants and can help narrow down.

Alternatively, ""ALIEN"" would test L and I.

But T and K are more common? T is the most common letter.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We have room.

Another word: ""MANGE"" doesn't end with N.

We'll go with ""TAKEN"".

But let's confirm the format.

So the next guess: ""TAKEN""

In the response, we must output in the specified format.

But note: we are not sure if the word has A at 1 or 2, but ""TAKEN"" will help us find out.

So I think it's a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C and R are not in the word (x), while A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically:
  - A is not at position 3.
  - N is not at position 4.
  - E is not at position 5.
- **SEDAN**: S and D are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not at position 2 (-), A is in the word but not at position 4 (-), and N is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - N is confirmed at position 5 (so the word ends with N: `_ _ _ _ N`).
   - A and E are in the word but not in previously guessed positions:
     - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from CRANE and SEDAN), so it must be at position 1 or 2.
     - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (from SEDAN and CRANE), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
2. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, S, and D are not in the word.
3. **Remaining Letters**: The word contains A, E, and N, plus two unknown letters (not C, R, S, D). Common untested letters include T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for A (1 or 2) and E (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new high-frequency consonants to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters and positions that are invalid for A and E.
- The word ""TAKEN"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It tests A at position 2 (a possible location) and E at position 4 (a possible location).
  - It includes new common consonants (T and K) that haven't been tested.
  - It ends with N (position 5), matching the confirmed pattern.
  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm if A is at position 1 (via a ""-"" for A). Similarly, E at position 4 will be tested.
  - This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities (e.g., if T or K are correct, or if A/E positions are validated).

<guess>TAKEN</guess>",TAKEN,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Second guess: SEDAN
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- N: ✓ (in the word and at position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and is at position 5 (from SEDAN: N is correct at position 5).

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from SEDAN).
   - E: present, but not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 2 (from SEDAN).

3. Letters not in the word:
   - C, R (from CRANE)
   - S, D (from SEDAN)

So the secret word has:
- A, E, and N (with N at position 5).
- We know N is at position 5, so the word ends with N.

The word structure: _ _ _ _ N

We know A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3,4 for A (and also not at 5 because that's N) and not at positions 2,5 for E (and position 5 is taken by N, so E cannot be there anyway).

Possible positions for A: since it cannot be at 3 or 4, and 5 is N, so A must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, for E: it cannot be at 2 or 5, and 5 is taken by N, so E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 and 2 are the only ones left for A? Actually, the positions are 1,2,3,4. We have:

- Position 5: N (fixed)

So the first four positions are open for A, E, and two other letters.

We know A cannot be at 3 or 4, so A must be at 1 or 2.

E cannot be at 2 or 5, so E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But note: if A is at 1, then E cannot be at 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 2, then E cannot be at 2 (which we already know).

We also have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we have A, E, N, so two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates indicated).

Excluded letters: C, R, S, D.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5 is N)
- Contains A and E (and two other letters that are not excluded)
- A is at 1 or 2
- E is at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 and not 5, which is already taken)
- Avoids C, R, S, D.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of possible words:

Since N is at the end, we can think of words ending with ""N"" that have A and E.

Possible patterns:

- If A is at 1: A _ _ _ N
- If A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

And E must be in one of the remaining positions.

We also know that in SEDAN, we had A at 4 and it was wrong, and E at 2 and it was wrong.

Now, let's list possible words.

First, if A is at 1: A _ _ _ N

The third and fourth positions are open. E can be at 3 or 4 (since it cannot be at 2 and 5, and 1 is taken by A).

So:
- A _ E _ N
- A _ _ E N

But note: in the first guess, A was at 3 and wrong, but that doesn't directly constrain E. Also, we have to avoid S, D, C, R.

Similarly, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

Then E can be at 1, 3, or 4? But position 1 is available, 3 and 4 are available. However, E cannot be at 2 (which is taken by A) and 5 (taken by N). So E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But if E is at 1: E A _ _ N
If E is at 3: _ A E _ N
If E is at 4: _ A _ E N

We need to test these possibilities.

We also have two more letters to fill, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, S, D.

We want to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tested: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Let's try to form words.

Option 1: A at 1, E at 3: A _ E _ N
The second and fourth positions need to be filled. The word would be A X E Y N, where X and Y are letters not in {C,R,S,D} and not A,E,N (but we can use other letters).

Possible words: 
- AVERN? Not a word.
- AHEAD? But H and D. D is excluded. So no.
- AWFUL? No E.

How about ""AGENT""? 
- A, G, E, N, T -> but N is at position 4? We need N at 5. In ""AGENT"", the N is at 4 and T at 5. But we need N at 5. So not.

We need the last letter to be N. So the word must end with N.

So for A _ E _ N: the fourth letter must be the one before N. So the word is A X E Y N.

But ""A _ E _ N"" means:
Position 1: A
Position 2: X
Position 3: E
Position 4: Y
Position 5: N

We need valid words. For example:
- ""AXIOM"" doesn't end with N.

Common words: 
- ""ABERN"" not a word.
- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> but that's A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). But we have E at 4? And we are in the pattern A _ E _ N? No, in ""ALIEN"", the E is at 4, so it would be A _ _ E N, not A _ E _ N.

Let me clarify:

Pattern A _ E _ N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.

Example: I can't think of a common word. ""AVEN""? Only 4 letters. ""HAVEN"" has H at 1, not A.

Another pattern: A _ _ E N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=N.

This is more common. Words like:
- ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> but S is excluded.
- ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.
- ""ARBEN"" not a word.
- ""AWAIT"" doesn't end with N.

How about ""AXMEN""? Not common.

Alternatively, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

And E at 1: E A _ _ N
- Example: ""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> but duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in EATEN, E is at 1 and 4? But we have E at 1 and then at 4? The word has two E's. But we don't have evidence for duplicates. Let's avoid for now.

- ""EARTH"": doesn't end with N.

E at 3: _ A E _ N
- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> but we need E at 4? In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4? Positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). So that's _ A _ E N, not _ A E _ N.

Pattern _ A E _ N: position 1=?, 2=A, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.

Example: ""TALEN"" not common. ""MAZEN"" not common. ""PAYEN"" not common.

E at 4: _ A _ E N
- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). This fits.

So ""HAVEN"" is a candidate. But we have to check excluded letters: H, A, V, E, N. We haven't excluded H or V. And A, E, N are in the word.

But we have feedback that in SEDAN, E was at position 2 and was wrong. In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4, which is allowed. Also, A is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3 or 4, and 2 is new).

But we also have to consider: in CRANE, A was at 3 and wrong, and in SEDAN, A was at 4 and wrong. So A is not at 3 or 4, so at 2 is possible.

Similarly, E is not at 2 or 5, so at 4 is possible.

But we have not tested H and V.

Another candidate: ""RAVEN"" but R is excluded.

""MAVEN"": M, A, V, E, N -> same as HAVEN but with M.

""WAVEN""? Not common.

""BAKEN""? Not common.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5). This fits the pattern _ A _ E N.

And T and K are not excluded.

Similarly, ""BAKER"" has R, excluded.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N.

""FAKEN""? Not common, but ""FAKEN"" might be a variant? Prefer common words.

Common words: TAKEN, WAKEN, HAVEN, MAVEN, RAVEN (but R excluded), etc.

Now, back to the possibility of A at 1.

Pattern A _ _ E N: 
- ""ASHEN"": but S excluded.
- ""AMEN"" too short.
- ""AWAKE"" doesn't end with N.
- ""AXIOM"" doesn't end with N.
- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). This fits A _ _ E N.

And L and I are not excluded.

Similarly, ""ARIEN"" not common.

So candidates: 
- For pattern _ A _ E N: TAKEN, WAKEN, MAVEN, HAVEN, etc.
- For pattern A _ _ E N: ALIEN.

We also have the pattern with E at position 1: E A _ _ N, but we couldn't find a common word without duplicates (like EATEN has two E's).

And pattern _ A E _ N: hard to find words.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

We have excluded: C, R, S, D.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, D.

New common letters: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

We know the word has A, E, N (with N at 5).

For the next guess, we can try:

Option 1: ""TAKEN"" - tests T and K, and has A at 2, E at 4, N at 5.
But we are not sure if A is at 2 or 1. If we guess ""TAKEN"" and A is actually at 1, then we might get A in the wrong position.

Similarly, if we guess ""ALIEN"", we test L and I, and have A at 1, E at 4, N at 5.

But we don't know which pattern.

We could also choose a word that doesn't put A at 1 or 2, but we know A must be at 1 or 2, so we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and E in the possible positions and tests new letters, even if it doesn't fit the exact pattern we think.

But we have to include A, E, and N (at 5).

We also have two more letters to guess.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has A at 1 and E at 3, for example, to test that pattern, but we couldn't find a common word for A _ E _ N.

Another idea: we know E can be at 1, 3, or 4. We haven't tested E at 1 or 3 yet.

Similarly, A at 1 or 2.

We can try to test E at 3.

For example, a word with E at 3: _ _ E _ N

And A at 1 or 2.

If A at 1: A _ E _ N -> no common word found.

If A at 2: _ A E _ N -> no common word found.

So maybe focus on the patterns we have.

Let's list the candidates we have:

1. ALIEN: A at 1, L, I, E at 4, N at 5. Tests L and I.
2. TAKEN: T at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests T and K.
3. HAVEN: H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests H and V.
4. MAVEN: M at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests M and V.

We can choose one that tests common letters.

T is a very common letter, so ""TAKEN"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, L and I are common, so ""ALIEN"" is good.

But note: in ""TAKEN"", we are putting A at 2. If A is actually at 1, then we will get A as '-' and know it's at 1.

Similarly, in ""ALIEN"", A is at 1, if A is at 2, we get A as '-'.

So either way, we get information.

We also need to consider that E is at 4 in both. We know E is not at 4? No, we don't know that. We only know E is not at 2 or 5. Position 4 is possible.

In fact, in SEDAN, E was at 2 and was wrong, but we haven't tested E at 4.

So let's choose ""TAKEN"". It tests T and K, which are common.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word.

Another candidate: ""WAKEN"" (W, A, K, E, N) same as TAKEN but with W.

""BAKEN"" not common.

""MAKEN"" not common.

""LAKEN"" not common.

So ""TAKEN"" is common.

Similarly, ""ALIEN"" is common.

But ""ALIEN"" has I, which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E). Consonants might give more information.

We can also consider ""OAKEN"" (O, A, K, E, N) but that has A at 2, E at 4, same as TAKEN, but with O and K. O is a vowel.

But we already know A and E are present, so testing consonants might be better.

Let's go with ""TAKEN"".

But wait, we have to avoid the excluded letters. T and K are not excluded.

So guess: ""TAKEN""

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in HAVEN -> x
- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we put A at 2 -> ✓? But in ""TAKEN"", A is at 2, and if the secret word has A at 2, then it would be correct.

But if the secret word is ""ALIEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in ALIEN -> x
- A: in ALIEN but at position 1, not 2 -> - (wrong position)
- K: not in ALIEN -> x
- E: in ALIEN at position 4, and we have E at 4 -> ✓
- N: ✓

So we would get: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

That would tell us that E and N are correct at 4 and 5, and A is present but not at 2, so A must be at 1.

Then we can guess ""ALIEN"" next.

Similarly, if the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we get all correct.

If the secret word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in HAVEN -> x
- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we have at 2 -> ✓
- K: not in HAVEN -> x
- E: in HAVEN at position 4, and we have at 4 -> ✓
- N: ✓

So we get T(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we know A, E, N are correct at 2,4,5, and the first letter is not T, and the third letter is not K. Then we can guess words like ""HAVEN"", ""MAVEN"", etc.

So ""TAKEN"" is a good guess because it tests two new consonants and can help narrow down.

Alternatively, ""ALIEN"" would test L and I.

But T and K are more common? T is the most common letter.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We have room.

Another word: ""MANGE"" doesn't end with N.

We'll go with ""TAKEN"".

But let's confirm the format.

So the next guess: ""TAKEN""

In the response, we must output in the specified format.

But note: we are not sure if the word has A at 1 or 2, but ""TAKEN"" will help us find out.

So I think it's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C and R are not in the word (x), while A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically:
  - A is not at position 3.
  - N is not at position 4.
  - E is not at position 5.
- **SEDAN**: S and D are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not at position 2 (-), A is in the word but not at position 4 (-), and N is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - N is confirmed at position 5 (so the word ends with N: `_ _ _ _ N`).
   - A and E are in the word but not in previously guessed positions:
     - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from CRANE and SEDAN), so it must be at position 1 or 2.
     - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (from SEDAN and CRANE), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
2. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, S, and D are not in the word.
3. **Remaining Letters**: The word contains A, E, and N, plus two unknown letters (not C, R, S, D). Common untested letters include T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for A (1 or 2) and E (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new high-frequency consonants to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters and positions that are invalid for A and E.
- The word ""TAKEN"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It tests A at position 2 (a possible location) and E at position 4 (a possible location).
  - It includes new common consonants (T and K) that haven't been tested.
  - It ends with N (position 5), matching the confirmed pattern.
  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm if A is at position 1 (via a ""-"" for A). Similarly, E at position 4 will be tested.
  - This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities (e.g., if T or K are correct, or if A/E positions are validated).",Guess 3: TAKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓),FAIL

 Common strategies often start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants.
 A recommended starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" since they have common letters.

 However, note that Wordle allows any valid English word. Let me choose a word that maximizes information gain.

 Considering different choices, I'll choose ""ROATE"" (a variant spelling, but acceptable) or ""SLATE"".

 But to be safe and use a very common word, let's choose ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, I can also choose ""SLATE"". Let me decide on ""CRANE"":

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). The vowels are common, and the consonants are reasonably common.

 So my first guess will be: ""CRANE""

 Format: <guess>CRANE</guess>For the first guess, I need a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Popular starting words often include letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, O. A strong choice is ""CRANE"" because it covers three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), allowing me to test multiple high-frequency letters. This helps narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"".

 In ""CRANE"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

 We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

 Since we have three confirmed letters (A, N, E) and two exclusions (C, R), we can try to form a new word that:
 - Includes A, N, E (each at least once, but note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have duplicates in the guess, so we'll assume the secret word has no duplicates for now).
 - Avoids C and R.

 Also, we must avoid placing A in position 3, N in position 4, and E in position 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We want to maximize information by trying new letters that we haven't tested yet. The remaining letters we haven't tested are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we also have to include A, N, E in the word, but in different positions.

 Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two new letters, and avoid positions 3 for A, 4 for N, and 5 for E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
 Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that places the known letters in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

 Let's try to form such a word.

 Example: 
  We can try putting A in position 1? But then we have to avoid position 3 for A, which is already satisfied. However, we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. Similarly for others.

 We can consider words like:
  ""ADIEU"" - but that has D, I, E, U and A. But note: we must include N as well? We know the word has N, so we cannot omit N.

 We must include A, N, and E.

 Let's think of words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

 Some possibilities:
  ""SANE?"" -> but S is new, and we have A, N, E. But in ""SANE"", the positions would be:
      S at 1, A at 2, N at 3, E at 4.
  However, we have constraints: 
      A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in our guess, A was in position 3 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So in ""SANE"", A is at 2 (which is allowed) and N is at 3 (which is allowed because the constraint for N is only that it cannot be at position 4) and E is at 4 (which is allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay). 

  But wait, we also have to avoid the positions we know they are not in? The feedback only tells us that in the first guess, A was not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5. They could be in other positions.

  However, we must also note that the word ""SANE"" has the letter S which we haven't tested. Also, it doesn't have C or R (which we know are excluded).

  But let's check the positions for A, N, E in ""SANE"":
      Position 1: S (new)
      Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, and this is a new position for A, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, and this is a new position for N, so it might be correct or not)
      Position 4: E (we know E is in the word, and this is a new position for E, so it might be correct or not)

  This word uses three of the known letters and one new letter (S). But we have only four letters? Actually, ""SANE"" is 5 letters? No, it's 4. So we need 5-letter words.

  We need 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.

  Let's try ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.

  How about ""SNAKE""? 
      S, N, A, K, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions: 
          1: S (new)
          2: N (we know N is in the word, but in the first guess N was at position 4 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at 4)
          3: A (we know A is in the word, but in the first guess A was at 3 and now we put it at 3 again? But wait, the feedback said A was not at 3, so we cannot put A at 3 again. So this is invalid for position 3.

  Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3.

  In ""SNAKE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""NAIVE""? 
      N, A, I, V, E -> 5 letters.
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed because N was not at 4, but 1 is new)
          2: A (allowed because A was not at 3, and 2 is new)
          3: I (new)
          4: V (new)
          5: E (but we know E cannot be at 5? Because in the first guess E was at 5 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can put it at 5 to test? But the feedback already told us it's not at 5, so if we put it at 5 again, we know it will be a minus. But we want to use the E in a new position to see if it is at 5? Actually, we already know it's not at 5, so we should avoid putting it at 5 to save a position for a new letter? 

  However, we have to include E, and we have to put it in one of the positions 1,2,3,4 (because 5 is forbidden). So in ""NAIVE"", E is at 5 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we would get a minus for E again, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

  We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4). So we should avoid position 5 for E.

  Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is not ideal because E is at 5.

  How about ""ANVIL""? 
      A, N, V, I, L -> but missing E? We know the word has E, so we must include E.

  We must include E.

  How about ""LEARN""? -> but we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""PLANE""? 
      P, L, A, N, E -> 
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: L (new)
          3: A -> but we cannot put A at 3 (because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong). So invalid.

  How about ""PANEL""? 
      P, A, N, E, L
      Positions:
          1: P (new)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: N (allowed, because not 4) -> but wait, we have to check: the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4? Yes, but 3 is allowed. However, we don't have a constraint for N at 3? Actually, the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, so 3 is a new position for N and allowed.
          4: E -> but we know E cannot be at 5? Actually, we can put E at 4? Yes, because the constraint for E is only that it cannot be at 5. Position 4 is allowed.
          5: L (new)

  This word ""PANEL"" has:
      P, A, N, E, L
      A is at 2 (new position), N at 3 (new position), E at 4 (new position). And we are testing two new letters: P and L.

  This seems good.

  But note: we are not required to put all known letters? Actually, we know the word has A, N, and E, so we must include them. And we are including them.

  Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have N. We must include N.

  Another option: ""SANDY"" -> 
      S, A, N, D, Y
      But missing E? We must include E.

  How about ""SENTA""? Not a common word. We need valid English words.

  Another idea: ""STAIN"" -> but missing E.

  We need a word with A, N, E.

  Let me list some words: 
      ""ANODE"", ""ATONE"", ""DAVEN"", ""EVADE"", ""MANED"", ""NAMED"", ""PANED"", ""PEAN"", ""WANED"", etc.

  But we have to avoid C and R.

  Consider ""ANODE"": 
      A, N, O, D, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: N (allowed) -> but note: we are putting N at 2, which is new.
          3: O (new)
          4: D (new)
          5: E -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5). So we get a minus for E again, which we already know.

  How about ""ATONE"":
      A, T, O, N, E
      Positions:
          1: A (allowed)
          2: T (new)
          3: O (new)
          4: N -> but wait, we know N cannot be at 4? Because in the first guess N was at 4 and got a minus. So we cannot put N at 4. This is invalid.

  How about ""MANED"":
      M, A, N, E, D
      Positions:
          1: M (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: N -> but we are putting N at 3? That's allowed because the constraint is only for position 4. 
          4: E -> allowed (because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
          5: D (new)

  This word ""MANED"" has:
      M, A, N, E, D
      A at 2 (new), N at 3 (new), E at 4 (new). And we test M and D.

  This is a valid English word (meaning: having a mane).

  Alternatively, ""NAMED"":
      N, A, M, E, D
      Positions:
          1: N (allowed, because not 4)
          2: A (allowed, because not 3)
          3: M (new)
          4: E (allowed, because not 5)
          5: D (new)

  This is also valid.

  But note: we have two options: ""MANED"" and ""NAMED"". Which one to choose?

  We want to maximize information. We don't know the positions of A, N, E. In ""MANED"", we are putting A at 2, N at 3, E at 4. In ""NAMED"", we are putting N at 1, A at 2, E at 4.

  We also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates.

  Both words test two new letters (M and D) and use the known letters in new positions.

  Another word: ""PAVED"" -> but that has V and D, but missing N? We need N.

  How about ""WAXEN""? 
      W, A, X, E, N
      Positions:
          1: W (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: X (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N -> but we know N cannot be at 4? Actually, the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4, but 5 is allowed. However, we have E at 4: that's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay.

  But note: we are putting N at 5? That's allowed because the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, but 5 is a new position.

  However, we have to check if ""WAXEN"" is a common word? It means made of wax, and it's acceptable.

  But we are testing X which is a less common letter. Maybe we should choose a word with more common letters.

  Considering common letters, let's try to use S, T, L, etc.

  How about ""STALE""? But we don't have N? We must include N.

  How about ""STANE""? Not a common word.

  How about ""SNARE""? But we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

  How about ""SLANE""? Not common.

  How about ""LEANT""? 
      L, E, A, N, T
      Positions:
          1: L (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> but we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: A -> not allowed! Because we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess). So invalid.

  How about ""LATEN""? Not common.

  After considering, let's go with ""MANED"" or ""NAMED"". 

  I think ""NAMED"" is a more common word. Also, it tests N at position 1, which we haven't tested before.

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for the letters. For A, we avoid position 3; for N, avoid position 4; for E, avoid position 5.

  In ""NAMED"":
      N at 1: allowed (because we only know N is not at 4)
      A at 2: allowed (because we only know A is not at 3)
      M at 3: new
      E at 4: allowed (because we only know E is not at 5)
      D at 5: new

  This is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""PANED"" (if it's a word? It means having panes, like a window) but we don't have that in our vocabulary? 

  Another common word: ""ADIEU"" is not possible because it doesn't have N.

  Let me check: we must include A, N, E. So ""ADIEU"" is out.

  I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's also consider ""OAKEN"" (made of oak) -> 
      O, A, K, E, N
      Positions:
          1: O (new)
          2: A (allowed)
          3: K (new)
          4: E (allowed)
          5: N (allowed) -> because N was not at 4, but 5 is new.

  This is also valid.

  However, we are testing O and K, which are common? 

  But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common consonants in English are T, S, L, etc. 

  How about ""TANGO""? -> but missing E.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that has two N's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it doesn't have E? Wait, ""SENNA"" has two N's and an E? 
      S, E, N, N, A -> but that's two N's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. The feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, we have no evidence. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

  How about ""STADE""? -> but missing N.

  How about ""STEAN""? Not common.

  How about ""MEAN""? Only 4 letters.

  After reconsideration, I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.

  But let's see if we can include more common letters. The letters we haven't tested and are common: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

  We are testing M and D in ""NAMED"". M and D are moderately common.

  Another word: ""SALET"" (a historical word for a helmet) -> but missing N and E? We need both.

  How about ""SANE?"" -> too short.

  How about ""SNEAD""? (a surname) -> 
      S, N, E, A, D
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: N (allowed) -> but we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.
          3: E (new) -> but we are putting E at 3? That's allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 3 is okay.
          4: A -> but we know A cannot be at 3? Actually, we can put A at 4? There is no constraint for A at 4. The constraint is only for position 3. So allowed.
          5: D (new)

  This word ""SNEAD"" has S, N, E, A, D. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  But note: we are putting A at position 4? That's allowed. And we are putting E at 3? That's allowed.

  However, we are putting N at 2? That's allowed.

  This word tests two common letters: S and D.

  But is ""SNEAD"" a valid word? It is a proper noun (golfer) but sometimes Wordle accepts proper nouns? Actually, the original Wordle uses common words, and SNEAD might be accepted? But to be safe, we should use more common words.

  How about ""SEDAN""? 
      S, E, D, A, N
      Positions:
          1: S (new)
          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> and we are putting E at 2, which is new.
          3: D (new)
          4: A (allowed, because not 3) -> 4 is new for A.
          5: N (allowed, because not 4) -> 5 is new for N.

  This word ""SEDAN"" is a common word. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.

  And it places the known letters in all new positions: 
      E at 2 (was at 5 in first guess, now 2)
      A at 4 (was at 3, now 4)
      N at 5 (was at 4, now 5)

  This is ideal because we are testing all known letters in positions that we haven't tried before.

  Therefore, I choose ""SEDAN"".

  Let me confirm the constraints:
      A: was at 3 (wrong), now at 4 -> allowed.
      N: was at 4 (wrong), now at 5 -> allowed.
      E: was at 5 (wrong), now at 2 -> allowed.

  And we are testing two new common letters: S and D.

  Also, we avoid C and R.

  So, the next guess: ""SEDAN""

  We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

  But note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more tries.

  Therefore, I will guess ""SEDAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are not in the secret word (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), meaning:
  - A is not in position 3.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoids C and R (excluded letters).
- Places A, N, and E in new positions (A not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""SEDAN"" fits perfectly:
- Contains A, N, and E.
- Uses new letters S and D (common consonants).
- Positions:
  - S (new) at position 1.
  - E at position 2 (new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - D (new) at position 3.
  - A at position 4 (new position for A, avoiding position 3).
  - N at position 5 (new position for N, avoiding position 4).

This guess tests all known letters in untried positions and introduces two new letters, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SEDAN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SEDAN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) D(x) A(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Second guess: SEDAN
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- N: ✓ (in the word and at position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and is at position 5 (from SEDAN: N is correct at position 5).

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from SEDAN).
   - E: present, but not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 2 (from SEDAN).

3. Letters not in the word:
   - C, R (from CRANE)
   - S, D (from SEDAN)

So the secret word has:
- A, E, and N (with N at position 5).
- We know N is at position 5, so the word ends with N.

The word structure: _ _ _ _ N

We know A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3,4 for A (and also not at 5 because that's N) and not at positions 2,5 for E (and position 5 is taken by N, so E cannot be there anyway).

Possible positions for A: since it cannot be at 3 or 4, and 5 is N, so A must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, for E: it cannot be at 2 or 5, and 5 is taken by N, so E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 and 2 are the only ones left for A? Actually, the positions are 1,2,3,4. We have:

- Position 5: N (fixed)

So the first four positions are open for A, E, and two other letters.

We know A cannot be at 3 or 4, so A must be at 1 or 2.

E cannot be at 2 or 5, so E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But note: if A is at 1, then E cannot be at 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 2, then E cannot be at 2 (which we already know).

We also have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we have A, E, N, so two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates indicated).

Excluded letters: C, R, S, D.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5 is N)
- Contains A and E (and two other letters that are not excluded)
- A is at 1 or 2
- E is at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 and not 5, which is already taken)
- Avoids C, R, S, D.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of possible words:

Since N is at the end, we can think of words ending with ""N"" that have A and E.

Possible patterns:

- If A is at 1: A _ _ _ N
- If A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

And E must be in one of the remaining positions.

We also know that in SEDAN, we had A at 4 and it was wrong, and E at 2 and it was wrong.

Now, let's list possible words.

First, if A is at 1: A _ _ _ N

The third and fourth positions are open. E can be at 3 or 4 (since it cannot be at 2 and 5, and 1 is taken by A).

So:
- A _ E _ N
- A _ _ E N

But note: in the first guess, A was at 3 and wrong, but that doesn't directly constrain E. Also, we have to avoid S, D, C, R.

Similarly, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

Then E can be at 1, 3, or 4? But position 1 is available, 3 and 4 are available. However, E cannot be at 2 (which is taken by A) and 5 (taken by N). So E can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But if E is at 1: E A _ _ N
If E is at 3: _ A E _ N
If E is at 4: _ A _ E N

We need to test these possibilities.

We also have two more letters to fill, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, S, D.

We want to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tested: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Let's try to form words.

Option 1: A at 1, E at 3: A _ E _ N
The second and fourth positions need to be filled. The word would be A X E Y N, where X and Y are letters not in {C,R,S,D} and not A,E,N (but we can use other letters).

Possible words: 
- AVERN? Not a word.
- AHEAD? But H and D. D is excluded. So no.
- AWFUL? No E.

How about ""AGENT""? 
- A, G, E, N, T -> but N is at position 4? We need N at 5. In ""AGENT"", the N is at 4 and T at 5. But we need N at 5. So not.

We need the last letter to be N. So the word must end with N.

So for A _ E _ N: the fourth letter must be the one before N. So the word is A X E Y N.

But ""A _ E _ N"" means:
Position 1: A
Position 2: X
Position 3: E
Position 4: Y
Position 5: N

We need valid words. For example:
- ""AXIOM"" doesn't end with N.

Common words: 
- ""ABERN"" not a word.
- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> but that's A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). But we have E at 4? And we are in the pattern A _ E _ N? No, in ""ALIEN"", the E is at 4, so it would be A _ _ E N, not A _ E _ N.

Let me clarify:

Pattern A _ E _ N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.

Example: I can't think of a common word. ""AVEN""? Only 4 letters. ""HAVEN"" has H at 1, not A.

Another pattern: A _ _ E N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=N.

This is more common. Words like:
- ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> but S is excluded.
- ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.
- ""ARBEN"" not a word.
- ""AWAIT"" doesn't end with N.

How about ""AXMEN""? Not common.

Alternatively, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N

And E at 1: E A _ _ N
- Example: ""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> but duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in EATEN, E is at 1 and 4? But we have E at 1 and then at 4? The word has two E's. But we don't have evidence for duplicates. Let's avoid for now.

- ""EARTH"": doesn't end with N.

E at 3: _ A E _ N
- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> but we need E at 4? In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4? Positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). So that's _ A _ E N, not _ A E _ N.

Pattern _ A E _ N: position 1=?, 2=A, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.

Example: ""TALEN"" not common. ""MAZEN"" not common. ""PAYEN"" not common.

E at 4: _ A _ E N
- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). This fits.

So ""HAVEN"" is a candidate. But we have to check excluded letters: H, A, V, E, N. We haven't excluded H or V. And A, E, N are in the word.

But we have feedback that in SEDAN, E was at position 2 and was wrong. In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4, which is allowed. Also, A is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3 or 4, and 2 is new).

But we also have to consider: in CRANE, A was at 3 and wrong, and in SEDAN, A was at 4 and wrong. So A is not at 3 or 4, so at 2 is possible.

Similarly, E is not at 2 or 5, so at 4 is possible.

But we have not tested H and V.

Another candidate: ""RAVEN"" but R is excluded.

""MAVEN"": M, A, V, E, N -> same as HAVEN but with M.

""WAVEN""? Not common.

""BAKEN""? Not common.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5). This fits the pattern _ A _ E N.

And T and K are not excluded.

Similarly, ""BAKER"" has R, excluded.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N.

""FAKEN""? Not common, but ""FAKEN"" might be a variant? Prefer common words.

Common words: TAKEN, WAKEN, HAVEN, MAVEN, RAVEN (but R excluded), etc.

Now, back to the possibility of A at 1.

Pattern A _ _ E N: 
- ""ASHEN"": but S excluded.
- ""AMEN"" too short.
- ""AWAKE"" doesn't end with N.
- ""AXIOM"" doesn't end with N.
- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). This fits A _ _ E N.

And L and I are not excluded.

Similarly, ""ARIEN"" not common.

So candidates: 
- For pattern _ A _ E N: TAKEN, WAKEN, MAVEN, HAVEN, etc.
- For pattern A _ _ E N: ALIEN.

We also have the pattern with E at position 1: E A _ _ N, but we couldn't find a common word without duplicates (like EATEN has two E's).

And pattern _ A E _ N: hard to find words.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

We have excluded: C, R, S, D.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, D.

New common letters: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

We know the word has A, E, N (with N at 5).

For the next guess, we can try:

Option 1: ""TAKEN"" - tests T and K, and has A at 2, E at 4, N at 5.
But we are not sure if A is at 2 or 1. If we guess ""TAKEN"" and A is actually at 1, then we might get A in the wrong position.

Similarly, if we guess ""ALIEN"", we test L and I, and have A at 1, E at 4, N at 5.

But we don't know which pattern.

We could also choose a word that doesn't put A at 1 or 2, but we know A must be at 1 or 2, so we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and E in the possible positions and tests new letters, even if it doesn't fit the exact pattern we think.

But we have to include A, E, and N (at 5).

We also have two more letters to guess.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has A at 1 and E at 3, for example, to test that pattern, but we couldn't find a common word for A _ E _ N.

Another idea: we know E can be at 1, 3, or 4. We haven't tested E at 1 or 3 yet.

Similarly, A at 1 or 2.

We can try to test E at 3.

For example, a word with E at 3: _ _ E _ N

And A at 1 or 2.

If A at 1: A _ E _ N -> no common word found.

If A at 2: _ A E _ N -> no common word found.

So maybe focus on the patterns we have.

Let's list the candidates we have:

1. ALIEN: A at 1, L, I, E at 4, N at 5. Tests L and I.
2. TAKEN: T at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests T and K.
3. HAVEN: H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests H and V.
4. MAVEN: M at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests M and V.

We can choose one that tests common letters.

T is a very common letter, so ""TAKEN"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, L and I are common, so ""ALIEN"" is good.

But note: in ""TAKEN"", we are putting A at 2. If A is actually at 1, then we will get A as '-' and know it's at 1.

Similarly, in ""ALIEN"", A is at 1, if A is at 2, we get A as '-'.

So either way, we get information.

We also need to consider that E is at 4 in both. We know E is not at 4? No, we don't know that. We only know E is not at 2 or 5. Position 4 is possible.

In fact, in SEDAN, E was at 2 and was wrong, but we haven't tested E at 4.

So let's choose ""TAKEN"". It tests T and K, which are common.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word.

Another candidate: ""WAKEN"" (W, A, K, E, N) same as TAKEN but with W.

""BAKEN"" not common.

""MAKEN"" not common.

""LAKEN"" not common.

So ""TAKEN"" is common.

Similarly, ""ALIEN"" is common.

But ""ALIEN"" has I, which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E). Consonants might give more information.

We can also consider ""OAKEN"" (O, A, K, E, N) but that has A at 2, E at 4, same as TAKEN, but with O and K. O is a vowel.

But we already know A and E are present, so testing consonants might be better.

Let's go with ""TAKEN"".

But wait, we have to avoid the excluded letters. T and K are not excluded.

So guess: ""TAKEN""

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in HAVEN -> x
- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we put A at 2 -> ✓? But in ""TAKEN"", A is at 2, and if the secret word has A at 2, then it would be correct.

But if the secret word is ""ALIEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in ALIEN -> x
- A: in ALIEN but at position 1, not 2 -> - (wrong position)
- K: not in ALIEN -> x
- E: in ALIEN at position 4, and we have E at 4 -> ✓
- N: ✓

So we would get: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

That would tell us that E and N are correct at 4 and 5, and A is present but not at 2, so A must be at 1.

Then we can guess ""ALIEN"" next.

Similarly, if the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we get all correct.

If the secret word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":
- T: not in HAVEN -> x
- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we have at 2 -> ✓
- K: not in HAVEN -> x
- E: in HAVEN at position 4, and we have at 4 -> ✓
- N: ✓

So we get T(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we know A, E, N are correct at 2,4,5, and the first letter is not T, and the third letter is not K. Then we can guess words like ""HAVEN"", ""MAVEN"", etc.

So ""TAKEN"" is a good guess because it tests two new consonants and can help narrow down.

Alternatively, ""ALIEN"" would test L and I.

But T and K are more common? T is the most common letter.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We have room.

Another word: ""MANGE"" doesn't end with N.

We'll go with ""TAKEN"".

But let's confirm the format.

So the next guess: ""TAKEN""

In the response, we must output in the specified format.

But note: we are not sure if the word has A at 1 or 2, but ""TAKEN"" will help us find out.

So I think it's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C and R are not in the word (x), while A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically:
  - A is not at position 3.
  - N is not at position 4.
  - E is not at position 5.
- **SEDAN**: S and D are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not at position 2 (-), A is in the word but not at position 4 (-), and N is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - N is confirmed at position 5 (so the word ends with N: `_ _ _ _ N`).
   - A and E are in the word but not in previously guessed positions:
     - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from CRANE and SEDAN), so it must be at position 1 or 2.
     - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (from SEDAN and CRANE), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
2. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, S, and D are not in the word.
3. **Remaining Letters**: The word contains A, E, and N, plus two unknown letters (not C, R, S, D). Common untested letters include T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for A (1 or 2) and E (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new high-frequency consonants to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters and positions that are invalid for A and E.
- The word ""TAKEN"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It tests A at position 2 (a possible location) and E at position 4 (a possible location).
  - It includes new common consonants (T and K) that haven't been tested.
  - It ends with N (position 5), matching the confirmed pattern.
  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm if A is at position 1 (via a ""-"" for A). Similarly, E at position 4 will be tested.
  - This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities (e.g., if T or K are correct, or if A/E positions are validated).

But then we have to avoid position 3 for A, which is already satisfied. However, we don\'t know if A is in position 1 or not.

Actually, in our guess, A was in position 3 and got a minus, meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3. So in ""SANE"", A is at 2 (which is allowed) and N is at 3 (which is allowed because the constraint for N is only that it cannot be at position 4) and E is at 4 (which is allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay). \n\n  But wait, we also have to avoid the positions we know they are not in? The feedback only tells us that in the first guess, A was not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5. They could be in other positions.\n\n  However, we must also note that the word ""SANE"" has the letter S which we haven\'t tested. Also, it doesn\'t have C or R (which we know are excluded).\n\n  But let\'s check the positions for A, N, E in ""SANE"":\n      Position 1: S (new)\n      Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, and this is a new position for A, so it might be correct or not)\n      Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, and this is a new position for N, so it might be correct or not)\n      Position 4: E (we know E is in the word, and this is a new position for E, so it might be correct or not)\n\n  This word uses three of the known letters and one new letter (S). But we have only four letters? Actually, ""SANE"" is 5 letters? No, it\'s 4. So we need 5-letter words.\n\n  We need 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two new letters.\n\n  Let\'s try ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.\n\n  How about ""SNAKE""? \n      S, N, A, K, E -> 5 letters.\n      Positions: \n          1: S (new)\n          2: N (we know N is in the word, but in the first guess N was at position 4 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at 4)\n          3: A (we know A is in the word, but in the first guess A was at 3 and now we put it at 3 again?

But the feedback already told us it\'s not at 5, so if we put it at 5 again, we know it will be a minus. But we want to use the E in a new position to see if it is at 5? Actually, we already know it\'s not at 5, so we should avoid putting it at 5 to save a position for a new letter? \n\n  However, we have to include E, and we have to put it in one of the positions 1,2,3,4 (because 5 is forbidden). So in ""NAIVE"", E is at 5 -> that\'s the same as before and we know it\'s wrong. So we would get a minus for E again, which we already know. That doesn\'t give new information.\n\n  We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4). So we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\n  Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is not ideal because E is at 5.\n\n  How about ""ANVIL""? \n      A, N, V, I, L -> but missing E?

Yes, but 3 is allowed. However, we don\'t have a constraint for N at 3? Actually, the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, so 3 is a new position for N and allowed.\n          4: E -> but we know E cannot be at 5? Actually, we can put E at 4? Yes, because the constraint for E is only that it cannot be at 5. Position 4 is allowed.\n          5: L (new)\n\n  This word ""PANEL"" has:\n      P, A, N, E, L\n      A is at 2 (new position), N at 3 (new position), E at 4 (new position). And we are testing two new letters: P and L.\n\n  This seems good.\n\n  But note: we are not required to put all known letters? Actually, we know the word has A, N, and E, so we must include them. And we are including them.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn\'t have N. We must include N.\n\n  Another option: ""SANDY"" -> \n      S, A, N, D, Y\n      But missing E? We must include E.\n\n  How about ""SENTA""? Not a common word. We need valid English words.\n\n  Another idea: ""STAIN"" -> but missing E.\n\n  We need a word with A, N, E.\n\n  Let me list some words: \n      ""ANODE"", ""ATONE"", ""DAVEN"", ""EVADE"", ""MANED"", ""NAMED"", ""PANED"", ""PEAN"", ""WANED"", etc.\n\n  But we have to avoid C and R.\n\n  Consider ""ANODE"": \n      A, N, O, D, E\n      Positions:\n          1: A (allowed)\n          2: N (allowed) -> but note: we are putting N at 2, which is new.\n          3: O (new)\n          4: D (new)\n          5: E -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5). So we get a minus for E again, which we already know.\n\n  How about ""ATONE"":\n      A, T, O, N, E\n      Positions:\n          1: A (allowed)\n          2: T (new)\n          3: O (new)\n          4: N -> but wait, we know N cannot be at 4? Because in the first guess N was at 4 and got a minus. So we cannot put N at 4. This is invalid.\n\n  How about ""MANED"":\n      M, A, N, E, D\n      Positions:\n          1: M (new)\n          2: A (allowed)\n          3: N -> but we are putting N at 3? That\'s allowed because the constraint is only for position 4. \n          4: E -> allowed (because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)\n          5: D (new)\n\n  This word ""MANED"" has:\n      M, A, N, E, D\n      A at 2 (new), N at 3 (new), E at 4 (new). And we test M and D.\n\n  This is a valid English word (meaning: having a mane).\n\n  Alternatively, ""NAMED"":\n      N, A, M, E, D\n      Positions:\n          1: N (allowed, because not 4)\n          2: A (allowed, because not 3)\n          3: M (new)\n          4: E (allowed, because not 5)\n          5: D (new)\n\n  This is also valid.\n\n  But note: we have two options: ""MANED"" and ""NAMED"". Which one to choose?\n\n  We want to maximize information. We don\'t know the positions of A, N, E. In ""MANED"", we are putting A at 2, N at 3, E at 4. In ""NAMED"", we are putting N at 1, A at 2, E at 4.\n\n  We also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates.\n\n  Both words test two new letters (M and D) and use the known letters in new positions.\n\n  Another word: ""PAVED"" -> but that has V and D, but missing N? We need N.\n\n  How about ""WAXEN""? \n      W, A, X, E, N\n      Positions:\n          1: W (new)\n          2: A (allowed)\n          3: X (new)\n          4: E (allowed)\n          5: N -> but we know N cannot be at 4? Actually, the constraint for N is that it cannot be at 4, but 5 is allowed. However, we have E at 4: that\'s allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay.\n\n  But note: we are putting N at 5? That\'s allowed because the first guess had N at 4 and it was wrong, but 5 is a new position.\n\n  However, we have to check if ""WAXEN"" is a common word? It means made of wax, and it\'s acceptable.\n\n  But we are testing X which is a less common letter. Maybe we should choose a word with more common letters.\n\n  Considering common letters, let\'s try to use S, T, L, etc.\n\n  How about ""STALE""? But we don\'t have N? We must include N.\n\n  How about ""STANE""? Not a common word.\n\n  How about ""SNARE""? But we know R is excluded, so we cannot use R.\n\n  How about ""SLANE""? Not common.\n\n  How about ""LEANT""? \n      L, E, A, N, T\n      Positions:\n          1: L (new)\n          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> but we are putting E at 2, which is new.\n          3: A -> not allowed! Because we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess). So invalid.\n\n  How about ""LATEN""? Not common.\n\n  After considering, let\'s go with ""MANED"" or ""NAMED"". \n\n  I think ""NAMED"" is a more common word. Also, it tests N at position 1, which we haven\'t tested before.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for the letters. For A, we avoid position 3; for N, avoid position 4; for E, avoid position 5.\n\n  In ""NAMED"":\n      N at 1: allowed (because we only know N is not at 4)\n      A at 2: allowed (because we only know A is not at 3)\n      M at 3: new\n      E at 4: allowed (because we only know E is not at 5)\n      D at 5: new\n\n  This is valid.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose ""PANED"" (if it\'s a word? It means having panes, like a window) but we don\'t have that in our vocabulary? \n\n  Another common word: ""ADIEU"" is not possible because it doesn\'t have N.\n\n  Let me check: we must include A, N, E. So ""ADIEU"" is out.\n\n  I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.\n\n  But let\'s also consider ""OAKEN"" (made of oak) -> \n      O, A, K, E, N\n      Positions:\n          1: O (new)\n          2: A (allowed)\n          3: K (new)\n          4: E (allowed)\n          5: N (allowed) -> because N was not at 4, but 5 is new.\n\n  This is also valid.\n\n  However, we are testing O and K, which are common? \n\n  But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common consonants in English are T, S, L, etc. \n\n  How about ""TANGO""? -> but missing E.\n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that has two N\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it doesn\'t have E? Wait, ""SENNA"" has two N\'s and an E? \n      S, E, N, N, A -> but that\'s two N\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. The feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, we have no evidence. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.\n\n  How about ""STADE""? -> but missing N.\n\n  How about ""STEAN""? Not common.\n\n  How about ""MEAN""? Only 4 letters.\n\n  After reconsideration, I think ""NAMED"" is a good choice.\n\n  But let\'s see if we can include more common letters. The letters we haven\'t tested and are common: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.\n\n  We are testing M and D in ""NAMED"". M and D are moderately common.\n\n  Another word: ""SALET"" (a historical word for a helmet) -> but missing N and E? We need both.\n\n  How about ""SANE?"" -> too short.\n\n  How about ""SNEAD""? (a surname) -> \n      S, N, E, A, D\n      Positions:\n          1: S (new)\n          2: N (allowed) -> but we are putting N at 2? That\'s allowed.\n          3: E (new) -> but we are putting E at 3? That\'s allowed because E cannot be at 5, but 3 is okay.\n          4: A -> but we know A cannot be at 3? Actually, we can put A at 4? There is no constraint for A at 4. The constraint is only for position 3. So allowed.\n          5: D (new)\n\n  This word ""SNEAD"" has S, N, E, A, D. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.\n\n  But note: we are putting A at position 4? That\'s allowed. And we are putting E at 3? That\'s allowed.\n\n  However, we are putting N at 2? That\'s allowed.\n\n  This word tests two common letters: S and D.\n\n  But is ""SNEAD"" a valid word? It is a proper noun (golfer) but sometimes Wordle accepts proper nouns? Actually, the original Wordle uses common words, and SNEAD might be accepted? But to be safe, we should use more common words.\n\n  How about ""SEDAN""? \n      S, E, D, A, N\n      Positions:\n          1: S (new)\n          2: E (allowed, because not 5) -> and we are putting E at 2, which is new.\n          3: D (new)\n          4: A (allowed, because not 3) -> 4 is new for A.\n          5: N (allowed, because not 4) -> 5 is new for N.\n\n  This word ""SEDAN"" is a common word. It includes A, N, E and tests S and D.\n\n  And it places the known letters in all new positions: \n      E at 2 (was at 5 in first guess, now 2)\n      A at 4 (was at 3, now 4)\n      N at 5 (was at 4, now 5)\n\n  This is ideal because we are testing all known letters in positions that we haven\'t tried before.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""SEDAN"".\n\n  Let me confirm the constraints:\n      A: was at 3 (wrong), now at 4 -> allowed.\n      N: was at 4 (wrong), now at 5 -> allowed.\n      E: was at 5 (wrong), now at 2 -> allowed.\n\n  And we are testing two new common letters: S and D.\n\n  Also, we avoid C and R.\n\n  So, the next guess: ""SEDAN""\n\n  We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n  But note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more tries.\n\n  Therefore, I will guess ""SEDAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C and R are not in the secret word (x).\n- A, N, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-), meaning:\n  - A is not in position 3.\n  - N is not in position 4.\n  - E is not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes A, N, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoids C and R (excluded letters).\n- Places A, N, and E in new positions (A not at 3, N not at 4, E not at 5).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""SEDAN"" fits perfectly:\n- Contains A, N, and E.\n- Uses new letters S and D (common consonants).\n- Positions:\n  - S (new) at position 1.\n  - E at position 2 (new position for E, avoiding position 5).\n  - D (new) at position 3.\n  - A at position 4 (new position for A, avoiding position 3).\n  - N at position 5 (new position for N, avoiding position 4).\n\nThis guess tests all known letters in untried positions and introduces two new letters, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>SEDAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: SEDAN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) D(x) A(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)\n- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)\n- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nSecond guess: SEDAN\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)\n- N: ✓ (in the word and at position 5)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. Confirmed letters:\n   - N is in the word and is at position 5 (from SEDAN: N is correct at position 5).\n\n2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions:\n   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from SEDAN).\n   - E: present, but not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 2 (from SEDAN).\n\n3. Letters not in the word:\n   - C, R (from CRANE)\n   - S, D (from SEDAN)\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- A, E, and N (with N at position 5).\n- We know N is at position 5, so the word ends with N.\n\nThe word structure: _ _ _ _ N\n\nWe know A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3,4 for A (and also not at 5 because that\'s N) and not at positions 2,5 for E (and position 5 is taken by N, so E cannot be there anyway).\n\nPossible positions for A: since it cannot be at 3 or 4, and 5 is N, so A must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, for E: it cannot be at 2 or 5, and 5 is taken by N, so E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: position 1 and 2 are the only ones left for A? Actually, the positions are 1,2,3,4. We have:\n\n- Position 5: N (fixed)\n\nSo the first four positions are open for A, E, and two other letters.\n\nWe know A cannot be at 3 or 4, so A must be at 1 or 2.\n\nE cannot be at 2 or 5, so E can be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: if A is at 1, then E cannot be at 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 2, then E cannot be at 2 (which we already know).\n\nWe also have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we have A, E, N, so two more distinct letters? We don\'t know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates indicated).\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, S, D.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Ends with N (position 5 is N)\n- Contains A and E (and two other letters that are not excluded)\n- A is at 1 or 2\n- E is at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 and not 5, which is already taken)\n- Avoids C, R, S, D.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nSince N is at the end, we can think of words ending with ""N"" that have A and E.\n\nPossible patterns:\n\n- If A is at 1: A _ _ _ N\n- If A is at 2: _ A _ _ N\n\nAnd E must be in one of the remaining positions.\n\nWe also know that in SEDAN, we had A at 4 and it was wrong, and E at 2 and it was wrong.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, if A is at 1: A _ _ _ N\n\nThe third and fourth positions are open. E can be at 3 or 4 (since it cannot be at 2 and 5, and 1 is taken by A).\n\nSo:\n- A _ E _ N\n- A _ _ E N\n\nBut note: in the first guess, A was at 3 and wrong, but that doesn\'t directly constrain E. Also, we have to avoid S, D, C, R.\n\nSimilarly, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N\n\nThen E can be at 1, 3, or 4? But position 1 is available, 3 and 4 are available. However, E cannot be at 2 (which is taken by A) and 5 (taken by N). So E can be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut if E is at 1: E A _ _ N\nIf E is at 3: _ A E _ N\nIf E is at 4: _ A _ E N\n\nWe need to test these possibilities.\n\nWe also have two more letters to fill, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, S, D.\n\nWe want to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form words.\n\nOption 1: A at 1, E at 3: A _ E _ N\nThe second and fourth positions need to be filled. The word would be A X E Y N, where X and Y are letters not in {C,R,S,D} and not A,E,N (but we can use other letters).\n\nPossible words: \n- AVERN? Not a word.\n- AHEAD? But H and D. D is excluded. So no.\n- AWFUL? No E.\n\nHow about ""AGENT""? \n- A, G, E, N, T -> but N is at position 4? We need N at 5. In ""AGENT"", the N is at 4 and T at 5. But we need N at 5. So not.\n\nWe need the last letter to be N. So the word must end with N.\n\nSo for A _ E _ N: the fourth letter must be the one before N. So the word is A X E Y N.\n\nBut ""A _ E _ N"" means:\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: X\nPosition 3: E\nPosition 4: Y\nPosition 5: N\n\nWe need valid words. For example:\n- ""AXIOM"" doesn\'t end with N.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ABERN"" not a word.\n- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> but that\'s A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). But we have E at 4? And we are in the pattern A _ E _ N? No, in ""ALIEN"", the E is at 4, so it would be A _ _ E N, not A _ E _ N.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nPattern A _ E _ N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.\n\nExample: I can\'t think of a common word. ""AVEN""? Only 4 letters. ""HAVEN"" has H at 1, not A.\n\nAnother pattern: A _ _ E N: positions 1=A, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=N.\n\nThis is more common. Words like:\n- ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> but S is excluded.\n- ""AMEN"": only 4 letters.\n- ""ARBEN"" not a word.\n- ""AWAIT"" doesn\'t end with N.\n\nHow about ""AXMEN""? Not common.\n\nAlternatively, if A is at 2: _ A _ _ N\n\nAnd E at 1: E A _ _ N\n- Example: ""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> but duplicate E? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in EATEN, E is at 1 and 4? But we have E at 1 and then at 4? The word has two E\'s. But we don\'t have evidence for duplicates. Let\'s avoid for now.\n\n- ""EARTH"": doesn\'t end with N.\n\nE at 3: _ A E _ N\n- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> but we need E at 4? In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4? Positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). So that\'s _ A _ E N, not _ A E _ N.\n\nPattern _ A E _ N: position 1=?, 2=A, 3=E, 4=?, 5=N.\n\nExample: ""TALEN"" not common. ""MAZEN"" not common. ""PAYEN"" not common.\n\nE at 4: _ A _ E N\n- Example: ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). This fits.\n\nSo ""HAVEN"" is a candidate. But we have to check excluded letters: H, A, V, E, N. We haven\'t excluded H or V. And A, E, N are in the word.\n\nBut we have feedback that in SEDAN, E was at position 2 and was wrong. In ""HAVEN"", E is at 4, which is allowed. Also, A is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3 or 4, and 2 is new).\n\nBut we also have to consider: in CRANE, A was at 3 and wrong, and in SEDAN, A was at 4 and wrong. So A is not at 3 or 4, so at 2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, E is not at 2 or 5, so at 4 is possible.\n\nBut we have not tested H and V.\n\nAnother candidate: ""RAVEN"" but R is excluded.\n\n""MAVEN"": M, A, V, E, N -> same as HAVEN but with M.\n\n""WAVEN""? Not common.\n\n""BAKEN""? Not common.\n\n""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5). This fits the pattern _ A _ E N.\n\nAnd T and K are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""BAKER"" has R, excluded.\n\n""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N.\n\n""FAKEN""? Not common, but ""FAKEN"" might be a variant? Prefer common words.\n\nCommon words: TAKEN, WAKEN, HAVEN, MAVEN, RAVEN (but R excluded), etc.\n\nNow, back to the possibility of A at 1.\n\nPattern A _ _ E N: \n- ""ASHEN"": but S excluded.\n- ""AMEN"" too short.\n- ""AWAKE"" doesn\'t end with N.\n- ""AXIOM"" doesn\'t end with N.\n- ""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5). This fits A _ _ E N.\n\nAnd L and I are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""ARIEN"" not common.\n\nSo candidates: \n- For pattern _ A _ E N: TAKEN, WAKEN, MAVEN, HAVEN, etc.\n- For pattern A _ _ E N: ALIEN.\n\nWe also have the pattern with E at position 1: E A _ _ N, but we couldn\'t find a common word without duplicates (like EATEN has two E\'s).\n\nAnd pattern _ A E _ N: hard to find words.\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.\n\nWe have excluded: C, R, S, D.\n\nWe have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, D.\n\nNew common letters: T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.\n\nWe know the word has A, E, N (with N at 5).\n\nFor the next guess, we can try:\n\nOption 1: ""TAKEN"" - tests T and K, and has A at 2, E at 4, N at 5.\nBut we are not sure if A is at 2 or 1. If we guess ""TAKEN"" and A is actually at 1, then we might get A in the wrong position.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""ALIEN"", we test L and I, and have A at 1, E at 4, N at 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which pattern.\n\nWe could also choose a word that doesn\'t put A at 1 or 2, but we know A must be at 1 or 2, so we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A and E in the possible positions and tests new letters, even if it doesn\'t fit the exact pattern we think.\n\nBut we have to include A, E, and N (at 5).\n\nWe also have two more letters to guess.\n\nTo maximize information, we might choose a word that has A at 1 and E at 3, for example, to test that pattern, but we couldn\'t find a common word for A _ E _ N.\n\nAnother idea: we know E can be at 1, 3, or 4. We haven\'t tested E at 1 or 3 yet.\n\nSimilarly, A at 1 or 2.\n\nWe can try to test E at 3.\n\nFor example, a word with E at 3: _ _ E _ N\n\nAnd A at 1 or 2.\n\nIf A at 1: A _ E _ N -> no common word found.\n\nIf A at 2: _ A E _ N -> no common word found.\n\nSo maybe focus on the patterns we have.\n\nLet\'s list the candidates we have:\n\n1. ALIEN: A at 1, L, I, E at 4, N at 5. Tests L and I.\n2. TAKEN: T at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests T and K.\n3. HAVEN: H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests H and V.\n4. MAVEN: M at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, N at 5. Tests M and V.\n\nWe can choose one that tests common letters.\n\nT is a very common letter, so ""TAKEN"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, L and I are common, so ""ALIEN"" is good.\n\nBut note: in ""TAKEN"", we are putting A at 2. If A is actually at 1, then we will get A as \'-\' and know it\'s at 1.\n\nSimilarly, in ""ALIEN"", A is at 1, if A is at 2, we get A as \'-\'.\n\nSo either way, we get information.\n\nWe also need to consider that E is at 4 in both. We know E is not at 4? No, we don\'t know that. We only know E is not at 2 or 5. Position 4 is possible.\n\nIn fact, in SEDAN, E was at 2 and was wrong, but we haven\'t tested E at 4.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""TAKEN"". It tests T and K, which are common.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""WAKEN"" (W, A, K, E, N) same as TAKEN but with W.\n\n""BAKEN"" not common.\n\n""MAKEN"" not common.\n\n""LAKEN"" not common.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" is common.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALIEN"" is common.\n\nBut ""ALIEN"" has I, which is a vowel, and we already have two vowels (A and E). Consonants might give more information.\n\nWe can also consider ""OAKEN"" (O, A, K, E, N) but that has A at 2, E at 4, same as TAKEN, but with O and K. O is a vowel.\n\nBut we already know A and E are present, so testing consonants might be better.\n\nLet\'s go with ""TAKEN"".\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid the excluded letters. T and K are not excluded.\n\nSo guess: ""TAKEN""\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":\n- T: not in HAVEN -> x\n- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we put A at 2 -> ✓? But in ""TAKEN"", A is at 2, and if the secret word has A at 2, then it would be correct.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""ALIEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":\n- T: not in ALIEN -> x\n- A: in ALIEN but at position 1, not 2 -> - (wrong position)\n- K: not in ALIEN -> x\n- E: in ALIEN at position 4, and we have E at 4 -> ✓\n- N: ✓\n\nSo we would get: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)\n\nThat would tell us that E and N are correct at 4 and 5, and A is present but not at 2, so A must be at 1.\n\nThen we can guess ""ALIEN"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we get all correct.\n\nIf the secret word is ""HAVEN"", then in ""TAKEN"":\n- T: not in HAVEN -> x\n- A: in HAVEN at position 2, and we have at 2 -> ✓\n- K: not in HAVEN -> x\n- E: in HAVEN at position 4, and we have at 4 -> ✓\n- N: ✓\n\nSo we get T(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)\n\nThen we know A, E, N are correct at 2,4,5, and the first letter is not T, and the third letter is not K. Then we can guess words like ""HAVEN"", ""MAVEN"", etc.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" is a good guess because it tests two new consonants and can help narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALIEN"" would test L and I.\n\nBut T and K are more common? T is the most common letter.\n\nI think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess.

Specifically:\n  - A is not at position 3.\n  - N is not at position 4.\n  - E is not at position 5.\n- **SEDAN**: S and D are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not at position 2 (-), A is in the word but not at position 4 (-), and N is correct at position 5 (✓).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:\n   - N is confirmed at position 5 (so the word ends with N: `_ _ _ _ N`).\n   - A and E are in the word but not in previously guessed positions:\n     - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from CRANE and SEDAN), so it must be at position 1 or 2.\n     - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (from SEDAN and CRANE), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n2. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, S, and D are not in the word.\n3. **Remaining Letters**: The word contains A, E, and N, plus two unknown letters (not C, R, S, D). Common untested letters include T, L, M, P, O, U, B, G, H, I, K, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test possible positions for A (1 or 2) and E (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new high-frequency consonants to maximize information.\n- Avoid excluded letters and positions that are invalid for A and E.\n- The word ""TAKEN"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - It tests A at position 2 (a possible location) and E at position 4 (a possible location).\n  - It includes new common consonants (T and K) that haven\'t been tested.\n  - It ends with N (position 5), matching the confirmed pattern.\n  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm if A is at position 1 (via a ""-"" for A). Similarly, E at position 4 will be tested.\n  - This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities (e.g., if T or K are correct, or if A/E positions are validated).\n\n<guess>TAKEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: SEDAN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) D(x) A(-) N(✓)\nGuess 3: TAKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-), so not position 3
- N: in word but wrong position (-), so not position 4
- E: in word but wrong position (-), so not position 5

From Guess 2 (SEDAN):
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-), so not position 2
- D: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-), so not position 4
- N: correct position (✓), so position 5 is N

From Guess 3 (TAKEN):
- T: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓), so position 2 is A
- K: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓), so position 4 is E
- N: correct position (✓), so position 5 is N (already known)

Now, we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ E N
- Position 2: A (from TAKEN A✓)
- Position 4: E (from TAKEN E✓)
- Position 5: N (from SEDAN N✓ and confirmed in TAKEN)

Also, we have exclusions:
- Letters not in word: C, R, S, D, T, K (from all guesses)
- Positions for A and E: 
  - A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SEDAN) — but now we know it's at position 2.
  - E cannot be at position 2 (from SEDAN) or 5 (from CRANE) — now it's fixed at position 4.

Moreover, we have:
- The word must contain A, E, N (with A at 2, E at 4, N at 5) and two more letters: one at position 1 and one at position 3.
- These two letters must not be C, R, S, D, T, K.
- We know from CRANE that the word has A, N, E, and possibly one or two more letters (but since it's 5 letters, and only two positions open, we need two distinct letters? Unless duplicates, but no evidence so far).

Now, we need to find the two missing letters for positions 1 and 3.

List of letters we haven't tested and are not excluded: 
B, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters: B, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, etc.

The word pattern is: [1] A [3] E N

So the word is: ? A ? E N

We need to find valid English words of this pattern.

Examples of common words:
- HAVEN: H at 1, V at 3 -> H and V are not excluded? H and V are in the list.
- MAVEN: M at 1, V at 3.
- RAVEN: R is excluded, so no.
- WAVEN: not common.
- FAKEN: not common.
- BAKEN: not common.
- TAKEN: we tried, but T and K are excluded now.

Other possibilities:
- HAZEN: not common.
- LANE: is 4 letters, need 5.
- With I: PAINT has T? No, T excluded. Or GAIN, etc. but pattern is ?A?EN.

Let's think:
Position 1: any letter from untested set.
Position 3: any letter from untested set, forming a word.

Candidates:
- HAVEN: H (1), A (2), V (3), E (4), N (5)
- MAVEN: M (1), A (2), V (3), E (4), N (5)
- RAVEN: excluded because R.
- WAVEN: W (1), A (2), V (3), E (4), N (5) — ""waven"" is not a common word; ""wave"" but not with N? ""Waven"" may be obsolete.
- BAKEN: B (1), A (2), K (3)? But K is excluded (from TAKEN K=x). So no.
- PAXEN: not a word.

Other possibilities:
- LAZEN: not common.
- JADED: J and D, but D excluded? And pattern not ?A?EN.

What about ""MAVEN""? Acceptable.

""HOVEN""? Not common.

""BAVEN""? Not common.

""GAYEN""? Not common.

""HAYEN""? Not common.

""FAXEN""? Not common.

Perhaps we consider:
- ""PAGEN"" not common.
- ""MAGEN"" not common.

But ""MAVEN is known, as is HAVEN"".

Also, ""FAMED"": F (1), A (2), M (3), E (4), D (5) — but D is excluded? From SEDAN D=x.

Not.

Another word: ""WAKEN"": W (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) — but K is excluded.

Similarly, ""BAKEN"" has K and is not common.

What about ""LAMED"": L (1), A (2), M (3), E (4), D (5) — D excluded.

""GAMED"": G (1), A (2), M (3), E (4), D (5) — D excluded.

So letters at position 1 and 3 must not be excluded and not duplicated.

Now, another common word: ""GIVEN"" — but has I and V, and G? Positions: G(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). But we need position 2 to be A, not I. So not.

Similarly, ""HIDDEN"" has duplicates and wrong letters.

Back to pattern: ?A?EN

Common words: 
- Haven (H, V)
- Maven (M, V)
- Ravel is not and R excluded.
- Water not.

What about ""HALEN""? Not common, but ""Halen"" as in Van Halen? Proper noun.

Perhaps we consider ""JAMEN""? Not.

But we have HAVEN and MAVEN as valid.

Another: ""RAVEN"" excluded.

""CAVEN"" C excluded.

So likely candidates: HAVEN and MAVEN.

We also have ""FAVEN""? Not.

""WAVEN"" — if accepted.

But the most common are HAVEN and MAVEN.

We can test either, but to maximize information? Actually, we have two positions to fill. We can choose a word that tests more common letters.

But we have no new feedback for other letters.

We are at guess 4, so we can try one of these.

If we guess ""HAVEN"", it tests H and V.

Similarly, ""MAVEN"" tests M and V.

Which letters are more common? H and M are common, V is less common.

Since we have many letters to choose from, but only a few words fit.

We can also consider ""PAVEN"" — not common.

Or ""LAVEN"" — L (1), A (2), V (3), E (4), N (5) — ""laven"" is a verb meaning to wash or bathe, but it might be accepted as an old word or in dictionaries.

Similarly, ""BAVEN"" — not found.

So top candidates: HAVEN, MAVEN, LAVEN.

We have to pick one.

But note: we haven't tested H, M, L, V, etc.

V appears in multiple words.

To get information on the third letter, perhaps.

But since we have only two positions, and we are guessing the whole word, if we get one wrong, we know.

We might as well guess ""HAVEN"" because H and V are distinct from M.

Similarly, we can choose ""MAVEN"".

But let's see how many possibilities are left.

The position 1 and 3 must be letters not excluded: so from B,F,G,H,I,J,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But forming words:

If position 1 is H, position 3 must be V -> HAVEN
If M, V -> MAVEN
If L, V -> LAVEN
If G, ? -> no word
If F, ? -> no word
If B, ? -> BAVEN? Not common
etc.

So actually, very few common words: HAVEN, MAVEN, and perhaps LAVEN (if accepted).

We might as well choose one. Since H is more common than M? Or vice versa.

In the context of Wordle, both are acceptable.

We can also consider ""WAVEN"" but it's rare.

Another word: ""GIVEN"" doesn't fit because I at 2, not A.

""HAZEN"" not common.

I think ""HAVEN"" is very common and a safe choice.

Similarly, ""MAVEN"" is also common.

We'll pick ""HAVEN"" to try first.

But note: in CRANE, we had A, N, E in the word, and now we have A and E fixed, and N fixed. So we don't have a letter that must be at position 1 or 3.

So guess: ""HAVEN""

If wrong, we'll try ""MAVEN"" next.

But we have two more guesses after this.

So for this turn, let's go with ""HAVEN"". 

But let's be cautious: we might miss letters.

Another idea: are there other words like ""PAPEN"" no.

Or ""VAPEN"" no.

But we don't have many options.

So <guess>HAVEN</guess>

Now, step-by-step:

- N is fixed at 5, A at 2, E at 4.
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not excluded (C,R,S,D,T,K) and not duplicated? Assume no dup.
- The word ?A?EN must be valid English.
- Candidates: HAVEN, MAVEN, LAVEN, and perhaps others (like ""WAVEN"" if accepted).
- We choose ""HAVEN"" as it is very common.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:
     - A, N, E are in the word but not at positions 3, 4, or 5 respectively.
     - C and R are excluded (not in the word).
   - **Guess 2 (SEDAN)**:
     - N is confirmed at position 5 (✓).
     - A and E are in the word but not at positions 4 or 2 respectively.
     - S and D are excluded.
   - **Guess 3 (TAKEN)**:
     - A and E are confirmed at positions 2 (✓) and 4 (✓) respectively.
     - N is reconfirmed at position 5 (✓).
     - T and K are excluded.
   - **Summary**:
     - Positions 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed as A, E, and N → **Word pattern: `_ A _ E N`**.
     - Excluded letters: C, R, S, D, T, K (not in the word).
     - Only positions 1 and 3 need to be solved.

2. **Constraints for Positions 1 and 3**:
   - The letters must be from the English alphabet and not excluded (allowed: B, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - The word must be valid English → Possible candidates (common words fitting `_ A _ E N`): 
     - **HAVEN**: H at 1, V at 3.
     - **MAVEN**: M at 1, V at 3.
     - **LAVEN**: L at 1, V at 3 (less common, meaning ""to wash"").
     - Other rare words like WAVEN are unlikely.
   - No duplicate letters are indicated in feedback → Assume all letters are unique.

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - Since **HAVEN** and **MAVEN** are most common, prioritize testing high-frequency consonants to maximize information:
     - H and M are common consonants; V is less common but consistent.
     - Guess **HAVEN** first to check for H and V:
       - If correct, solved.
       - If incorrect, feedback will reveal whether H or V is valid, simplifying to **MAVEN** (if V is present) or **LAVEN** (if V is absent).

4. **Decision**:
   - **HAVEN** efficiently tests new letters (H, V) within the confirmed pattern. It uses two untested common consonants and relies on minimal assumptions.
   - After this guess:
     - If partial feedback (e.g., V not in word), switch to M- or L-based words.
     - Only 3 guesses used → 3 remain for adjustments.

<guess>HAVEN</guess>",HAVEN,"We have the following feedback:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
