We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Consider common letters that are left. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should cover new common letters. Let's aim for a word with:

- Common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Some candidate words without C,R,A,N,E:
- ""SPILT"": includes S,P,I,L,T
- ""LIGHT"": includes L,I,G,H,T
- ""TOUGH"": includes T,O,U,G,H

Let me consider ""SOLID"": 
  S, O, L, I, D -> but O is a vowel and S, L, T (T is missing?) are common.

Another option: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This covers common letters: M, O, I, S, T.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as not in the word (x). So, we know the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. For ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in word)
   - O: x (not in word)
   - I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position! So the third letter is I)
   - S: x (not in word)
   - T: x (not in word)

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters, and the third letter is fixed as I.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available letters: We have to use the remaining alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

Available vowels: U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be a consonant too). Other vowels are gone.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with I in the third position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Common letters to try: We want to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants left: L, D, B, G, H, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> Check letters: G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded? 
  Excluded: A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, L, D are all allowed.

- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> similarly, B, U, I, L, D are allowed.

- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C is x). So invalid because of C.

- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded.

- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, I, D: all allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but M is excluded (from moist: M is x). So invalid.

We must avoid M.

Another idea: ""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> M is excluded.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> but T is excluded (from moist: T is x). So T cannot be used.

Similarly, ""BUILT"" has T, excluded.

So, we need to avoid T.

Let me list words with pattern _ _ I _ _ without the excluded letters.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> all allowed.
- ""JUICE"" has E and C, excluded.
- ""QUILT"" has T, excluded.
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> E is excluded (from crane: E is x). So invalid.
- ""QUIFF"": Q, U, I, F, F -> but Q and double F? Not a common word, but let's check validity. ""Quiff"" is a valid word meaning a piece of hair. But we can consider.

However, we want to maximize information. ""GUILD"" and ""BUILD"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the first two letters and the last two are unknown.

Another word: ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but N is excluded (from crane: N is x). So invalid.

""FLING"": F, L, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K -> N excluded.

""CHILL"": C is excluded.

So, back to ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

Also, ""QUIPU"": Q, U, I, P, U -> but it has two U's? And is it valid? ""Quipu"" is a valid word (an ancient Inca device), but we might avoid rare words.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T excluded.

Another common word: ""WHISK"": W, H, I, S, K -> but S is excluded (from moist: S is x). So invalid.

""SHIP"" is 4 letters.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> R and C excluded.

So, let's stick with more common words: ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

We can also consider ""JUICE"" but it has E and C, excluded.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> but the third letter must be I, so not matching pattern.

The pattern is fixed: third letter I.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" - but O is excluded, and it has O and A (A excluded).

""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D -> A excluded.

""RABID"": R and A excluded.

So, I think ""GUILD"" or ""BUILD"" or ""FLUID"" are good choices.

Let's choose ""BUILD"" because it uses B and U, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters, and BUILD: B, U, I, L, D are all not excluded.

Similarly, GUILD: G, U, I, L, D.

FLUID: F, L, U, I, D.

We might also consider ""QUIET"" but excluded.

Another one: ""QUICK"" has C.

""BLITZ"": B, L, I, T, Z -> T is excluded.

""FLUFF"": F, L, U, F, F -> but third letter U? No, we need I in third. Pattern: _ _ I _ _, so first two, then I, then two more.

""FLUFF"" is F,L,U,F,F - third letter is U, not I.

So, not.

""SKIFF"": S and K? S excluded.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BUILD"".

But let's confirm: 
- B: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- I: we know it's correct, but we are using it in the third position.
- L: not excluded
- D: not excluded

Yes.

We could also use ""GUILD"" or ""FLUID"", but ""BUILD"" is a very common word.

So, I'll guess ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>

After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): Only the letter ""I"" is correct and in the right position (third letter). The other letters (M, O, S, T) are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has ""I"" as its third letter.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.
- Available letters for the guess: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" in the third position.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, U, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid all excluded letters.

Selected word: **""BUILD""**  
- B: New consonant, not excluded.  
- U: New vowel, not excluded.  
- I: Confirmed correct position (third letter).  
- L: New consonant, not excluded.  
- D: New consonant, not excluded.  

This guess tests four new common letters while respecting the constraints.

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> Check letters: G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded? 
  Excluded: A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, L, D are all allowed.

- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> similarly, B, U, I, L, D are allowed.

- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C is x). So invalid because of C.

- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded.

- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, I, D: all allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but M is excluded (from moist: M is x). So invalid.

We must avoid M.

Another idea: ""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> M is excluded.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> but T is excluded (from moist: T is x). So T cannot be used.

Similarly, ""BUILT"" has T, excluded.

So, we need to avoid T.

Let me list words with pattern _ _ I _ _ without the excluded letters.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> all allowed.
- ""JUICE"" has E and C, excluded.
- ""QUILT"" has T, excluded.
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> E is excluded (from crane: E is x). So invalid.
- ""QUIFF"": Q, U, I, F, F -> but Q and double F? Not a common word, but let's check validity. ""Quiff"" is a valid word meaning a piece of hair. But we can consider.

However, we want to maximize information. ""GUILD"" and ""BUILD"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the first two letters and the last two are unknown.

Another word: ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but N is excluded (from crane: N is x). So invalid.

""FLING"": F, L, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K -> N excluded.

""CHILL"": C is excluded.

So, back to ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

Also, ""QUIPU"": Q, U, I, P, U -> but it has two U's? And is it valid? ""Quipu"" is a valid word (an ancient Inca device), but we might avoid rare words.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T excluded.

Another common word: ""WHISK"": W, H, I, S, K -> but S is excluded (from moist: S is x). So invalid.

""SHIP"" is 4 letters.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> R and C excluded.

So, let's stick with more common words: ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

We can also consider ""JUICE"" but it has E and C, excluded.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> but the third letter must be I, so not matching pattern.

The pattern is fixed: third letter I.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" - but O is excluded, and it has O and A (A excluded).

""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D -> A excluded.

""RABID"": R and A excluded.

So, I think ""GUILD"" or ""BUILD"" or ""FLUID"" are good choices.

Let's choose ""BUILD"" because it uses B and U, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters, and BUILD: B, U, I, L, D are all not excluded.

Similarly, GUILD: G, U, I, L, D.

FLUID: F, L, U, I, D.

We might also consider ""QUIET"" but excluded.

Another one: ""QUICK"" has C.

""BLITZ"": B, L, I, T, Z -> T is excluded.

""FLUFF"": F, L, U, F, F -> but third letter U? No, we need I in third. Pattern: _ _ I _ _, so first two, then I, then two more.

""FLUFF"" is F,L,U,F,F - third letter is U, not I.

So, not.

""SKIFF"": S and K? S excluded.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BUILD"".

But let's confirm: 
- B: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- I: we know it's correct, but we are using it in the third position.
- L: not excluded
- D: not excluded

Yes.

We could also use ""GUILD"" or ""FLUID"", but ""BUILD"" is a very common word.

So, I'll guess ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): Only the letter ""I"" is correct and in the right position (third letter). The other letters (M, O, S, T) are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has ""I"" as its third letter.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.
- Available letters for the guess: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" in the third position.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, U, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid all excluded letters.

Selected word: **""BUILD""**  
- B: New consonant, not excluded.  
- U: New vowel, not excluded.  
- I: Confirmed correct position (third letter).  
- L: New consonant, not excluded.  
- D: New consonant, not excluded.  

This guess tests four new common letters while respecting the constraints.",Guess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,guild,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include C, R, A, N, or E.

Consider common letters that are left. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should cover new common letters. Let's aim for a word with:
- I or O (common vowels)
- Common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Some candidate words without C,R,A,N,E:
- ""SPILT"": includes S,P,I,L,T
- ""LIGHT"": includes L,I,G,H,T
- ""TOUGH"": includes T,O,U,G,H

But note: we also want to avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Looking at word frequency, S and T are very common. Also, O and I are common vowels.

Let me consider ""SOLID"": 
  S, O, L, I, D -> but O is a vowel and S, L, T (T is missing?) are common.

Another option: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This covers common letters: M, O, I, S, T.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S.

But let me check if they are valid words: Yes, both ""moist"" and ""pious"" are valid.

Since the feedback showed none of the first letters, we are free to choose any word without those.

I think ""MOIST"" is a strong choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T — all common letters.

So, I'll go with ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as not in the word (x). So, we know the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. For ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in word)
   - O: x (not in word)
   - I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position! So the third letter is I)
   - S: x (not in word)
   - T: x (not in word)

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters, and the third letter is fixed as I.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available letters: We have to use the remaining alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

Available vowels: U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be a consonant too). Other vowels are gone.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with I in the third position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Common letters to try: We want to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants left: L, D, B, G, H, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> Check letters: G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded? 
  Excluded: A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, L, D are all allowed.

- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> similarly, B, U, I, L, D are allowed.

- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C is x). So invalid because of C.

- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded.

- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, I, D: all allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but M is excluded (from moist: M is x). So invalid.

We must avoid M.

Another idea: ""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> M is excluded.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> but T is excluded (from moist: T is x). So T cannot be used.

Similarly, ""BUILT"" has T, excluded.

So, we need to avoid T.

Let me list words with pattern _ _ I _ _ without the excluded letters.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> all allowed.
- ""JUICE"" has E and C, excluded.
- ""QUILT"" has T, excluded.
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> E is excluded (from crane: E is x). So invalid.
- ""QUIFF"": Q, U, I, F, F -> but Q and double F? Not a common word, but let's check validity. ""Quiff"" is a valid word meaning a piece of hair. But we can consider.

However, we want to maximize information. ""GUILD"" and ""BUILD"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the first two letters and the last two are unknown.

Another word: ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but N is excluded (from crane: N is x). So invalid.

""FLING"": F, L, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K -> N excluded.

""CHILL"": C is excluded.

So, back to ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

Also, ""QUIPU"": Q, U, I, P, U -> but it has two U's? And is it valid? ""Quipu"" is a valid word (an ancient Inca device), but we might avoid rare words.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T excluded.

Another common word: ""WHISK"": W, H, I, S, K -> but S is excluded (from moist: S is x). So invalid.

""SHIP"" is 4 letters.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> R and C excluded.

So, let's stick with more common words: ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

We can also consider ""JUICE"" but it has E and C, excluded.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> but the third letter must be I, so not matching pattern.

The pattern is fixed: third letter I.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" - but O is excluded, and it has O and A (A excluded).

""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D -> A excluded.

""RABID"": R and A excluded.

So, I think ""GUILD"" or ""BUILD"" or ""FLUID"" are good choices.

Let's choose ""BUILD"" because it uses B and U, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters, and BUILD: B, U, I, L, D are all not excluded.

Similarly, GUILD: G, U, I, L, D.

FLUID: F, L, U, I, D.

We might also consider ""QUIET"" but excluded.

Another one: ""QUICK"" has C.

""BLITZ"": B, L, I, T, Z -> T is excluded.

""FLUFF"": F, L, U, F, F -> but third letter U? No, we need I in third. Pattern: _ _ I _ _, so first two, then I, then two more.

""FLUFF"" is F,L,U,F,F - third letter is U, not I.

So, not.

""SKIFF"": S and K? S excluded.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BUILD"".

But let's confirm: 
- B: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- I: we know it's correct, but we are using it in the third position.
- L: not excluded
- D: not excluded

Yes.

We could also use ""GUILD"" or ""FLUID"", but ""BUILD"" is a very common word.

So, I'll guess ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): Only the letter ""I"" is correct and in the right position (third letter). The other letters (M, O, S, T) are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has ""I"" as its third letter.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.
- Available letters for the guess: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" in the third position.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, U, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid all excluded letters.

Selected word: **""BUILD""**  
- B: New consonant, not excluded.  
- U: New vowel, not excluded.  
- I: Confirmed correct position (third letter).  
- L: New consonant, not excluded.  
- D: New consonant, not excluded.  

This guess tests four new common letters while respecting the constraints.

We have new feedback for Guess 3: ""build""
Feedback: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(✓)

Let's break this down:
- B: x (not in the word) → So B is not in the secret word. This is a new exclusion.
- U: ✓ (correct letter and correct position) → This means U is in the word and it's in the second position.
- I: ✓ (already known from Guess 2) → Confirmed again: third letter is I.
- L: ✓ → L is in the word and in the correct position. Since ""build"" has L in the fourth position, that must be the correct spot.
- D: ✓ → D is in the word and in the correct position. In ""build"", D is the fifth letter, so the fifth letter must be D.

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The second letter is U.
2. The third letter is I.
3. The fourth letter is L.
4. The fifth letter is D.
5. The first letter is still unknown, but we know it's not B (and not any other excluded letters).

Moreover, we have confirmed positions:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: D

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ U I L D

We now only need to find the first letter.

Excluded letters so far (from all feedback):
- From Guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
- From Guess 2: M, O, S, T
- From Guess 3: B

So total excluded: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T

But note: we also know the letters that are in the word: U, I, L, D (and the first letter is unknown).

The first letter cannot be any of the excluded letters, and it cannot be U, I, L, or D because:
- U is in the second position, so if it were in the first, it would have been a ""wrong position"" or ""correct"" in both positions? But in the feedback for ""build"", the U was correct only in the second position. If the first letter were U, it might conflict unless double letters, but let's think.

We don't know if the word allows double letters. However, in ""build"", we used U once and it was marked correct in position 2. If the secret word had U in position 1 as well, then we would have gotten at least a '-' for U if it were also in the word but wrong position, but we didn't use U in position 1. We used B in pos1, which was x.

But since U is only in pos2 and no other U was guessed, we don't know if U can appear twice? However, likely, the word does not have double U, but we cannot be sure. But since no rule says letters can't repeat, we should consider the possibility, but it's rare.

However, the feedback for ""build"" showed only U in pos2 correct, and L and D are single in their positions. So probably no double letters for these.

But the unknown first letter: it must be one of the remaining letters that is not excluded.

Available letters: the alphabet minus excluded minus the letters we know are in the word? But U, I, L, D are already in the word, so they can be used again? However, in positions, since positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed, we only have position 1 to fill.

And position 1 needs a letter that has not been excluded and is valid.

But since we don't know if the word has repeated letters, we should try a letter not already in the word to maximize information? Or we can try a word that completes the pattern.

But we have to guess a word that matches _ U I L D.

What possible words are there?

We need a 5-letter word ending with ""UILD"" but the first letter is variable.

Common words:
- GUILD: starts with G, but we haven't excluded G. However, in our guess we used ""build"" which had B, and now B is excluded. But G is allowed.
- BUILD starts with B, but B is excluded now.
- Other? ""QUILD"" is not a word.
- WILD: but that's 4 letters.

Full words:
- GUILD: G U I L D
- but also ""BUILD"" is not possible because B excluded.

Another word? ""MILT"" is 4 letters.

Is there any other word ending with UILD? Not that I know except GUILD and BUILD.

GUILD is valid.

But have we excluded G? No, G hasn't been used or excluded.

Check excluded: A,B,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T – no G.

So GUILD? But let's check: if secret word is GUILD, then our guess ""build"" had B in first position instead of G, which is excluded? B is x, so in the secret word, if it's GUILD, the first letter is G, which wasn't guessed in ""build"", so that's fine.

Feedback for ""build"" vs GUILD:
- B in pos1: not in the word → so G is in pos1, which we haven't guessed, so that's consistent.
- U: correct in pos2.
- I: correct in pos3.
- L: correct in pos4.
- D: correct in pos5.

Yes, perfect match.

So the word could be GUILD.

But are there other words? Let me think.

Another word: ""HILD"" is not 5 letters. Or ""UILD"" is not a root.

Perhaps ""QUILT"" but T is excluded and pattern doesn't match because it would be Q U I L T, but fifth letter D, so not.

""JUILD"" – not a word.

""FLUID"" – F L U I D, but here positions: pos1 F, pos2 L, pos3 U? No, the pattern requires pos2 U, pos3 I, etc.

FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, so pos3 is U, pos4 I? But we need U in pos2 and I in pos3, so it's different. FLUID doesn't fit _ U I L D.

So likely, the only common word is GUILD.

But what about ""BILKD""? B is excluded, and it would be B-I-L-K-D, not matching U in pos2.

Other? ""SUILD"" – not a word.

Therefore, GUILD should be the word.

But we can verify: in the feedback, we haven't tried G yet. But since we know all positions except the first, and G is available, GUILD must be the word.

Sometimes there are uncommon words, but GUILD is common.

So I will guess GUILD.

But let's make sure about double letters or other possibilities. Suppose the word is ""YULED"", but YULED might not be a word, and pattern doesn't have U in pos2 and L in pos4? ""YULED"": Y-U-L-E-D, but E is excluded, and also it would be Y U L E D, so pos3 is L, not I. Moreover E is excluded.

""PULID"" – not a word.

I think GUILD is the only reasonable answer.

So, our next guess should be GUILD.

But note: we have only one position unknown, so guessing GUILD is logical.

We have more guesses left? We are at guess 3 feedback, so making guess 4.

Response format: return the guessed word in <guess>.

So I'll guess ""guild"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only I is correct and in position 3; M, O, S, T are not in the word.
- **Guess 3: ""build""** → B is not in the word; U, I, L, D are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Deductions:
1. **Word structure**: The secret word must have the form `_ U I L D` (second letter U, third letter I, fourth letter L, fifth letter D). Only the first letter is unknown.
2. **Excluded letters**: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T (from all feedback) cannot appear in the word.
3. **Possible first letters**: Given exclusions and the pattern, the first letter must be one of the remaining unused letters (e.g., F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z). However, since the pattern `_ U I L D` matches common words like ""GUILD,"" and ""GUILD"" avoids all excluded letters, it is a strong candidate.
4. **Reasoning for ""GUILD""**:
   - ""G"" is not excluded and fits the pattern.
   - ""UILD"" matches the known positions (U in pos 2, I in pos 3, L in pos 4, D in pos 5).
   - No other common 5-letter words fit this pattern (e.g., ""BUILD"" is invalid due to B exclusion, and alternatives like ""QUILD"" or ""YUILD"" are not valid English words).

Thus, ""GUILD"" is the most logical guess to solve the secret word.

<guess>guild","We have new feedback for Guess 3: ""build""

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,guild,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include C, R, A, N, or E.

Consider common letters that are left. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should cover new common letters. Let's aim for a word with:
- I or O (common vowels)
- Common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Some candidate words without C,R,A,N,E:
- ""SPILT"": includes S,P,I,L,T
- ""LIGHT"": includes L,I,G,H,T
- ""TOUGH"": includes T,O,U,G,H

But note: we also want to avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Looking at word frequency, S and T are very common. Also, O and I are common vowels.

Let me consider ""SOLID"": 
  S, O, L, I, D -> but O is a vowel and S, L, T (T is missing?) are common.

Another option: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This covers common letters: M, O, I, S, T.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S.

But let me check if they are valid words: Yes, both ""moist"" and ""pious"" are valid.

Since the feedback showed none of the first letters, we are free to choose any word without those.

I think ""MOIST"" is a strong choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T — all common letters.

So, I'll go with ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as not in the word (x). So, we know the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. For ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in word)
   - O: x (not in word)
   - I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position! So the third letter is I)
   - S: x (not in word)
   - T: x (not in word)

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters, and the third letter is fixed as I.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available letters: We have to use the remaining alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

Available vowels: U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be a consonant too). Other vowels are gone.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with I in the third position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Common letters to try: We want to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants left: L, D, B, G, H, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> Check letters: G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded? 
  Excluded: A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, L, D are all allowed.

- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> similarly, B, U, I, L, D are allowed.

- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C is x). So invalid because of C.

- ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded.

- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, I, D: all allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but M is excluded (from moist: M is x). So invalid.

We must avoid M.

Another idea: ""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> M is excluded.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> but T is excluded (from moist: T is x). So T cannot be used.

Similarly, ""BUILT"" has T, excluded.

So, we need to avoid T.

Let me list words with pattern _ _ I _ _ without the excluded letters.

Possible words:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> all allowed.
- ""JUICE"" has E and C, excluded.
- ""QUILT"" has T, excluded.
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> all allowed.
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> E is excluded (from crane: E is x). So invalid.
- ""QUIFF"": Q, U, I, F, F -> but Q and double F? Not a common word, but let's check validity. ""Quiff"" is a valid word meaning a piece of hair. But we can consider.

However, we want to maximize information. ""GUILD"" and ""BUILD"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the first two letters and the last two are unknown.

Another word: ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but N is excluded (from crane: N is x). So invalid.

""FLING"": F, L, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K -> N excluded.

""CHILL"": C is excluded.

So, back to ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

Also, ""QUIPU"": Q, U, I, P, U -> but it has two U's? And is it valid? ""Quipu"" is a valid word (an ancient Inca device), but we might avoid rare words.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T excluded.

Another common word: ""WHISK"": W, H, I, S, K -> but S is excluded (from moist: S is x). So invalid.

""SHIP"" is 4 letters.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> R and C excluded.

So, let's stick with more common words: ""GUILD"", ""BUILD"", ""FLUID"".

We can also consider ""JUICE"" but it has E and C, excluded.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> but the third letter must be I, so not matching pattern.

The pattern is fixed: third letter I.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" - but O is excluded, and it has O and A (A excluded).

""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D -> A excluded.

""RABID"": R and A excluded.

So, I think ""GUILD"" or ""BUILD"" or ""FLUID"" are good choices.

Let's choose ""BUILD"" because it uses B and U, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters, and BUILD: B, U, I, L, D are all not excluded.

Similarly, GUILD: G, U, I, L, D.

FLUID: F, L, U, I, D.

We might also consider ""QUIET"" but excluded.

Another one: ""QUICK"" has C.

""BLITZ"": B, L, I, T, Z -> T is excluded.

""FLUFF"": F, L, U, F, F -> but third letter U? No, we need I in third. Pattern: _ _ I _ _, so first two, then I, then two more.

""FLUFF"" is F,L,U,F,F - third letter is U, not I.

So, not.

""SKIFF"": S and K? S excluded.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BUILD"".

But let's confirm: 
- B: not excluded
- U: not excluded
- I: we know it's correct, but we are using it in the third position.
- L: not excluded
- D: not excluded

Yes.

We could also use ""GUILD"" or ""FLUID"", but ""BUILD"" is a very common word.

So, I'll guess ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): Only the letter ""I"" is correct and in the right position (third letter). The other letters (M, O, S, T) are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has ""I"" as its third letter.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.
- Available letters for the guess: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" in the third position.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, U, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid all excluded letters.

Selected word: **""BUILD""**  
- B: New consonant, not excluded.  
- U: New vowel, not excluded.  
- I: Confirmed correct position (third letter).  
- L: New consonant, not excluded.  
- D: New consonant, not excluded.  

This guess tests four new common letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only I is correct and in position 3; M, O, S, T are not in the word.
- **Guess 3: ""build""** → B is not in the word; U, I, L, D are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Deductions:
1. **Word structure**: The secret word must have the form `_ U I L D` (second letter U, third letter I, fourth letter L, fifth letter D). Only the first letter is unknown.
2. **Excluded letters**: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T (from all feedback) cannot appear in the word.
3. **Possible first letters**: Given exclusions and the pattern, the first letter must be one of the remaining unused letters (e.g., F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z). However, since the pattern `_ U I L D` matches common words like ""GUILD,"" and ""GUILD"" avoids all excluded letters, it is a strong candidate.
4. **Reasoning for ""GUILD""**:
   - ""G"" is not excluded and fits the pattern.
   - ""UILD"" matches the known positions (U in pos 2, I in pos 3, L in pos 4, D in pos 5).
   - No other common 5-letter words fit this pattern (e.g., ""BUILD"" is invalid due to B exclusion, and alternatives like ""QUILD"" or ""YUILD"" are not valid English words).

Thus, ""GUILD"" is the most logical guess to solve the secret word.

Since ""build"" has L in the fourth position, that must be the correct spot.\n- D: ✓ → D is in the word and in the correct position. In ""build"", D is the fifth letter, so the fifth letter must be D.\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n1. The second letter is U.\n2. The third letter is I.\n3. The fourth letter is L.\n4. The fifth letter is D.\n5. The first letter is still unknown, but we know it\'s not B (and not any other excluded letters).\n\nMoreover, we have confirmed positions:\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: L\n- Position 5: D\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ U I L D\n\nWe now only need to find the first letter.\n\nExcluded letters so far (from all feedback):\n- From Guess 1: C, R, A, N, E\n- From Guess 2: M, O, S, T\n- From Guess 3: B\n\nSo total excluded: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T\n\nBut note: we also know the letters that are in the word: U, I, L, D (and the first letter is unknown).\n\nThe first letter cannot be any of the excluded letters, and it cannot be U, I, L, or D because:\n- U is in the second position, so if it were in the first, it would have been a ""wrong position"" or ""correct"" in both positions? But in the feedback for ""build"", the U was correct only in the second position. If the first letter were U, it might conflict unless double letters, but let\'s think.\n\nWe don\'t know if the word allows double letters. However, in ""build"", we used U once and it was marked correct in position 2. If the secret word had U in position 1 as well, then we would have gotten at least a \'-\' for U if it were also in the word but wrong position, but we didn\'t use U in position 1. We used B in pos1, which was x.\n\nBut since U is only in pos2 and no other U was guessed, we don\'t know if U can appear twice? However, likely, the word does not have double U, but we cannot be sure. But since no rule says letters can\'t repeat, we should consider the possibility, but it\'s rare.\n\nHowever, the feedback for ""build"" showed only U in pos2 correct, and L and D are single in their positions. So probably no double letters for these.\n\nBut the unknown first letter: it must be one of the remaining letters that is not excluded.\n\nAvailable letters: the alphabet minus excluded minus the letters we know are in the word? But U, I, L, D are already in the word, so they can be used again? However, in positions, since positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed, we only have position 1 to fill.\n\nAnd position 1 needs a letter that has not been excluded and is valid.\n\nBut since we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, we should try a letter not already in the word to maximize information? Or we can try a word that completes the pattern.\n\nBut we have to guess a word that matches _ U I L D.\n\nWhat possible words are there?\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending with ""UILD"" but the first letter is variable.\n\nCommon words:\n- GUILD: starts with G, but we haven\'t excluded G. However, in our guess we used ""build"" which had B, and now B is excluded. But G is allowed.\n- BUILD starts with B, but B is excluded now.\n- Other? ""QUILD"" is not a word.\n- WILD: but that\'s 4 letters.\n\nFull words:\n- GUILD: G U I L D\n- but also ""BUILD"" is not possible because B excluded.\n\nAnother word? ""MILT"" is 4 letters.\n\nIs there any other word ending with UILD? Not that I know except GUILD and BUILD.\n\nGUILD is valid.\n\nBut have we excluded G? No, G hasn\'t been used or excluded.\n\nCheck excluded: A,B,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T – no G.\n\nSo GUILD? But let\'s check: if secret word is GUILD, then our guess ""build"" had B in first position instead of G, which is excluded? B is x, so in the secret word, if it\'s GUILD, the first letter is G, which wasn\'t guessed in ""build"", so that\'s fine.\n\nFeedback for ""build"" vs GUILD:\n- B in pos1: not in the word → so G is in pos1, which we haven\'t guessed, so that\'s consistent.\n- U: correct in pos2.\n- I: correct in pos3.\n- L: correct in pos4.\n- D: correct in pos5.\n\nYes, perfect match.\n\nSo the word could be GUILD.\n\nBut are there other words? Let me think.\n\nAnother word: ""HILD"" is not 5 letters. Or ""UILD"" is not a root.\n\nPerhaps ""QUILT"" but T is excluded and pattern doesn\'t match because it would be Q U I L T, but fifth letter D, so not.\n\n""JUILD"" – not a word.\n\n""FLUID"" – F L U I D, but here positions: pos1 F, pos2 L, pos3 U? No, the pattern requires pos2 U, pos3 I, etc.\n\nFLUID is F-L-U-I-D, so pos3 is U, pos4 I? But we need U in pos2 and I in pos3, so it\'s different. FLUID doesn\'t fit _ U I L D.\n\nSo likely, the only common word is GUILD.\n\nBut what about ""BILKD""? B is excluded, and it would be B-I-L-K-D, not matching U in pos2.\n\nOther? ""SUILD"" – not a word.\n\nTherefore, GUILD should be the word.\n\nBut we can verify: in the feedback, we haven\'t tried G yet. But since we know all positions except the first, and G is available, GUILD must be the word.\n\nSometimes there are uncommon words, but GUILD is common.\n\nSo I will guess GUILD.\n\nBut let\'s make sure about double letters or other possibilities. Suppose the word is ""YULED"", but YULED might not be a word, and pattern doesn\'t have U in pos2 and L in pos4? ""YULED"": Y-U-L-E-D, but E is excluded, and also it would be Y U L E D, so pos3 is L, not I.

We have the pattern: _ U I L D (second letter U, third I, fourth L, fifth D) and first letter unknown.
Excluded letters: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T (from previous feedback).
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses a first letter not in the excluded list.

Possible first letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words that fit:
- ""GUILD"" is a valid word (meaning a group or association).
- Other possibilities? 
  - ""BUILD"" was already guessed and had B excluded.
  - ""QUILD"" is not a word.
  - ""FLUID"" has F in first position, but the pattern requires U in second, I in third, L in fourth, D in fifth. ""FLUID"" is F L U I D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D -> does not match the pattern (we need 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D).
  - ""JUICE"" has J in first, but then U in second, I in third, but fourth is C (excluded) and fifth is E (excluded). Also, it doesn't have L and D in the required positions.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters is ""GUILD"".

Therefore, we guess ""GUILD"".

Based on the feedback and deductions:

- The secret word pattern is `_ U I L D` (positions 2-5 confirmed: U, I, L, D).
- Excluded letters (A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T) cannot be used.
- The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is **""GUILD""** (G is not excluded, and the word is valid).

This guess tests the only remaining unknown position (first letter) while confirming the solution.
