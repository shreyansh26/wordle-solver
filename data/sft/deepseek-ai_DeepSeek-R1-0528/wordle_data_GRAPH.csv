We are at the first guess. Since we have no feedback yet, we want a word that maximizes information gain.
Common strategies for the first word include choosing words with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Let me consider some good starting words:
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"" are often used because they have common letters.
- But we can choose any word; however, it should be a valid English word.

I recall that the word ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another word that some people use, but it's less common.

Another popular one: ""ADIEU"" has too many vowels and might miss consonants.

But let's look at the rules: we must return a valid English word.

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid first word.

So my first guess: RAISE

But note: the response format requires:
<guess> RAISE </guess>

However, we must also include our reasoning within thought before the guess.

So, let me write our reasoning:

Thought process:
We are making the first guess. We choose the word ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are distinct, so we can test more letters.
- This word appears frequently in Wordle starting word lists.

Now, return the guess in the required format.
</think>
Choosing the first guess in Wordle involves maximizing information gain by selecting a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent starting point because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in English words.
- All five letters are distinct, allowing us to test for the presence or absence of more letters.
- This word has been proven effective in Wordle strategies for quickly narrowing down possibilities.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: present but in the wrong position (-)
- I: not present (x)
- S: not present (x)
- E: not present (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 for R and position 2 for A in ""RAISE"").
2. The letters I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and A, but does not contain I, S, or E.

We must make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not I, S, or E.
- Places R and A in positions different from the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 2 for A).

We also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that contain R and A, and avoid I, S, E.

We can also consider common letters that haven't been tested yet, such as T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

We know the word has 5 letters, and two of them are R and A. So we need to choose 3 more letters that are not I, S, E.

We should avoid repeating the positions for R and A. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2. So in the new guess, R should not be in position 1, and A should not be in position 2.

Let's try to think of words that have R and A, and place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because it wasn't position 2)

We also want to test other common letters.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and includes other common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with T: words like ""TRAIN"" but that has I (which is not allowed) and we know I is not in the word.
- ""TRAIN"" is invalid because of I.

- ""TRACK"" has C and K, but also R and A. However, we must avoid S and E, and I is already out. But note: we don't know about C and K. Also, in ""TRACK"", R is in position 2 (which is allowed) and A is in position 3 (which is allowed because it wasn't position 2). But wait, we have to check if it's valid: T R A C K.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T and A. But it doesn't have R. We need R because we know R is in the word.

So we must include R.

What about ""CRANE""? But that has E (which is not allowed) and C and N. But E is forbidden.

We cannot use E.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""ROAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so invalid.

Similarly, ""RAISE"" we already used.

What about ""PARTY"": 
- P, A, R, T, Y
- A is in position 2? But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""PARTY"", if we put A in position 2 again, that would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. So that's the same position as before, which we know is incorrect. Therefore, we should not use that.

We need a word where A is not in position 2 and R is not in position 1.

Let me try to think of words with A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

For example:
- A in position 1: words like ""A____""
- Then R can be in 3,4,5? But we don't know.

Let me try ""ALERT"" but that has E, which is forbidden.

""ALARM"" has A in position 1 and 3, and R in position 2 and 4. But we have to avoid E, I, S. Also, it has L and M.

But let's check: A in position 1 (which is new, since previously A was in 2) and R in position 2 (which is new, since previously R was in 1). Also, no I, S, E.

So ""ALARM"" is a candidate: A L A R M. But note: it has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, in the feedback for RAISE, we only got one A marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A because the feedback only marks each occurrence. Actually, if there were two A's, and we guessed one in the wrong position, it would still show one minus. But we don't know for sure.

But ""ALARM"" has two A's and one R. We know R is present, and A is present. But we don't know if there are multiple A's.

However, we can use it. But let's see if we can find a word with distinct letters to test more.

We have only 6 tries, so testing more letters is better.

We know the word has R and A, and three other letters that are not I, S, E.

We have tested: R, A, I, S, E. So we have 21 other letters to choose from.

We should try a word that uses common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word with R and A in new positions and include T, O, N.

For example:
- ""RANCH"": R in position 1? But we cannot put R in position 1 because in the first guess R was in position 1 and it was wrong. So R must not be in position 1. Therefore, we cannot start with R.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2.

So ""RANCH"" is invalid because R is in position 1.

What about ""CRANE""? But has E.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N. 
- R is in position 2 (new, since previously R was in 1) -> allowed.
- A is in position 4 (new, since previously A was in 2) -> allowed.
- Letters: O, R, G, A, N. None of I, S, E.
- This word tests O, G, A (in new position), R (in new position), and N.

So ""ORGAN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""ROBIN"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRAWL"": T R A W L. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Letters: T, R, A, W, L. No I, S, E.

Also a candidate.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another: ""PARTY"" but A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

""CARGO"": C A R G O. 
- A is in position 2? That's the same as before -> not allowed. We know A is not in position 2.

So avoid A in position 2.

""CARGO"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.

""BARON"": B A R O N. 
- A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""MANOR"": M A N O R. A in position 2 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"": but no R.

We need R.

""RADAR"": R in position 1 -> invalid, and A in position 2 -> invalid. Also, duplicate letters.

Not ideal.

""TAROT"": T A R O T. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""LARVA"": L A R V A. A in position 2 -> invalid.

So let's try to avoid position 2 for A.

What about A in position 1? Like ""ADORN"", but no R? ""ADORN"": A D O R N. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: A, D, O, R, N. No I, S, E.

This is a valid word.

Similarly, ""ACORN"": A C O R N. Same pattern.

But we don't know if C or D is better.

Another: ""ABHOR"": A B H O R. 
- A in position 1, R in position 5. 
- Tests B, H, O.

But H is less common.

We might prefer common letters.

So ""ADORN"" or ""ACORN"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that.

Another candidate: ""FLAIR"" but has I -> invalid.

""STRAW"": has S -> invalid.

""GROAN"": G R O A N. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: G, R, O, A, N. No I, S, E.

Also good.

Now, comparing:
- ""ORGAN"": O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5)
- ""ADORN"": A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""ACORN"": A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)

We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid the known bad positions.

In ""ADORN"" and ""ACORN"", we are putting A in position 1, which is new, and R in position 4, which is new.

In ""ORGAN"", we put R in position 2 and A in position 4.

In ""GROAN"", R in position 2 and A in position 4.

We also note that in the first guess, we had R in 1 and A in 2, both wrong. Now, by putting them in different positions, we can get more information.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

The letters we haven't tested yet: all except R, A, I, S, E.

Common letters: T, O, L, N, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

In ""ORGAN"", we test O, G, N, and also R and A in new positions.

In ""ADORN"", we test A (in new position), D, O, R (in new position), N.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" tests A, C, O, R, N.

""GROAN"" tests G, R, O, A, N.

We might prefer to include T or L, but we don't have to.

Another word: ""ULTRA"" but has U, L, T, R, A. But A is in position 5? ""ULTRA"": U L T R A -> A in position 5. 
- R in position 4? 
- Positions: U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- So A is in position 5 (new) and R in position 4 (new). 
- Tests U, L, T.

But U and L are common? T is very common.

But we have to choose one.

We could also consider ""RANCH"" but R in position 1 is invalid.

What about ""PAINT""? Has I -> invalid.

""MOUTH""? No R or A.

We must include both R and A.

So let's decide.

I think ""ADORN"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new).
- It includes common letters: D, O, N.
- It avoids the forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" is also good.

But let's see which one is more common. Both are valid.

Another word: ""ROUND""? But no A.

We need A.

""BRAND"": B R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is different. 
- Letters: B, R, A, N, D. No I, S, E.

Also a good candidate.

Now, we have several options: ""ADORN"", ""ACORN"", ""ORGAN"", ""GROAN"", ""BRAND"", etc.

We should choose one that maximizes new letters and commonality.

But note: we don't know which letters are present, so we want to cover as many as possible.

We have 5 positions and we know two letters (R and A) must be included, so we are testing 3 new letters.

All these words test 3 new letters.

Common letters: in the English language, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we already know E, I, S are out. So next are T, O, N, A (we have A), R (we have R), then L, C, D, U, M, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, L, etc.

In ""ADORN"": tests D, O, N -> O and N are common.
In ""ACORN"": tests C, O, N -> O and N common, C is less common than T or L.
In ""ORGAN"": tests O, G, N -> G is less common.
In ""GROAN"": tests G, O, N -> same as above.
In ""BRAND"": tests B, R, A, N, D -> B and D, but N is common.

But we don't have T or L in these.

What about a word with T? Like ""TRAIL"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRACT"": T R A C T. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word. 
- Also, no I, S, E. 
- But A is in position 3, which is new.

But duplicate T might reduce information.

""CRWTH""? Not common.

""WARTY"": W A R T Y. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""PARTY"" invalid.

""ARTY"": not 5 letters.

""TAROT"": invalid because A in position 2.

What about ""RATTY"": R in position 1 -> invalid.

""ATTAR"": A T T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 5 (new). 
- But duplicate T and A? 
- Letters: A, T, T, A, R -> tests T, but duplicates.

Not ideal.

""LATTE"": no R.

We might have to go without T for now.

Another idea: ""DOZAR""? Not a word.

""NADIR"": N A D I R -> has I -> invalid.

""RADII"": has I and duplicate -> invalid.

So let's go back.

Perhaps ""ADORN"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""ULTRA"" again: U L T R A. 
- U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- This tests U, L, T, which are new, and R and A in new positions (R in 4, A in 5). 
- And no I, S, E.

This might be even better because it tests three new common letters: T is very common, L is common, U is less common but still.

But we are testing U and L, which are vowels? U is a vowel, but we already have A.

But it's valid.

We can also consider ""ALERT"" but has E -> invalid.

""ALTAR"": A L T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), but then A again in position 4? 
- And R in position 5. 
- But duplicate A. 
- Tests L and T.

But duplicate might not be best.

""ULTRA"" has no duplicates.

Similarly, ""PATIO"" has I and O, but I is invalid.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a valid word and tests T and L, which are common.

But let's see: U is not as common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""TALON"": T A L O N. 
- But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""TONAL"": T O N A L. 
- A in position 4 (new). 
- But no R. We must include R.

We need R.

""R"" is required.

So ""TONAL"" doesn't have R.

""LORAN"": L O R A N. 
- R in position 3 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: L, O, R, A, N. No I, S, E.

This is also good: tests L, O, N, and R and A in new positions.

Similarly, ""NORMAL"": too long.

""ROYAL"": has Y, but no N? ""ROYAL"": R O Y A L. 
- R in position 1 -> invalid.

""CAROL"": has C, A, R, O, L. But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""VOCAL"": no R.

I think ""LORAN"" is a good choice: L(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), N(5). 
- R is in position 3 (not 1) and A in position 4 (not 2). 
- Tests L, O, N.

Similarly, ""ADORN"" is A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> tests D, O, N.

Between ""LORAN"" and ""ADORN"", which is better? ""LORAN"" tests L instead of D. L is more common than D.

In English, L is more frequent than D? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is first, then T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, then D, L, U, etc. So L and D are close, but L is slightly more common.

But both are reasonable.

""ULTRA"" tests U, L, T. T is very common (2nd), L is 11th, U is 13th. So it tests T, which is high frequency.

So ""ULTRA"" might be better because it includes T.

But U is less common, but we are testing it.

We have to choose one.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a good choice because it tests T and L, and U, and positions R and A at the end.

So let's go with ""ULTRA"".

But to confirm: 
- U: new
- L: new
- T: new
- R: in position 4 (not 1)
- A: in position 5 (not 2)

And the word is valid.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" but no R.

I think ""ULTRA"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there's a word with more common letters.

""CRATE"" has E -> invalid.

""TRADE"" has E -> invalid.

""GRAND"": G R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Tests G, N, D.

But no T.

""BRAND"": B R A N D, same.

""DRANK"": D R A N K. 
- R in position 2, A in position 3. 
- Tests D, N, K.

K is less common.

I think ""ULTRA"" is fine.

But note: the secret word might not have U, but we are testing.

We can also consider ""OCTAD"" but no R.

I think we should go with ""ULTRA"".

But let's double-check the feedback: we know R and A are present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. In ""ULTRA"", R is in 4 and A in 5, so that's fine.

So I choose ""ULTRA"".

But in the response, we must output in the format.

So the second guess is ""ULTRA"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- A is present but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are in the secret word), but avoid I, S, E.
- R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2 (as per feedback).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, U) and positions to maximize information gain.

The word ""ULTRA"" is chosen because:
- It contains R and A, with R in position 4 (new position) and A in position 5 (new position).
- It introduces three new letters: U, L, T (all common and not yet tested).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word that adheres to the constraints.

<guess>ULTRA</guess>",ULTRA,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: present but in the wrong position (-)
- I: not present (x)
- S: not present (x)
- E: not present (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 for R and position 2 for A in ""RAISE"").
2. The letters I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and A, but does not contain I, S, or E.

We must make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not I, S, or E.
- Places R and A in positions different from the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 2 for A).

We also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that contain R and A, and avoid I, S, E.

We can also consider common letters that haven't been tested yet, such as T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

We know the word has 5 letters, and two of them are R and A. So we need to choose 3 more letters that are not I, S, E.

We should avoid repeating the positions for R and A. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2. So in the new guess, R should not be in position 1, and A should not be in position 2.

Let's try to think of words that have R and A, and place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because it wasn't position 2)

We also want to test other common letters.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and includes other common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with T: words like ""TRAIN"" but that has I (which is not allowed) and we know I is not in the word.
- ""TRAIN"" is invalid because of I.

- ""TRACK"" has C and K, but also R and A. However, we must avoid S and E, and I is already out. But note: we don't know about C and K. Also, in ""TRACK"", R is in position 2 (which is allowed) and A is in position 3 (which is allowed because it wasn't position 2). But wait, we have to check if it's valid: T R A C K.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T and A. But it doesn't have R. We need R because we know R is in the word.

So we must include R.

What about ""CRANE""? But that has E (which is not allowed) and C and N. But E is forbidden.

We cannot use E.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""ROAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so invalid.

Similarly, ""RAISE"" we already used.

What about ""PARTY"": 
- P, A, R, T, Y
- A is in position 2? But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""PARTY"", if we put A in position 2 again, that would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. So that's the same position as before, which we know is incorrect. Therefore, we should not use that.

We need a word where A is not in position 2 and R is not in position 1.

Let me try to think of words with A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

For example:
- A in position 1: words like ""A____""
- Then R can be in 3,4,5? But we don't know.

Let me try ""ALERT"" but that has E, which is forbidden.

""ALARM"" has A in position 1 and 3, and R in position 2 and 4. But we have to avoid E, I, S. Also, it has L and M.

But let's check: A in position 1 (which is new, since previously A was in 2) and R in position 2 (which is new, since previously R was in 1). Also, no I, S, E.

So ""ALARM"" is a candidate: A L A R M. But note: it has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, in the feedback for RAISE, we only got one A marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A because the feedback only marks each occurrence. Actually, if there were two A's, and we guessed one in the wrong position, it would still show one minus. But we don't know for sure.

But ""ALARM"" has two A's and one R. We know R is present, and A is present. But we don't know if there are multiple A's.

However, we can use it. But let's see if we can find a word with distinct letters to test more.

We have only 6 tries, so testing more letters is better.

We know the word has R and A, and three other letters that are not I, S, E.

We have tested: R, A, I, S, E. So we have 21 other letters to choose from.

We should try a word that uses common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word with R and A in new positions and include T, O, N.

For example:
- ""RANCH"": R in position 1? But we cannot put R in position 1 because in the first guess R was in position 1 and it was wrong. So R must not be in position 1. Therefore, we cannot start with R.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2.

So ""RANCH"" is invalid because R is in position 1.

What about ""CRANE""? But has E.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N. 
- R is in position 2 (new, since previously R was in 1) -> allowed.
- A is in position 4 (new, since previously A was in 2) -> allowed.
- Letters: O, R, G, A, N. None of I, S, E.
- This word tests O, G, A (in new position), R (in new position), and N.

So ""ORGAN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""ROBIN"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRAWL"": T R A W L. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Letters: T, R, A, W, L. No I, S, E.

Also a candidate.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another: ""PARTY"" but A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

""CARGO"": C A R G O. 
- A is in position 2? That's the same as before -> not allowed. We know A is not in position 2.

So avoid A in position 2.

""CARGO"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.

""BARON"": B A R O N. 
- A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""MANOR"": M A N O R. A in position 2 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"": but no R.

We need R.

""RADAR"": R in position 1 -> invalid, and A in position 2 -> invalid. Also, duplicate letters.

Not ideal.

""TAROT"": T A R O T. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""LARVA"": L A R V A. A in position 2 -> invalid.

So let's try to avoid position 2 for A.

What about A in position 1? Like ""ADORN"", but no R? ""ADORN"": A D O R N. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: A, D, O, R, N. No I, S, E.

This is a valid word.

Similarly, ""ACORN"": A C O R N. Same pattern.

But we don't know if C or D is better.

Another: ""ABHOR"": A B H O R. 
- A in position 1, R in position 5. 
- Tests B, H, O.

But H is less common.

We might prefer common letters.

So ""ADORN"" or ""ACORN"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that.

Another candidate: ""FLAIR"" but has I -> invalid.

""STRAW"": has S -> invalid.

""GROAN"": G R O A N. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: G, R, O, A, N. No I, S, E.

Also good.

Now, comparing:
- ""ORGAN"": O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5)
- ""ADORN"": A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""ACORN"": A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)

We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid the known bad positions.

In ""ADORN"" and ""ACORN"", we are putting A in position 1, which is new, and R in position 4, which is new.

In ""ORGAN"", we put R in position 2 and A in position 4.

In ""GROAN"", R in position 2 and A in position 4.

We also note that in the first guess, we had R in 1 and A in 2, both wrong. Now, by putting them in different positions, we can get more information.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

The letters we haven't tested yet: all except R, A, I, S, E.

Common letters: T, O, L, N, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

In ""ORGAN"", we test O, G, N, and also R and A in new positions.

In ""ADORN"", we test A (in new position), D, O, R (in new position), N.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" tests A, C, O, R, N.

""GROAN"" tests G, R, O, A, N.

We might prefer to include T or L, but we don't have to.

Another word: ""ULTRA"" but has U, L, T, R, A. But A is in position 5? ""ULTRA"": U L T R A -> A in position 5. 
- R in position 4? 
- Positions: U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- So A is in position 5 (new) and R in position 4 (new). 
- Tests U, L, T.

But U and L are common? T is very common.

But we have to choose one.

We could also consider ""RANCH"" but R in position 1 is invalid.

What about ""PAINT""? Has I -> invalid.

""MOUTH""? No R or A.

We must include both R and A.

So let's decide.

I think ""ADORN"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new).
- It includes common letters: D, O, N.
- It avoids the forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" is also good.

But let's see which one is more common. Both are valid.

Another word: ""ROUND""? But no A.

We need A.

""BRAND"": B R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is different. 
- Letters: B, R, A, N, D. No I, S, E.

Also a good candidate.

Now, we have several options: ""ADORN"", ""ACORN"", ""ORGAN"", ""GROAN"", ""BRAND"", etc.

We should choose one that maximizes new letters and commonality.

But note: we don't know which letters are present, so we want to cover as many as possible.

We have 5 positions and we know two letters (R and A) must be included, so we are testing 3 new letters.

All these words test 3 new letters.

Common letters: in the English language, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we already know E, I, S are out. So next are T, O, N, A (we have A), R (we have R), then L, C, D, U, M, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, L, etc.

In ""ADORN"": tests D, O, N -> O and N are common.
In ""ACORN"": tests C, O, N -> O and N common, C is less common than T or L.
In ""ORGAN"": tests O, G, N -> G is less common.
In ""GROAN"": tests G, O, N -> same as above.
In ""BRAND"": tests B, R, A, N, D -> B and D, but N is common.

But we don't have T or L in these.

What about a word with T? Like ""TRAIL"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRACT"": T R A C T. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word. 
- Also, no I, S, E. 
- But A is in position 3, which is new.

But duplicate T might reduce information.

""CRWTH""? Not common.

""WARTY"": W A R T Y. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""PARTY"" invalid.

""ARTY"": not 5 letters.

""TAROT"": invalid because A in position 2.

What about ""RATTY"": R in position 1 -> invalid.

""ATTAR"": A T T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 5 (new). 
- But duplicate T and A? 
- Letters: A, T, T, A, R -> tests T, but duplicates.

Not ideal.

""LATTE"": no R.

We might have to go without T for now.

Another idea: ""DOZAR""? Not a word.

""NADIR"": N A D I R -> has I -> invalid.

""RADII"": has I and duplicate -> invalid.

So let's go back.

Perhaps ""ADORN"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""ULTRA"" again: U L T R A. 
- U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- This tests U, L, T, which are new, and R and A in new positions (R in 4, A in 5). 
- And no I, S, E.

This might be even better because it tests three new common letters: T is very common, L is common, U is less common but still.

But we are testing U and L, which are vowels? U is a vowel, but we already have A.

But it's valid.

We can also consider ""ALERT"" but has E -> invalid.

""ALTAR"": A L T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), but then A again in position 4? 
- And R in position 5. 
- But duplicate A. 
- Tests L and T.

But duplicate might not be best.

""ULTRA"" has no duplicates.

Similarly, ""PATIO"" has I and O, but I is invalid.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a valid word and tests T and L, which are common.

But let's see: U is not as common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""TALON"": T A L O N. 
- But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""TONAL"": T O N A L. 
- A in position 4 (new). 
- But no R. We must include R.

We need R.

""R"" is required.

So ""TONAL"" doesn't have R.

""LORAN"": L O R A N. 
- R in position 3 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: L, O, R, A, N. No I, S, E.

This is also good: tests L, O, N, and R and A in new positions.

Similarly, ""NORMAL"": too long.

""ROYAL"": has Y, but no N? ""ROYAL"": R O Y A L. 
- R in position 1 -> invalid.

""CAROL"": has C, A, R, O, L. But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""VOCAL"": no R.

I think ""LORAN"" is a good choice: L(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), N(5). 
- R is in position 3 (not 1) and A in position 4 (not 2). 
- Tests L, O, N.

Similarly, ""ADORN"" is A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> tests D, O, N.

Between ""LORAN"" and ""ADORN"", which is better? ""LORAN"" tests L instead of D. L is more common than D.

In English, L is more frequent than D? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is first, then T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, then D, L, U, etc. So L and D are close, but L is slightly more common.

But both are reasonable.

""ULTRA"" tests U, L, T. T is very common (2nd), L is 11th, U is 13th. So it tests T, which is high frequency.

So ""ULTRA"" might be better because it includes T.

But U is less common, but we are testing it.

We have to choose one.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a good choice because it tests T and L, and U, and positions R and A at the end.

So let's go with ""ULTRA"".

But to confirm: 
- U: new
- L: new
- T: new
- R: in position 4 (not 1)
- A: in position 5 (not 2)

And the word is valid.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" but no R.

I think ""ULTRA"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there's a word with more common letters.

""CRATE"" has E -> invalid.

""TRADE"" has E -> invalid.

""GRAND"": G R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Tests G, N, D.

But no T.

""BRAND"": B R A N D, same.

""DRANK"": D R A N K. 
- R in position 2, A in position 3. 
- Tests D, N, K.

K is less common.

I think ""ULTRA"" is fine.

But note: the secret word might not have U, but we are testing.

We can also consider ""OCTAD"" but no R.

I think we should go with ""ULTRA"".

But let's double-check the feedback: we know R and A are present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. In ""ULTRA"", R is in 4 and A in 5, so that's fine.

So I choose ""ULTRA"".

But in the response, we must output in the format.

So the second guess is ""ULTRA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- A is present but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are in the secret word), but avoid I, S, E.
- R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2 (as per feedback).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, U) and positions to maximize information gain.

The word ""ULTRA"" is chosen because:
- It contains R and A, with R in position 4 (new position) and A in position 5 (new position).
- It introduces three new letters: U, L, T (all common and not yet tested).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word that adheres to the constraints.",Guess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(-) A(-),FAIL

Common strategies for the first word include choosing words with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Let me consider some good starting words:
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"" are often used because they have common letters.
- But we can choose any word; however, it should be a valid English word.

I recall that the word ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another word that some people use, but it's less common.

Another popular one: ""ADIEU"" has too many vowels and might miss consonants.

But let's look at the rules: we must return a valid English word.

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid first word.

So my first guess: RAISE

But note: the response format requires:
<guess> RAISE </guess>

However, we must also include our reasoning within thought before the guess.

So, let me write our reasoning:

Thought process:
We are making the first guess. We choose the word ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are distinct, so we can test more letters.
- This word appears frequently in Wordle starting word lists.

Now, return the guess in the required format.Choosing the first guess in Wordle involves maximizing information gain by selecting a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent starting point because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in English words.
- All five letters are distinct, allowing us to test for the presence or absence of more letters.
- This word has been proven effective in Wordle strategies for quickly narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: present but in the wrong position (-)
- I: not present (x)
- S: not present (x)
- E: not present (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 for R and position 2 for A in ""RAISE"").
2. The letters I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and A, but does not contain I, S, or E.

We must make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not I, S, or E.
- Places R and A in positions different from the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 2 for A).

We also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that contain R and A, and avoid I, S, E.

We can also consider common letters that haven't been tested yet, such as T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

We know the word has 5 letters, and two of them are R and A. So we need to choose 3 more letters that are not I, S, E.

We should avoid repeating the positions for R and A. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2. So in the new guess, R should not be in position 1, and A should not be in position 2.

Let's try to think of words that have R and A, and place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because it wasn't position 2)

We also want to test other common letters.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and includes other common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with T: words like ""TRAIN"" but that has I (which is not allowed) and we know I is not in the word.
- ""TRAIN"" is invalid because of I.

- ""TRACK"" has C and K, but also R and A. However, we must avoid S and E, and I is already out. But note: we don't know about C and K. Also, in ""TRACK"", R is in position 2 (which is allowed) and A is in position 3 (which is allowed because it wasn't position 2). But wait, we have to check if it's valid: T R A C K.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T and A. But it doesn't have R. We need R because we know R is in the word.

So we must include R.

What about ""CRANE""? But that has E (which is not allowed) and C and N. But E is forbidden.

We cannot use E.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""ROAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so invalid.

Similarly, ""RAISE"" we already used.

What about ""PARTY"": 
- P, A, R, T, Y
- A is in position 2? But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""PARTY"", if we put A in position 2 again, that would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. So that's the same position as before, which we know is incorrect. Therefore, we should not use that.

We need a word where A is not in position 2 and R is not in position 1.

Let me try to think of words with A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

For example:
- A in position 1: words like ""A____""
- Then R can be in 3,4,5? But we don't know.

Let me try ""ALERT"" but that has E, which is forbidden.

""ALARM"" has A in position 1 and 3, and R in position 2 and 4. But we have to avoid E, I, S. Also, it has L and M.

But let's check: A in position 1 (which is new, since previously A was in 2) and R in position 2 (which is new, since previously R was in 1). Also, no I, S, E.

So ""ALARM"" is a candidate: A L A R M. But note: it has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, in the feedback for RAISE, we only got one A marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A because the feedback only marks each occurrence. Actually, if there were two A's, and we guessed one in the wrong position, it would still show one minus. But we don't know for sure.

But ""ALARM"" has two A's and one R. We know R is present, and A is present. But we don't know if there are multiple A's.

However, we can use it. But let's see if we can find a word with distinct letters to test more.

We have only 6 tries, so testing more letters is better.

We know the word has R and A, and three other letters that are not I, S, E.

We have tested: R, A, I, S, E. So we have 21 other letters to choose from.

We should try a word that uses common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word with R and A in new positions and include T, O, N.

For example:
- ""RANCH"": R in position 1? But we cannot put R in position 1 because in the first guess R was in position 1 and it was wrong. So R must not be in position 1. Therefore, we cannot start with R.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2.

So ""RANCH"" is invalid because R is in position 1.

What about ""CRANE""? But has E.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N. 
- R is in position 2 (new, since previously R was in 1) -> allowed.
- A is in position 4 (new, since previously A was in 2) -> allowed.
- Letters: O, R, G, A, N. None of I, S, E.
- This word tests O, G, A (in new position), R (in new position), and N.

So ""ORGAN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""ROBIN"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRAWL"": T R A W L. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Letters: T, R, A, W, L. No I, S, E.

Also a candidate.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another: ""PARTY"" but A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

""CARGO"": C A R G O. 
- A is in position 2? That's the same as before -> not allowed. We know A is not in position 2.

So avoid A in position 2.

""CARGO"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.

""BARON"": B A R O N. 
- A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""MANOR"": M A N O R. A in position 2 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"": but no R.

We need R.

""RADAR"": R in position 1 -> invalid, and A in position 2 -> invalid. Also, duplicate letters.

Not ideal.

""TAROT"": T A R O T. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""LARVA"": L A R V A. A in position 2 -> invalid.

So let's try to avoid position 2 for A.

What about A in position 1? Like ""ADORN"", but no R? ""ADORN"": A D O R N. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: A, D, O, R, N. No I, S, E.

This is a valid word.

Similarly, ""ACORN"": A C O R N. Same pattern.

But we don't know if C or D is better.

Another: ""ABHOR"": A B H O R. 
- A in position 1, R in position 5. 
- Tests B, H, O.

But H is less common.

We might prefer common letters.

So ""ADORN"" or ""ACORN"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that.

Another candidate: ""FLAIR"" but has I -> invalid.

""STRAW"": has S -> invalid.

""GROAN"": G R O A N. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: G, R, O, A, N. No I, S, E.

Also good.

Now, comparing:
- ""ORGAN"": O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5)
- ""ADORN"": A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""ACORN"": A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)

We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid the known bad positions.

In ""ADORN"" and ""ACORN"", we are putting A in position 1, which is new, and R in position 4, which is new.

In ""ORGAN"", we put R in position 2 and A in position 4.

In ""GROAN"", R in position 2 and A in position 4.

We also note that in the first guess, we had R in 1 and A in 2, both wrong. Now, by putting them in different positions, we can get more information.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

The letters we haven't tested yet: all except R, A, I, S, E.

Common letters: T, O, L, N, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

In ""ORGAN"", we test O, G, N, and also R and A in new positions.

In ""ADORN"", we test A (in new position), D, O, R (in new position), N.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" tests A, C, O, R, N.

""GROAN"" tests G, R, O, A, N.

We might prefer to include T or L, but we don't have to.

Another word: ""ULTRA"" but has U, L, T, R, A. But A is in position 5? ""ULTRA"": U L T R A -> A in position 5. 
- R in position 4? 
- Positions: U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- So A is in position 5 (new) and R in position 4 (new). 
- Tests U, L, T.

But U and L are common? T is very common.

But we have to choose one.

We could also consider ""RANCH"" but R in position 1 is invalid.

What about ""PAINT""? Has I -> invalid.

""MOUTH""? No R or A.

We must include both R and A.

So let's decide.

I think ""ADORN"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new).
- It includes common letters: D, O, N.
- It avoids the forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" is also good.

But let's see which one is more common. Both are valid.

Another word: ""ROUND""? But no A.

We need A.

""BRAND"": B R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is different. 
- Letters: B, R, A, N, D. No I, S, E.

Also a good candidate.

Now, we have several options: ""ADORN"", ""ACORN"", ""ORGAN"", ""GROAN"", ""BRAND"", etc.

We should choose one that maximizes new letters and commonality.

But note: we don't know which letters are present, so we want to cover as many as possible.

We have 5 positions and we know two letters (R and A) must be included, so we are testing 3 new letters.

All these words test 3 new letters.

Common letters: in the English language, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we already know E, I, S are out. So next are T, O, N, A (we have A), R (we have R), then L, C, D, U, M, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, L, etc.

In ""ADORN"": tests D, O, N -> O and N are common.
In ""ACORN"": tests C, O, N -> O and N common, C is less common than T or L.
In ""ORGAN"": tests O, G, N -> G is less common.
In ""GROAN"": tests G, O, N -> same as above.
In ""BRAND"": tests B, R, A, N, D -> B and D, but N is common.

But we don't have T or L in these.

What about a word with T? Like ""TRAIL"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRACT"": T R A C T. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word. 
- Also, no I, S, E. 
- But A is in position 3, which is new.

But duplicate T might reduce information.

""CRWTH""? Not common.

""WARTY"": W A R T Y. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""PARTY"" invalid.

""ARTY"": not 5 letters.

""TAROT"": invalid because A in position 2.

What about ""RATTY"": R in position 1 -> invalid.

""ATTAR"": A T T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 5 (new). 
- But duplicate T and A? 
- Letters: A, T, T, A, R -> tests T, but duplicates.

Not ideal.

""LATTE"": no R.

We might have to go without T for now.

Another idea: ""DOZAR""? Not a word.

""NADIR"": N A D I R -> has I -> invalid.

""RADII"": has I and duplicate -> invalid.

So let's go back.

Perhaps ""ADORN"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""ULTRA"" again: U L T R A. 
- U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- This tests U, L, T, which are new, and R and A in new positions (R in 4, A in 5). 
- And no I, S, E.

This might be even better because it tests three new common letters: T is very common, L is common, U is less common but still.

But we are testing U and L, which are vowels? U is a vowel, but we already have A.

But it's valid.

We can also consider ""ALERT"" but has E -> invalid.

""ALTAR"": A L T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), but then A again in position 4? 
- And R in position 5. 
- But duplicate A. 
- Tests L and T.

But duplicate might not be best.

""ULTRA"" has no duplicates.

Similarly, ""PATIO"" has I and O, but I is invalid.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a valid word and tests T and L, which are common.

But let's see: U is not as common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""TALON"": T A L O N. 
- But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""TONAL"": T O N A L. 
- A in position 4 (new). 
- But no R. We must include R.

We need R.

""R"" is required.

So ""TONAL"" doesn't have R.

""LORAN"": L O R A N. 
- R in position 3 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: L, O, R, A, N. No I, S, E.

This is also good: tests L, O, N, and R and A in new positions.

Similarly, ""NORMAL"": too long.

""ROYAL"": has Y, but no N? ""ROYAL"": R O Y A L. 
- R in position 1 -> invalid.

""CAROL"": has C, A, R, O, L. But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""VOCAL"": no R.

I think ""LORAN"" is a good choice: L(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), N(5). 
- R is in position 3 (not 1) and A in position 4 (not 2). 
- Tests L, O, N.

Similarly, ""ADORN"" is A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> tests D, O, N.

Between ""LORAN"" and ""ADORN"", which is better? ""LORAN"" tests L instead of D. L is more common than D.

In English, L is more frequent than D? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is first, then T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, then D, L, U, etc. So L and D are close, but L is slightly more common.

But both are reasonable.

""ULTRA"" tests U, L, T. T is very common (2nd), L is 11th, U is 13th. So it tests T, which is high frequency.

So ""ULTRA"" might be better because it includes T.

But U is less common, but we are testing it.

We have to choose one.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a good choice because it tests T and L, and U, and positions R and A at the end.

So let's go with ""ULTRA"".

But to confirm: 
- U: new
- L: new
- T: new
- R: in position 4 (not 1)
- A: in position 5 (not 2)

And the word is valid.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" but no R.

I think ""ULTRA"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there's a word with more common letters.

""CRATE"" has E -> invalid.

""TRADE"" has E -> invalid.

""GRAND"": G R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Tests G, N, D.

But no T.

""BRAND"": B R A N D, same.

""DRANK"": D R A N K. 
- R in position 2, A in position 3. 
- Tests D, N, K.

K is less common.

I think ""ULTRA"" is fine.

But note: the secret word might not have U, but we are testing.

We can also consider ""OCTAD"" but no R.

I think we should go with ""ULTRA"".

But let's double-check the feedback: we know R and A are present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. In ""ULTRA"", R is in 4 and A in 5, so that's fine.

So I choose ""ULTRA"".

But in the response, we must output in the format.

So the second guess is ""ULTRA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- A is present but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are in the secret word), but avoid I, S, E.
- R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2 (as per feedback).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, U) and positions to maximize information gain.

The word ""ULTRA"" is chosen because:
- It contains R and A, with R in position 4 (new position) and A in position 5 (new position).
- It introduces three new letters: U, L, T (all common and not yet tested).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word that adheres to the constraints.

The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 for R and position 2 for A in ""RAISE"").\n2. The letters I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains R and A, but does not contain I, S, or E.\n\nWe must make a second guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not I, S, or E.\n- Places R and A in positions different from the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 2 for A).\n\nWe also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words that contain R and A, and avoid I, S, E.\n\nWe can also consider common letters that haven\'t been tested yet, such as T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters, and two of them are R and A. So we need to choose 3 more letters that are not I, S, E.\n\nWe should avoid repeating the positions for R and A. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2. So in the new guess, R should not be in position 1, and A should not be in position 2.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and A, and place them in different positions.\n\nPossible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put A in position 1, that\'s allowed because it wasn\'t position 2)\n\nWe also want to test other common letters.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and includes other common consonants.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- Starting with T: words like ""TRAIN"" but that has I (which is not allowed) and we know I is not in the word.\n- ""TRAIN"" is invalid because of I.\n\n- ""TRACK"" has C and K, but also R and A. However, we must avoid S and E, and I is already out. But note: we don\'t know about C and K. Also, in ""TRACK"", R is in position 2 (which is allowed) and A is in position 3 (which is allowed because it wasn\'t position 2). But wait, we have to check if it\'s valid: T R A C K.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T and A. But it doesn\'t have R. We need R because we know R is in the word.\n\nSo we must include R.\n\nWhat about ""CRANE""? But that has E (which is not allowed) and C and N. But E is forbidden.\n\nWe cannot use E.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nAnother word: ""ROAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""RAISE"" we already used.\n\nWhat about ""PARTY"": \n- P, A, R, T, Y\n- A is in position 2? But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""PARTY"", if we put A in position 2 again, that would be the same position and we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nIn ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. So that\'s the same position as before, which we know is incorrect. Therefore, we should not use that.\n\nWe need a word where A is not in position 2 and R is not in position 1.\n\nLet me try to think of words with A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- A in position 1: words like ""A____""\n- Then R can be in 3,4,5? But we don\'t know.\n\nLet me try ""ALERT"" but that has E, which is forbidden.\n\n""ALARM"" has A in position 1 and 3, and R in position 2 and 4. But we have to avoid E, I, S. Also, it has L and M.\n\nBut let\'s check: A in position 1 (which is new, since previously A was in 2) and R in position 2 (which is new, since previously R was in 1). Also, no I, S, E.\n\nSo ""ALARM"" is a candidate: A L A R M. But note: it has two A\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but it\'s possible. However, in the feedback for RAISE, we only got one A marked, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean there is only one A because the feedback only marks each occurrence. Actually, if there were two A\'s, and we guessed one in the wrong position, it would still show one minus. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut ""ALARM"" has two A\'s and one R.

No R or A.\n\nWe must include both R and A.\n\nSo let\'s decide.\n\nI think ""ADORN"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests A in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and R in position 4 (new).\n- It includes common letters: D, O, N.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ACORN"" is also good.\n\nBut let\'s see which one is more common. Both are valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROUND""? But no A.\n\nWe need A.\n\n""BRAND"": B R A N D. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is different. \n- Letters: B, R, A, N, D. No I, S, E.\n\nAlso a good candidate.\n\nNow, we have several options: ""ADORN"", ""ACORN"", ""ORGAN"", ""GROAN"", ""BRAND"", etc.\n\nWe should choose one that maximizes new letters and commonality.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which letters are present, so we want to cover as many as possible.\n\nWe have 5 positions and we know two letters (R and A) must be included, so we are testing 3 new letters.\n\nAll these words test 3 new letters.\n\nCommon letters: in the English language, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we already know E, I, S are out. So next are T, O, N, A (we have A), R (we have R), then L, C, D, U, M, etc.\n\nSo we should try to include T, O, N, L, etc.\n\nIn ""ADORN"": tests D, O, N -> O and N are common.\nIn ""ACORN"": tests C, O, N -> O and N common, C is less common than T or L.\nIn ""ORGAN"": tests O, G, N -> G is less common.\nIn ""GROAN"": tests G, O, N -> same as above.\nIn ""BRAND"": tests B, R, A, N, D -> B and D, but N is common.\n\nBut we don\'t have T or L in these.\n\nWhat about a word with T? Like ""TRAIL"" but has I -> invalid.\n\n""TRACT"": T R A C T. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- But duplicate T? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. \n- Also, no I, S, E. \n- But A is in position 3, which is new.\n\nBut duplicate T might reduce information.\n\n""CRWTH""? Not common.\n\n""WARTY"": W A R T Y. \n- A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""PARTY"" invalid.\n\n""ARTY"": not 5 letters.\n\n""TAROT"": invalid because A in position 2.\n\nWhat about ""RATTY"": R in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n""ATTAR"": A T T A R. \n- A in position 1 (new), R in position 5 (new). \n- But duplicate T and A? \n- Letters: A, T, T, A, R -> tests T, but duplicates.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""LATTE"": no R.\n\nWe might have to go without T for now.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOZAR""? Not a word.\n\n""NADIR"": N A D I R -> has I -> invalid.\n\n""RADII"": has I and duplicate -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s go back.\n\nPerhaps ""ADORN"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of ""ULTRA"" again: U L T R A. \n- U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). \n- This tests U, L, T, which are new, and R and A in new positions (R in 4, A in 5). \n- And no I, S, E.\n\nThis might be even better because it tests three new common letters: T is very common, L is common, U is less common but still.\n\nBut we are testing U and L, which are vowels? U is a vowel, but we already have A.\n\nBut it\'s valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""ALERT"" but has E -> invalid.\n\n""ALTAR"": A L T A R. \n- A in position 1 (new), but then A again in position 4? \n- And R in position 5. \n- But duplicate A. \n- Tests L and T.\n\nBut duplicate might not be best.\n\n""ULTRA"" has no duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""PATIO"" has I and O, but I is invalid.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is a valid word and tests T and L, which are common.\n\nBut let\'s see: U is not as common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""TALON"": T A L O N. \n- But A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""TONAL"": T O N A L. \n- A in position 4 (new). \n- But no R. We must include R.\n\nWe need R.\n\n""R"" is required.\n\nSo ""TONAL"" doesn\'t have R.\n\n""LORAN"": L O R A N. \n- R in position 3 (new), A in position 4 (new). \n- Letters: L, O, R, A, N. No I, S, E.\n\nThis is also good: tests L, O, N, and R and A in new positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""NORMAL"": too long.\n\n""ROYAL"": has Y, but no N? ""ROYAL"": R O Y A L. \n- R in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n""CAROL"": has C, A, R, O, L. But A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""VOCAL"": no R.\n\nI think ""LORAN"" is a good choice: L(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), N(5). \n- R is in position 3 (not 1) and A in position 4 (not 2). \n- Tests L, O, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADORN"" is A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> tests D, O, N.\n\nBetween ""LORAN"" and ""ADORN"", which is better? ""LORAN"" tests L instead of D. L is more common than D.\n\nIn English, L is more frequent than D? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is first, then T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, then D, L, U, etc. So L and D are close, but L is slightly more common.\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\n""ULTRA"" tests U, L, T. T is very common (2nd), L is 11th, U is 13th. So it tests T, which is high frequency.\n\nSo ""ULTRA"" might be better because it includes T.\n\nBut U is less common, but we are testing it.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is a good choice because it tests T and L, and U, and positions R and A at the end.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ULTRA"".\n\nBut to confirm: \n- U: new\n- L: new\n- T: new\n- R: in position 4 (not 1)\n- A: in position 5 (not 2)\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLANT"" but no R.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word with more common letters.\n\n""CRATE"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""TRADE"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""GRAND"": G R A N D. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- Tests G, N, D.\n\nBut no T.\n\n""BRAND"": B R A N D, same.\n\n""DRANK"": D R A N K. \n- R in position 2, A in position 3. \n- Tests D, N, K.\n\nK is less common.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is fine.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not have U, but we are testing.\n\nWe can also consider ""OCTAD"" but no R.\n\nI think we should go with ""ULTRA"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback: we know R and A are present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. In ""ULTRA"", R is in 4 and A in 5, so that\'s fine.\n\nSo I choose ""ULTRA"".\n\nBut in the response, we must output in the format.\n\nSo the second guess is ""ULTRA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n- A is present but in the wrong position (not position 2).\n- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R and A (since they are in the secret word), but avoid I, S, E.\n- R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2 (as per feedback).\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, U) and positions to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""ULTRA"" is chosen because:\n- It contains R and A, with R in position 4 (new position) and A in position 5 (new position).\n- It introduces three new letters: U, L, T (all common and not yet tested).\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word that adheres to the constraints.\n\n<guess>ULTRA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(-) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ULTRA -> U(x), L(x), T(x), R(-), A(-)
Meaning:
- U, L, T are not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and got ""-"").
- A is in the word, but not in position 5 (since guessed in position 5 and got ""-"").

We know:
- The secret word contains R and A (from both guesses).
- It does not contain I, S, E, U, L, T.
- R cannot be in position 1 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).
- A cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 5 (from second guess).

We need to list the possible letters and positions.

Letters available (not excluded): 
Excluded: I, S, E, U, L, T. That leaves 20 letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we have R and A already present.

But the word has 5 letters, two of which we know are R and A. So the other three letters are from the remaining letters.

For positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess). Also, it might be one of the new letters.
- Position 2: Cannot be A (from first guess). Also, it was L in second guess (which is x, so no L). So it must be a new letter.
- Position 3: Was T in second guess (x) so not T. Can be other.
- Position 4: Cannot be R (since in second guess R is in 4 and got -).
- Position 5: Cannot be A (from second guess).

Additionally, R must be placed in a position that is not 1 and not 4. Possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, A must be placed in a position that is not 2 and not 5. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's see constraints from both guesses:

For R: 
- In first guess, position 1: not R -> so R is not 1.
- In second guess, position 4: not R -> so R is not 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

For A:
- In first guess, position 2: not A -> so A not in 2.
- In second guess, position 5: not A -> so A not in 5.
- Therefore, A must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, note that in the word, R and A are distinct, and we don't have information about duplicates, so assume they are single for now.

We need to form a word with R and A in allowed positions, and three other letters from the remaining alphabet.

We must avoid: I, S, E, U, L, T.

We should guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Possible positions:

Let me denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5.

R can be: P2, P3, or P5.
A can be: P1, P3, or P4.

But note: P3 cannot be both R and A at the same time, unless we later find duplicates, but for now, we assume letters are unique? Not necessarily, but with limited info.

Since we have only two instances, we consider R and A as separate.

So possible cases:

Case 1: A in P1
Then R in P2, P3, or P5.

Case 2: A in P3
Then R in P2 or P5 (since P3 occupied by A).

Case 3: A in P4
Then R in P2, P3, or P5.

Similarly, we have to fill the other positions.

We also note the exclusions: P2 cannot be A (but in case A is P1 or P3 or P4, so P2 is not A). Similarly, P5 cannot be A.

We should choose a word that tests frequent letters and narrows down.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, W, Y, etc.

We might try to include O, N as they are common.

Let's try to find a word that fits.

First, suppose A is in P1 (position 1): A _ _ _ _

Then R could be in P2: A R _ _ _
But P2 would be R, and we need to fill the rest.

With letters not excluded.

For example, A R O B ? But not B, need 5 letters.

A R O W N -> AROWN? Not a word.

A R M O R -> ARMOR? But R is duplicated? Wait, but R is already in P2, and we have to have R, but if the word has two R's? Feedback might show one R correct and one not, but so far we only know one R.

ARMOR is valid.

But let's see feedback: if secret has only one R, then when we guess ARMOR (two R's), the feedback might mark the correct R and show the other as absent or wrong position.

Similarly, A in P1 and R in P3: A _ R _ _

For example: A B R A C? But C, and we don't have E. But A repeated? ABRAC -> not 5. ABACK? A B A C K -> but A repeated, and K.

But not BR.

Let's list possible words.

Since we are guessing, we need one word.

Another idea: use a word with O and N.

Suppose A in P4: so _ _ _ A _

Then R could be in P2, P3, or P5.

For example, R in P5: so _ _ _ A R

Then positions: P1 and P2 and P3 to be filled.

With common letters.

For example, C O R A R? Duplicate.

M A N A R? But P4 is A already, and A in P2? But P2 cannot be A because from first guess A not in P2.

P2 cannot be A.

For _ _ _ A R, P2 cannot be A.

For instance, C O W A R -> COWAR? Not a word. 
B O W A R -> BOWAR? Not standard. 
DOZAR? No.

GONAR? No.

Perhaps not.

R in P2: so _ R _ A _? But P5 cannot be A? No, P5 is different.

This is: P1 R P3 A P5

P5 cannot be A (it's already established), so P5 is another letter.

R in P3: so _ _ R A _

Then P1, P2, P5 to fill.

Common: for example, B O R A X -> BORAX? Valid. 
Letters: B, O, R, A, X. None excluded.

BORAX: 
- B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5)

Check positions: 
A is in P4 -> allowed? Yes, P4 is not P2 or P5. 
R is in P3 -> allowed? R can be in P3 (since not P1 or P4). 

Similarly, others.

Another possibility: A in P3: so _ _ A _ _

Then R in P2 or P5.

If R in P2: _ R A _ _

R in P5: _ _ A _ R

First, if R in P2: positions: P1 R A P4 P5

P4 and P5: P4 cannot be A? A is in P3, so P4 and P5 are other letters.

Common words: C R A B S? But S excluded. 
C R A B -> too short. 
C R A M P? M P, but 5 letters? CRAMP: C R A M P. 
Good: CRAMP.

C R A M P: 
- C(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)

Now, positions: 
R is in P2 -> allowed (since not P1 or P4) 
A is in P3 -> allowed (not P2 or P5) 

And letters: C, R, A, M, P. No excluded letters.

Similarly, B R A N D -> B R A N D. 
- R in P2, A in P3.

Also good.

If R in P5 with A in P3: _ _ A _ R

For example: D O A B R -> not a word. 
F O A M R -> FOAMR? No. 
GOAD R? GOADR? No. 
MANOR but A in P3? M A N O R -> A in P2? Not allowed.

With A in P3: P1 P2 A P4 R

P2 cannot be A (already), and we need P1, P2, P4.

E.g., P L A N R -> PLANR? Not a word.

S W A M R -> SWAMR? No.

D H A K R? Not common.

So better not try this.

Back to CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.

We also have A in P1 option.

For example, A in P1, R in P3: A _ R _ _

For instance, A B R O M? ABROM? Not word. 
A C R I D? But I excluded. 
A D R O P? ADROP? Not word.

A F R O W? AFROW? Not standard.

A G R O W -> AGROW? Not common.

A N R O W -> ANROW? No.

Perhaps not many.

A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R

Then A ? ? ? R

With P2, P3, P4.

P2 cannot be A.

For example, A N V I R? I excluded.

A W A R D -> A W A R D: but A in P1 and P3? And R in P4? 
Positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5)

But we have A in P1 and P3? Feedback: if secret has one A, then A in P1 might be correct or not? In second guess ULTRA, A was in P5 and was -, so A is not in P5, but could be elsewhere.

In AWARD, if secret has A in P1, then it would be ✓ for P1? But we don't know.

Similarly, R in P4: in ULTRA, we had R in P4 and it was -, so R not in P4. Therefore, we cannot use R in P4 in this guess.

In AWARD, R is in position 4. But from second guess, R is not in position 4, so using R in position 4 would be incorrect and waste a guess.

So we must avoid putting R in position 4.

Similarly, for any word, we cannot put R in position 4 because we know R is not in position 4.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2 or 5, and R in position 1 or 4.

Therefore, in the case A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R

Then P3 and P4: P4 cannot be R since R is in P5.

And P2 cannot be A.

Possible: A B O V R? Not word.

A C H O R? ACHOR? Word? Not common.

A M B E R? E excluded.

A N C O R? ANCOR? Old word? Not common.

Perhaps rare.

Best to stick with the first possibilities we had: CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.

Now, CRAMP: C R A M P
- C is a common letter? Not extremely common, but possible.
BRAND: B R A N D

BORAX: B O R A X

Among these, BRAND might be better because N is a common letter.

Also in CRAMP, M and P are common.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Another word with A in P4 and R in P3: so _ _ R A _ 

For example: O R A C L? Not 5 letters. 
C O R A L? But L is excluded? From second guess L is not in word, so CORAL has L -> invalid.

Therefore, no.

B _ R A _ : with B in P1 and R in P3, A in P4.

Possible words: B O R A X (already) or B U R A B? Not. 
B E R A K? E excluded.

So BORAX is one.

Similarly, with N: N O R A D? NORAD? Valid? Place name.

Letters: N O R A D. 
Positions: N(1) P2? But P2 not specified.

NORAD: N(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5)

A in P4 -> allowed? Yes. 
R in P3 -> allowed? Not 1 or 4, so P3 ok.

Letters: N, O, R, A, D. O and N are common.

But D and O.

Now, compared to BRAND: B(1) R(2) A(3) N(4) D)5

In BRAND: 
- R in position 2 -> allowed (not 1 or 4) 
- A in position 3 -> allowed (not 2 or 5) 

Similarly, letters: B, R, A, N, D.

We already tested R and A, so we are testing B, N, D.

In NORAD: N, O, R, A, D -> testing N, O, D.

O is common.

We could also consider ""GROAN"" but G, R, O, A, N: but in second guess ULTRA, we had U,L,T all absent, so G not tested. But O and N common.

But in GROAN: G(1) R(2) O(3) A(4) N(5)

A in P4 -> allowed? Yes, not P2 or P5. 
R in P2 -> allowed? Not P1 or P4.

Yes.

Similarly, ""CROWN"" no A.

I think ""BRAND"" is a solid choice because:
- It tests common letters B, N, D.
- Positions: R in 2 and A in 3, both new positions from previous guesses.

Similarly, ""GROAN"" tests G, O, N.

Since O is more common than B (letter frequency), ""GROAN"" might be slightly better? But both fine.

Another option: ""FROWN""? No A.

Must have A.

""MANOR"" but A in P2 -> invalid.

""BARON"" A in P2 -> invalid.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> R in P2, A in P4? Positions: O(1) R(2) G(3) A(4) N(5)

R in P2: allowed. 
A in P4: allowed.

Letters: O, R, G, A, N. G not excluded.

But in first guess, we tested R and A; now testing O, G, N.

O and N common.

I think any of these are good.

But to decide, let's pick ""BRAND"" for its simplicity.

After this guess, we'll get feedback and can narrow down.

So we choose ""BRAND"".

Final decision: ""BRAND""
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE): R and A are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (ULTRA): U, L, T are absent. R is not in position 4. A is not in position 5.

Key constraints:
- The word contains R and A, with possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4) and for A: 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5).
- Excluded letters: I, S, E, U, L, T.
- Remaining letters must be from the available pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to choose a word that adheres to the constraints, places R and A in new positions, and tests common unused letters (e.g., N, O, D) to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- ""BRAND"" (B, R, A, N, D) is selected because:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, avoiding 1 and 4).
  - A is in position 3 (new position, avoiding 2 and 5).
  - Tests new common letters: B, N, D (N is highly frequent; B and D less so but reasonable).
  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.
  - Valid 5-letter word, allowing for further refinement in subsequent guesses.

<guess>BRAND</guess>",BRAND,"We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ULTRA -> U(x), L(x), T(x), R(-), A(-)
Meaning:
- U, L, T are not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and got ""-"").
- A is in the word, but not in position 5 (since guessed in position 5 and got ""-"").

We know:
- The secret word contains R and A (from both guesses).
- It does not contain I, S, E, U, L, T.
- R cannot be in position 1 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).
- A cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 5 (from second guess).

We need to list the possible letters and positions.

Letters available (not excluded): 
Excluded: I, S, E, U, L, T. That leaves 20 letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we have R and A already present.

But the word has 5 letters, two of which we know are R and A. So the other three letters are from the remaining letters.

For positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess). Also, it might be one of the new letters.
- Position 2: Cannot be A (from first guess). Also, it was L in second guess (which is x, so no L). So it must be a new letter.
- Position 3: Was T in second guess (x) so not T. Can be other.
- Position 4: Cannot be R (since in second guess R is in 4 and got -).
- Position 5: Cannot be A (from second guess).

Additionally, R must be placed in a position that is not 1 and not 4. Possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, A must be placed in a position that is not 2 and not 5. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's see constraints from both guesses:

For R: 
- In first guess, position 1: not R -> so R is not 1.
- In second guess, position 4: not R -> so R is not 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

For A:
- In first guess, position 2: not A -> so A not in 2.
- In second guess, position 5: not A -> so A not in 5.
- Therefore, A must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, note that in the word, R and A are distinct, and we don't have information about duplicates, so assume they are single for now.

We need to form a word with R and A in allowed positions, and three other letters from the remaining alphabet.

We must avoid: I, S, E, U, L, T.

We should guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Possible positions:

Let me denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5.

R can be: P2, P3, or P5.
A can be: P1, P3, or P4.

But note: P3 cannot be both R and A at the same time, unless we later find duplicates, but for now, we assume letters are unique? Not necessarily, but with limited info.

Since we have only two instances, we consider R and A as separate.

So possible cases:

Case 1: A in P1
Then R in P2, P3, or P5.

Case 2: A in P3
Then R in P2 or P5 (since P3 occupied by A).

Case 3: A in P4
Then R in P2, P3, or P5.

Similarly, we have to fill the other positions.

We also note the exclusions: P2 cannot be A (but in case A is P1 or P3 or P4, so P2 is not A). Similarly, P5 cannot be A.

We should choose a word that tests frequent letters and narrows down.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, W, Y, etc.

We might try to include O, N as they are common.

Let's try to find a word that fits.

First, suppose A is in P1 (position 1): A _ _ _ _

Then R could be in P2: A R _ _ _
But P2 would be R, and we need to fill the rest.

With letters not excluded.

For example, A R O B ? But not B, need 5 letters.

A R O W N -> AROWN? Not a word.

A R M O R -> ARMOR? But R is duplicated? Wait, but R is already in P2, and we have to have R, but if the word has two R's? Feedback might show one R correct and one not, but so far we only know one R.

ARMOR is valid.

But let's see feedback: if secret has only one R, then when we guess ARMOR (two R's), the feedback might mark the correct R and show the other as absent or wrong position.

Similarly, A in P1 and R in P3: A _ R _ _

For example: A B R A C? But C, and we don't have E. But A repeated? ABRAC -> not 5. ABACK? A B A C K -> but A repeated, and K.

But not BR.

Let's list possible words.

Since we are guessing, we need one word.

Another idea: use a word with O and N.

Suppose A in P4: so _ _ _ A _

Then R could be in P2, P3, or P5.

For example, R in P5: so _ _ _ A R

Then positions: P1 and P2 and P3 to be filled.

With common letters.

For example, C O R A R? Duplicate.

M A N A R? But P4 is A already, and A in P2? But P2 cannot be A because from first guess A not in P2.

P2 cannot be A.

For _ _ _ A R, P2 cannot be A.

For instance, C O W A R -> COWAR? Not a word. 
B O W A R -> BOWAR? Not standard. 
DOZAR? No.

GONAR? No.

Perhaps not.

R in P2: so _ R _ A _? But P5 cannot be A? No, P5 is different.

This is: P1 R P3 A P5

P5 cannot be A (it's already established), so P5 is another letter.

R in P3: so _ _ R A _

Then P1, P2, P5 to fill.

Common: for example, B O R A X -> BORAX? Valid. 
Letters: B, O, R, A, X. None excluded.

BORAX: 
- B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5)

Check positions: 
A is in P4 -> allowed? Yes, P4 is not P2 or P5. 
R is in P3 -> allowed? R can be in P3 (since not P1 or P4). 

Similarly, others.

Another possibility: A in P3: so _ _ A _ _

Then R in P2 or P5.

If R in P2: _ R A _ _

R in P5: _ _ A _ R

First, if R in P2: positions: P1 R A P4 P5

P4 and P5: P4 cannot be A? A is in P3, so P4 and P5 are other letters.

Common words: C R A B S? But S excluded. 
C R A B -> too short. 
C R A M P? M P, but 5 letters? CRAMP: C R A M P. 
Good: CRAMP.

C R A M P: 
- C(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)

Now, positions: 
R is in P2 -> allowed (since not P1 or P4) 
A is in P3 -> allowed (not P2 or P5) 

And letters: C, R, A, M, P. No excluded letters.

Similarly, B R A N D -> B R A N D. 
- R in P2, A in P3.

Also good.

If R in P5 with A in P3: _ _ A _ R

For example: D O A B R -> not a word. 
F O A M R -> FOAMR? No. 
GOAD R? GOADR? No. 
MANOR but A in P3? M A N O R -> A in P2? Not allowed.

With A in P3: P1 P2 A P4 R

P2 cannot be A (already), and we need P1, P2, P4.

E.g., P L A N R -> PLANR? Not a word.

S W A M R -> SWAMR? No.

D H A K R? Not common.

So better not try this.

Back to CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.

We also have A in P1 option.

For example, A in P1, R in P3: A _ R _ _

For instance, A B R O M? ABROM? Not word. 
A C R I D? But I excluded. 
A D R O P? ADROP? Not word.

A F R O W? AFROW? Not standard.

A G R O W -> AGROW? Not common.

A N R O W -> ANROW? No.

Perhaps not many.

A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R

Then A ? ? ? R

With P2, P3, P4.

P2 cannot be A.

For example, A N V I R? I excluded.

A W A R D -> A W A R D: but A in P1 and P3? And R in P4? 
Positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5)

But we have A in P1 and P3? Feedback: if secret has one A, then A in P1 might be correct or not? In second guess ULTRA, A was in P5 and was -, so A is not in P5, but could be elsewhere.

In AWARD, if secret has A in P1, then it would be ✓ for P1? But we don't know.

Similarly, R in P4: in ULTRA, we had R in P4 and it was -, so R not in P4. Therefore, we cannot use R in P4 in this guess.

In AWARD, R is in position 4. But from second guess, R is not in position 4, so using R in position 4 would be incorrect and waste a guess.

So we must avoid putting R in position 4.

Similarly, for any word, we cannot put R in position 4 because we know R is not in position 4.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2 or 5, and R in position 1 or 4.

Therefore, in the case A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R

Then P3 and P4: P4 cannot be R since R is in P5.

And P2 cannot be A.

Possible: A B O V R? Not word.

A C H O R? ACHOR? Word? Not common.

A M B E R? E excluded.

A N C O R? ANCOR? Old word? Not common.

Perhaps rare.

Best to stick with the first possibilities we had: CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.

Now, CRAMP: C R A M P
- C is a common letter? Not extremely common, but possible.
BRAND: B R A N D

BORAX: B O R A X

Among these, BRAND might be better because N is a common letter.

Also in CRAMP, M and P are common.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Another word with A in P4 and R in P3: so _ _ R A _ 

For example: O R A C L? Not 5 letters. 
C O R A L? But L is excluded? From second guess L is not in word, so CORAL has L -> invalid.

Therefore, no.

B _ R A _ : with B in P1 and R in P3, A in P4.

Possible words: B O R A X (already) or B U R A B? Not. 
B E R A K? E excluded.

So BORAX is one.

Similarly, with N: N O R A D? NORAD? Valid? Place name.

Letters: N O R A D. 
Positions: N(1) P2? But P2 not specified.

NORAD: N(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5)

A in P4 -> allowed? Yes. 
R in P3 -> allowed? Not 1 or 4, so P3 ok.

Letters: N, O, R, A, D. O and N are common.

But D and O.

Now, compared to BRAND: B(1) R(2) A(3) N(4) D)5

In BRAND: 
- R in position 2 -> allowed (not 1 or 4) 
- A in position 3 -> allowed (not 2 or 5) 

Similarly, letters: B, R, A, N, D.

We already tested R and A, so we are testing B, N, D.

In NORAD: N, O, R, A, D -> testing N, O, D.

O is common.

We could also consider ""GROAN"" but G, R, O, A, N: but in second guess ULTRA, we had U,L,T all absent, so G not tested. But O and N common.

But in GROAN: G(1) R(2) O(3) A(4) N(5)

A in P4 -> allowed? Yes, not P2 or P5. 
R in P2 -> allowed? Not P1 or P4.

Yes.

Similarly, ""CROWN"" no A.

I think ""BRAND"" is a solid choice because:
- It tests common letters B, N, D.
- Positions: R in 2 and A in 3, both new positions from previous guesses.

Similarly, ""GROAN"" tests G, O, N.

Since O is more common than B (letter frequency), ""GROAN"" might be slightly better? But both fine.

Another option: ""FROWN""? No A.

Must have A.

""MANOR"" but A in P2 -> invalid.

""BARON"" A in P2 -> invalid.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> R in P2, A in P4? Positions: O(1) R(2) G(3) A(4) N(5)

R in P2: allowed. 
A in P4: allowed.

Letters: O, R, G, A, N. G not excluded.

But in first guess, we tested R and A; now testing O, G, N.

O and N common.

I think any of these are good.

But to decide, let's pick ""BRAND"" for its simplicity.

After this guess, we'll get feedback and can narrow down.

So we choose ""BRAND"".

Final decision: ""BRAND""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE): R and A are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (ULTRA): U, L, T are absent. R is not in position 4. A is not in position 5.

Key constraints:
- The word contains R and A, with possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4) and for A: 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5).
- Excluded letters: I, S, E, U, L, T.
- Remaining letters must be from the available pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to choose a word that adheres to the constraints, places R and A in new positions, and tests common unused letters (e.g., N, O, D) to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- ""BRAND"" (B, R, A, N, D) is selected because:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, avoiding 1 and 4).
  - A is in position 3 (new position, avoiding 2 and 5).
  - Tests new common letters: B, N, D (N is highly frequent; B and D less so but reasonable).
  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.
  - Valid 5-letter word, allowing for further refinement in subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: BRAND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) D(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. Since we have no feedback yet, we want a word that maximizes information gain.
Common strategies for the first word include choosing words with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Let me consider some good starting words:
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"" are often used because they have common letters.
- But we can choose any word; however, it should be a valid English word.

I recall that the word ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another word that some people use, but it's less common.

Another popular one: ""ADIEU"" has too many vowels and might miss consonants.

But let's look at the rules: we must return a valid English word.

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid first word.

So my first guess: RAISE

But note: the response format requires:
<guess> RAISE </guess>

However, we must also include our reasoning within thought before the guess.

So, let me write our reasoning:

Thought process:
We are making the first guess. We choose the word ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are distinct, so we can test more letters.
- This word appears frequently in Wordle starting word lists.

Now, return the guess in the required format.Choosing the first guess in Wordle involves maximizing information gain by selecting a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent starting point because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in English words.
- All five letters are distinct, allowing us to test for the presence or absence of more letters.
- This word has been proven effective in Wordle strategies for quickly narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: present but in the wrong position (-)
- I: not present (x)
- S: not present (x)
- E: not present (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 for R and position 2 for A in ""RAISE"").
2. The letters I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and A, but does not contain I, S, or E.

We must make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not I, S, or E.
- Places R and A in positions different from the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 2 for A).

We also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that contain R and A, and avoid I, S, E.

We can also consider common letters that haven't been tested yet, such as T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

We know the word has 5 letters, and two of them are R and A. So we need to choose 3 more letters that are not I, S, E.

We should avoid repeating the positions for R and A. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2. So in the new guess, R should not be in position 1, and A should not be in position 2.

Let's try to think of words that have R and A, and place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because it wasn't position 2)

We also want to test other common letters.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and includes other common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with T: words like ""TRAIN"" but that has I (which is not allowed) and we know I is not in the word.
- ""TRAIN"" is invalid because of I.

- ""TRACK"" has C and K, but also R and A. However, we must avoid S and E, and I is already out. But note: we don't know about C and K. Also, in ""TRACK"", R is in position 2 (which is allowed) and A is in position 3 (which is allowed because it wasn't position 2). But wait, we have to check if it's valid: T R A C K.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T and A. But it doesn't have R. We need R because we know R is in the word.

So we must include R.

What about ""CRANE""? But that has E (which is not allowed) and C and N. But E is forbidden.

We cannot use E.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""ROAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so invalid.

Similarly, ""RAISE"" we already used.

What about ""PARTY"": 
- P, A, R, T, Y
- A is in position 2? But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""PARTY"", if we put A in position 2 again, that would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. So that's the same position as before, which we know is incorrect. Therefore, we should not use that.

We need a word where A is not in position 2 and R is not in position 1.

Let me try to think of words with A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

For example:
- A in position 1: words like ""A____""
- Then R can be in 3,4,5? But we don't know.

Let me try ""ALERT"" but that has E, which is forbidden.

""ALARM"" has A in position 1 and 3, and R in position 2 and 4. But we have to avoid E, I, S. Also, it has L and M.

But let's check: A in position 1 (which is new, since previously A was in 2) and R in position 2 (which is new, since previously R was in 1). Also, no I, S, E.

So ""ALARM"" is a candidate: A L A R M. But note: it has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, in the feedback for RAISE, we only got one A marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A because the feedback only marks each occurrence. Actually, if there were two A's, and we guessed one in the wrong position, it would still show one minus. But we don't know for sure.

But ""ALARM"" has two A's and one R. We know R is present, and A is present. But we don't know if there are multiple A's.

However, we can use it. But let's see if we can find a word with distinct letters to test more.

We have only 6 tries, so testing more letters is better.

We know the word has R and A, and three other letters that are not I, S, E.

We have tested: R, A, I, S, E. So we have 21 other letters to choose from.

We should try a word that uses common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word with R and A in new positions and include T, O, N.

For example:
- ""RANCH"": R in position 1? But we cannot put R in position 1 because in the first guess R was in position 1 and it was wrong. So R must not be in position 1. Therefore, we cannot start with R.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2.

So ""RANCH"" is invalid because R is in position 1.

What about ""CRANE""? But has E.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N. 
- R is in position 2 (new, since previously R was in 1) -> allowed.
- A is in position 4 (new, since previously A was in 2) -> allowed.
- Letters: O, R, G, A, N. None of I, S, E.
- This word tests O, G, A (in new position), R (in new position), and N.

So ""ORGAN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""ROBIN"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRAWL"": T R A W L. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Letters: T, R, A, W, L. No I, S, E.

Also a candidate.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another: ""PARTY"" but A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

""CARGO"": C A R G O. 
- A is in position 2? That's the same as before -> not allowed. We know A is not in position 2.

So avoid A in position 2.

""CARGO"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.

""BARON"": B A R O N. 
- A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""MANOR"": M A N O R. A in position 2 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"": but no R.

We need R.

""RADAR"": R in position 1 -> invalid, and A in position 2 -> invalid. Also, duplicate letters.

Not ideal.

""TAROT"": T A R O T. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""LARVA"": L A R V A. A in position 2 -> invalid.

So let's try to avoid position 2 for A.

What about A in position 1? Like ""ADORN"", but no R? ""ADORN"": A D O R N. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: A, D, O, R, N. No I, S, E.

This is a valid word.

Similarly, ""ACORN"": A C O R N. Same pattern.

But we don't know if C or D is better.

Another: ""ABHOR"": A B H O R. 
- A in position 1, R in position 5. 
- Tests B, H, O.

But H is less common.

We might prefer common letters.

So ""ADORN"" or ""ACORN"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that.

Another candidate: ""FLAIR"" but has I -> invalid.

""STRAW"": has S -> invalid.

""GROAN"": G R O A N. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: G, R, O, A, N. No I, S, E.

Also good.

Now, comparing:
- ""ORGAN"": O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5)
- ""ADORN"": A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""ACORN"": A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)

We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid the known bad positions.

In ""ADORN"" and ""ACORN"", we are putting A in position 1, which is new, and R in position 4, which is new.

In ""ORGAN"", we put R in position 2 and A in position 4.

In ""GROAN"", R in position 2 and A in position 4.

We also note that in the first guess, we had R in 1 and A in 2, both wrong. Now, by putting them in different positions, we can get more information.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

The letters we haven't tested yet: all except R, A, I, S, E.

Common letters: T, O, L, N, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

In ""ORGAN"", we test O, G, N, and also R and A in new positions.

In ""ADORN"", we test A (in new position), D, O, R (in new position), N.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" tests A, C, O, R, N.

""GROAN"" tests G, R, O, A, N.

We might prefer to include T or L, but we don't have to.

Another word: ""ULTRA"" but has U, L, T, R, A. But A is in position 5? ""ULTRA"": U L T R A -> A in position 5. 
- R in position 4? 
- Positions: U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- So A is in position 5 (new) and R in position 4 (new). 
- Tests U, L, T.

But U and L are common? T is very common.

But we have to choose one.

We could also consider ""RANCH"" but R in position 1 is invalid.

What about ""PAINT""? Has I -> invalid.

""MOUTH""? No R or A.

We must include both R and A.

So let's decide.

I think ""ADORN"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new).
- It includes common letters: D, O, N.
- It avoids the forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""ACORN"" is also good.

But let's see which one is more common. Both are valid.

Another word: ""ROUND""? But no A.

We need A.

""BRAND"": B R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is different. 
- Letters: B, R, A, N, D. No I, S, E.

Also a good candidate.

Now, we have several options: ""ADORN"", ""ACORN"", ""ORGAN"", ""GROAN"", ""BRAND"", etc.

We should choose one that maximizes new letters and commonality.

But note: we don't know which letters are present, so we want to cover as many as possible.

We have 5 positions and we know two letters (R and A) must be included, so we are testing 3 new letters.

All these words test 3 new letters.

Common letters: in the English language, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we already know E, I, S are out. So next are T, O, N, A (we have A), R (we have R), then L, C, D, U, M, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, L, etc.

In ""ADORN"": tests D, O, N -> O and N are common.
In ""ACORN"": tests C, O, N -> O and N common, C is less common than T or L.
In ""ORGAN"": tests O, G, N -> G is less common.
In ""GROAN"": tests G, O, N -> same as above.
In ""BRAND"": tests B, R, A, N, D -> B and D, but N is common.

But we don't have T or L in these.

What about a word with T? Like ""TRAIL"" but has I -> invalid.

""TRACT"": T R A C T. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- But duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word. 
- Also, no I, S, E. 
- But A is in position 3, which is new.

But duplicate T might reduce information.

""CRWTH""? Not common.

""WARTY"": W A R T Y. 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""PARTY"" invalid.

""ARTY"": not 5 letters.

""TAROT"": invalid because A in position 2.

What about ""RATTY"": R in position 1 -> invalid.

""ATTAR"": A T T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), R in position 5 (new). 
- But duplicate T and A? 
- Letters: A, T, T, A, R -> tests T, but duplicates.

Not ideal.

""LATTE"": no R.

We might have to go without T for now.

Another idea: ""DOZAR""? Not a word.

""NADIR"": N A D I R -> has I -> invalid.

""RADII"": has I and duplicate -> invalid.

So let's go back.

Perhaps ""ADORN"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""ULTRA"" again: U L T R A. 
- U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). 
- This tests U, L, T, which are new, and R and A in new positions (R in 4, A in 5). 
- And no I, S, E.

This might be even better because it tests three new common letters: T is very common, L is common, U is less common but still.

But we are testing U and L, which are vowels? U is a vowel, but we already have A.

But it's valid.

We can also consider ""ALERT"" but has E -> invalid.

""ALTAR"": A L T A R. 
- A in position 1 (new), but then A again in position 4? 
- And R in position 5. 
- But duplicate A. 
- Tests L and T.

But duplicate might not be best.

""ULTRA"" has no duplicates.

Similarly, ""PATIO"" has I and O, but I is invalid.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a valid word and tests T and L, which are common.

But let's see: U is not as common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""TALON"": T A L O N. 
- But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""TONAL"": T O N A L. 
- A in position 4 (new). 
- But no R. We must include R.

We need R.

""R"" is required.

So ""TONAL"" doesn't have R.

""LORAN"": L O R A N. 
- R in position 3 (new), A in position 4 (new). 
- Letters: L, O, R, A, N. No I, S, E.

This is also good: tests L, O, N, and R and A in new positions.

Similarly, ""NORMAL"": too long.

""ROYAL"": has Y, but no N? ""ROYAL"": R O Y A L. 
- R in position 1 -> invalid.

""CAROL"": has C, A, R, O, L. But A in position 2 -> invalid.

""VOCAL"": no R.

I think ""LORAN"" is a good choice: L(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), N(5). 
- R is in position 3 (not 1) and A in position 4 (not 2). 
- Tests L, O, N.

Similarly, ""ADORN"" is A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> tests D, O, N.

Between ""LORAN"" and ""ADORN"", which is better? ""LORAN"" tests L instead of D. L is more common than D.

In English, L is more frequent than D? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is first, then T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, then D, L, U, etc. So L and D are close, but L is slightly more common.

But both are reasonable.

""ULTRA"" tests U, L, T. T is very common (2nd), L is 11th, U is 13th. So it tests T, which is high frequency.

So ""ULTRA"" might be better because it includes T.

But U is less common, but we are testing it.

We have to choose one.

I think ""ULTRA"" is a good choice because it tests T and L, and U, and positions R and A at the end.

So let's go with ""ULTRA"".

But to confirm: 
- U: new
- L: new
- T: new
- R: in position 4 (not 1)
- A: in position 5 (not 2)

And the word is valid.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" but no R.

I think ""ULTRA"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there's a word with more common letters.

""CRATE"" has E -> invalid.

""TRADE"" has E -> invalid.

""GRAND"": G R A N D. 
- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). 
- Tests G, N, D.

But no T.

""BRAND"": B R A N D, same.

""DRANK"": D R A N K. 
- R in position 2, A in position 3. 
- Tests D, N, K.

K is less common.

I think ""ULTRA"" is fine.

But note: the secret word might not have U, but we are testing.

We can also consider ""OCTAD"" but no R.

I think we should go with ""ULTRA"".

But let's double-check the feedback: we know R and A are present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. In ""ULTRA"", R is in 4 and A in 5, so that's fine.

So I choose ""ULTRA"".

But in the response, we must output in the format.

So the second guess is ""ULTRA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- A is present but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are in the secret word), but avoid I, S, E.
- R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2 (as per feedback).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, U) and positions to maximize information gain.

The word ""ULTRA"" is chosen because:
- It contains R and A, with R in position 4 (new position) and A in position 5 (new position).
- It introduces three new letters: U, L, T (all common and not yet tested).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word that adheres to the constraints.

<guess>ULTRA</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(-) A(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ULTRA -> U(x), L(x), T(x), R(-), A(-)
Meaning:
- U, L, T are not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and got ""-"").
- A is in the word, but not in position 5 (since guessed in position 5 and got ""-"").

We know:
- The secret word contains R and A (from both guesses).
- It does not contain I, S, E, U, L, T.
- R cannot be in position 1 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).
- A cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 5 (from second guess).

We need to list the possible letters and positions.

Letters available (not excluded): 
Excluded: I, S, E, U, L, T. That leaves 20 letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we have R and A already present.

But the word has 5 letters, two of which we know are R and A. So the other three letters are from the remaining letters.

For positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess). Also, it might be one of the new letters.
- Position 2: Cannot be A (from first guess). Also, it was L in second guess (which is x, so no L). So it must be a new letter.
- Position 3: Was T in second guess (x) so not T. Can be other.
- Position 4: Cannot be R (since in second guess R is in 4 and got -).
- Position 5: Cannot be A (from second guess).

Additionally, R must be placed in a position that is not 1 and not 4. Possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, A must be placed in a position that is not 2 and not 5. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's see constraints from both guesses:

For R: 
- In first guess, position 1: not R -> so R is not 1.
- In second guess, position 4: not R -> so R is not 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

For A:
- In first guess, position 2: not A -> so A not in 2.
- In second guess, position 5: not A -> so A not in 5.
- Therefore, A must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, note that in the word, R and A are distinct, and we don't have information about duplicates, so assume they are single for now.

We need to form a word with R and A in allowed positions, and three other letters from the remaining alphabet.

We must avoid: I, S, E, U, L, T.

We should guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Possible positions:

Let me denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5.

R can be: P2, P3, or P5.
A can be: P1, P3, or P4.

But note: P3 cannot be both R and A at the same time, unless we later find duplicates, but for now, we assume letters are unique? Not necessarily, but with limited info.

Since we have only two instances, we consider R and A as separate.

So possible cases:

Case 1: A in P1
Then R in P2, P3, or P5.

Case 2: A in P3
Then R in P2 or P5 (since P3 occupied by A).

Case 3: A in P4
Then R in P2, P3, or P5.

Similarly, we have to fill the other positions.

We also note the exclusions: P2 cannot be A (but in case A is P1 or P3 or P4, so P2 is not A). Similarly, P5 cannot be A.

We should choose a word that tests frequent letters and narrows down.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, W, Y, etc.

We might try to include O, N as they are common.

Let's try to find a word that fits.

First, suppose A is in P1 (position 1): A _ _ _ _

Then R could be in P2: A R _ _ _
But P2 would be R, and we need to fill the rest.

With letters not excluded.

For example, A R O B ? But not B, need 5 letters.

A R O W N -> AROWN? Not a word.

A R M O R -> ARMOR? But R is duplicated? Wait, but R is already in P2, and we have to have R, but if the word has two R's? Feedback might show one R correct and one not, but so far we only know one R.

ARMOR is valid.

But let's see feedback: if secret has only one R, then when we guess ARMOR (two R's), the feedback might mark the correct R and show the other as absent or wrong position.

Similarly, A in P1 and R in P3: A _ R _ _

For example: A B R A C? But C, and we don't have E. But A repeated? ABRAC -> not 5. ABACK? A B A C K -> but A repeated, and K.

But not BR.

Let's list possible words.

Since we are guessing, we need one word.

Another idea: use a word with O and N.

Suppose A in P4: so _ _ _ A _

Then R could be in P2, P3, or P5.

For example, R in P5: so _ _ _ A R

Then positions: P1 and P2 and P3 to be filled.

With common letters.

For example, C O R A R? Duplicate.

M A N A R? But P4 is A already, and A in P2? But P2 cannot be A because from first guess A not in P2.

P2 cannot be A.

For _ _ _ A R, P2 cannot be A.

For instance, C O W A R -> COWAR? Not a word. 
B O W A R -> BOWAR? Not standard. 
DOZAR? No.

GONAR? No.

Perhaps not.

R in P2: so _ R _ A _? But P5 cannot be A? No, P5 is different.

This is: P1 R P3 A P5

P5 cannot be A (it's already established), so P5 is another letter.

R in P3: so _ _ R A _

Then P1, P2, P5 to fill.

Common: for example, B O R A X -> BORAX? Valid. 
Letters: B, O, R, A, X. None excluded.

BORAX: 
- B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5)

Check positions: 
A is in P4 -> allowed? Yes, P4 is not P2 or P5. 
R is in P3 -> allowed? R can be in P3 (since not P1 or P4). 

Similarly, others.

Another possibility: A in P3: so _ _ A _ _

Then R in P2 or P5.

If R in P2: _ R A _ _

R in P5: _ _ A _ R

First, if R in P2: positions: P1 R A P4 P5

P4 and P5: P4 cannot be A? A is in P3, so P4 and P5 are other letters.

Common words: C R A B S? But S excluded. 
C R A B -> too short. 
C R A M P? M P, but 5 letters? CRAMP: C R A M P. 
Good: CRAMP.

C R A M P: 
- C(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)

Now, positions: 
R is in P2 -> allowed (since not P1 or P4) 
A is in P3 -> allowed (not P2 or P5) 

And letters: C, R, A, M, P. No excluded letters.

Similarly, B R A N D -> B R A N D. 
- R in P2, A in P3.

Also good.

If R in P5 with A in P3: _ _ A _ R

For example: D O A B R -> not a word. 
F O A M R -> FOAMR? No. 
GOAD R? GOADR? No. 
MANOR but A in P3? M A N O R -> A in P2? Not allowed.

With A in P3: P1 P2 A P4 R

P2 cannot be A (already), and we need P1, P2, P4.

E.g., P L A N R -> PLANR? Not a word.

S W A M R -> SWAMR? No.

D H A K R? Not common.

So better not try this.

Back to CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.

We also have A in P1 option.

For example, A in P1, R in P3: A _ R _ _

For instance, A B R O M? ABROM? Not word. 
A C R I D? But I excluded. 
A D R O P? ADROP? Not word.

A F R O W? AFROW? Not standard.

A G R O W -> AGROW? Not common.

A N R O W -> ANROW? No.

Perhaps not many.

A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R

Then A ? ? ? R

With P2, P3, P4.

P2 cannot be A.

For example, A N V I R? I excluded.

A W A R D -> A W A R D: but A in P1 and P3? And R in P4? 
Positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5)

But we have A in P1 and P3? Feedback: if secret has one A, then A in P1 might be correct or not? In second guess ULTRA, A was in P5 and was -, so A is not in P5, but could be elsewhere.

In AWARD, if secret has A in P1, then it would be ✓ for P1? But we don't know.

Similarly, R in P4: in ULTRA, we had R in P4 and it was -, so R not in P4. Therefore, we cannot use R in P4 in this guess.

In AWARD, R is in position 4. But from second guess, R is not in position 4, so using R in position 4 would be incorrect and waste a guess.

So we must avoid putting R in position 4.

Similarly, for any word, we cannot put R in position 4 because we know R is not in position 4.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 2 or 5, and R in position 1 or 4.

Therefore, in the case A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R

Then P3 and P4: P4 cannot be R since R is in P5.

And P2 cannot be A.

Possible: A B O V R? Not word.

A C H O R? ACHOR? Word? Not common.

A M B E R? E excluded.

A N C O R? ANCOR? Old word? Not common.

Perhaps rare.

Best to stick with the first possibilities we had: CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.

Now, CRAMP: C R A M P
- C is a common letter? Not extremely common, but possible.
BRAND: B R A N D

BORAX: B O R A X

Among these, BRAND might be better because N is a common letter.

Also in CRAMP, M and P are common.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Another word with A in P4 and R in P3: so _ _ R A _ 

For example: O R A C L? Not 5 letters. 
C O R A L? But L is excluded? From second guess L is not in word, so CORAL has L -> invalid.

Therefore, no.

B _ R A _ : with B in P1 and R in P3, A in P4.

Possible words: B O R A X (already) or B U R A B? Not. 
B E R A K? E excluded.

So BORAX is one.

Similarly, with N: N O R A D? NORAD? Valid? Place name.

Letters: N O R A D. 
Positions: N(1) P2? But P2 not specified.

NORAD: N(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5)

A in P4 -> allowed? Yes. 
R in P3 -> allowed? Not 1 or 4, so P3 ok.

Letters: N, O, R, A, D. O and N are common.

But D and O.

Now, compared to BRAND: B(1) R(2) A(3) N(4) D)5

In BRAND: 
- R in position 2 -> allowed (not 1 or 4) 
- A in position 3 -> allowed (not 2 or 5) 

Similarly, letters: B, R, A, N, D.

We already tested R and A, so we are testing B, N, D.

In NORAD: N, O, R, A, D -> testing N, O, D.

O is common.

We could also consider ""GROAN"" but G, R, O, A, N: but in second guess ULTRA, we had U,L,T all absent, so G not tested. But O and N common.

But in GROAN: G(1) R(2) O(3) A(4) N(5)

A in P4 -> allowed? Yes, not P2 or P5. 
R in P2 -> allowed? Not P1 or P4.

Yes.

Similarly, ""CROWN"" no A.

I think ""BRAND"" is a solid choice because:
- It tests common letters B, N, D.
- Positions: R in 2 and A in 3, both new positions from previous guesses.

Similarly, ""GROAN"" tests G, O, N.

Since O is more common than B (letter frequency), ""GROAN"" might be slightly better? But both fine.

Another option: ""FROWN""? No A.

Must have A.

""MANOR"" but A in P2 -> invalid.

""BARON"" A in P2 -> invalid.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> R in P2, A in P4? Positions: O(1) R(2) G(3) A(4) N(5)

R in P2: allowed. 
A in P4: allowed.

Letters: O, R, G, A, N. G not excluded.

But in first guess, we tested R and A; now testing O, G, N.

O and N common.

I think any of these are good.

But to decide, let's pick ""BRAND"" for its simplicity.

After this guess, we'll get feedback and can narrow down.

So we choose ""BRAND"".

Final decision: ""BRAND""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE): R and A are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (ULTRA): U, L, T are absent. R is not in position 4. A is not in position 5.

Key constraints:
- The word contains R and A, with possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5 (not 1 or 4) and for A: 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5).
- Excluded letters: I, S, E, U, L, T.
- Remaining letters must be from the available pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to choose a word that adheres to the constraints, places R and A in new positions, and tests common unused letters (e.g., N, O, D) to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- ""BRAND"" (B, R, A, N, D) is selected because:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, avoiding 1 and 4).
  - A is in position 3 (new position, avoiding 2 and 5).
  - Tests new common letters: B, N, D (N is highly frequent; B and D less so but reasonable).
  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.
  - Valid 5-letter word, allowing for further refinement in subsequent guesses.

So we need to choose 3 more letters that are not I, S, E.\n\nWe should avoid repeating the positions for R and A. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2. So in the new guess, R should not be in position 1, and A should not be in position 2.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and A, and place them in different positions.\n\nPossible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put A in position 1, that\'s allowed because it wasn\'t position 2)\n\nWe also want to test other common letters.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and includes other common consonants.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- Starting with T: words like ""TRAIN"" but that has I (which is not allowed) and we know I is not in the word.\n- ""TRAIN"" is invalid because of I.\n\n- ""TRACK"" has C and K, but also R and A. However, we must avoid S and E, and I is already out. But note: we don\'t know about C and K. Also, in ""TRACK"", R is in position 2 (which is allowed) and A is in position 3 (which is allowed because it wasn\'t position 2). But wait, we have to check if it\'s valid: T R A C K.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T and A. But it doesn\'t have R. We need R because we know R is in the word.\n\nSo we must include R.\n\nWhat about ""CRANE""? But that has E (which is not allowed) and C and N.

But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2.

So that\'s the same position as before, which we know is incorrect. Therefore, we should not use that.\n\nWe need a word where A is not in position 2 and R is not in position 1.\n\nLet me try to think of words with A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- A in position 1: words like ""A____""\n- Then R can be in 3,4,5? But we don\'t know.\n\nLet me try ""ALERT"" but that has E, which is forbidden.\n\n""ALARM"" has A in position 1 and 3, and R in position 2 and 4. But we have to avoid E, I, S. Also, it has L and M.\n\nBut let\'s check: A in position 1 (which is new, since previously A was in 2) and R in position 2 (which is new, since previously R was in 1). Also, no I, S, E.\n\nSo ""ALARM"" is a candidate: A L A R M. But note: it has two A\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but it\'s possible. However, in the feedback for RAISE, we only got one A marked, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean there is only one A because the feedback only marks each occurrence. Actually, if there were two A\'s, and we guessed one in the wrong position, it would still show one minus. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut ""ALARM"" has two A\'s and one R. We know R is present, and A is present. But we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s.\n\nHowever, we can use it. But let\'s see if we can find a word with distinct letters to test more.\n\nWe have only 6 tries, so testing more letters is better.\n\nWe know the word has R and A, and three other letters that are not I, S, E.\n\nWe have tested: R, A, I, S, E. So we have 21 other letters to choose from.\n\nWe should try a word that uses common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, N, L, C, D, U, etc.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R and A in new positions and include T, O, N.\n\nFor example:\n- ""RANCH"": R in position 1? But we cannot put R in position 1 because in the first guess R was in position 1 and it was wrong. So R must not be in position 1. Therefore, we cannot start with R.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put A in position 2.\n\nSo ""RANCH"" is invalid because R is in position 1.\n\nWhat about ""CRANE""? But has E.\n\n""ORGAN"": O R G A N. \n- R is in position 2 (new, since previously R was in 1) -> allowed.\n- A is in position 4 (new, since previously A was in 2) -> allowed.\n- Letters: O, R, G, A, N. None of I, S, E.\n- This word tests O, G, A (in new position), R (in new position), and N.\n\nSo ""ORGAN"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROBIN"" but has I -> invalid.\n\n""TRAWL"": T R A W L. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- Letters: T, R, A, W, L. No I, S, E.\n\nAlso a candidate.\n\nBut we might prefer more common letters.\n\nAnother: ""PARTY"" but A is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n""CARGO"": C A R G O. \n- A is in position 2? That\'s the same as before -> not allowed. We know A is not in position 2.\n\nSo avoid A in position 2.\n\n""CARGO"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""BARON"": B A R O N. \n- A is in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""MANOR"": M A N O R. A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""OCTAL"": but no R.\n\nWe need R.\n\n""RADAR"": R in position 1 -> invalid, and A in position 2 -> invalid. Also, duplicate letters.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""TAROT"": T A R O T. \n- A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""LARVA"": L A R V A. A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s try to avoid position 2 for A.\n\nWhat about A in position 1? Like ""ADORN"", but no R? ""ADORN"": A D O R N. \n- A in position 1 (new), R in position 4 (new). \n- Letters: A, D, O, R, N. No I, S, E.\n\nThis is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""ACORN"": A C O R N. Same pattern.\n\nBut we don\'t know if C or D is better.\n\nAnother: ""ABHOR"": A B H O R. \n- A in position 1, R in position 5. \n- Tests B, H, O.\n\nBut H is less common.\n\nWe might prefer common letters.\n\nSo ""ADORN"" or ""ACORN"" are good.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, but we don\'t have evidence for that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FLAIR"" but has I -> invalid.\n\n""STRAW"": has S -> invalid.\n\n""GROAN"": G R O A N. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new). \n- Letters: G, R, O, A, N. No I, S, E.\n\nAlso good.\n\nNow, comparing:\n- ""ORGAN"": O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5)\n- ""ADORN"": A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)\n- ""ACORN"": A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)\n- ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid the known bad positions.\n\nIn ""ADORN"" and ""ACORN"", we are putting A in position 1, which is new, and R in position 4, which is new.\n\nIn ""ORGAN"", we put R in position 2 and A in position 4.\n\nIn ""GROAN"", R in position 2 and A in position 4.\n\nWe also note that in the first guess, we had R in 1 and A in 2, both wrong. Now, by putting them in different positions, we can get more information.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nThe letters we haven\'t tested yet: all except R, A, I, S, E.\n\nCommon letters: T, O, L, N, C, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nIn ""ORGAN"", we test O, G, N, and also R and A in new positions.\n\nIn ""ADORN"", we test A (in new position), D, O, R (in new position), N.\n\nSimilarly, ""ACORN"" tests A, C, O, R, N.\n\n""GROAN"" tests G, R, O, A, N.\n\nWe might prefer to include T or L, but we don\'t have to.\n\nAnother word: ""ULTRA"" but has U, L, T, R, A. But A is in position 5? ""ULTRA"": U L T R A -> A in position 5. \n- R in position 4? \n- Positions: U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). \n- So A is in position 5 (new) and R in position 4 (new). \n- Tests U, L, T.\n\nBut U and L are common? T is very common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe could also consider ""RANCH"" but R in position 1 is invalid.\n\nWhat about ""PAINT""? Has I -> invalid.\n\n""MOUTH""? No R or A.\n\nWe must include both R and A.\n\nSo let\'s decide.\n\nI think ""ADORN"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests A in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and R in position 4 (new).\n- It includes common letters: D, O, N.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ACORN"" is also good.\n\nBut let\'s see which one is more common. Both are valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROUND""? But no A.\n\nWe need A.\n\n""BRAND"": B R A N D. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we put A in position 3, which is different. \n- Letters: B, R, A, N, D. No I, S, E.\n\nAlso a good candidate.\n\nNow, we have several options: ""ADORN"", ""ACORN"", ""ORGAN"", ""GROAN"", ""BRAND"", etc.\n\nWe should choose one that maximizes new letters and commonality.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which letters are present, so we want to cover as many as possible.\n\nWe have 5 positions and we know two letters (R and A) must be included, so we are testing 3 new letters.\n\nAll these words test 3 new letters.\n\nCommon letters: in the English language, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we already know E, I, S are out. So next are T, O, N, A (we have A), R (we have R), then L, C, D, U, M, etc.\n\nSo we should try to include T, O, N, L, etc.\n\nIn ""ADORN"": tests D, O, N -> O and N are common.\nIn ""ACORN"": tests C, O, N -> O and N common, C is less common than T or L.\nIn ""ORGAN"": tests O, G, N -> G is less common.\nIn ""GROAN"": tests G, O, N -> same as above.\nIn ""BRAND"": tests B, R, A, N, D -> B and D, but N is common.\n\nBut we don\'t have T or L in these.\n\nWhat about a word with T? Like ""TRAIL"" but has I -> invalid.\n\n""TRACT"": T R A C T. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- But duplicate T? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. \n- Also, no I, S, E. \n- But A is in position 3, which is new.\n\nBut duplicate T might reduce information.\n\n""CRWTH""? Not common.\n\n""WARTY"": W A R T Y. \n- A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""PARTY"" invalid.\n\n""ARTY"": not 5 letters.\n\n""TAROT"": invalid because A in position 2.\n\nWhat about ""RATTY"": R in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n""ATTAR"": A T T A R. \n- A in position 1 (new), R in position 5 (new). \n- But duplicate T and A? \n- Letters: A, T, T, A, R -> tests T, but duplicates.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""LATTE"": no R.\n\nWe might have to go without T for now.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOZAR""? Not a word.\n\n""NADIR"": N A D I R -> has I -> invalid.\n\n""RADII"": has I and duplicate -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s go back.\n\nPerhaps ""ADORN"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of ""ULTRA"" again: U L T R A. \n- U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). \n- This tests U, L, T, which are new, and R and A in new positions (R in 4, A in 5). \n- And no I, S, E.\n\nThis might be even better because it tests three new common letters: T is very common, L is common, U is less common but still.\n\nBut we are testing U and L, which are vowels? U is a vowel, but we already have A.\n\nBut it\'s valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""ALERT"" but has E -> invalid.\n\n""ALTAR"": A L T A R. \n- A in position 1 (new), but then A again in position 4? \n- And R in position 5. \n- But duplicate A. \n- Tests L and T.\n\nBut duplicate might not be best.\n\n""ULTRA"" has no duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""PATIO"" has I and O, but I is invalid.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is a valid word and tests T and L, which are common.\n\nBut let\'s see: U is not as common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""TALON"": T A L O N. \n- But A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""TONAL"": T O N A L. \n- A in position 4 (new). \n- But no R. We must include R.\n\nWe need R.\n\n""R"" is required.\n\nSo ""TONAL"" doesn\'t have R.\n\n""LORAN"": L O R A N. \n- R in position 3 (new), A in position 4 (new). \n- Letters: L, O, R, A, N. No I, S, E.\n\nThis is also good: tests L, O, N, and R and A in new positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""NORMAL"": too long.\n\n""ROYAL"": has Y, but no N? ""ROYAL"": R O Y A L. \n- R in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n""CAROL"": has C, A, R, O, L. But A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""VOCAL"": no R.\n\nI think ""LORAN"" is a good choice: L(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), N(5). \n- R is in position 3 (not 1) and A in position 4 (not 2). \n- Tests L, O, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADORN"" is A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> tests D, O, N.\n\nBetween ""LORAN"" and ""ADORN"", which is better? ""LORAN"" tests L instead of D. L is more common than D.\n\nIn English, L is more frequent than D? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is first, then T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, then D, L, U, etc. So L and D are close, but L is slightly more common.\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\n""ULTRA"" tests U, L, T. T is very common (2nd), L is 11th, U is 13th. So it tests T, which is high frequency.\n\nSo ""ULTRA"" might be better because it includes T.\n\nBut U is less common, but we are testing it.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is a good choice because it tests T and L, and U, and positions R and A at the end.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ULTRA"".\n\nBut to confirm: \n- U: new\n- L: new\n- T: new\n- R: in position 4 (not 1)\n- A: in position 5 (not 2)\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLANT"" but no R.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word with more common letters.\n\n""CRATE"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""TRADE"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""GRAND"": G R A N D. \n- R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new). \n- Tests G, N, D.\n\nBut no T.\n\n""BRAND"": B R A N D, same.\n\n""DRANK"": D R A N K. \n- R in position 2, A in position 3. \n- Tests D, N, K.\n\nK is less common.\n\nI think ""ULTRA"" is fine.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not have U, but we are testing.\n\nWe can also consider ""OCTAD"" but no R.\n\nI think we should go with ""ULTRA"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback: we know R and A are present, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively. In ""ULTRA"", R is in 4 and A in 5, so that\'s fine.\n\nSo I choose ""ULTRA"".\n\nBut in the response, we must output in the format.\n\nSo the second guess is ""ULTRA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n- A is present but in the wrong position (not position 2).\n- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R and A (since they are in the secret word), but avoid I, S, E.\n- R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2 (as per feedback).\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, U) and positions to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""ULTRA"" is chosen because:\n- It contains R and A, with R in position 4 (new position) and A in position 5 (new position).\n- It introduces three new letters: U, L, T (all common and not yet tested).\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word that adheres to the constraints.\n\n<guess>ULTRA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(-) A(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ULTRA -> U(x), L(x), T(x), R(-), A(-)\nMeaning:\n- U, L, T are not in the word.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and got ""-"").\n- A is in the word, but not in position 5 (since guessed in position 5 and got ""-"").\n\nWe know:\n- The secret word contains R and A (from both guesses).\n- It does not contain I, S, E, U, L, T.\n- R cannot be in position 1 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).\n- A cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 5 (from second guess).\n\nWe need to list the possible letters and positions.\n\nLetters available (not excluded): \nExcluded: I, S, E, U, L, T. That leaves 20 letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we have R and A already present.\n\nBut the word has 5 letters, two of which we know are R and A. So the other three letters are from the remaining letters.\n\nFor positions:\n- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess). Also, it might be one of the new letters.\n- Position 2: Cannot be A (from first guess). Also, it was L in second guess (which is x, so no L). So it must be a new letter.\n- Position 3: Was T in second guess (x) so not T. Can be other.\n- Position 4: Cannot be R (since in second guess R is in 4 and got -).\n- Position 5: Cannot be A (from second guess).\n\nAdditionally, R must be placed in a position that is not 1 and not 4. Possible positions for R: 2, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, A must be placed in a position that is not 2 and not 5. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nNow let\'s see constraints from both guesses:\n\nFor R: \n- In first guess, position 1: not R -> so R is not 1.\n- In second guess, position 4: not R -> so R is not 4.\n- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nFor A:\n- In first guess, position 2: not A -> so A not in 2.\n- In second guess, position 5: not A -> so A not in 5.\n- Therefore, A must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, note that in the word, R and A are distinct, and we don\'t have information about duplicates, so assume they are single for now.\n\nWe need to form a word with R and A in allowed positions, and three other letters from the remaining alphabet.\n\nWe must avoid: I, S, E, U, L, T.\n\nWe should guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.\n\nPossible positions:\n\nLet me denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5.\n\nR can be: P2, P3, or P5.\nA can be: P1, P3, or P4.\n\nBut note: P3 cannot be both R and A at the same time, unless we later find duplicates, but for now, we assume letters are unique? Not necessarily, but with limited info.\n\nSince we have only two instances, we consider R and A as separate.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nCase 1: A in P1\nThen R in P2, P3, or P5.\n\nCase 2: A in P3\nThen R in P2 or P5 (since P3 occupied by A).\n\nCase 3: A in P4\nThen R in P2, P3, or P5.\n\nSimilarly, we have to fill the other positions.\n\nWe also note the exclusions: P2 cannot be A (but in case A is P1 or P3 or P4, so P2 is not A). Similarly, P5 cannot be A.\n\nWe should choose a word that tests frequent letters and narrows down.\n\nCommon letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe might try to include O, N as they are common.\n\nLet\'s try to find a word that fits.\n\nFirst, suppose A is in P1 (position 1): A _ _ _ _\n\nThen R could be in P2: A R _ _ _\nBut P2 would be R, and we need to fill the rest.\n\nWith letters not excluded.\n\nFor example, A R O B ? But not B, need 5 letters.\n\nA R O W N -> AROWN? Not a word.\n\nA R M O R -> ARMOR? But R is duplicated? Wait, but R is already in P2, and we have to have R, but if the word has two R\'s? Feedback might show one R correct and one not, but so far we only know one R.\n\nARMOR is valid.\n\nBut let\'s see feedback: if secret has only one R, then when we guess ARMOR (two R\'s), the feedback might mark the correct R and show the other as absent or wrong position.\n\nSimilarly, A in P1 and R in P3: A _ R _ _\n\nFor example: A B R A C? But C, and we don\'t have E. But A repeated? ABRAC -> not 5. ABACK? A B A C K -> but A repeated, and K.\n\nBut not BR.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nSince we are guessing, we need one word.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with O and N.\n\nSuppose A in P4: so _ _ _ A _\n\nThen R could be in P2, P3, or P5.\n\nFor example, R in P5: so _ _ _ A R\n\nThen positions: P1 and P2 and P3 to be filled.\n\nWith common letters.\n\nFor example, C O R A R? Duplicate.\n\nM A N A R? But P4 is A already, and A in P2? But P2 cannot be A because from first guess A not in P2.\n\nP2 cannot be A.\n\nFor _ _ _ A R, P2 cannot be A.\n\nFor instance, C O W A R -> COWAR? Not a word. \nB O W A R -> BOWAR? Not standard. \nDOZAR? No.\n\nGONAR? No.\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nR in P2: so _ R _ A _? But P5 cannot be A? No, P5 is different.\n\nThis is: P1 R P3 A P5\n\nP5 cannot be A (it\'s already established), so P5 is another letter.\n\nR in P3: so _ _ R A _\n\nThen P1, P2, P5 to fill.\n\nCommon: for example, B O R A X -> BORAX? Valid. \nLetters: B, O, R, A, X. None excluded.\n\nBORAX: \n- B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5)\n\nCheck positions: \nA is in P4 -> allowed? Yes, P4 is not P2 or P5. \nR is in P3 -> allowed? R can be in P3 (since not P1 or P4). \n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAnother possibility: A in P3: so _ _ A _ _\n\nThen R in P2 or P5.\n\nIf R in P2: _ R A _ _\n\nR in P5: _ _ A _ R\n\nFirst, if R in P2: positions: P1 R A P4 P5\n\nP4 and P5: P4 cannot be A? A is in P3, so P4 and P5 are other letters.\n\nCommon words: C R A B S? But S excluded. \nC R A B -> too short. \nC R A M P? M P, but 5 letters? CRAMP: C R A M P. \nGood: CRAMP.\n\nC R A M P: \n- C(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)\n\nNow, positions: \nR is in P2 -> allowed (since not P1 or P4) \nA is in P3 -> allowed (not P2 or P5) \n\nAnd letters: C, R, A, M, P. No excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, B R A N D -> B R A N D. \n- R in P2, A in P3.\n\nAlso good.\n\nIf R in P5 with A in P3: _ _ A _ R\n\nFor example: D O A B R -> not a word. \nF O A M R -> FOAMR? No. \nGOAD R? GOADR? No. \nMANOR but A in P3? M A N O R -> A in P2? Not allowed.\n\nWith A in P3: P1 P2 A P4 R\n\nP2 cannot be A (already), and we need P1, P2, P4.\n\nE.g., P L A N R -> PLANR? Not a word.\n\nS W A M R -> SWAMR? No.\n\nD H A K R? Not common.\n\nSo better not try this.\n\nBack to CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.\n\nWe also have A in P1 option.\n\nFor example, A in P1, R in P3: A _ R _ _\n\nFor instance, A B R O M? ABROM? Not word. \nA C R I D? But I excluded. \nA D R O P? ADROP? Not word.\n\nA F R O W? AFROW? Not standard.\n\nA G R O W -> AGROW? Not common.\n\nA N R O W -> ANROW? No.\n\nPerhaps not many.\n\nA in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R\n\nThen A ? ? ? R\n\nWith P2, P3, P4.\n\nP2 cannot be A.\n\nFor example, A N V I R? I excluded.\n\nA W A R D -> A W A R D: but A in P1 and P3? And R in P4? \nPositions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5)\n\nBut we have A in P1 and P3? Feedback: if secret has one A, then A in P1 might be correct or not? In second guess ULTRA, A was in P5 and was -, so A is not in P5, but could be elsewhere.\n\nIn AWARD, if secret has A in P1, then it would be ✓ for P1? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, R in P4: in ULTRA, we had R in P4 and it was -, so R not in P4. Therefore, we cannot use R in P4 in this guess.\n\nIn AWARD, R is in position 4. But from second guess, R is not in position 4, so using R in position 4 would be incorrect and waste a guess.\n\nSo we must avoid putting R in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, for any word, we cannot put R in position 4 because we know R is not in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put A in position 2 or 5, and R in position 1 or 4.\n\nTherefore, in the case A in P1, R in P5: A _ _ _ R\n\nThen P3 and P4: P4 cannot be R since R is in P5.\n\nAnd P2 cannot be A.\n\nPossible: A B O V R? Not word.\n\nA C H O R? ACHOR? Word? Not common.\n\nA M B E R? E excluded.\n\nA N C O R? ANCOR? Old word? Not common.\n\nPerhaps rare.\n\nBest to stick with the first possibilities we had: CRAMP or BORAX or BRAND.\n\nNow, CRAMP: C R A M P\n- C is a common letter? Not extremely common, but possible.\nBRAND: B R A N D\n\nBORAX: B O R A X\n\nAmong these, BRAND might be better because N is a common letter.\n\nAlso in CRAMP, M and P are common.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include more common letters.\n\nAnother word with A in P4 and R in P3: so _ _ R A _ \n\nFor example: O R A C L? Not 5 letters. \nC O R A L? But L is excluded? From second guess L is not in word, so CORAL has L -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, no.\n\nB _ R A _ : with B in P1 and R in P3, A in P4.\n\nPossible words: B O R A X (already) or B U R A B? Not. \nB E R A K? E excluded.\n\nSo BORAX is one.\n\nSimilarly, with N: N O R A D? NORAD? Valid? Place name.\n\nLetters: N O R A D. \nPositions: N(1) P2? But P2 not specified.\n\nNORAD: N(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5)\n\nA in P4 -> allowed? Yes. \nR in P3 -> allowed? Not 1 or 4, so P3 ok.\n\nLetters: N, O, R, A, D. O and N are common.\n\nBut D and O.\n\nNow, compared to BRAND: B(1) R(2) A(3) N(4) D)5\n\nIn BRAND: \n- R in position 2 -> allowed (not 1 or 4) \n- A in position 3 -> allowed (not 2 or 5) \n\nSimilarly, letters: B, R, A, N, D.\n\nWe already tested R and A, so we are testing B, N, D.\n\nIn NORAD: N, O, R, A, D -> testing N, O, D.\n\nO is common.\n\nWe could also consider ""GROAN"" but G, R, O, A, N: but in second guess ULTRA, we had U,L,T all absent, so G not tested.

We have feedback from three guesses:

### Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)
- A: present, wrong position (not position 2)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: absent

### Guess 2: ULTRA
- U: absent
- L: absent
- T: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 4)
- A: present, wrong position (not position 5)

### Guess 3: BRAND
- B: absent
- R: correct position (position 2)! This means R is fixed in position 2.
- A: correct position (position 3)! So A is fixed in position 3.
- N: absent
- D: absent

From Guess 3:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ R A _ _

Now, we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: position 2 is R, position 3 is A.
- The word is: P1 R A P4 P5

From previous feedback, we can update the set of excluded and included letters.

**Excluded letters**: I, S, E, U, L, T, B, N, D (marked absent in any guess)

**Included letters**:
- R and A are confirmed and positioned.
- We might have other letters not yet revealed.

**Position constraints based on feedback**:
- For position 1: Cannot be R (from RAISE feedback).
- For position 4: Cannot be R (from ULTRA feedback: R not in position 4).
- For position 5: Cannot be A (from ULTRA feedback: A not in position 5).

In the current known positions:
- P1: must be one of the remaining letters, not excluded, and not R.
- P4: must be a letter not excluded, and cannot be R (we know it's not position 4 for R).
- P5: must be a letter not excluded, and cannot be A.

**Available letters**: We have 13 letters not excluded: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus possibly others, but excluding the absent ones: I,S,E,U,L,T,B,N,D)

But note: we tested many letters already. The only letters we know to be present are R and A (both fixed). Are there more?

In the feedback for earlier guesses:
- RAISE: R and A present, but no other letters were marked present except R and A. So no additional letters from RAISE.
- ULTRA: Only R and A present, and we know their positions were wrong at that time, but now fixed.
- BRAND: Only R and A marked correct/present, and B,N,D absent.

Therefore, the remaining three positions (P1, P4, P5) must consist of letters that haven't been tested or that could be present. However, since no other letters were marked as present in any feedback, we might assume that the word only has R and A as the unique letters? Not necessarily: it could have duplicates, but we don't have evidence.

But let's consider: In RAISE, if there were additional letters, they should have been marked if present. For example, if a letter in RAISE was present but wrong position, it would have shown ""-"", but only R and A had ""-"". Similarly for ULTRA, only R and A had feedback meaning present.

Therefore, the secret word consists of exactly:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 1: a letter not in {I,S,E,U,L,T,B,N,D} and not R
- Position 4: a letter not in the excluded set and not R
- Position 5: a letter not in the excluded set and not A

And since no other letters are indicated to be present, the word should not contain any other letters from previous guesses except R and A.

But wait: we need the word to be valid English word with R and A at positions 2 and 3.

We can list possible words: known pattern: _ R A _ _

With the available letters, we can form words.

Common words:

- CRAWL? But L excluded and W not excluded? C R A W L -> L excluded, invalid.
- CRAFT: C R A F T -> T excluded? From ULTRA, T is absent -> excluded. So CRAFT invalid.
- DRAFT: D excluded.
- GRAPH: G R A P H -> H not excluded? G R A P H: G is in available, P, H available.
  - But G was not tested? Yes, available. And T not present.
  - But feedback: in ULTRA, L and T absent, but G not tested.

But GRAPH has H.

Another: CRAMP? But M not excluded? C R A M P: C, M, P available? C is still possible.

But in BRAND, we had D and N absent, so CRAMP might be an option.

But let's see:

Pattern: ?R A ? ?

Available letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

List possible 5-letter words beginning with R A, but position 1 is not R, it's the first letter.

Common words:

- CRAWL: L excluded -> invalid.
- CRAZE: Z valid? Word CRAZE: C R A Z E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- CRAVE: E? C R A V E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- BRAVO: B excluded -> invalid.
- FRAME: E? F R A M E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- GRACE: E? G R A C E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- GRAPE: E excluded -> invalid.
- TRACK: T excluded -> invalid.

We need a word without E and without the excluded letters.

Try GRAPH: G R A P H -> 5 letters: G, R, A, P, H. 
- R and A in positions 2,3: but GRAPH is G R A P H -> so positions 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:P, 5:H.
- Checking excluded: G not excluded, P not excluded, H not excluded. 
- And no E or others.

Similarly, other options?

CROWD? But O not in pattern? Pattern is _ R A _ _, so must be R A in middle? C R A ? ?

For example:
- WRACK: W R A C K? But T excluded? No T. WRACK: letters W,R,A,C,K. All available? Yes? W not excluded? In ULTRA we tested U,L,T, not W. 
- But is WRACK a valid word? Yes, meaning a variant of wreck or other.

Similarly, CRACK: C R A C K -> duplicate C? And K available? Yes.

But both have C.

Another: PROWL? No A.

Focus on words with pattern: ?R A _ _

Possible: CRABS? S excluded -> invalid.
CRAMS: C R A M S -> S excluded -> invalid.
CRAMP: C R A M P -> M and P available? C, M, P available.

CRAMP: C(1) R(2) A(3) M(4) P(5)

Similarly, GRAMP? Less common.

CHARM: C H A R M? But pattern is _ R A _ _, not _ H A R M. We need R in position 2 and A in position 3.

For CHARM, the positions are C H A R M: position 3 is A, but position 2 is H, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 2 fixed as R and position 3 as A.

So pattern: X R A Y Z

With X,Y,Z from available letters.

Now, CRAMP: X=C, Y=M, Z=P -> available.

Other possibilities:
- GRAMP: not common word? G R A M P -> GRAMP is not standard English? Usually not used.
- GRAPH: G R A P H -> X=G, Y=P, Z=H -> available.
- WRACK: W R A C K -> X=W, Y=C, Z=K -> available.
- CRACK: C R A C K -> X=C, Y=C, Z=K -> duplicate C? But that's acceptable if the word has duplicates? We don't know from feedback.
- CRAWL: L excluded -> invalid.
- FRAUD: F R A U D -> U excluded? U is excluded -> invalid.
- BROAD: B excluded -> invalid.
- DROPO? Not pattern.

PRANK: P R A N K -> N excluded? From BRAND feedback N absent -> excluded.

So PRANK invalid.

CRANK: C R A N K -> N excluded.

Similarly, any with N excluded.

So CRAMP and GRAPH and WRACK are candidates.

Also: WOMAN? Not pattern.

KRAUT? K R A U T -> U and T excluded -> invalid.

GROAN: G R O A N -> O not in position 3? Pattern requires A in position 3? GROAN is G R O A N -> positions: O in position 3? But we need A in position 3? So not.

We need A in position 3.

So CRAMP, GRAPH, WRACK, and maybe others.

What about WRAPS? S excluded.

CRASS? S excluded.

FRAP? Not 5 letters. FRAPP? Not.

WORRY? Not pattern.

GRAFT: T excluded -> invalid.

CRAFT: T excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between CRAMP, GRAPH, WRACK.

All have different letters.

To decide, we could pick GRAPH because it tests G, P, H which are common:

- GRAPH: G, P, H.

Another candidate: PRAWN: P R A W N -> N excluded -> invalid.

So not.

WRATH: T excluded -> invalid.

Therefore, three main options.

Now, since we need to guess quickly and narrow down, choose one.

GRAPH might be a good choice because:
- It uses common letters G, P, H.
- It is a known word.

Similarly, CRAMP is valid.

WRACK is also valid.

To avoid duplication of C in CRACK? No duplication in CRAMP for positions.

CRAMP has unique letters: C, R, A, M, P.

GRAPH: G, R, A, P, H.

WRACK: W, R, A, C, K.

Now, feedback might reveal.

But since no information on these, any choice is fine.

I'll pick GRAPH.

So the fourth guess: GRAPH

Pattern: P1=G, P2=R, P3=A, P4=P, P5=H.

Check constraints:
- P1: G, not R -> ok
- P4: P, not R -> ok
- P5: H, not A -> ok

And letters not excluded.

So guess GRAPH.
</think>
Given the feedback from previous guesses, I have deduced the following information:

- **From Guess 1 (RAISE):** R is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the word but not in position 2. I, S, and E are absent.
- **From Guess 2 (ULTRA):** U, L, and T are absent. R is not in position 4. A is not in position 5.
- **From Guess 3 (BRAND):** B, N, and D are absent. R is correctly placed in position 2. A is correctly placed in position 3.

This reveals that the secret word has the fixed pattern: _ R A _ _ (position 2 is R, position 3 is A).

### Constraints:
- **Excluded letters:** I, S, E, U, L, T, B, N, D.
- **Available letters (for positions 1, 4, and 5):** C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Position restrictions:**
  - Position 1: Cannot be R (from RAISE feedback) and must be an available letter.
  - Position 4: Cannot be R (from ULTRA feedback).
  - Position 5: Cannot be A (from ULTRA feedback).
- No other letters from previous feedback are present (e.g., only R and A have been confirmed as present/repeatedly positioned).
- The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting ""_ R A _ _"".

### Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Fixation:** The secret word starts with an unknown letter (P1), followed by R (P2), A (P3), and two unknown letters (P4 and P5).
2. **Letter Exclusion:** Several common letters have been excluded (e.g., B, N, D in BRAND), leaving less common options.
3. **Word Selection:** I evaluated potential words fitting ""_ R A _ _"" using available letters:
   - Examples: CRACK (invalid—C duplicate or uncommon pairing), WRACK (valid—tests W, C, K), CRAMP (valid—tests C, M, P), GRAPH (valid—tests G, P, H).
   - **GRAPH chosen because:** It uses three common available letters (G, P, H), avoids duplicates/exclusions, and is a high-frequency word. Testing G, P, and H maximizes information gain for the remaining positions.
4. **Validation:** GRAPH positions: G (P1), R (P2—fixed), A (P3—fixed), P (P4), H (P5). This adheres to constraints:
   - P1 (G) ≠ R, P4 (P) ≠ R, P5 (H) ≠ A.
   - All letters (G, R, A, P, H) are valid and untested/excluded.
5. **Goal:** Narrow possibilities—if GRAPH provides new feedback, it will confirm/refute G, P, and H, helping solve positions 1, 4, and 5 with fewer guesses.

<guess>GRAPH</guess>",GRAPH,"We have feedback from three guesses:

### Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)
- A: present, wrong position (not position 2)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: absent

### Guess 2: ULTRA
- U: absent
- L: absent
- T: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 4)
- A: present, wrong position (not position 5)

### Guess 3: BRAND
- B: absent
- R: correct position (position 2)! This means R is fixed in position 2.
- A: correct position (position 3)! So A is fixed in position 3.
- N: absent
- D: absent

From Guess 3:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ R A _ _

Now, we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: position 2 is R, position 3 is A.
- The word is: P1 R A P4 P5

From previous feedback, we can update the set of excluded and included letters.

**Excluded letters**: I, S, E, U, L, T, B, N, D (marked absent in any guess)

**Included letters**:
- R and A are confirmed and positioned.
- We might have other letters not yet revealed.

**Position constraints based on feedback**:
- For position 1: Cannot be R (from RAISE feedback).
- For position 4: Cannot be R (from ULTRA feedback: R not in position 4).
- For position 5: Cannot be A (from ULTRA feedback: A not in position 5).

In the current known positions:
- P1: must be one of the remaining letters, not excluded, and not R.
- P4: must be a letter not excluded, and cannot be R (we know it's not position 4 for R).
- P5: must be a letter not excluded, and cannot be A.

**Available letters**: We have 13 letters not excluded: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus possibly others, but excluding the absent ones: I,S,E,U,L,T,B,N,D)

But note: we tested many letters already. The only letters we know to be present are R and A (both fixed). Are there more?

In the feedback for earlier guesses:
- RAISE: R and A present, but no other letters were marked present except R and A. So no additional letters from RAISE.
- ULTRA: Only R and A present, and we know their positions were wrong at that time, but now fixed.
- BRAND: Only R and A marked correct/present, and B,N,D absent.

Therefore, the remaining three positions (P1, P4, P5) must consist of letters that haven't been tested or that could be present. However, since no other letters were marked as present in any feedback, we might assume that the word only has R and A as the unique letters? Not necessarily: it could have duplicates, but we don't have evidence.

But let's consider: In RAISE, if there were additional letters, they should have been marked if present. For example, if a letter in RAISE was present but wrong position, it would have shown ""-"", but only R and A had ""-"". Similarly for ULTRA, only R and A had feedback meaning present.

Therefore, the secret word consists of exactly:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 1: a letter not in {I,S,E,U,L,T,B,N,D} and not R
- Position 4: a letter not in the excluded set and not R
- Position 5: a letter not in the excluded set and not A

And since no other letters are indicated to be present, the word should not contain any other letters from previous guesses except R and A.

But wait: we need the word to be valid English word with R and A at positions 2 and 3.

We can list possible words: known pattern: _ R A _ _

With the available letters, we can form words.

Common words:

- CRAWL? But L excluded and W not excluded? C R A W L -> L excluded, invalid.
- CRAFT: C R A F T -> T excluded? From ULTRA, T is absent -> excluded. So CRAFT invalid.
- DRAFT: D excluded.
- GRAPH: G R A P H -> H not excluded? G R A P H: G is in available, P, H available.
  - But G was not tested? Yes, available. And T not present.
  - But feedback: in ULTRA, L and T absent, but G not tested.

But GRAPH has H.

Another: CRAMP? But M not excluded? C R A M P: C, M, P available? C is still possible.

But in BRAND, we had D and N absent, so CRAMP might be an option.

But let's see:

Pattern: ?R A ? ?

Available letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

List possible 5-letter words beginning with R A, but position 1 is not R, it's the first letter.

Common words:

- CRAWL: L excluded -> invalid.
- CRAZE: Z valid? Word CRAZE: C R A Z E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- CRAVE: E? C R A V E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- BRAVO: B excluded -> invalid.
- FRAME: E? F R A M E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- GRACE: E? G R A C E -> E excluded -> invalid.
- GRAPE: E excluded -> invalid.
- TRACK: T excluded -> invalid.

We need a word without E and without the excluded letters.

Try GRAPH: G R A P H -> 5 letters: G, R, A, P, H. 
- R and A in positions 2,3: but GRAPH is G R A P H -> so positions 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:P, 5:H.
- Checking excluded: G not excluded, P not excluded, H not excluded. 
- And no E or others.

Similarly, other options?

CROWD? But O not in pattern? Pattern is _ R A _ _, so must be R A in middle? C R A ? ?

For example:
- WRACK: W R A C K? But T excluded? No T. WRACK: letters W,R,A,C,K. All available? Yes? W not excluded? In ULTRA we tested U,L,T, not W. 
- But is WRACK a valid word? Yes, meaning a variant of wreck or other.

Similarly, CRACK: C R A C K -> duplicate C? And K available? Yes.

But both have C.

Another: PROWL? No A.

Focus on words with pattern: ?R A _ _

Possible: CRABS? S excluded -> invalid.
CRAMS: C R A M S -> S excluded -> invalid.
CRAMP: C R A M P -> M and P available? C, M, P available.

CRAMP: C(1) R(2) A(3) M(4) P(5)

Similarly, GRAMP? Less common.

CHARM: C H A R M? But pattern is _ R A _ _, not _ H A R M. We need R in position 2 and A in position 3.

For CHARM, the positions are C H A R M: position 3 is A, but position 2 is H, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 2 fixed as R and position 3 as A.

So pattern: X R A Y Z

With X,Y,Z from available letters.

Now, CRAMP: X=C, Y=M, Z=P -> available.

Other possibilities:
- GRAMP: not common word? G R A M P -> GRAMP is not standard English? Usually not used.
- GRAPH: G R A P H -> X=G, Y=P, Z=H -> available.
- WRACK: W R A C K -> X=W, Y=C, Z=K -> available.
- CRACK: C R A C K -> X=C, Y=C, Z=K -> duplicate C? But that's acceptable if the word has duplicates? We don't know from feedback.
- CRAWL: L excluded -> invalid.
- FRAUD: F R A U D -> U excluded? U is excluded -> invalid.
- BROAD: B excluded -> invalid.
- DROPO? Not pattern.

PRANK: P R A N K -> N excluded? From BRAND feedback N absent -> excluded.

So PRANK invalid.

CRANK: C R A N K -> N excluded.

Similarly, any with N excluded.

So CRAMP and GRAPH and WRACK are candidates.

Also: WOMAN? Not pattern.

KRAUT? K R A U T -> U and T excluded -> invalid.

GROAN: G R O A N -> O not in position 3? Pattern requires A in position 3? GROAN is G R O A N -> positions: O in position 3? But we need A in position 3? So not.

We need A in position 3.

So CRAMP, GRAPH, WRACK, and maybe others.

What about WRAPS? S excluded.

CRASS? S excluded.

FRAP? Not 5 letters. FRAPP? Not.

WORRY? Not pattern.

GRAFT: T excluded -> invalid.

CRAFT: T excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between CRAMP, GRAPH, WRACK.

All have different letters.

To decide, we could pick GRAPH because it tests G, P, H which are common:

- GRAPH: G, P, H.

Another candidate: PRAWN: P R A W N -> N excluded -> invalid.

So not.

WRATH: T excluded -> invalid.

Therefore, three main options.

Now, since we need to guess quickly and narrow down, choose one.

GRAPH might be a good choice because:
- It uses common letters G, P, H.
- It is a known word.

Similarly, CRAMP is valid.

WRACK is also valid.

To avoid duplication of C in CRACK? No duplication in CRAMP for positions.

CRAMP has unique letters: C, R, A, M, P.

GRAPH: G, R, A, P, H.

WRACK: W, R, A, C, K.

Now, feedback might reveal.

But since no information on these, any choice is fine.

I'll pick GRAPH.

So the fourth guess: GRAPH

Pattern: P1=G, P2=R, P3=A, P4=P, P5=H.

Check constraints:
- P1: G, not R -> ok
- P4: P, not R -> ok
- P5: H, not A -> ok

And letters not excluded.

So guess GRAPH.Given the feedback from previous guesses, I have deduced the following information:

- **From Guess 1 (RAISE):** R is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the word but not in position 2. I, S, and E are absent.
- **From Guess 2 (ULTRA):** U, L, and T are absent. R is not in position 4. A is not in position 5.
- **From Guess 3 (BRAND):** B, N, and D are absent. R is correctly placed in position 2. A is correctly placed in position 3.

This reveals that the secret word has the fixed pattern: _ R A _ _ (position 2 is R, position 3 is A).

### Constraints:
- **Excluded letters:** I, S, E, U, L, T, B, N, D.
- **Available letters (for positions 1, 4, and 5):** C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Position restrictions:**
  - Position 1: Cannot be R (from RAISE feedback) and must be an available letter.
  - Position 4: Cannot be R (from ULTRA feedback).
  - Position 5: Cannot be A (from ULTRA feedback).
- No other letters from previous feedback are present (e.g., only R and A have been confirmed as present/repeatedly positioned).
- The guess must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting ""_ R A _ _"".

### Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Fixation:** The secret word starts with an unknown letter (P1), followed by R (P2), A (P3), and two unknown letters (P4 and P5).
2. **Letter Exclusion:** Several common letters have been excluded (e.g., B, N, D in BRAND), leaving less common options.
3. **Word Selection:** I evaluated potential words fitting ""_ R A _ _"" using available letters:
   - Examples: CRACK (invalid—C duplicate or uncommon pairing), WRACK (valid—tests W, C, K), CRAMP (valid—tests C, M, P), GRAPH (valid—tests G, P, H).
   - **GRAPH chosen because:** It uses three common available letters (G, P, H), avoids duplicates/exclusions, and is a high-frequency word. Testing G, P, and H maximizes information gain for the remaining positions.
4. **Validation:** GRAPH positions: G (P1), R (P2—fixed), A (P3—fixed), P (P4), H (P5). This adheres to constraints:
   - P1 (G) ≠ R, P4 (P) ≠ R, P5 (H) ≠ A.
   - All letters (G, R, A, P, H) are valid and untested/excluded.
5. **Goal:** Narrow possibilities—if GRAPH provides new feedback, it will confirm/refute G, P, and H, helping solve positions 1, 4, and 5 with fewer guesses.",Guess 4: GRAPH -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) P(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
