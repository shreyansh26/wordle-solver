We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (from the first guess).

 Also, note that R and A must be placed in different positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We might want to try other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we can try to place R and A in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note that in the first guess, position 2 had R and it was wrong, so R can be in 1,3,4,5? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in that position, so it could be in any of the other four positions).

 Similarly, A can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Let's try to come up with a word that includes R and A, and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROAST"", but note that we have E and N are absent, and O and S are new. However, we have:
   R at position 1 (which is allowed, since previously it was at 2 and now we are trying 1) and 
   A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for the same letter in the same position would be the same. But we are allowed to reuse a letter in the same position? The rules don't forbid it, but it's not optimal. We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is not at position 3. So in our next guess, we should try A in a different position.

 However, let's check ""ROAST"":
   R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

 But we know A is not at position 3 (from the first guess), so we should avoid that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADAR"", but that has two A's and two R's? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid for now because we want to test more letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTY""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

 Let's check:
   A is at position 2 (which is allowed because previously it was at 3 and now we are trying 2) and 
   R is at position 3 (previously it was at 2, now at 3). 

 This seems okay. Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

 But note: we must avoid C, N, E, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we don't know. Since we are only required to have one R and one A (as per the first guess) but the word might have more? The feedback for the first guess only told us that there is at least one R and one A.

 But to keep it simple, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""STARK""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at 3.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But we know N is absent (from the first guess: N was at position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 again? That's not good.

 Let's try ""RATIO"":
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 1) and avoids position 3 for A (we are putting A at 2). Also, we are introducing T, I, O.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" uses R, A, T, I, O -> all allowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"", but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 How about ""RAILS""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (it's at 1) and A is not at 3 (it's at 2). Also, no forbidden letters.

 But note: we are using S and L, which are common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have the letter I? We don't know.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.

 This also avoids the bad positions: R was at 2 (now at 3) and A was at 3 (now at 2). 

 But note: we are introducing P, T, S.

 We have two good candidates: ""RATIO"" and ""PARTS"". 

 However, ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, and O) which might help. But we already know A is in the word, so we are testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common consonants. 

 Let me think of ""STAMP"", but then we have A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we cannot put A at 3. 

 How about ""SPARK""? 
   S at 1, P at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""CRASP""? But C is absent.

 Another idea: ""TAROT""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> but we have two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, A at 2 and R at 3: that's acceptable.

 But we are using T twice? And we don't know if T is in the word. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" but N is absent.

 After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: P, A, R, T, S.
   - It places A and R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong (A not at 3, R not at 2).
   - It introduces three new letters: P, T, S.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and A at position 2. We know from the first guess that R is in the word but not at position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. So positions 2 and 3 are open for swapping? Actually, we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. That is allowed because we haven't tried A at 2 or R at 3 before.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 3 or A at position 2. It only told us that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.

 So ""PARTS"" is a valid guess.

 Another candidate: ""RANTS"" but N is absent.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 This also works.

 But I think ""PARTS"" is better because it has S and T which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" is similar to ""PARTS"" but rearranged. 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know R is not at position 2 (from the first guess). So ""TRAPS"" would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Therefore, ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""PARTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I will go with ""PARTS"".

 But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word, but it's a common letter.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more vowels? We know A is in, but what about O, I, U? 

 However, we have already used A and R, and we are introducing three new consonants: P, T, S. That might be efficient.

 Another idea: ""ORBIT"" but we have O and B and I, and T. But we are missing A? We must include A and R because we know they are in the word. So we cannot skip A or R.

 Therefore, we must include both A and R in the guess.

 So ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""PARTS"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- A is present but not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C, N, E (confirmed absent).
3. Places R anywhere except position 2 and A anywhere except position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""RATIO"" and ""RAPID"", but settled on ""PARTS"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces three new common consonants: P, T, and S.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repositions the known letters effectively.

   Specifically, R was in position 2 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (from the first guess).

 Also, note that R and A must be placed in different positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We might want to try other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we can try to place R and A in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note that in the first guess, position 2 had R and it was wrong, so R can be in 1,3,4,5? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in that position, so it could be in any of the other four positions).

 Similarly, A can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Let's try to come up with a word that includes R and A, and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROAST"", but note that we have E and N are absent, and O and S are new. However, we have:
   R at position 1 (which is allowed, since previously it was at 2 and now we are trying 1) and 
   A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for the same letter in the same position would be the same. But we are allowed to reuse a letter in the same position? The rules don't forbid it, but it's not optimal. We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is not at position 3. So in our next guess, we should try A in a different position.

 However, let's check ""ROAST"":
   R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

 But we know A is not at position 3 (from the first guess), so we should avoid that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADAR"", but that has two A's and two R's? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid for now because we want to test more letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTY""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

 Let's check:
   A is at position 2 (which is allowed because previously it was at 3 and now we are trying 2) and 
   R is at position 3 (previously it was at 2, now at 3). 

 This seems okay. Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

 But note: we must avoid C, N, E, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we don't know. Since we are only required to have one R and one A (as per the first guess) but the word might have more? The feedback for the first guess only told us that there is at least one R and one A.

 But to keep it simple, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""STARK""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at 3.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But we know N is absent (from the first guess: N was at position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 again? That's not good.

 Let's try ""RATIO"":
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 1) and avoids position 3 for A (we are putting A at 2). Also, we are introducing T, I, O.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" uses R, A, T, I, O -> all allowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"", but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 How about ""RAILS""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (it's at 1) and A is not at 3 (it's at 2). Also, no forbidden letters.

 But note: we are using S and L, which are common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have the letter I? We don't know.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.

 This also avoids the bad positions: R was at 2 (now at 3) and A was at 3 (now at 2). 

 But note: we are introducing P, T, S.

 We have two good candidates: ""RATIO"" and ""PARTS"". 

 However, ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, and O) which might help. But we already know A is in the word, so we are testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common consonants. 

 Let me think of ""STAMP"", but then we have A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we cannot put A at 3. 

 How about ""SPARK""? 
   S at 1, P at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""CRASP""? But C is absent.

 Another idea: ""TAROT""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> but we have two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, A at 2 and R at 3: that's acceptable.

 But we are using T twice? And we don't know if T is in the word. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" but N is absent.

 After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: P, A, R, T, S.
   - It places A and R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong (A not at 3, R not at 2).
   - It introduces three new letters: P, T, S.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and A at position 2. We know from the first guess that R is in the word but not at position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. So positions 2 and 3 are open for swapping? Actually, we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. That is allowed because we haven't tried A at 2 or R at 3 before.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 3 or A at position 2. It only told us that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.

 So ""PARTS"" is a valid guess.

 Another candidate: ""RANTS"" but N is absent.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 This also works.

 But I think ""PARTS"" is better because it has S and T which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" is similar to ""PARTS"" but rearranged. 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know R is not at position 2 (from the first guess). So ""TRAPS"" would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Therefore, ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""PARTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I will go with ""PARTS"".

 But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word, but it's a common letter.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more vowels? We know A is in, but what about O, I, U? 

 However, we have already used A and R, and we are introducing three new consonants: P, T, S. That might be efficient.

 Another idea: ""ORBIT"" but we have O and B and I, and T. But we are missing A? We must include A and R because we know they are in the word. So we cannot skip A or R.

 Therefore, we must include both A and R in the guess.

 So ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""PARTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- A is present but not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C, N, E (confirmed absent).
3. Places R anywhere except position 2 and A anywhere except position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""RATIO"" and ""RAPID"", but settled on ""PARTS"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces three new common consonants: P, T, and S.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repositions the known letters effectively.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""parts""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (because we put it at position 2 in this guess and got '-')
  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 3 (since in ""parts"", R is the third letter)
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S
Present letters: R (at position 3), A (but not at position 3, and now also not at position 2)

We also know that the secret word has:
  Position 3: R (fixed)

And A is in the word but not at position 2 or 3.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S

We have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has R at position 3.
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 or 3.
  - Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also want to test new common letters. The remaining common letters might include: L, I, O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since not 2 or 3).

We also need to fill the other positions (1,2,4,5) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, P, T, S. So avoid: C, E, N, P, T, S.

We can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that A is already known to be in the word, so we must include it.

We have to form a 5-letter word with R at position 3 and A at either 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: A at position 1: 
  Pattern: A _ R _ _

Option 2: A at position 4:
  Pattern: _ _ R A _

Option 3: A at position 5:
  Pattern: _ _ R _ A

We also need to use new letters to get more information.

Let's try to find words that fit these patterns and use common unused letters.

For example, for pattern ""A _ R _ _"", we can try:
  A?R??: Words like ""ABRIM"", ""ABRID"", but we don't know if they are words. We need valid words.

Alternatively, let's think of common words:

- ""ALARM"": but L is allowed, and M is allowed. However, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, A is at position 1 and 4? But we are only required to have one A, but the word might have more. However, we are not sure. Also, we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""ALARM"" has A at 1 and 4, and R at 3. But we are testing A at 1 and 4? We know A is not at 3, but we don't know about 1 and 4. However, we are also introducing L and M.

But note: we have already used A and R, so we are only testing L and M? Actually, we are testing the positions of A and also the new letters.

But wait, in ""ALARM"", the A at position 1: if the secret word has A at position 1, we would get a check, but if not, we get a dash. Similarly for the A at position 4.

However, we are only required to have one A? The feedback from the first guess only said there is at least one A. It could have more.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A again? Actually, we can use it to test multiple positions. But we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid many letters.

But let's check the letters: ""ALARM"" uses A, L, A, R, M. The absent letters we have are C, N, E, P, T, S. So L and M are allowed.

But note: we are using A twice. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. If it doesn't, then one of the A's might be marked as absent? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then every occurrence that is in the word will be marked as either check or dash, and if there are duplicates, then the feedback might mark one as dash and the other as absent? Actually, no. The rules: for each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, it's check. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it's dash. If it's not in the word, it's x. But if the word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one will be marked as dash (if in the word but wrong position) and the other as x (if that position doesn't have A and there are no more A's). But we don't know the count.

So it might be risky to use two A's because we might get an x for one of them and then we don't know if it's because of the position or because there's only one A.

Therefore, to avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with only one A.

So let's look for words with one A, at position 1, 4, or 5, and R at position 3.

Patterns:

1. A _ R _ _ (with one A, so the other letters are not A)
2. _ _ R A _ (with one A)
3. _ _ R _ A (with one A)

Now, let's think of common words:

For pattern 1: A _ R _ _
  Examples: 
    ""ABRIM"" - not common
    ""ACRID"" - but C is absent
    ""ADRIB"" - not a word
    ""AERIE"" - E is absent
    ""AGREE"" - E is absent and two E's
    ""ALARM"" - has two A's, which we want to avoid for now.

How about ""ALERT""? But E and T are absent.

""ALIKE""? But I and K are allowed, but E is absent.

""ALIVE""? E absent.

""ALOUD"": A at 1, L at 2, O at 4, U at 5? But we need R at 3. So ""ALOUD"" doesn't have R.

We need R at 3.

""ALURM""? Not a word.

For pattern 2: _ _ R A _
  Examples:
    ""BORAX"" - B, O, R, A, X -> R at 3, A at 4. But we have to avoid X? We don't know if X is common, but it's allowed. Also, B and O are new.
    ""CRAWL"" - but C is absent.
    ""DRAWL"" - D, R, A, W, L -> R at 2? No, we need R at 3. In ""DRAWL"", R is at 2. We need R at 3.

We need the third letter to be R.

So pattern: first two letters, then R, then A, then one letter.

Examples: 
  ""BARMY""? B at 1, A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: in ""parts"", A was at 2 and we got dash, meaning A is not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2. But in this pattern, A is at 4, so that's okay. The word is: [letter1] [letter2] R A [letter5]

So letter2 can be anything except the absent letters and not A? Because we are not putting A at 2.

For example: 
  ""WORDY"" -> no A.
  ""FORAM"" -> F, O, R, A, M -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a valid word? I think ""foram"" is a biological term, but might not be common. 

  ""LORAL"" -> L, O, R, A, L -> but two L's? and A at 4. But is ""loral"" a word? It means relating to the lore (a part of a bird). Not very common.

  ""MORAY"" -> M, O, R, A, Y -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a type of eel. Valid.

  ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a common word.

But note: in ""MURAL"", we have A at 4. We are testing A at 4. Also, we are introducing M, U, L.

Similarly, ""MORAL"" -> M, O, R, A, L -> same as above but O instead of U.

But we don't know if O or U are in the word.

For pattern 3: _ _ R _ A
  Examples:
    ""BURKA"" -> B, U, R, K, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""FURCA"" -> not common.
    ""JIRGA"" -> J, I, R, G, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""VARIA"" -> V, A, R, I, A -> but two A's? and A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. Also, in ""VARIA"", the first letter is V, then A at 2 -> but we cannot put A at 2. So invalid.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z is not common.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but C is absent.

  ""DOBRA"" -> D, O, B, R, A -> R at 4? We need R at 3. In ""DOBRA"", R is at 4, not 3.

We need R at 3 and A at 5.

So: [letter1] [letter2] R [letter4] A

Examples:
  ""AORTA"" -> but A at 1 and 5? We have two A's. Also, we are putting A at 1? That's allowed, but we are also testing A at 5. But we have two A's.

  ""BARRA"" -> two A's? and R at 3? B, A, R, R, A -> but we have two R's? We know there is at least one R, but maybe two? We don't know.

  ""TERRA"" -> T is absent.

  ""VERRA"" -> not a word.

  ""HURRA"" -> H, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""PARRY"" -> P is absent.

  ""CARRY"" -> C absent.

  ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

  ""HARRY"" -> same, A at 2? No, H, A, R, R, Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.

  ""LORRY"" -> no A.

  ""WORRY"" -> no A.

  ""BURMA"" -> B, U, R, M, A -> R at 3, A at 5. This is a place name, but acceptable? The word is ""Burma"", which is an old name for Myanmar. But it's a valid word.

  ""DURRA"" -> D, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""CURIA"" -> C absent.

  ""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> R at 5? We need R at 3.

So ""BURMA"" seems acceptable: B, U, R, M, A -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A.

This has R at 3 and A at 5, and we are introducing B, U, M.

But note: we are not using A at position 2, so that's safe.

Similarly, ""MURAL"" from pattern 2 is also good.

Now, we have two candidates: ""MURAL"" (with A at 4) and ""BURMA"" (with A at 5).

We also have ""MORAY"" and ""MORAL"".

But ""MORAL"" is a very common word: M, O, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4.

We can choose ""MORAL"" because it uses common letters.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S. ""MORAL"" uses M, O, R, A, L -> all allowed.

So let's choose ""MORAL"".

Alternatively, we can choose ""MURAL"" to test U instead of O.

But O is more common than U, so ""MORAL"" might be better.

Another common word: ""ROYAL"" -> but R is at 1? We need R at 3. So not.

""RURAL"" -> R at 1 and 3? We have R at 1 and 3. But we know R is at position 3, so if we put R at 1, it might be marked as dash (if the word has only one R) or check (if it has two and at position 1). But we don't want to use R again at position 1 because we are not sure. Also, we are testing A at 5? ""RURAL"" has no A.

So not.

I think ""MORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3 (fixed), A at 4, L at 5.

We are testing:
  A at position 4: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (since we know A is in the word, just not at 2 or 3, so if not at 4, then it must be at 1 or 5? but we are not testing 1 or 5 in this guess).

Also, we are testing M, O, L.

So we will get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""MORAL"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any absent letters. We are not.

So:

<guess>moral</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, and S are absent. R is confirmed at position 3. A is present but not in position 2.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has R fixed at position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.
- Present letters: R (position 3) and A (position unknown, but not 2 or 3).

For the third guess, I need a word that:
- Has R at position 3.
- Includes A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, E, N, P, T, S).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""MURAL"" (A at position 4) and ""BURMA"" (A at position 5), but chose **""MORAL""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (required).
- It tests A at position 4 (a valid position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: M, O, and L.
- It avoids all absent letters and uses only valid positions for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test new letters efficiently.

<guess>moral</guess>",moral,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""parts""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (because we put it at position 2 in this guess and got '-')
  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 3 (since in ""parts"", R is the third letter)
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S
Present letters: R (at position 3), A (but not at position 3, and now also not at position 2)

We also know that the secret word has:
  Position 3: R (fixed)

And A is in the word but not at position 2 or 3.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S

We have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has R at position 3.
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 or 3.
  - Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also want to test new common letters. The remaining common letters might include: L, I, O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since not 2 or 3).

We also need to fill the other positions (1,2,4,5) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, P, T, S. So avoid: C, E, N, P, T, S.

We can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that A is already known to be in the word, so we must include it.

We have to form a 5-letter word with R at position 3 and A at either 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: A at position 1: 
  Pattern: A _ R _ _

Option 2: A at position 4:
  Pattern: _ _ R A _

Option 3: A at position 5:
  Pattern: _ _ R _ A

We also need to use new letters to get more information.

Let's try to find words that fit these patterns and use common unused letters.

For example, for pattern ""A _ R _ _"", we can try:
  A?R??: Words like ""ABRIM"", ""ABRID"", but we don't know if they are words. We need valid words.

Alternatively, let's think of common words:

- ""ALARM"": but L is allowed, and M is allowed. However, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, A is at position 1 and 4? But we are only required to have one A, but the word might have more. However, we are not sure. Also, we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""ALARM"" has A at 1 and 4, and R at 3. But we are testing A at 1 and 4? We know A is not at 3, but we don't know about 1 and 4. However, we are also introducing L and M.

But note: we have already used A and R, so we are only testing L and M? Actually, we are testing the positions of A and also the new letters.

But wait, in ""ALARM"", the A at position 1: if the secret word has A at position 1, we would get a check, but if not, we get a dash. Similarly for the A at position 4.

However, we are only required to have one A? The feedback from the first guess only said there is at least one A. It could have more.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A again? Actually, we can use it to test multiple positions. But we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid many letters.

But let's check the letters: ""ALARM"" uses A, L, A, R, M. The absent letters we have are C, N, E, P, T, S. So L and M are allowed.

But note: we are using A twice. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. If it doesn't, then one of the A's might be marked as absent? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then every occurrence that is in the word will be marked as either check or dash, and if there are duplicates, then the feedback might mark one as dash and the other as absent? Actually, no. The rules: for each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, it's check. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it's dash. If it's not in the word, it's x. But if the word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one will be marked as dash (if in the word but wrong position) and the other as x (if that position doesn't have A and there are no more A's). But we don't know the count.

So it might be risky to use two A's because we might get an x for one of them and then we don't know if it's because of the position or because there's only one A.

Therefore, to avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with only one A.

So let's look for words with one A, at position 1, 4, or 5, and R at position 3.

Patterns:

1. A _ R _ _ (with one A, so the other letters are not A)
2. _ _ R A _ (with one A)
3. _ _ R _ A (with one A)

Now, let's think of common words:

For pattern 1: A _ R _ _
  Examples: 
    ""ABRIM"" - not common
    ""ACRID"" - but C is absent
    ""ADRIB"" - not a word
    ""AERIE"" - E is absent
    ""AGREE"" - E is absent and two E's
    ""ALARM"" - has two A's, which we want to avoid for now.

How about ""ALERT""? But E and T are absent.

""ALIKE""? But I and K are allowed, but E is absent.

""ALIVE""? E absent.

""ALOUD"": A at 1, L at 2, O at 4, U at 5? But we need R at 3. So ""ALOUD"" doesn't have R.

We need R at 3.

""ALURM""? Not a word.

For pattern 2: _ _ R A _
  Examples:
    ""BORAX"" - B, O, R, A, X -> R at 3, A at 4. But we have to avoid X? We don't know if X is common, but it's allowed. Also, B and O are new.
    ""CRAWL"" - but C is absent.
    ""DRAWL"" - D, R, A, W, L -> R at 2? No, we need R at 3. In ""DRAWL"", R is at 2. We need R at 3.

We need the third letter to be R.

So pattern: first two letters, then R, then A, then one letter.

Examples: 
  ""BARMY""? B at 1, A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: in ""parts"", A was at 2 and we got dash, meaning A is not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2. But in this pattern, A is at 4, so that's okay. The word is: [letter1] [letter2] R A [letter5]

So letter2 can be anything except the absent letters and not A? Because we are not putting A at 2.

For example: 
  ""WORDY"" -> no A.
  ""FORAM"" -> F, O, R, A, M -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a valid word? I think ""foram"" is a biological term, but might not be common. 

  ""LORAL"" -> L, O, R, A, L -> but two L's? and A at 4. But is ""loral"" a word? It means relating to the lore (a part of a bird). Not very common.

  ""MORAY"" -> M, O, R, A, Y -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a type of eel. Valid.

  ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a common word.

But note: in ""MURAL"", we have A at 4. We are testing A at 4. Also, we are introducing M, U, L.

Similarly, ""MORAL"" -> M, O, R, A, L -> same as above but O instead of U.

But we don't know if O or U are in the word.

For pattern 3: _ _ R _ A
  Examples:
    ""BURKA"" -> B, U, R, K, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""FURCA"" -> not common.
    ""JIRGA"" -> J, I, R, G, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""VARIA"" -> V, A, R, I, A -> but two A's? and A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. Also, in ""VARIA"", the first letter is V, then A at 2 -> but we cannot put A at 2. So invalid.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z is not common.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but C is absent.

  ""DOBRA"" -> D, O, B, R, A -> R at 4? We need R at 3. In ""DOBRA"", R is at 4, not 3.

We need R at 3 and A at 5.

So: [letter1] [letter2] R [letter4] A

Examples:
  ""AORTA"" -> but A at 1 and 5? We have two A's. Also, we are putting A at 1? That's allowed, but we are also testing A at 5. But we have two A's.

  ""BARRA"" -> two A's? and R at 3? B, A, R, R, A -> but we have two R's? We know there is at least one R, but maybe two? We don't know.

  ""TERRA"" -> T is absent.

  ""VERRA"" -> not a word.

  ""HURRA"" -> H, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""PARRY"" -> P is absent.

  ""CARRY"" -> C absent.

  ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

  ""HARRY"" -> same, A at 2? No, H, A, R, R, Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.

  ""LORRY"" -> no A.

  ""WORRY"" -> no A.

  ""BURMA"" -> B, U, R, M, A -> R at 3, A at 5. This is a place name, but acceptable? The word is ""Burma"", which is an old name for Myanmar. But it's a valid word.

  ""DURRA"" -> D, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""CURIA"" -> C absent.

  ""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> R at 5? We need R at 3.

So ""BURMA"" seems acceptable: B, U, R, M, A -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A.

This has R at 3 and A at 5, and we are introducing B, U, M.

But note: we are not using A at position 2, so that's safe.

Similarly, ""MURAL"" from pattern 2 is also good.

Now, we have two candidates: ""MURAL"" (with A at 4) and ""BURMA"" (with A at 5).

We also have ""MORAY"" and ""MORAL"".

But ""MORAL"" is a very common word: M, O, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4.

We can choose ""MORAL"" because it uses common letters.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S. ""MORAL"" uses M, O, R, A, L -> all allowed.

So let's choose ""MORAL"".

Alternatively, we can choose ""MURAL"" to test U instead of O.

But O is more common than U, so ""MORAL"" might be better.

Another common word: ""ROYAL"" -> but R is at 1? We need R at 3. So not.

""RURAL"" -> R at 1 and 3? We have R at 1 and 3. But we know R is at position 3, so if we put R at 1, it might be marked as dash (if the word has only one R) or check (if it has two and at position 1). But we don't want to use R again at position 1 because we are not sure. Also, we are testing A at 5? ""RURAL"" has no A.

So not.

I think ""MORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3 (fixed), A at 4, L at 5.

We are testing:
  A at position 4: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (since we know A is in the word, just not at 2 or 3, so if not at 4, then it must be at 1 or 5? but we are not testing 1 or 5 in this guess).

Also, we are testing M, O, L.

So we will get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""MORAL"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any absent letters. We are not.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BORAX,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (from the first guess).

 Also, note that R and A must be placed in different positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We might want to try other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we can try to place R and A in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note that in the first guess, position 2 had R and it was wrong, so R can be in 1,3,4,5? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in that position, so it could be in any of the other four positions).

 Similarly, A can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Let's try to come up with a word that includes R and A, and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROAST"", but note that we have E and N are absent, and O and S are new. However, we have:
   R at position 1 (which is allowed, since previously it was at 2 and now we are trying 1) and 
   A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for the same letter in the same position would be the same. But we are allowed to reuse a letter in the same position? The rules don't forbid it, but it's not optimal. We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is not at position 3. So in our next guess, we should try A in a different position.

 However, let's check ""ROAST"":
   R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

 But we know A is not at position 3 (from the first guess), so we should avoid that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADAR"", but that has two A's and two R's? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid for now because we want to test more letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTY""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

 Let's check:
   A is at position 2 (which is allowed because previously it was at 3 and now we are trying 2) and 
   R is at position 3 (previously it was at 2, now at 3). 

 This seems okay. Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

 But note: we must avoid C, N, E, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we don't know. Since we are only required to have one R and one A (as per the first guess) but the word might have more? The feedback for the first guess only told us that there is at least one R and one A.

 But to keep it simple, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""STARK""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at 3.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But we know N is absent (from the first guess: N was at position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 again? That's not good.

 Let's try ""RATIO"":
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 1) and avoids position 3 for A (we are putting A at 2). Also, we are introducing T, I, O.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" uses R, A, T, I, O -> all allowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"", but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 How about ""RAILS""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (it's at 1) and A is not at 3 (it's at 2). Also, no forbidden letters.

 But note: we are using S and L, which are common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have the letter I? We don't know.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.

 This also avoids the bad positions: R was at 2 (now at 3) and A was at 3 (now at 2). 

 But note: we are introducing P, T, S.

 We have two good candidates: ""RATIO"" and ""PARTS"". 

 However, ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, and O) which might help. But we already know A is in the word, so we are testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common consonants. 

 Let me think of ""STAMP"", but then we have A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we cannot put A at 3. 

 How about ""SPARK""? 
   S at 1, P at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""CRASP""? But C is absent.

 Another idea: ""TAROT""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> but we have two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, A at 2 and R at 3: that's acceptable.

 But we are using T twice? And we don't know if T is in the word. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" but N is absent.

 After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: P, A, R, T, S.
   - It places A and R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong (A not at 3, R not at 2).
   - It introduces three new letters: P, T, S.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and A at position 2. We know from the first guess that R is in the word but not at position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. So positions 2 and 3 are open for swapping? Actually, we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. That is allowed because we haven't tried A at 2 or R at 3 before.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 3 or A at position 2. It only told us that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.

 So ""PARTS"" is a valid guess.

 Another candidate: ""RANTS"" but N is absent.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 This also works.

 But I think ""PARTS"" is better because it has S and T which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" is similar to ""PARTS"" but rearranged. 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know R is not at position 2 (from the first guess). So ""TRAPS"" would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Therefore, ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""PARTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I will go with ""PARTS"".

 But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word, but it's a common letter.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more vowels? We know A is in, but what about O, I, U? 

 However, we have already used A and R, and we are introducing three new consonants: P, T, S. That might be efficient.

 Another idea: ""ORBIT"" but we have O and B and I, and T. But we are missing A? We must include A and R because we know they are in the word. So we cannot skip A or R.

 Therefore, we must include both A and R in the guess.

 So ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""PARTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- A is present but not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C, N, E (confirmed absent).
3. Places R anywhere except position 2 and A anywhere except position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""RATIO"" and ""RAPID"", but settled on ""PARTS"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces three new common consonants: P, T, and S.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repositions the known letters effectively.

<guess>parts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""parts""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (because we put it at position 2 in this guess and got '-')
  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 3 (since in ""parts"", R is the third letter)
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S
Present letters: R (at position 3), A (but not at position 3, and now also not at position 2)

We also know that the secret word has:
  Position 3: R (fixed)

And A is in the word but not at position 2 or 3.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S

We have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has R at position 3.
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 or 3.
  - Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also want to test new common letters. The remaining common letters might include: L, I, O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since not 2 or 3).

We also need to fill the other positions (1,2,4,5) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, P, T, S. So avoid: C, E, N, P, T, S.

We can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that A is already known to be in the word, so we must include it.

We have to form a 5-letter word with R at position 3 and A at either 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: A at position 1: 
  Pattern: A _ R _ _

Option 2: A at position 4:
  Pattern: _ _ R A _

Option 3: A at position 5:
  Pattern: _ _ R _ A

We also need to use new letters to get more information.

Let's try to find words that fit these patterns and use common unused letters.

For example, for pattern ""A _ R _ _"", we can try:
  A?R??: Words like ""ABRIM"", ""ABRID"", but we don't know if they are words. We need valid words.

Alternatively, let's think of common words:

- ""ALARM"": but L is allowed, and M is allowed. However, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, A is at position 1 and 4? But we are only required to have one A, but the word might have more. However, we are not sure. Also, we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""ALARM"" has A at 1 and 4, and R at 3. But we are testing A at 1 and 4? We know A is not at 3, but we don't know about 1 and 4. However, we are also introducing L and M.

But note: we have already used A and R, so we are only testing L and M? Actually, we are testing the positions of A and also the new letters.

But wait, in ""ALARM"", the A at position 1: if the secret word has A at position 1, we would get a check, but if not, we get a dash. Similarly for the A at position 4.

However, we are only required to have one A? The feedback from the first guess only said there is at least one A. It could have more.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A again? Actually, we can use it to test multiple positions. But we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid many letters.

But let's check the letters: ""ALARM"" uses A, L, A, R, M. The absent letters we have are C, N, E, P, T, S. So L and M are allowed.

But note: we are using A twice. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. If it doesn't, then one of the A's might be marked as absent? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then every occurrence that is in the word will be marked as either check or dash, and if there are duplicates, then the feedback might mark one as dash and the other as absent? Actually, no. The rules: for each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, it's check. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it's dash. If it's not in the word, it's x. But if the word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one will be marked as dash (if in the word but wrong position) and the other as x (if that position doesn't have A and there are no more A's). But we don't know the count.

So it might be risky to use two A's because we might get an x for one of them and then we don't know if it's because of the position or because there's only one A.

Therefore, to avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with only one A.

So let's look for words with one A, at position 1, 4, or 5, and R at position 3.

Patterns:

1. A _ R _ _ (with one A, so the other letters are not A)
2. _ _ R A _ (with one A)
3. _ _ R _ A (with one A)

Now, let's think of common words:

For pattern 1: A _ R _ _
  Examples: 
    ""ABRIM"" - not common
    ""ACRID"" - but C is absent
    ""ADRIB"" - not a word
    ""AERIE"" - E is absent
    ""AGREE"" - E is absent and two E's
    ""ALARM"" - has two A's, which we want to avoid for now.

How about ""ALERT""? But E and T are absent.

""ALIKE""? But I and K are allowed, but E is absent.

""ALIVE""? E absent.

""ALOUD"": A at 1, L at 2, O at 4, U at 5? But we need R at 3. So ""ALOUD"" doesn't have R.

We need R at 3.

""ALURM""? Not a word.

For pattern 2: _ _ R A _
  Examples:
    ""BORAX"" - B, O, R, A, X -> R at 3, A at 4. But we have to avoid X? We don't know if X is common, but it's allowed. Also, B and O are new.
    ""CRAWL"" - but C is absent.
    ""DRAWL"" - D, R, A, W, L -> R at 2? No, we need R at 3. In ""DRAWL"", R is at 2. We need R at 3.

We need the third letter to be R.

So pattern: first two letters, then R, then A, then one letter.

Examples: 
  ""BARMY""? B at 1, A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: in ""parts"", A was at 2 and we got dash, meaning A is not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2. But in this pattern, A is at 4, so that's okay. The word is: [letter1] [letter2] R A [letter5]

So letter2 can be anything except the absent letters and not A? Because we are not putting A at 2.

For example: 
  ""WORDY"" -> no A.
  ""FORAM"" -> F, O, R, A, M -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a valid word? I think ""foram"" is a biological term, but might not be common. 

  ""LORAL"" -> L, O, R, A, L -> but two L's? and A at 4. But is ""loral"" a word? It means relating to the lore (a part of a bird). Not very common.

  ""MORAY"" -> M, O, R, A, Y -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a type of eel. Valid.

  ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a common word.

But note: in ""MURAL"", we have A at 4. We are testing A at 4. Also, we are introducing M, U, L.

Similarly, ""MORAL"" -> M, O, R, A, L -> same as above but O instead of U.

But we don't know if O or U are in the word.

For pattern 3: _ _ R _ A
  Examples:
    ""BURKA"" -> B, U, R, K, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""FURCA"" -> not common.
    ""JIRGA"" -> J, I, R, G, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""VARIA"" -> V, A, R, I, A -> but two A's? and A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. Also, in ""VARIA"", the first letter is V, then A at 2 -> but we cannot put A at 2. So invalid.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z is not common.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but C is absent.

  ""DOBRA"" -> D, O, B, R, A -> R at 4? We need R at 3. In ""DOBRA"", R is at 4, not 3.

We need R at 3 and A at 5.

So: [letter1] [letter2] R [letter4] A

Examples:
  ""AORTA"" -> but A at 1 and 5? We have two A's. Also, we are putting A at 1? That's allowed, but we are also testing A at 5. But we have two A's.

  ""BARRA"" -> two A's? and R at 3? B, A, R, R, A -> but we have two R's? We know there is at least one R, but maybe two? We don't know.

  ""TERRA"" -> T is absent.

  ""VERRA"" -> not a word.

  ""HURRA"" -> H, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""PARRY"" -> P is absent.

  ""CARRY"" -> C absent.

  ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

  ""HARRY"" -> same, A at 2? No, H, A, R, R, Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.

  ""LORRY"" -> no A.

  ""WORRY"" -> no A.

  ""BURMA"" -> B, U, R, M, A -> R at 3, A at 5. This is a place name, but acceptable? The word is ""Burma"", which is an old name for Myanmar. But it's a valid word.

  ""DURRA"" -> D, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""CURIA"" -> C absent.

  ""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> R at 5? We need R at 3.

So ""BURMA"" seems acceptable: B, U, R, M, A -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A.

This has R at 3 and A at 5, and we are introducing B, U, M.

But note: we are not using A at position 2, so that's safe.

Similarly, ""MURAL"" from pattern 2 is also good.

Now, we have two candidates: ""MURAL"" (with A at 4) and ""BURMA"" (with A at 5).

We also have ""MORAY"" and ""MORAL"".

But ""MORAL"" is a very common word: M, O, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4.

We can choose ""MORAL"" because it uses common letters.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S. ""MORAL"" uses M, O, R, A, L -> all allowed.

So let's choose ""MORAL"".

Alternatively, we can choose ""MURAL"" to test U instead of O.

But O is more common than U, so ""MORAL"" might be better.

Another common word: ""ROYAL"" -> but R is at 1? We need R at 3. So not.

""RURAL"" -> R at 1 and 3? We have R at 1 and 3. But we know R is at position 3, so if we put R at 1, it might be marked as dash (if the word has only one R) or check (if it has two and at position 1). But we don't want to use R again at position 1 because we are not sure. Also, we are testing A at 5? ""RURAL"" has no A.

So not.

I think ""MORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3 (fixed), A at 4, L at 5.

We are testing:
  A at position 4: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (since we know A is in the word, just not at 2 or 3, so if not at 4, then it must be at 1 or 5? but we are not testing 1 or 5 in this guess).

Also, we are testing M, O, L.

So we will get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""MORAL"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any absent letters. We are not.

So:

<guess>moral</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, and S are absent. R is confirmed at position 3. A is present but not in position 2.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has R fixed at position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.
- Present letters: R (position 3) and A (position unknown, but not 2 or 3).

For the third guess, I need a word that:
- Has R at position 3.
- Includes A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, E, N, P, T, S).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""MURAL"" (A at position 4) and ""BURMA"" (A at position 5), but chose **""MORAL""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (required).
- It tests A at position 4 (a valid position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: M, O, and L.
- It avoids all absent letters and uses only valid positions for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test new letters efficiently.

We don\'t know.\n\n Another candidate: ""PARTS""\n   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.\n\n This also avoids the bad positions: R was at 2 (now at 3) and A was at 3 (now at 2). \n\n But note: we are introducing P, T, S.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""RATIO"" and ""PARTS"". \n\n However, ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, and O) which might help. But we already know A is in the word, so we are testing I and O.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common consonants. \n\n Let me think of ""STAMP"", but then we have A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we cannot put A at 3. \n\n How about ""SPARK""? \n   S at 1, P at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""CRASP""? But C is absent.\n\n Another idea: ""TAROT""? \n   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> but we have two T\'s? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. Also, A at 2 and R at 3: that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we are using T twice? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. We are trying to test new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" but N is absent.\n\n After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It uses common letters: P, A, R, T, S.\n   - It places A and R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong (A not at 3, R not at 2).\n   - It introduces three new letters: P, T, S.\n\n But note: we are using R at position 3 and A at position 2. We know from the first guess that R is in the word but not at position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. So positions 2 and 3 are open for swapping? Actually, we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. That is allowed because we haven\'t tried A at 2 or R at 3 before.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess doesn\'t tell us that R cannot be at position 3 or A at position 2. It only told us that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.\n\n So ""PARTS"" is a valid guess.\n\n Another candidate: ""RANTS"" but N is absent.\n\n How about ""RAPID""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.\n\n This also works.\n\n But I think ""PARTS"" is better because it has S and T which are very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" is similar to ""PARTS"" but rearranged. \n   T at 1, R at 2 -> wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know R is not at position 2 (from the first guess). So ""TRAPS"" would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n Therefore, ""PARTS"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me check if ""PARTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\n So I will go with ""PARTS"".\n\n But note: we are using the letter S. We don\'t know if S is in the word, but it\'s a common letter.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more vowels? We know A is in, but what about O, I, U? \n\n However, we have already used A and R, and we are introducing three new consonants: P, T, S. That might be efficient.\n\n Another idea: ""ORBIT"" but we have O and B and I, and T. But we are missing A? We must include A and R because we know they are in the word. So we cannot skip A or R.\n\n Therefore, we must include both A and R in the guess.\n\n So ""PARTS"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""PARTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- R is present but not in position 2.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids C, N, E (confirmed absent).\n3. Places R anywhere except position 2 and A anywhere except position 3.\n4. Introduces new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI considered words like ""RATIO"" and ""RAPID"", but settled on ""PARTS"" because:\n- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n- It introduces three new common consonants: P, T, and S.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and repositions the known letters effectively.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""parts""\n  P: x (not in word)\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (because we put it at position 2 in this guess and got \'-\')\n  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 3 (since in ""parts"", R is the third letter)\n  T: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S\nPresent letters: R (at position 3), A (but not at position 3, and now also not at position 2)\n\nWe also know that the secret word has:\n  Position 3: R (fixed)\n\nAnd A is in the word but not at position 2 or 3.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n  - Has R at position 3.\n  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 or 3.\n  - Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, S.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters. The remaining common letters might include: L, I, O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since not 2 or 3).\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions (1,2,4,5) with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, P, T, S. So avoid: C, E, N, P, T, S.\n\nWe can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that A is already known to be in the word, so we must include it.\n\nWe have to form a 5-letter word with R at position 3 and A at either 1, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that fit:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1: \n  Pattern: A _ R _ _\n\nOption 2: A at position 4:\n  Pattern: _ _ R A _\n\nOption 3: A at position 5:\n  Pattern: _ _ R _ A\n\nWe also need to use new letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s try to find words that fit these patterns and use common unused letters.\n\nFor example, for pattern ""A _ R _ _"", we can try:\n  A?R??: Words like ""ABRIM"", ""ABRID"", but we don\'t know if they are words. We need valid words.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s think of common words:\n\n- ""ALARM"": but L is allowed, and M is allowed. However, we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, A is at position 1 and 4? But we are only required to have one A, but the word might have more. However, we are not sure. Also, we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""ALARM"" has A at 1 and 4, and R at 3. But we are testing A at 1 and 4? We know A is not at 3, but we don\'t know about 1 and 4. However, we are also introducing L and M.\n\nBut note: we have already used A and R, so we are only testing L and M? Actually, we are testing the positions of A and also the new letters.\n\nBut wait, in ""ALARM"", the A at position 1: if the secret word has A at position 1, we would get a check, but if not, we get a dash. Similarly for the A at position 4.\n\nHowever, we are only required to have one A? The feedback from the first guess only said there is at least one A. It could have more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid using A again? Actually, we can use it to test multiple positions. But we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid many letters.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: ""ALARM"" uses A, L, A, R, M. The absent letters we have are C, N, E, P, T, S. So L and M are allowed.\n\nBut note: we are using A twice. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. If it doesn\'t, then one of the A\'s might be marked as absent? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then every occurrence that is in the word will be marked as either check or dash, and if there are duplicates, then the feedback might mark one as dash and the other as absent? Actually, no. The rules: for each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, it\'s check. If it\'s in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s dash. If it\'s not in the word, it\'s x. But if the word has only one A and we have two A\'s in the guess, then one will be marked as dash (if in the word but wrong position) and the other as x (if that position doesn\'t have A and there are no more A\'s). But we don\'t know the count.\n\nSo it might be risky to use two A\'s because we might get an x for one of them and then we don\'t know if it\'s because of the position or because there\'s only one A.\n\nTherefore, to avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with only one A.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with one A, at position 1, 4, or 5, and R at position 3.\n\nPatterns:\n\n1. A _ R _ _ (with one A, so the other letters are not A)\n2. _ _ R A _ (with one A)\n3. _ _ R _ A (with one A)\n\nNow, let\'s think of common words:\n\nFor pattern 1: A _ R _ _\n  Examples: \n    ""ABRIM"" - not common\n    ""ACRID"" - but C is absent\n    ""ADRIB"" - not a word\n    ""AERIE"" - E is absent\n    ""AGREE"" - E is absent and two E\'s\n    ""ALARM"" - has two A\'s, which we want to avoid for now.\n\nHow about ""ALERT""? But E and T are absent.\n\n""ALIKE""? But I and K are allowed, but E is absent.\n\n""ALIVE""? E absent.\n\n""ALOUD"": A at 1, L at 2, O at 4, U at 5? But we need R at 3. So ""ALOUD"" doesn\'t have R.\n\nWe need R at 3.\n\n""ALURM""? Not a word.\n\nFor pattern 2: _ _ R A _\n  Examples:\n    ""BORAX"" - B, O, R, A, X -> R at 3, A at 4. But we have to avoid X? We don\'t know if X is common, but it\'s allowed. Also, B and O are new.\n    ""CRAWL"" - but C is absent.\n    ""DRAWL"" - D, R, A, W, L -> R at 2? No, we need R at 3. In ""DRAWL"", R is at 2. We need R at 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be R.\n\nSo pattern: first two letters, then R, then A, then one letter.\n\nExamples: \n  ""BARMY""? B at 1, A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: in ""parts"", A was at 2 and we got dash, meaning A is not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2. But in this pattern, A is at 4, so that\'s okay. The word is: [letter1] [letter2] R A [letter5]\n\nSo letter2 can be anything except the absent letters and not A? Because we are not putting A at 2.\n\nFor example: \n  ""WORDY"" -> no A.\n  ""FORAM"" -> F, O, R, A, M -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a valid word? I think ""foram"" is a biological term, but might not be common. \n\n  ""LORAL"" -> L, O, R, A, L -> but two L\'s? and A at 4. But is ""loral"" a word? It means relating to the lore (a part of a bird). Not very common.\n\n  ""MORAY"" -> M, O, R, A, Y -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a type of eel. Valid.\n\n  ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a common word.\n\nBut note: in ""MURAL"", we have A at 4. We are testing A at 4. Also, we are introducing M, U, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""MORAL"" -> M, O, R, A, L -> same as above but O instead of U.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O or U are in the word.\n\nFor pattern 3: _ _ R _ A\n  Examples:\n    ""BURKA"" -> B, U, R, K, A -> R at 3, A at 5.\n    ""FURCA"" -> not common.\n    ""JIRGA"" -> J, I, R, G, A -> R at 3, A at 5.\n    ""VARIA"" -> V, A, R, I, A -> but two A\'s? and A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. Also, in ""VARIA"", the first letter is V, then A at 2 -> but we cannot put A at 2. So invalid.\n\n  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z is not common.\n\n  ""LYCRA"" -> but C is absent.\n\n  ""DOBRA"" -> D, O, B, R, A -> R at 4? We need R at 3. In ""DOBRA"", R is at 4, not 3.\n\nWe need R at 3 and A at 5.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] R [letter4] A\n\nExamples:\n  ""AORTA"" -> but A at 1 and 5? We have two A\'s. Also, we are putting A at 1? That\'s allowed, but we are also testing A at 5. But we have two A\'s.\n\n  ""BARRA"" -> two A\'s? and R at 3? B, A, R, R, A -> but we have two R\'s? We know there is at least one R, but maybe two? We don\'t know.\n\n  ""TERRA"" -> T is absent.\n\n  ""VERRA"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""HURRA"" -> H, U, R, R, A -> two R\'s and two A\'s? Not ideal.\n\n  ""PARRY"" -> P is absent.\n\n  ""CARRY"" -> C absent.\n\n  ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. So invalid.\n\n  ""HARRY"" -> same, A at 2? No, H, A, R, R, Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n  ""LORRY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""WORRY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""BURMA"" -> B, U, R, M, A -> R at 3, A at 5. This is a place name, but acceptable? The word is ""Burma"", which is an old name for Myanmar. But it\'s a valid word.\n\n  ""DURRA"" -> D, U, R, R, A -> two R\'s and two A\'s? Not ideal.\n\n  ""CURIA"" -> C absent.\n\n  ""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> R at 5? We need R at 3.\n\nSo ""BURMA"" seems acceptable: B, U, R, M, A -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A.\n\nThis has R at 3 and A at 5, and we are introducing B, U, M.\n\nBut note: we are not using A at position 2, so that\'s safe.\n\nSimilarly, ""MURAL"" from pattern 2 is also good.\n\nNow, we have two candidates: ""MURAL"" (with A at 4) and ""BURMA"" (with A at 5).\n\nWe also have ""MORAY"" and ""MORAL"".\n\nBut ""MORAL"" is a very common word: M, O, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4.\n\nWe can choose ""MORAL"" because it uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S. ""MORAL"" uses M, O, R, A, L -> all allowed.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""MORAL"".\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""MURAL"" to test U instead of O.\n\nBut O is more common than U, so ""MORAL"" might be better.\n\nAnother common word: ""ROYAL"" -> but R is at 1? We need R at 3. So not.\n\n""RURAL"" -> R at 1 and 3? We have R at 1 and 3. But we know R is at position 3, so if we put R at 1, it might be marked as dash (if the word has only one R) or check (if it has two and at position 1). But we don\'t want to use R again at position 1 because we are not sure. Also, we are testing A at 5? ""RURAL"" has no A.\n\nSo not.\n\nI think ""MORAL"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3 (fixed), A at 4, L at 5.\n\nWe are testing:\n  A at position 4: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (since we know A is in the word, just not at 2 or 3, so if not at 4, then it must be at 1 or 5? but we are not testing 1 or 5 in this guess).\n\nAlso, we are testing M, O, L.\n\nSo we will get information about these.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""MORAL"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not using any absent letters. We are not.\n\nSo:\n\n<guess>moral</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, and E are absent.

We are given feedback for the third guess ""moral"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 O: ✓ (correct position, so O is at position 2)
 R: ✓ (correct position, so R is at position 3, which we already knew)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 4)
 L: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and R at position 3 and A at position 4.
- The letters M and L are absent (so not in the word).
- We also have previous absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ O R A _

We need to fill the first and last positions.

We know the word has the form: ? O R A ?

And we know the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.

We must avoid these letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S, M, O, L.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that fits: [letter1] O R A [letter5]

With letter1 and letter5 not in the absent list.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- BORAX: B at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, X at 5. But X is not very common, and we haven't tested it. Also, B is available.

- FORAY: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5. This is a common word.

- CORAL: but C is absent.

- MORAL: we already tried, and M is absent.

- DORAD: D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, D at 5. But D is at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""dorad"" is a type of fish, but not very common.

- HORAS: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. But S is absent.

- KORAS: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. S absent.

- NORIA: N is absent.

- TORAH: T is absent.

- VOTARY: V, O, T, A, R, Y -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""votary"" is 6 letters. We need 5.

- WORRY: W at 1, O at 2, R at 3, R at 4? But we have A at 4? No, the pattern is ? O R A ? so position 4 is A. So ""WORRY"" has R at 4, not A.

- WORDY: no A.

- FORTY: T is absent.

- FORUM: M is absent and U at 5? But pattern requires A at 4, so not.

- FORAM: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, M at 5. But M is absent.

- HORAL: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. But L is absent.

- GORAL: G at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. L absent.

- FORDS: no A.

So the best candidate I see is ""FORAY"": F, O, R, A, Y.

This uses F and Y, which are new and not absent.

Another candidate: ""BORAX"" with B and X.

But ""FORAY"" is more common.

We also have ""DORBA""? Not a word.

""GORED"" has no A.

""YORBA""? Not common.

""JORAM""? J, O, R, A, M -> M absent.

""VOTAR""? Not a word.

""FORAY"" seems good.

Another one: ""FORMA"" but M absent.

""FORZA"" -> Z is not common, and it's Italian.

So I think ""FORAY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the last letter is not one of the absent ones. Y is not absent.

Also, F is not absent.

Therefore, we guess ""FORAY"".

But let's see if there are other options.

""BORAS"": but S is absent.

""KORAT"": K, O, R, A, T -> T is absent.

""FURAL"": L absent.

""FURAN"": N absent.

""FURAZ"": not a word.

""FORAY"" is the best.

We can also consider ""DORAB"" (a fish) but not common.

Or ""HORAH"" (a dance) but H at 1 and H at 5? And we haven't tested H.

But ""FORAY"" is more standard.

So I'll go with ""FORAY"".

But note: we are on the fourth guess, and we have two positions to determine: first and last. We are testing F and Y.

If we get feedback, we can then deduce the word.

So:

<guess>foray</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, S are absent. R is confirmed at position 3. A is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 3 (""moral"")**: M and L are absent. O is confirmed at position 2. R is confirmed at position 3. A is confirmed at position 4.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ O R A _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as O, R, A).
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.
- Present letters: O (position 2), R (position 3), A (position 4).

For the fourth guess, I need a word that fits the pattern `_ O R A _` and uses only letters not ruled out. I chose **""FORAY""** because:
- It fits the pattern: F at position 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5.
- It tests new common letters (F and Y) to gather information about positions 1 and 5.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and confirm the word if F and Y are correct.

<guess>foray</guess>",foray,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""moral"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 O: ✓ (correct position, so O is at position 2)
 R: ✓ (correct position, so R is at position 3, which we already knew)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 4)
 L: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and R at position 3 and A at position 4.
- The letters M and L are absent (so not in the word).
- We also have previous absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ O R A _

We need to fill the first and last positions.

We know the word has the form: ? O R A ?

And we know the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.

We must avoid these letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S, M, O, L.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that fits: [letter1] O R A [letter5]

With letter1 and letter5 not in the absent list.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- BORAX: B at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, X at 5. But X is not very common, and we haven't tested it. Also, B is available.

- FORAY: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5. This is a common word.

- CORAL: but C is absent.

- MORAL: we already tried, and M is absent.

- DORAD: D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, D at 5. But D is at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""dorad"" is a type of fish, but not very common.

- HORAS: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. But S is absent.

- KORAS: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. S absent.

- NORIA: N is absent.

- TORAH: T is absent.

- VOTARY: V, O, T, A, R, Y -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""votary"" is 6 letters. We need 5.

- WORRY: W at 1, O at 2, R at 3, R at 4? But we have A at 4? No, the pattern is ? O R A ? so position 4 is A. So ""WORRY"" has R at 4, not A.

- WORDY: no A.

- FORTY: T is absent.

- FORUM: M is absent and U at 5? But pattern requires A at 4, so not.

- FORAM: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, M at 5. But M is absent.

- HORAL: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. But L is absent.

- GORAL: G at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. L absent.

- FORDS: no A.

So the best candidate I see is ""FORAY"": F, O, R, A, Y.

This uses F and Y, which are new and not absent.

Another candidate: ""BORAX"" with B and X.

But ""FORAY"" is more common.

We also have ""DORBA""? Not a word.

""GORED"" has no A.

""YORBA""? Not common.

""JORAM""? J, O, R, A, M -> M absent.

""VOTAR""? Not a word.

""FORAY"" seems good.

Another one: ""FORMA"" but M absent.

""FORZA"" -> Z is not common, and it's Italian.

So I think ""FORAY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the last letter is not one of the absent ones. Y is not absent.

Also, F is not absent.

Therefore, we guess ""FORAY"".

But let's see if there are other options.

""BORAS"": but S is absent.

""KORAT"": K, O, R, A, T -> T is absent.

""FURAL"": L absent.

""FURAN"": N absent.

""FURAZ"": not a word.

""FORAY"" is the best.

We can also consider ""DORAB"" (a fish) but not common.

Or ""HORAH"" (a dance) but H at 1 and H at 5? And we haven't tested H.

But ""FORAY"" is more standard.

So I'll go with ""FORAY"".

But note: we are on the fourth guess, and we have two positions to determine: first and last. We are testing F and Y.

If we get feedback, we can then deduce the word.

So:

<guess>foray</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, S are absent. R is confirmed at position 3. A is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 3 (""moral"")**: M and L are absent. O is confirmed at position 2. R is confirmed at position 3. A is confirmed at position 4.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ O R A _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as O, R, A).
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.
- Present letters: O (position 2), R (position 3), A (position 4).

For the fourth guess, I need a word that fits the pattern `_ O R A _` and uses only letters not ruled out. I chose **""FORAY""** because:
- It fits the pattern: F at position 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5.
- It tests new common letters (F and Y) to gather information about positions 1 and 5.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and confirm the word if F and Y are correct.",Guess 4: foray -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) Y(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (from the first guess).

 Also, note that R and A must be placed in different positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We might want to try other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we can try to place R and A in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note that in the first guess, position 2 had R and it was wrong, so R can be in 1,3,4,5? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in that position, so it could be in any of the other four positions).

 Similarly, A can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Let's try to come up with a word that includes R and A, and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROAST"", but note that we have E and N are absent, and O and S are new. However, we have:
   R at position 1 (which is allowed, since previously it was at 2 and now we are trying 1) and 
   A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for the same letter in the same position would be the same. But we are allowed to reuse a letter in the same position? The rules don't forbid it, but it's not optimal. We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is not at position 3. So in our next guess, we should try A in a different position.

 However, let's check ""ROAST"":
   R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

 But we know A is not at position 3 (from the first guess), so we should avoid that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADAR"", but that has two A's and two R's? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid for now because we want to test more letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTY""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

 Let's check:
   A is at position 2 (which is allowed because previously it was at 3 and now we are trying 2) and 
   R is at position 3 (previously it was at 2, now at 3). 

 This seems okay. Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

 But note: we must avoid C, N, E, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we don't know. Since we are only required to have one R and one A (as per the first guess) but the word might have more? The feedback for the first guess only told us that there is at least one R and one A.

 But to keep it simple, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""STARK""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at 3.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But we know N is absent (from the first guess: N was at position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 again? That's not good.

 Let's try ""RATIO"":
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 1) and avoids position 3 for A (we are putting A at 2). Also, we are introducing T, I, O.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" uses R, A, T, I, O -> all allowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"", but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 How about ""RAILS""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (it's at 1) and A is not at 3 (it's at 2). Also, no forbidden letters.

 But note: we are using S and L, which are common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have the letter I? We don't know.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.

 This also avoids the bad positions: R was at 2 (now at 3) and A was at 3 (now at 2). 

 But note: we are introducing P, T, S.

 We have two good candidates: ""RATIO"" and ""PARTS"". 

 However, ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, and O) which might help. But we already know A is in the word, so we are testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common consonants. 

 Let me think of ""STAMP"", but then we have A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we cannot put A at 3. 

 How about ""SPARK""? 
   S at 1, P at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""CRASP""? But C is absent.

 Another idea: ""TAROT""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> but we have two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, A at 2 and R at 3: that's acceptable.

 But we are using T twice? And we don't know if T is in the word. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" but N is absent.

 After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: P, A, R, T, S.
   - It places A and R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong (A not at 3, R not at 2).
   - It introduces three new letters: P, T, S.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and A at position 2. We know from the first guess that R is in the word but not at position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. So positions 2 and 3 are open for swapping? Actually, we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. That is allowed because we haven't tried A at 2 or R at 3 before.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 3 or A at position 2. It only told us that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.

 So ""PARTS"" is a valid guess.

 Another candidate: ""RANTS"" but N is absent.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 This also works.

 But I think ""PARTS"" is better because it has S and T which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" is similar to ""PARTS"" but rearranged. 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know R is not at position 2 (from the first guess). So ""TRAPS"" would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Therefore, ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""PARTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I will go with ""PARTS"".

 But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word, but it's a common letter.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more vowels? We know A is in, but what about O, I, U? 

 However, we have already used A and R, and we are introducing three new consonants: P, T, S. That might be efficient.

 Another idea: ""ORBIT"" but we have O and B and I, and T. But we are missing A? We must include A and R because we know they are in the word. So we cannot skip A or R.

 Therefore, we must include both A and R in the guess.

 So ""PARTS"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""PARTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- A is present but not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C, N, E (confirmed absent).
3. Places R anywhere except position 2 and A anywhere except position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""RATIO"" and ""RAPID"", but settled on ""PARTS"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces three new common consonants: P, T, and S.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repositions the known letters effectively.

<guess>parts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""parts""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (because we put it at position 2 in this guess and got '-')
  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 3 (since in ""parts"", R is the third letter)
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S
Present letters: R (at position 3), A (but not at position 3, and now also not at position 2)

We also know that the secret word has:
  Position 3: R (fixed)

And A is in the word but not at position 2 or 3.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S

We have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has R at position 3.
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 or 3.
  - Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also want to test new common letters. The remaining common letters might include: L, I, O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since not 2 or 3).

We also need to fill the other positions (1,2,4,5) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, P, T, S. So avoid: C, E, N, P, T, S.

We can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that A is already known to be in the word, so we must include it.

We have to form a 5-letter word with R at position 3 and A at either 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: A at position 1: 
  Pattern: A _ R _ _

Option 2: A at position 4:
  Pattern: _ _ R A _

Option 3: A at position 5:
  Pattern: _ _ R _ A

We also need to use new letters to get more information.

Let's try to find words that fit these patterns and use common unused letters.

For example, for pattern ""A _ R _ _"", we can try:
  A?R??: Words like ""ABRIM"", ""ABRID"", but we don't know if they are words. We need valid words.

Alternatively, let's think of common words:

- ""ALARM"": but L is allowed, and M is allowed. However, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, A is at position 1 and 4? But we are only required to have one A, but the word might have more. However, we are not sure. Also, we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""ALARM"" has A at 1 and 4, and R at 3. But we are testing A at 1 and 4? We know A is not at 3, but we don't know about 1 and 4. However, we are also introducing L and M.

But note: we have already used A and R, so we are only testing L and M? Actually, we are testing the positions of A and also the new letters.

But wait, in ""ALARM"", the A at position 1: if the secret word has A at position 1, we would get a check, but if not, we get a dash. Similarly for the A at position 4.

However, we are only required to have one A? The feedback from the first guess only said there is at least one A. It could have more.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A again? Actually, we can use it to test multiple positions. But we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid many letters.

But let's check the letters: ""ALARM"" uses A, L, A, R, M. The absent letters we have are C, N, E, P, T, S. So L and M are allowed.

But note: we are using A twice. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. If it doesn't, then one of the A's might be marked as absent? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then every occurrence that is in the word will be marked as either check or dash, and if there are duplicates, then the feedback might mark one as dash and the other as absent? Actually, no. The rules: for each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, it's check. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it's dash. If it's not in the word, it's x. But if the word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one will be marked as dash (if in the word but wrong position) and the other as x (if that position doesn't have A and there are no more A's). But we don't know the count.

So it might be risky to use two A's because we might get an x for one of them and then we don't know if it's because of the position or because there's only one A.

Therefore, to avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with only one A.

So let's look for words with one A, at position 1, 4, or 5, and R at position 3.

Patterns:

1. A _ R _ _ (with one A, so the other letters are not A)
2. _ _ R A _ (with one A)
3. _ _ R _ A (with one A)

Now, let's think of common words:

For pattern 1: A _ R _ _
  Examples: 
    ""ABRIM"" - not common
    ""ACRID"" - but C is absent
    ""ADRIB"" - not a word
    ""AERIE"" - E is absent
    ""AGREE"" - E is absent and two E's
    ""ALARM"" - has two A's, which we want to avoid for now.

How about ""ALERT""? But E and T are absent.

""ALIKE""? But I and K are allowed, but E is absent.

""ALIVE""? E absent.

""ALOUD"": A at 1, L at 2, O at 4, U at 5? But we need R at 3. So ""ALOUD"" doesn't have R.

We need R at 3.

""ALURM""? Not a word.

For pattern 2: _ _ R A _
  Examples:
    ""BORAX"" - B, O, R, A, X -> R at 3, A at 4. But we have to avoid X? We don't know if X is common, but it's allowed. Also, B and O are new.
    ""CRAWL"" - but C is absent.
    ""DRAWL"" - D, R, A, W, L -> R at 2? No, we need R at 3. In ""DRAWL"", R is at 2. We need R at 3.

We need the third letter to be R.

So pattern: first two letters, then R, then A, then one letter.

Examples: 
  ""BARMY""? B at 1, A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: in ""parts"", A was at 2 and we got dash, meaning A is not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2. But in this pattern, A is at 4, so that's okay. The word is: [letter1] [letter2] R A [letter5]

So letter2 can be anything except the absent letters and not A? Because we are not putting A at 2.

For example: 
  ""WORDY"" -> no A.
  ""FORAM"" -> F, O, R, A, M -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a valid word? I think ""foram"" is a biological term, but might not be common. 

  ""LORAL"" -> L, O, R, A, L -> but two L's? and A at 4. But is ""loral"" a word? It means relating to the lore (a part of a bird). Not very common.

  ""MORAY"" -> M, O, R, A, Y -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a type of eel. Valid.

  ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a common word.

But note: in ""MURAL"", we have A at 4. We are testing A at 4. Also, we are introducing M, U, L.

Similarly, ""MORAL"" -> M, O, R, A, L -> same as above but O instead of U.

But we don't know if O or U are in the word.

For pattern 3: _ _ R _ A
  Examples:
    ""BURKA"" -> B, U, R, K, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""FURCA"" -> not common.
    ""JIRGA"" -> J, I, R, G, A -> R at 3, A at 5.
    ""VARIA"" -> V, A, R, I, A -> but two A's? and A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. Also, in ""VARIA"", the first letter is V, then A at 2 -> but we cannot put A at 2. So invalid.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z is not common.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but C is absent.

  ""DOBRA"" -> D, O, B, R, A -> R at 4? We need R at 3. In ""DOBRA"", R is at 4, not 3.

We need R at 3 and A at 5.

So: [letter1] [letter2] R [letter4] A

Examples:
  ""AORTA"" -> but A at 1 and 5? We have two A's. Also, we are putting A at 1? That's allowed, but we are also testing A at 5. But we have two A's.

  ""BARRA"" -> two A's? and R at 3? B, A, R, R, A -> but we have two R's? We know there is at least one R, but maybe two? We don't know.

  ""TERRA"" -> T is absent.

  ""VERRA"" -> not a word.

  ""HURRA"" -> H, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""PARRY"" -> P is absent.

  ""CARRY"" -> C absent.

  ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

  ""HARRY"" -> same, A at 2? No, H, A, R, R, Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.

  ""LORRY"" -> no A.

  ""WORRY"" -> no A.

  ""BURMA"" -> B, U, R, M, A -> R at 3, A at 5. This is a place name, but acceptable? The word is ""Burma"", which is an old name for Myanmar. But it's a valid word.

  ""DURRA"" -> D, U, R, R, A -> two R's and two A's? Not ideal.

  ""CURIA"" -> C absent.

  ""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> R at 5? We need R at 3.

So ""BURMA"" seems acceptable: B, U, R, M, A -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A.

This has R at 3 and A at 5, and we are introducing B, U, M.

But note: we are not using A at position 2, so that's safe.

Similarly, ""MURAL"" from pattern 2 is also good.

Now, we have two candidates: ""MURAL"" (with A at 4) and ""BURMA"" (with A at 5).

We also have ""MORAY"" and ""MORAL"".

But ""MORAL"" is a very common word: M, O, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4.

We can choose ""MORAL"" because it uses common letters.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S. ""MORAL"" uses M, O, R, A, L -> all allowed.

So let's choose ""MORAL"".

Alternatively, we can choose ""MURAL"" to test U instead of O.

But O is more common than U, so ""MORAL"" might be better.

Another common word: ""ROYAL"" -> but R is at 1? We need R at 3. So not.

""RURAL"" -> R at 1 and 3? We have R at 1 and 3. But we know R is at position 3, so if we put R at 1, it might be marked as dash (if the word has only one R) or check (if it has two and at position 1). But we don't want to use R again at position 1 because we are not sure. Also, we are testing A at 5? ""RURAL"" has no A.

So not.

I think ""MORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3 (fixed), A at 4, L at 5.

We are testing:
  A at position 4: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (since we know A is in the word, just not at 2 or 3, so if not at 4, then it must be at 1 or 5? but we are not testing 1 or 5 in this guess).

Also, we are testing M, O, L.

So we will get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""MORAL"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any absent letters. We are not.

So:

<guess>moral</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, and S are absent. R is confirmed at position 3. A is present but not in position 2.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has R fixed at position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.
- Present letters: R (position 3) and A (position unknown, but not 2 or 3).

For the third guess, I need a word that:
- Has R at position 3.
- Includes A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, E, N, P, T, S).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I considered words like ""MURAL"" (A at position 4) and ""BURMA"" (A at position 5), but chose **""MORAL""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (required).
- It tests A at position 4 (a valid position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: M, O, and L.
- It avoids all absent letters and uses only valid positions for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test new letters efficiently.

<guess>moral</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
Guess 3: moral -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""moral"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 O: ✓ (correct position, so O is at position 2)
 R: ✓ (correct position, so R is at position 3, which we already knew)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 4)
 L: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and R at position 3 and A at position 4.
- The letters M and L are absent (so not in the word).
- We also have previous absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ O R A _

We need to fill the first and last positions.

We know the word has the form: ? O R A ?

And we know the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.

We must avoid these letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S, M, O, L.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that fits: [letter1] O R A [letter5]

With letter1 and letter5 not in the absent list.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- BORAX: B at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, X at 5. But X is not very common, and we haven't tested it. Also, B is available.

- FORAY: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5. This is a common word.

- CORAL: but C is absent.

- MORAL: we already tried, and M is absent.

- DORAD: D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, D at 5. But D is at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""dorad"" is a type of fish, but not very common.

- HORAS: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. But S is absent.

- KORAS: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. S absent.

- NORIA: N is absent.

- TORAH: T is absent.

- VOTARY: V, O, T, A, R, Y -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""votary"" is 6 letters. We need 5.

- WORRY: W at 1, O at 2, R at 3, R at 4? But we have A at 4? No, the pattern is ? O R A ? so position 4 is A. So ""WORRY"" has R at 4, not A.

- WORDY: no A.

- FORTY: T is absent.

- FORUM: M is absent and U at 5? But pattern requires A at 4, so not.

- FORAM: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, M at 5. But M is absent.

- HORAL: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. But L is absent.

- GORAL: G at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. L absent.

- FORDS: no A.

So the best candidate I see is ""FORAY"": F, O, R, A, Y.

This uses F and Y, which are new and not absent.

Another candidate: ""BORAX"" with B and X.

But ""FORAY"" is more common.

We also have ""DORBA""? Not a word.

""GORED"" has no A.

""YORBA""? Not common.

""JORAM""? J, O, R, A, M -> M absent.

""VOTAR""? Not a word.

""FORAY"" seems good.

Another one: ""FORMA"" but M absent.

""FORZA"" -> Z is not common, and it's Italian.

So I think ""FORAY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the last letter is not one of the absent ones. Y is not absent.

Also, F is not absent.

Therefore, we guess ""FORAY"".

But let's see if there are other options.

""BORAS"": but S is absent.

""KORAT"": K, O, R, A, T -> T is absent.

""FURAL"": L absent.

""FURAN"": N absent.

""FURAZ"": not a word.

""FORAY"" is the best.

We can also consider ""DORAB"" (a fish) but not common.

Or ""HORAH"" (a dance) but H at 1 and H at 5? And we haven't tested H.

But ""FORAY"" is more standard.

So I'll go with ""FORAY"".

But note: we are on the fourth guess, and we have two positions to determine: first and last. We are testing F and Y.

If we get feedback, we can then deduce the word.

So:

<guess>foray</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, S are absent. R is confirmed at position 3. A is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 3 (""moral"")**: M and L are absent. O is confirmed at position 2. R is confirmed at position 3. A is confirmed at position 4.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ O R A _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as O, R, A).
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L.
- Present letters: O (position 2), R (position 3), A (position 4).

For the fourth guess, I need a word that fits the pattern `_ O R A _` and uses only letters not ruled out. I chose **""FORAY""** because:
- It fits the pattern: F at position 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5.
- It tests new common letters (F and Y) to gather information about positions 1 and 5.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and confirm the word if F and Y are correct.

Actually, the feedback says it\'s in the word but not in that position, so it could be in any of the other four positions).\n\n Similarly, A can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).\n\n However, we must also avoid the letters C, N, E.\n\n Let\'s try to come up with a word that includes R and A, and also introduces new common letters.\n\n Example: We could try ""ROAST"", but note that we have E and N are absent, and O and S are new.

But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at position 3. However, the feedback for the same letter in the same position would be the same. But we are allowed to reuse a letter in the same position? The rules don\'t forbid it, but it\'s not optimal. We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is not at position 3. So in our next guess, we should try A in a different position.\n\n However, let\'s check ""ROAST"":\n   R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.\n\n But we know A is not at position 3 (from the first guess), so we should avoid that.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RADAR"", but that has two A\'s and two R\'s?

Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.\n\n But note: we must avoid C, N, E, which we are.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn\'t indicate that, but we don\'t know. Since we are only required to have one R and one A (as per the first guess) but the word might have more? The feedback for the first guess only told us that there is at least one R and one A.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Another candidate: ""STARK""\n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at 3.\n\n How about ""TRAIN""? But we know N is absent (from the first guess: N was at position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""TRAIL""? \n   T at 1, R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 again? That\'s not good.\n\n Let\'s try ""RATIO"":\n   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n\n This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 1) and avoids position 3 for A (we are putting A at 2). Also, we are introducing T, I, O.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" uses R, A, T, I, O -> all allowed.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"", but E is absent? So we cannot use E.\n\n How about ""RAILS""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n\n This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (it\'s at 1) and A is not at 3 (it\'s at 2). Also, no forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are using S and L, which are common.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have the letter I? We don\'t know.\n\n Another candidate: ""PARTS""\n   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.\n\n This also avoids the bad positions: R was at 2 (now at 3) and A was at 3 (now at 2). \n\n But note: we are introducing P, T, S.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""RATIO"" and ""PARTS"". \n\n However, ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, and O) which might help. But we already know A is in the word, so we are testing I and O.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common consonants. \n\n Let me think of ""STAMP"", but then we have A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we cannot put A at 3. \n\n How about ""SPARK""? \n   S at 1, P at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""CRASP""? But C is absent.\n\n Another idea: ""TAROT""? \n   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> but we have two T\'s? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. Also, A at 2 and R at 3: that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we are using T twice? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. We are trying to test new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" but N is absent.\n\n After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It uses common letters: P, A, R, T, S.\n   - It places A and R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong (A not at 3, R not at 2).\n   - It introduces three new letters: P, T, S.\n\n But note: we are using R at position 3 and A at position 2. We know from the first guess that R is in the word but not at position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. So positions 2 and 3 are open for swapping? Actually, we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. That is allowed because we haven\'t tried A at 2 or R at 3 before.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess doesn\'t tell us that R cannot be at position 3 or A at position 2. It only told us that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.\n\n So ""PARTS"" is a valid guess.\n\n Another candidate: ""RANTS"" but N is absent.\n\n How about ""RAPID""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.\n\n This also works.\n\n But I think ""PARTS"" is better because it has S and T which are very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" is similar to ""PARTS"" but rearranged. \n   T at 1, R at 2 -> wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know R is not at position 2 (from the first guess). So ""TRAPS"" would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n Therefore, ""PARTS"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me check if ""PARTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\n So I will go with ""PARTS"".\n\n But note: we are using the letter S. We don\'t know if S is in the word, but it\'s a common letter.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more vowels? We know A is in, but what about O, I, U? \n\n However, we have already used A and R, and we are introducing three new consonants: P, T, S. That might be efficient.\n\n Another idea: ""ORBIT"" but we have O and B and I, and T. But we are missing A? We must include A and R because we know they are in the word. So we cannot skip A or R.\n\n Therefore, we must include both A and R in the guess.\n\n So ""PARTS"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""PARTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- R is present but not in position 2.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids C, N, E (confirmed absent).\n3. Places R anywhere except position 2 and A anywhere except position 3.\n4. Introduces new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI considered words like ""RATIO"" and ""RAPID"", but settled on ""PARTS"" because:\n- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n- It introduces three new common consonants: P, T, and S.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and repositions the known letters effectively.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""parts""\n  P: x (not in word)\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (because we put it at position 2 in this guess and got \'-\')\n  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 3 (since in ""parts"", R is the third letter)\n  T: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S\nPresent letters: R (at position 3), A (but not at position 3, and now also not at position 2)\n\nWe also know that the secret word has:\n  Position 3: R (fixed)\n\nAnd A is in the word but not at position 2 or 3.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n  - Has R at position 3.\n  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 or 3.\n  - Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, S.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters.

We need valid words.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s think of common words:\n\n- ""ALARM"": but L is allowed, and M is allowed. However, we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, A is at position 1 and 4? But we are only required to have one A, but the word might have more. However, we are not sure. Also, we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""ALARM"" has A at 1 and 4, and R at 3. But we are testing A at 1 and 4? We know A is not at 3, but we don\'t know about 1 and 4. However, we are also introducing L and M.\n\nBut note: we have already used A and R, so we are only testing L and M? Actually, we are testing the positions of A and also the new letters.\n\nBut wait, in ""ALARM"", the A at position 1: if the secret word has A at position 1, we would get a check, but if not, we get a dash. Similarly for the A at position 4.\n\nHowever, we are only required to have one A? The feedback from the first guess only said there is at least one A. It could have more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid using A again? Actually, we can use it to test multiple positions. But we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid many letters.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: ""ALARM"" uses A, L, A, R, M. The absent letters we have are C, N, E, P, T, S. So L and M are allowed.\n\nBut note: we are using A twice. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. If it doesn\'t, then one of the A\'s might be marked as absent? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then every occurrence that is in the word will be marked as either check or dash, and if there are duplicates, then the feedback might mark one as dash and the other as absent? Actually, no. The rules: for each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, it\'s check. If it\'s in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s dash. If it\'s not in the word, it\'s x. But if the word has only one A and we have two A\'s in the guess, then one will be marked as dash (if in the word but wrong position) and the other as x (if that position doesn\'t have A and there are no more A\'s). But we don\'t know the count.\n\nSo it might be risky to use two A\'s because we might get an x for one of them and then we don\'t know if it\'s because of the position or because there\'s only one A.\n\nTherefore, to avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with only one A.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with one A, at position 1, 4, or 5, and R at position 3.\n\nPatterns:\n\n1. A _ R _ _ (with one A, so the other letters are not A)\n2. _ _ R A _ (with one A)\n3. _ _ R _ A (with one A)\n\nNow, let\'s think of common words:\n\nFor pattern 1: A _ R _ _\n  Examples: \n    ""ABRIM"" - not common\n    ""ACRID"" - but C is absent\n    ""ADRIB"" - not a word\n    ""AERIE"" - E is absent\n    ""AGREE"" - E is absent and two E\'s\n    ""ALARM"" - has two A\'s, which we want to avoid for now.\n\nHow about ""ALERT""? But E and T are absent.\n\n""ALIKE""? But I and K are allowed, but E is absent.\n\n""ALIVE""? E absent.\n\n""ALOUD"": A at 1, L at 2, O at 4, U at 5? But we need R at 3. So ""ALOUD"" doesn\'t have R.\n\nWe need R at 3.\n\n""ALURM""? Not a word.\n\nFor pattern 2: _ _ R A _\n  Examples:\n    ""BORAX"" - B, O, R, A, X -> R at 3, A at 4. But we have to avoid X? We don\'t know if X is common, but it\'s allowed. Also, B and O are new.\n    ""CRAWL"" - but C is absent.\n    ""DRAWL"" - D, R, A, W, L -> R at 2? No, we need R at 3. In ""DRAWL"", R is at 2. We need R at 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be R.\n\nSo pattern: first two letters, then R, then A, then one letter.\n\nExamples: \n  ""BARMY""? B at 1, A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: in ""parts"", A was at 2 and we got dash, meaning A is not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2. But in this pattern, A is at 4, so that\'s okay. The word is: [letter1] [letter2] R A [letter5]\n\nSo letter2 can be anything except the absent letters and not A? Because we are not putting A at 2.\n\nFor example: \n  ""WORDY"" -> no A.\n  ""FORAM"" -> F, O, R, A, M -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a valid word? I think ""foram"" is a biological term, but might not be common. \n\n  ""LORAL"" -> L, O, R, A, L -> but two L\'s? and A at 4. But is ""loral"" a word? It means relating to the lore (a part of a bird). Not very common.\n\n  ""MORAY"" -> M, O, R, A, Y -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a type of eel. Valid.\n\n  ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4. This is a common word.\n\nBut note: in ""MURAL"", we have A at 4. We are testing A at 4. Also, we are introducing M, U, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""MORAL"" -> M, O, R, A, L -> same as above but O instead of U.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O or U are in the word.\n\nFor pattern 3: _ _ R _ A\n  Examples:\n    ""BURKA"" -> B, U, R, K, A -> R at 3, A at 5.\n    ""FURCA"" -> not common.\n    ""JIRGA"" -> J, I, R, G, A -> R at 3, A at 5.\n    ""VARIA"" -> V, A, R, I, A -> but two A\'s? and A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. Also, in ""VARIA"", the first letter is V, then A at 2 -> but we cannot put A at 2. So invalid.\n\n  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z is not common.\n\n  ""LYCRA"" -> but C is absent.\n\n  ""DOBRA"" -> D, O, B, R, A -> R at 4? We need R at 3. In ""DOBRA"", R is at 4, not 3.\n\nWe need R at 3 and A at 5.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] R [letter4] A\n\nExamples:\n  ""AORTA"" -> but A at 1 and 5? We have two A\'s. Also, we are putting A at 1? That\'s allowed, but we are also testing A at 5. But we have two A\'s.\n\n  ""BARRA"" -> two A\'s? and R at 3? B, A, R, R, A -> but we have two R\'s? We know there is at least one R, but maybe two? We don\'t know.\n\n  ""TERRA"" -> T is absent.\n\n  ""VERRA"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""HURRA"" -> H, U, R, R, A -> two R\'s and two A\'s? Not ideal.\n\n  ""PARRY"" -> P is absent.\n\n  ""CARRY"" -> C absent.\n\n  ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2. So invalid.\n\n  ""HARRY"" -> same, A at 2? No, H, A, R, R, Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n  ""LORRY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""WORRY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""BURMA"" -> B, U, R, M, A -> R at 3, A at 5. This is a place name, but acceptable? The word is ""Burma"", which is an old name for Myanmar. But it\'s a valid word.\n\n  ""DURRA"" -> D, U, R, R, A -> two R\'s and two A\'s? Not ideal.\n\n  ""CURIA"" -> C absent.\n\n  ""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> R at 5? We need R at 3.\n\nSo ""BURMA"" seems acceptable: B, U, R, M, A -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A.\n\nThis has R at 3 and A at 5, and we are introducing B, U, M.\n\nBut note: we are not using A at position 2, so that\'s safe.\n\nSimilarly, ""MURAL"" from pattern 2 is also good.\n\nNow, we have two candidates: ""MURAL"" (with A at 4) and ""BURMA"" (with A at 5).\n\nWe also have ""MORAY"" and ""MORAL"".\n\nBut ""MORAL"" is a very common word: M, O, R, A, L -> R at 3, A at 4.\n\nWe can choose ""MORAL"" because it uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S. ""MORAL"" uses M, O, R, A, L -> all allowed.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""MORAL"".\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""MURAL"" to test U instead of O.\n\nBut O is more common than U, so ""MORAL"" might be better.\n\nAnother common word: ""ROYAL"" -> but R is at 1? We need R at 3. So not.\n\n""RURAL"" -> R at 1 and 3? We have R at 1 and 3. But we know R is at position 3, so if we put R at 1, it might be marked as dash (if the word has only one R) or check (if it has two and at position 1). But we don\'t want to use R again at position 1 because we are not sure. Also, we are testing A at 5? ""RURAL"" has no A.\n\nSo not.\n\nI think ""MORAL"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3 (fixed), A at 4, L at 5.\n\nWe are testing:\n  A at position 4: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (since we know A is in the word, just not at 2 or 3, so if not at 4, then it must be at 1 or 5? but we are not testing 1 or 5 in this guess).\n\nAlso, we are testing M, O, L.\n\nSo we will get information about these.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""MORAL"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not using any absent letters. We are not.\n\nSo:\n\n<guess>moral</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, and E are absent.

But X is not very common, and we haven\'t tested it. Also, B is available.\n\n- FORAY: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5. This is a common word.\n\n- CORAL: but C is absent.\n\n- MORAL: we already tried, and M is absent.\n\n- DORAD: D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, D at 5. But D is at 1 and 5?

No, ""votary"" is 6 letters. We need 5.\n\n- WORRY: W at 1, O at 2, R at 3, R at 4? But we have A at 4? No, the pattern is ? O R A ? so position 4 is A. So ""WORRY"" has R at 4, not A.\n\n- WORDY: no A.\n\n- FORTY: T is absent.\n\n- FORUM: M is absent and U at 5? But pattern requires A at 4, so not.\n\n- FORAM: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, M at 5.

L absent.\n\n- FORDS: no A.\n\nSo the best candidate I see is ""FORAY"": F, O, R, A, Y.\n\nThis uses F and Y, which are new and not absent.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BORAX"" with B and X.\n\nBut ""FORAY"" is more common.\n\nWe also have ""DORBA""?

Y is not absent.\n\nAlso, F is not absent.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""FORAY"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other options.\n\n""BORAS"": but S is absent.\n\n""KORAT"": K, O, R, A, T -> T is absent.\n\n""FURAL"": L absent.\n\n""FURAN"": N absent.\n\n""FURAZ"": not a word.\n\n""FORAY"" is the best.\n\nWe can also consider ""DORAB"" (a fish) but not common.\n\nOr ""HORAH"" (a dance) but H at 1 and H at 5? And we haven\'t tested H.\n\nBut ""FORAY"" is more standard.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FORAY"".\n\nBut note: we are on the fourth guess, and we have two positions to determine: first and last. We are testing F and Y.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can then deduce the word.\n\nSo:\n\n<guess>foray</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, E are absent.

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""foray"":
 F: x (not in the word)
 O: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
 R: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
 A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
 Y: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O R A _
- The letters F and Y are absent (so not in the word).
- We also have previous absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L, F, Y.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: ? O R A ?

And we must avoid the absent letters: C, E, F, L, M, N, P, S, T, Y.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S, M, O, L, F, Y.

Available common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, and less common ones like J, Q, X, Z.

We need to form a word that fits: [letter1] O R A [letter5]

With letter1 and letter5 not in the absent list.

Possible words:

- BORAX: B at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, X at 5. But X is not very common, and we haven't tested it. Also, B is available.

- DORAD: D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, D at 5. But ""dorad"" is a fish, and it has two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it might be obscure.

- GORAL: G at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. But L is absent.

- HORAH: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, H at 5. ""Horah"" is a dance, and it has two H's? But H is available.

- JORAM: J at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, M at 5. But M is absent.

- KORAS: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. S is absent.

- NORIA: N is absent.

- TORAH: T is absent.

- VOTARY: 6 letters.

- WORRY: no A.

- WORDY: no A.

- BORED: E is absent.

- CORED: C and E absent.

- GORED: E absent.

- HORDE: E absent.

- WOVEN: no A.

- BOXER: no A.

- JOKER: no A.

- HOMER: no A.

- ROVER: no A.

- COVER: C and E absent.

- MOWER: M and E absent.

- POWER: P and E absent.

- TOWER: T and E absent.

- BOWLR: not a word.

- BOWEL: E absent.

- DOWRY: D, O, W, R, Y -> but Y is absent and no A.

- HOWDY: no A.

- JOWAR: J, O, W, A, R -> but R is at position 5? We need R at 3. In ""JOWAR"", the letters are J,O,W,A,R -> so positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:A, 5:R. But we need A at 4 and R at 3? Here R is at 5 and A at 4, but R is not at 3. So not.

We need the pattern: 1:?, 2:O, 3:R, 4:A, 5:?

So the word must have O at 2, R at 3, A at 4.

Therefore, the only possibilities are words that start with any letter (except absent ones) and end with any letter (except absent ones), and the middle is fixed as ""ORA"".

So the word is: [letter] + ""ORA"" + [letter]

We can list possible words:

- BORAH? Not common.

- DORAD: as above.

- DORBA? Not a word.

- GORAL: L absent.

- HORAH: as above.

- JORAM: M absent.

- KORAI: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, I at 5. ""Korai"" is a plural of kore (Greek statue), but might be accepted? 

- NORIA: N absent.

- PORTA: P absent.

- SORAS: S absent.

- TORAH: T absent.

- VORAZ? Not a word.

- WORKS: no A.

- WORMS: no A.

- WORDS: no A.

- WARDS: W, A, R, D, S -> but positions: 1:W, 2:A? We need O at 2, not A.

We must have O at 2.

Another idea: ""BOCCA""? But C absent and no R.

I think we are missing some common words.

What about ""DOGMA""? But G at 3? We need R at 3.

""DOZEN"": E and N absent.

""BROAD"": B, R, O, A, D -> but positions: 1:B, 2:R? We need O at 2 and R at 3. Here R is at 2 and O at 3. Not matching.

""GROAN"": G, R, O, A, N -> but N absent.

""BROWN"": no A.

""FROWN"": F and N absent.

""CROWD"": C absent.

""GROWL"": L absent.

""PROWL"": P and L absent.

""TROOP"": T and P absent.

""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S -> P and S absent.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> N and E absent.

""DRONE"" is not allowed.

But note: we have the fixed pattern: _ O R A _

So the word must be: [1]O[3=R][4=A][5]

So the only common word I can think of is ""BORAX"" and ""FORAY"" (which we tried and failed).

But ""FORAY"" was tried and F and Y were absent.

Another word: ""CORAL"" is out because C and L absent.

What about ""HORAL""? But L absent.

""VORAL""? Not a word.

""ZORIL"": Z, O, R, I, L -> L absent and no A.

""ZORIS"": no A.

""KARAT"": K, A, R, A, T -> but A at 1 and 4? And T absent. Also, we need O at 2, not A.

We must have O at 2.

Perhaps ""MORAT""? M and T absent.

""BORAK""? K at 5. ""Borak"" is a word? It means ridicule, but rare.

""BORAS"": S absent.

""BORAX"" is the only common one I can think of.

But let's check: ""BORAX"" is a mineral, and it's accepted in word games.

Other possibilities: ""DORAB"" (a fish), ""DOREE"" (E absent), ""DORJE"" (J and E? E absent), ""HORAL"" (L absent), ""KORUN"" (N absent), ""SORGO"" (S absent), ""TORAN"" (T and N absent), ""VOTARY"" (6 letters).

""WORLD"": no A.

""WORDY"": no A.

""WORMY"": no A.

""BOWED"": E absent.

""JOWED"": not common.

""ROWED"": E absent.

""TOWED"": T and E absent.

""VOWED"": E absent.

""BOWES"": E and S absent.

""COWED"": C and E absent.

""HAWED"": E absent.

""JAWED"": E absent.

""LAWED"": E and L absent.

""MAWED"": M and E absent.

""PAWED"": P and E absent.

""SAWED"": S and E absent.

""TAWED"": T and E absent.

""YAWED"": Y and E absent.

None of these have A at 4.

Another idea: ""BOCCA"" is not matching.

Perhaps ""ABORA"" is not a word.

I think we have to consider less common words or we might have missed one.

What about ""DORBA""? Not a word.

""GORGE"" has no A.

""FORGO"" has no A.

""FORDO"" has no A.

""FORBY"" has Y absent.

""FORBS"" has S absent.

""FORMS"" has M and S absent.

""FORTS"" has T and S absent.

""FORUM"" has M absent.

""FORCE"" has C and E absent.

""FORES"" has E and S absent.

""FORKS"" has S absent.

""FORKY"" has Y absent.

""FORTH"" has T and H? H is available. But ""FORTH"" is F, O, R, T, H -> T is absent, and no A at 4.

We need A at 4.

Another common word: ""BOOZE"" has no A.

""DOZEN"" has E and N.

""JAZZY"" has no O or R.

I think we are left with ""BORAX"" or ""HORAH"" or ""KORAI"".

But ""KORAI"" might be accepted.

Another one: ""DORSA"" -> D, O, R, S, A -> S is absent, and A is at 5? We need A at 4. In ""DORSA"", it's D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, S at 4, A at 5. But we need A at 4, not 5. So not.

""BORAS"" is B, O, R, A, S -> A at 4? Yes, but S is absent.

""BORAK"" is B, O, R, A, K -> K at 5. This is a valid word (meaning ridicule or a type of material). But it's rare.

""BORAX"" is more common.

""FORAM"" has M absent.

""VORDA"" -> not a word.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ORA"" is the root, and we add two letters.

Let's try to find words ending with ""ORA"" and then one letter? But the pattern is [1] O R A [5], so it's not ending with ORA, but the ORA is in the middle.

Words that start with B: B O R A ? -> BORAX, BORAK, BORAL (L absent), BORAN (N absent), BORAS (S absent), BORAX is the only one left.

Similarly for D: D O R A ? -> DORAD, DORBA (not word), DOREE (E absent), DORIC (C absent), DORIS (S absent), DORKS (K and S? S absent), DORKY (Y absent), DORMS (M and S absent), DORMY (M and Y absent), DORPS (P and S absent), DORRS (S absent), DORS A (S absent), so only DORAD.

For G: G O R A ? -> GORAL (L absent), GORED (E absent), GORES (E and S absent), GORGE (E absent), GORSE (E and S absent), no valid.

For H: H O R A ? -> HORAH, HORAL (L absent), HORAS (S absent), HORDE (E absent), HORNS (N and S absent), HORSE (E and S absent), so only HORAH.

For I: No word starts with I and then O.

For J: J O R A ? -> JORAM (M absent), JORUM (M absent), not.

For K: K O R A ? -> KORAS (S absent), KORAT (T absent), KORUN (N absent), KORAI (I at 5).

For U: U O R A ? -> not common, like UORTA? not word.

For V: V O R A ? -> VORAZ? not word, or VOTAL? T and L absent.

For W: W O R A ? -> WORKS (no A), etc.

For X: X O R A ? -> not common.

For Z: Z O R A ? -> ZORIS (no A), etc.

So the only remaining common word is ""BORAX"". ""HORAH"" and ""KORAI"" are less common, and ""DORAD"" is also less common.

But ""BORAX"" is a valid word and is accepted in Wordle.

Therefore, we guess ""BORAX"".

But note: we have not used B, X, D, H, K, etc. But we are on the fifth guess, so we need to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess ""HORAH"" or ""DORAD"", but ""BORAX"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""BORAX"".

<guess>borax</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, E absent; R and A present but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, S absent; R confirmed at position 3; A present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 3 (""moral"")**: M, L absent; O, R, A confirmed at positions 2, 3, and 4.
- **Guess 4 (""foray"")**: F, Y absent; O, R, A confirmed at positions 2, 3, and 4.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O R A _` (positions 2, 3, 4 are O, R, A).
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: C, E, F, L, M, N, P, S, T, Y.
- Possible letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, etc.

After evaluating possible words that fit `_ O R A _` and avoid absent letters, the only common valid word is **""BORAX""** (B at position 1, X at position 5). Other options like ""DORAD"" or ""HORAH"" are less common. This guess will either solve the puzzle or provide critical feedback for the last attempt.

After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses, here's a step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Established**:  
   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O R A _`  
     - Position 2: `O` (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).  
     - Position 3: `R` (confirmed correct in Guess 2, 3, and 4).  
     - Position 4: `A` (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).  
   - Positions 1 and 5 are unknown and must be filled with letters not ruled out.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: **C, E, F, L, M, N, P, S, T, Y** are absent.  
   - These letters cannot appear in the word.  

3. **Possible Letters for Positions 1 and 5**:  
   - Available common letters: **B, D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W** (and rarer letters like J, Q, X, Z).  
   - We need a valid 5-letter word matching `_ O R A _` using only these letters.  

4. **Evaluating Possible Words**:  
   - **BORAX**: B at 1, X at 5. Fits the pattern, avoids absent letters. ""Borax"" is a common word (a mineral).  
   - **DORAD**: D at 1, D at 5. Fits but is obscure (a type of fish) and has duplicate ""D"".  
   - **HORAH**: H at 1, H at 5. Fits but is uncommon (a dance) and has duplicate ""H"".  
   - **KORAI**: K at 1, I at 5. Fits but is rare (Greek statues).  
   - Other options like **GORAL** (G, L), **JORAM** (J, M), or **VORAZ** are invalid due to absent letters or non-words.  
   - **BORAX is the most common and viable choice**—it tests new letters (B and X) and avoids all absent letters.  

5. **Why This Guess?**  
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle.  
   - If incorrect, feedback on B and X will reveal the exact word (e.g., if B is correct but X is wrong, position 5 must be D, H, I, etc.).  
   - With only 2 unknowns left, this maximizes information for the final guess if needed.  

<guess>borax</guess>",borax,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""foray"":
 F: x (not in the word)
 O: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
 R: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
 A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
 Y: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O R A _
- The letters F and Y are absent (so not in the word).
- We also have previous absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, M, L, F, Y.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: ? O R A ?

And we must avoid the absent letters: C, E, F, L, M, N, P, S, T, Y.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, S, M, O, L, F, Y.

Available common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, and less common ones like J, Q, X, Z.

We need to form a word that fits: [letter1] O R A [letter5]

With letter1 and letter5 not in the absent list.

Possible words:

- BORAX: B at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, X at 5. But X is not very common, and we haven't tested it. Also, B is available.

- DORAD: D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, D at 5. But ""dorad"" is a fish, and it has two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it might be obscure.

- GORAL: G at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, L at 5. But L is absent.

- HORAH: H at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, H at 5. ""Horah"" is a dance, and it has two H's? But H is available.

- JORAM: J at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, M at 5. But M is absent.

- KORAS: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. S is absent.

- NORIA: N is absent.

- TORAH: T is absent.

- VOTARY: 6 letters.

- WORRY: no A.

- WORDY: no A.

- BORED: E is absent.

- CORED: C and E absent.

- GORED: E absent.

- HORDE: E absent.

- WOVEN: no A.

- BOXER: no A.

- JOKER: no A.

- HOMER: no A.

- ROVER: no A.

- COVER: C and E absent.

- MOWER: M and E absent.

- POWER: P and E absent.

- TOWER: T and E absent.

- BOWLR: not a word.

- BOWEL: E absent.

- DOWRY: D, O, W, R, Y -> but Y is absent and no A.

- HOWDY: no A.

- JOWAR: J, O, W, A, R -> but R is at position 5? We need R at 3. In ""JOWAR"", the letters are J,O,W,A,R -> so positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:A, 5:R. But we need A at 4 and R at 3? Here R is at 5 and A at 4, but R is not at 3. So not.

We need the pattern: 1:?, 2:O, 3:R, 4:A, 5:?

So the word must have O at 2, R at 3, A at 4.

Therefore, the only possibilities are words that start with any letter (except absent ones) and end with any letter (except absent ones), and the middle is fixed as ""ORA"".

So the word is: [letter] + ""ORA"" + [letter]

We can list possible words:

- BORAH? Not common.

- DORAD: as above.

- DORBA? Not a word.

- GORAL: L absent.

- HORAH: as above.

- JORAM: M absent.

- KORAI: K at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, I at 5. ""Korai"" is a plural of kore (Greek statue), but might be accepted? 

- NORIA: N absent.

- PORTA: P absent.

- SORAS: S absent.

- TORAH: T absent.

- VORAZ? Not a word.

- WORKS: no A.

- WORMS: no A.

- WORDS: no A.

- WARDS: W, A, R, D, S -> but positions: 1:W, 2:A? We need O at 2, not A.

We must have O at 2.

Another idea: ""BOCCA""? But C absent and no R.

I think we are missing some common words.

What about ""DOGMA""? But G at 3? We need R at 3.

""DOZEN"": E and N absent.

""BROAD"": B, R, O, A, D -> but positions: 1:B, 2:R? We need O at 2 and R at 3. Here R is at 2 and O at 3. Not matching.

""GROAN"": G, R, O, A, N -> but N absent.

""BROWN"": no A.

""FROWN"": F and N absent.

""CROWD"": C absent.

""GROWL"": L absent.

""PROWL"": P and L absent.

""TROOP"": T and P absent.

""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S -> P and S absent.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> N and E absent.

""DRONE"" is not allowed.

But note: we have the fixed pattern: _ O R A _

So the word must be: [1]O[3=R][4=A][5]

So the only common word I can think of is ""BORAX"" and ""FORAY"" (which we tried and failed).

But ""FORAY"" was tried and F and Y were absent.

Another word: ""CORAL"" is out because C and L absent.

What about ""HORAL""? But L absent.

""VORAL""? Not a word.

""ZORIL"": Z, O, R, I, L -> L absent and no A.

""ZORIS"": no A.

""KARAT"": K, A, R, A, T -> but A at 1 and 4? And T absent. Also, we need O at 2, not A.

We must have O at 2.

Perhaps ""MORAT""? M and T absent.

""BORAK""? K at 5. ""Borak"" is a word? It means ridicule, but rare.

""BORAS"": S absent.

""BORAX"" is the only common one I can think of.

But let's check: ""BORAX"" is a mineral, and it's accepted in word games.

Other possibilities: ""DORAB"" (a fish), ""DOREE"" (E absent), ""DORJE"" (J and E? E absent), ""HORAL"" (L absent), ""KORUN"" (N absent), ""SORGO"" (S absent), ""TORAN"" (T and N absent), ""VOTARY"" (6 letters).

""WORLD"": no A.

""WORDY"": no A.

""WORMY"": no A.

""BOWED"": E absent.

""JOWED"": not common.

""ROWED"": E absent.

""TOWED"": T and E absent.

""VOWED"": E absent.

""BOWES"": E and S absent.

""COWED"": C and E absent.

""HAWED"": E absent.

""JAWED"": E absent.

""LAWED"": E and L absent.

""MAWED"": M and E absent.

""PAWED"": P and E absent.

""SAWED"": S and E absent.

""TAWED"": T and E absent.

""YAWED"": Y and E absent.

None of these have A at 4.

Another idea: ""BOCCA"" is not matching.

Perhaps ""ABORA"" is not a word.

I think we have to consider less common words or we might have missed one.

What about ""DORBA""? Not a word.

""GORGE"" has no A.

""FORGO"" has no A.

""FORDO"" has no A.

""FORBY"" has Y absent.

""FORBS"" has S absent.

""FORMS"" has M and S absent.

""FORTS"" has T and S absent.

""FORUM"" has M absent.

""FORCE"" has C and E absent.

""FORES"" has E and S absent.

""FORKS"" has S absent.

""FORKY"" has Y absent.

""FORTH"" has T and H? H is available. But ""FORTH"" is F, O, R, T, H -> T is absent, and no A at 4.

We need A at 4.

Another common word: ""BOOZE"" has no A.

""DOZEN"" has E and N.

""JAZZY"" has no O or R.

I think we are left with ""BORAX"" or ""HORAH"" or ""KORAI"".

But ""KORAI"" might be accepted.

Another one: ""DORSA"" -> D, O, R, S, A -> S is absent, and A is at 5? We need A at 4. In ""DORSA"", it's D at 1, O at 2, R at 3, S at 4, A at 5. But we need A at 4, not 5. So not.

""BORAS"" is B, O, R, A, S -> A at 4? Yes, but S is absent.

""BORAK"" is B, O, R, A, K -> K at 5. This is a valid word (meaning ridicule or a type of material). But it's rare.

""BORAX"" is more common.

""FORAM"" has M absent.

""VORDA"" -> not a word.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ORA"" is the root, and we add two letters.

Let's try to find words ending with ""ORA"" and then one letter? But the pattern is [1] O R A [5], so it's not ending with ORA, but the ORA is in the middle.

Words that start with B: B O R A ? -> BORAX, BORAK, BORAL (L absent), BORAN (N absent), BORAS (S absent), BORAX is the only one left.

Similarly for D: D O R A ? -> DORAD, DORBA (not word), DOREE (E absent), DORIC (C absent), DORIS (S absent), DORKS (K and S? S absent), DORKY (Y absent), DORMS (M and S absent), DORMY (M and Y absent), DORPS (P and S absent), DORRS (S absent), DORS A (S absent), so only DORAD.

For G: G O R A ? -> GORAL (L absent), GORED (E absent), GORES (E and S absent), GORGE (E absent), GORSE (E and S absent), no valid.

For H: H O R A ? -> HORAH, HORAL (L absent), HORAS (S absent), HORDE (E absent), HORNS (N and S absent), HORSE (E and S absent), so only HORAH.

For I: No word starts with I and then O.

For J: J O R A ? -> JORAM (M absent), JORUM (M absent), not.

For K: K O R A ? -> KORAS (S absent), KORAT (T absent), KORUN (N absent), KORAI (I at 5).

For U: U O R A ? -> not common, like UORTA? not word.

For V: V O R A ? -> VORAZ? not word, or VOTAL? T and L absent.

For W: W O R A ? -> WORKS (no A), etc.

For X: X O R A ? -> not common.

For Z: Z O R A ? -> ZORIS (no A), etc.

So the only remaining common word is ""BORAX"". ""HORAH"" and ""KORAI"" are less common, and ""DORAD"" is also less common.

But ""BORAX"" is a valid word and is accepted in Wordle.

Therefore, we guess ""BORAX"".

But note: we have not used B, X, D, H, K, etc. But we are on the fifth guess, so we need to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess ""HORAH"" or ""DORAD"", but ""BORAX"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""BORAX"".

<guess>borax</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, N, E absent; R and A present but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: P, T, S absent; R confirmed at position 3; A present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 3 (""moral"")**: M, L absent; O, R, A confirmed at positions 2, 3, and 4.
- **Guess 4 (""foray"")**: F, Y absent; O, R, A confirmed at positions 2, 3, and 4.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O R A _` (positions 2, 3, 4 are O, R, A).
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: C, E, F, L, M, N, P, S, T, Y.
- Possible letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, etc.

After evaluating possible words that fit `_ O R A _` and avoid absent letters, the only common valid word is **""BORAX""** (B at position 1, X at position 5). Other options like ""DORAD"" or ""HORAH"" are less common. This guess will either solve the puzzle or provide critical feedback for the last attempt.

<guess>borax</guess>After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses, here's a step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Established**:  
   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O R A _`  
     - Position 2: `O` (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).  
     - Position 3: `R` (confirmed correct in Guess 2, 3, and 4).  
     - Position 4: `A` (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).  
   - Positions 1 and 5 are unknown and must be filled with letters not ruled out.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: **C, E, F, L, M, N, P, S, T, Y** are absent.  
   - These letters cannot appear in the word.  

3. **Possible Letters for Positions 1 and 5**:  
   - Available common letters: **B, D, G, H, I, K, U, V, W** (and rarer letters like J, Q, X, Z).  
   - We need a valid 5-letter word matching `_ O R A _` using only these letters.  

4. **Evaluating Possible Words**:  
   - **BORAX**: B at 1, X at 5. Fits the pattern, avoids absent letters. ""Borax"" is a common word (a mineral).  
   - **DORAD**: D at 1, D at 5. Fits but is obscure (a type of fish) and has duplicate ""D"".  
   - **HORAH**: H at 1, H at 5. Fits but is uncommon (a dance) and has duplicate ""H"".  
   - **KORAI**: K at 1, I at 5. Fits but is rare (Greek statues).  
   - Other options like **GORAL** (G, L), **JORAM** (J, M), or **VORAZ** are invalid due to absent letters or non-words.  
   - **BORAX is the most common and viable choice**—it tests new letters (B and X) and avoids all absent letters.  

5. **Why This Guess?**  
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle.  
   - If incorrect, feedback on B and X will reveal the exact word (e.g., if B is correct but X is wrong, position 5 must be D, H, I, etc.).  
   - With only 2 unknowns left, this maximizes information for the final guess if needed.",Guess 5: borax -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
