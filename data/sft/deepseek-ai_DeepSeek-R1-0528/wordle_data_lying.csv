We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or wealth) that is often used as a starting word because it contains common letters.
 However, let me check if ""ROATE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""SOARE"" (a young hawk) is also used.

 But let's choose a word that is more common. Another popular choice is ""CRANE"".

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes the common vowels A and E, and the common consonants C, R, N.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very popular.

 After considering, I will go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the word and it is in the 4th position (since in ""crane"", N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'N' in the 4th position.
   - Does not contain C, R, A, E.
   - Is a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have 'N' as the 4th letter.

 The pattern is: _ _ _ N _

 We need to fill the first three letters and the last letter, avoiding C, R, A, E.

 Common letters that are still available: We can use other vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

 We should try to include as many common letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's list some words that fit the pattern _ _ _ N _ and do not contain C, R, A, E.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> but we have to check if it contains any forbidden letters? It has P, O, I, T. None of C, R, A, E. So it's allowed.
 - ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> same, no forbidden letters.
 - ""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T -> no forbidden letters.
 - ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but wait, the pattern requires the 4th letter to be N, so the word must be _ _ _ N _ -> MINTS has M in 1st, I in 2nd, N in 3rd? No, that's not the same. We need the 4th letter to be N.

 Let me clarify: the word must have the 4th letter as N. So the positions are:
   Position 1: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 2: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 3: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: any letter (not C,R,A,E)

 So, for ""POINT"": 
   P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 Similarly, ""JOINT"": J (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 ""MOUNT"": M (1st), O (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 But note: we also want to cover new letters to maximize information.

 We have already used the letters P, O, I, T in ""POINT"", but we haven't used them in previous guess? Actually, in the first guess we used C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding those.

 We haven't used P, O, I, T, so they are new.

 Similarly, for ""JOINT"": we haven't used J, O, I, T.

 However, we also know that the word does not have R, A, E, so we can avoid them.

 Another idea: we might want to try a word that has a double letter? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters that we haven't tried.

 The most common letters we haven't tried: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try to include T, O, I, S, L.

 The word ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T. That's good because O, I, T are common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""JOINT"", but J is less common.

 Another word: ""TOWN"" is 4 letters, not 5.

 How about ""SHUNT"": S-H-U-N-T -> S, H, U, N, T. U is a vowel we haven't tried, and S, T are common.

 But we have to choose one.

 Let me think of more words: 
   ""BLUNT"": B-L-U-N-T -> B, L, U, T. 
   ""FLINT"": F-L-I-N-T -> F, L, I, T.

 However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E. So ""BLUNT"" and ""FLINT"" are acceptable.

 But we also want to avoid using too many rare letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can afford to get more information.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 However, let me check if there are words that have more common letters.

 Another word: ""STINT"": S-T-I-N-T -> but T is repeated? The word is S-T-I-N-T. The 4th letter is N, but the 5th is T. Also, the 2nd is T. So it has two T's. That might be acceptable, but we don't know if the word has a T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T. We already know N is in the word, so we are testing P, O, I, T.

 We might get feedback on these.

 But note: we are going to get feedback for each position.

 Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> but wait, the 4th letter must be N. So ""MOIST"" doesn't have N at the 4th position.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let's stick to the pattern.

 I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

 However, we can also consider ""JOINS"" but that would be J-O-I-N-S -> 4th is N, but the 5th is S. But ""JOINS"" is a word? Yes, but we are avoiding E and we have S.

 But note: we are not restricted to not using S. So it's acceptable.

 But I think ""POINT"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""SHINY"": S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th is N? Let's see: S (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), Y (5). Yes. And it has S, H, I, Y. H and Y are less common.

 I think ""POINT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""POINT"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

 So I will go with ""POINT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, E). ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""POINT"".

- The word must have **N in the 4th position** (e.g., \_ \_ \_ N \_).
- It **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- To maximize new information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P).

A strong candidate is **""POINT""**:

 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or wealth) that is often used as a starting word because it contains common letters.
 However, let me check if ""ROATE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""SOARE"" (a young hawk) is also used.

 But let's choose a word that is more common. Another popular choice is ""CRANE"".

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes the common vowels A and E, and the common consonants C, R, N.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very popular.

 After considering, I will go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the word and it is in the 4th position (since in ""crane"", N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:

   Position 1: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 2: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 3: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: any letter (not C,R,A,E)

 So, for ""POINT"": 
   P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 Similarly, ""JOINT"": J (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 ""MOUNT"": M (1st), O (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 But note: we also want to cover new letters to maximize information.

 We have already used the letters P, O, I, T in ""POINT"", but we haven't used them in previous guess? Actually, in the first guess we used C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding those.

 We haven't used P, O, I, T, so they are new.

 Similarly, for ""JOINT"": we haven't used J, O, I, T.

 However, we also know that the word does not have R, A, E, so we can avoid them.

 Another idea: we might want to try a word that has a double letter? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters that we haven't tried.

 The most common letters we haven't tried: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try to include T, O, I, S, L.

 The word ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T. That's good because O, I, T are common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""JOINT"", but J is less common.

 Another word: ""TOWN"" is 4 letters, not 5.

 How about ""SHUNT"": S-H-U-N-T -> S, H, U, N, T. U is a vowel we haven't tried, and S, T are common.

 But we have to choose one.

 Let me think of more words: 
   ""BLUNT"": B-L-U-N-T -> B, L, U, T. 
   ""FLINT"": F-L-I-N-T -> F, L, I, T.

 However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E. So ""BLUNT"" and ""FLINT"" are acceptable.

 But we also want to avoid using too many rare letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can afford to get more information.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 However, let me check if there are words that have more common letters.

 Another word: ""STINT"": S-T-I-N-T -> but T is repeated? The word is S-T-I-N-T. The 4th letter is N, but the 5th is T. Also, the 2nd is T. So it has two T's. That might be acceptable, but we don't know if the word has a T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T. We already know N is in the word, so we are testing P, O, I, T.

 We might get feedback on these.

 But note: we are going to get feedback for each position.

 Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> but wait, the 4th letter must be N. So ""MOIST"" doesn't have N at the 4th position.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let's stick to the pattern.

 I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

 However, we can also consider ""JOINS"" but that would be J-O-I-N-S -> 4th is N, but the 5th is S. But ""JOINS"" is a word? Yes, but we are avoiding E and we have S.

 But note: we are not restricted to not using S. So it's acceptable.

 But I think ""POINT"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""SHINY"": S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th is N? Let's see: S (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), Y (5). Yes. And it has S, H, I, Y. H and Y are less common.

 I think ""POINT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""POINT"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

 So I will go with ""POINT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, E). ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **N is correct and in the 4th position** (as indicated by ✓).
- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word (as indicated by x).

For the next guess:
- The word must have **N in the 4th position** (e.g., \_ \_ \_ N \_).
- It **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- To maximize new information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P).

A strong candidate is **""POINT""**:
- Fits the pattern \_ \_ \_ N \_ (P-O-I-N-T).
- Tests new common letters: **P, O, I, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   - So, N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

2. Second guess ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
   - N is again in the correct position (4th), which we already knew.
   - P, O, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- The secret word has:
   - 3rd letter: I (from 'point' feedback)
   - 4th letter: N (from both guesses)
- The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has only one of the guessed letters that was correct (N), and the others are absent. Similarly, in the second guess, only I and N were correct.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ I N _

We need to fill the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, G, H, M, B, etc.

We also know that the first and second letters cannot be any of the forbidden letters, and the fifth letter also cannot be forbidden.

Since the word has I in 3rd and N in 4th, common words with this pattern? For example, ""BEGIN"", ""BLINK"", ""CHAIN"" (but CHAIN has A and is forbidden), ""MINCE"" (has E and C).

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that match _ _ I N _ and don't contain C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Possible words:

- ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K. Check forbidden: B, L, K are allowed? Yes, because no C,R,A,E,P,O,T. So B, L, K are new.
   - We haven't tested B, L, K yet.

- ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G. F, L, G: new and allowed.

- ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G. S, L, G: new and allowed.

- ""CLING"": but C is forbidden (from first guess), so no.

- ""SHINS"": S-H-I-N-S. S, H: new, but ends with S. And we have double S? But S is not forbidden yet.

However, we also need to consider that in ""point"", the I was in the correct position and N correct, but the other letters were absent. So if we try ""BLINK"", for instance, we test B, L, K.

But note: we have limited guesses, and we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Another word: ""MINUS"" -> M-I-N-U-S -> but the pattern requires I in the 3rd and N in the 4th? MINUS has M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> Wrong positions. We need I at 3 and N at 4, so MINUS doesn't fit.

Another: ""DAILY"" -> D-A-I-L-Y -> has A (forbidden). No.

""SUNNY"" -> S-U-N-N-Y -> pattern is _ _ I N _, but SUNNY has U in 3rd? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no I. Doesn't fit.

We must have I at position 3 and N at 4.

So the word must look like: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter5 not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T}.

Also, since the word length is 5, and no repeated letters so far? We don't know.

Possible words:

- ""BLINK"": B,L,I,N,K
- ""SLINK"": S,L,I,N,K
- ""FLING"": F,L,I,N,G
- ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G
- ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> W is new
- ""THING"": T is forbidden (from guess2: T(x)) so we cannot have T -> ruled out.
- ""THINK"": T is forbidden -> no.
- ""UNFIT"": but U in 1st, N in 2nd, F in 3rd? Doesn't fit pattern.

We need to consider that letter1, letter2, letter5 are not any of the forbidden letters.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had A absent, and in second, O and T absent, so we avoid those.

Now, let me list a few more:

- ""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D -> but pattern: U is at position 2, L at 5? B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at 4th, not L. Doesn't fit.

- ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> same issue.

- ""BLIMP"": B,L,I,M,P -> but P is forbidden.

- ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D -> D is new? B,L,D.
  - Pattern: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches.

Yes, ""BLIND"" would work: B, L, I, N, D.

Similarly, ""BLINK"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)

""FLING"": F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""SWING"": S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> but R is forbidden.

""SHINE"": S,H,I,N,E -> but E is forbidden.

""WHINE"": W,H,I,N,E -> E forbidden.

So let's focus on ones without forbidden letters.

We can try:

- BLINK: tests B, L, K
- BLIND: tests B, L, D
- SLING: tests S, L, G
- SWING: tests S, W, G
- FLING: tests F, L, G

We want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information if we don't guess correctly.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, etc.

L is very common, so testing L is good.

We can also consider ""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G -> pattern: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So letter5 = G. And L, Y, G are new.

Similarly, ""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G.

But note: we have not ruled out Y or G.

Since we know two letters (I and N) and their positions, we might try to guess the word if we can think of common words.

Common words ending with ""IN"": 
- with pattern: ? ? I N ? -> possible: BEGIN, but G has not been tested and E is forbidden. BEGIN has E? B,E,G,I,N -> E is forbidden.
- SHRIN: not a word.
- QUINT: Q,U,I,N,T -> but T is forbidden.

So, less common?

Also, ""BLIND"" and ""BLINK"" are common.

But perhaps we should choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested.

Tested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,T,I (from ""crane"" and ""point"")
N and I are known.

So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should avoid using multiple rare letters.

Perhaps ""SLUNG"": but pattern: S,L,U,N,G -> U at 3rd? No, it has S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). But position 3 must be I, not U.

Doesn't fit.

""SPRIG"": but S,P,R,I,G -> P and R forbidden.

I think ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"" are good.

But we might also consider ""SHINY"": but in previous feedback, we don't know about S and H, but the pattern _ _ I N _, SHINY has H at position 2? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes, that matches.

And S, H, Y are new and allowed.

Similarly, ""SHINE"" has E forbidden.

""SHINY"" is a valid word: meaning bright or shining.

And forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,P,O,T, and S,H,Y not forbidden.

So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Now, among these, which gives more coverage?

""BLINK"": letters B,L,K (all new, L common)
""SHINY"": letters S,H,Y (S and H common, Y less so)
""FLING"": F,L,G (L common, F and G less common)

But we have to consider that if we guess ""BLIND"" and it's wrong, we may get information about B,L,D.

Similarly for ""SHINY"".

Since we have I and N fixed, we might get lucky.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't need to have L, for example, but we want to test more letters.

Another word: ""SWIM"" is 4 letters.

Or ""BEGIN"": forbidden.

""MINIM"": M,I,N,I,M -> pattern: M(1), I(2)? No, position 2 needs to be something else, and we need position 3 to be I? MINIM: M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5). But we need N at position 4, not position 3. Doesn't fit.

After considering, I think ""SHINY"" is a good choice because it tests S and H, which are common.

But note: in ""SHINY"", the H is in position 2. We haven't tested H before.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" tests L in position 2.

We can also choose ""JUICE"" -> but J,U,I,C,E -> C and E forbidden.

Not valid.

I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it tests B, L, K, and L is very common.

So let's choose ""BLINK"".

But wait, what about ""SLINK""? S,L,I,N,K -> same pattern.

S is more common than B? S is more common.

But we are safe to test S.

Perhaps we should use S to see if it's present.

Similarly, we haven't tested S at all.

In ""point"", we didn't test S.

So a word with S might be better.

How about ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G -> tests S, L, G.

But ""SLINK"" has K.

Another word: ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> tests S, W, G.

W is less common.

So ""SLING"" or ""SLINK"".

Both test S and L in positions 1 and 2.

Since L is common, we might get information on L.

I think ""SLINK"" is a word (meaning to move stealthily).

Similarly, ""BLINK"" is also common.

But to cover S, I'll go with ""SLINK"".

However, let me see if there's a word that doesn't have L and tests other letters.

What about ""SHINY"" as I thought earlier? It has S, H, Y.

H is also common.

Perhaps ""SHINY"" is better because it doesn't have L? We don't know if L is present.

I think testing L is good, but S is more common.

But we can do both? Not in one guess.

Another candidate: ""BUILD"" doesn't fit pattern.

We need to pick one.

I think ""SLING"" is safe: S-L-I-N-G.

Common letters: S, L, G.

So I'll go with ""SLING"".

But let me confirm: ""SLING"" is a valid English word, meaning to throw or a type of weapon.

And it fits the pattern: S (1), L (2), I (3), N (4), G (5).

Avoids all forbidden letters.

Feedback from this will tell us about S, L, G.

If we get ✓ for S or L, we narrow down.

If all wrong, then we know S, L, G are not in the word.

So let's use ""SLING"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have two letters known (I and N), so we might be close.

Perhaps we can think of a word that has U or D, but we don't know.

Another common word: ""WINN"" not 5.

""BEGIN"" not allowed.

I think ""SLING"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U,N,L,I,T -> pattern: U(1), N(2)? But we need N at 4. No.

I'll go with ""SLING"".

So guess: SLING

But wait, in the pattern, letter5 can be G, so maybe.

But we don't know if G is in the word.

Similarly, we don't know about L.

So that's the point.

To maximize new letters, ""SLING"" introduces three new letters: S, L, G.

Then we'll get feedback.

So decision: ""SLING""

<guess>sling</guess>
</think>
We have two pieces of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
   - This means:  
     - N is in the secret word and in the correct position (4th).  
     - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ N _`.

2. **Guess 2: point** → P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
   - This means:  
     - I is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd).  
     - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  
     - P, O, T are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Combined with previous feedback, the pattern is now: `_ _ I N _`.  
   - Absolute exclusions: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  

### Key Constraints:
- The secret word is `_ _ I N _`.  
- Letters **excluded**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  
- The 5th letter cannot be any of the excluded letters.  
- We need to prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, L, U, D, G, M, B, H, K, Y, W) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new common letters to gain more information if this guess isn't correct.  
- Strong candidates:  
  - **SLING**: Tests S (position 1), L (position 2), and G (position 5)—all common and unused.  
  - Alternatively, words like **BLINK** (B, L, K) or **SHINY** (S, H, Y) are viable, but **SLING** covers more high-frequency letters (S, L, G).  
- **SLING** is valid:  
  - Pattern match: S(`?`), L(`?`), I(`✓`, position 3), N(`✓`, position 4), G(`?`).  
  - No excluded letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, T absent).  
  - Tests 3 new common letters.  

### Selected Guess: **SLING**
<guess>sling</guess>",sling,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   - So, N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

2. Second guess ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
   - N is again in the correct position (4th), which we already knew.
   - P, O, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- The secret word has:
   - 3rd letter: I (from 'point' feedback)
   - 4th letter: N (from both guesses)
- The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has only one of the guessed letters that was correct (N), and the others are absent. Similarly, in the second guess, only I and N were correct.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ I N _

We need to fill the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, G, H, M, B, etc.

We also know that the first and second letters cannot be any of the forbidden letters, and the fifth letter also cannot be forbidden.

Since the word has I in 3rd and N in 4th, common words with this pattern? For example, ""BEGIN"", ""BLINK"", ""CHAIN"" (but CHAIN has A and is forbidden), ""MINCE"" (has E and C).

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that match _ _ I N _ and don't contain C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Possible words:

- ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K. Check forbidden: B, L, K are allowed? Yes, because no C,R,A,E,P,O,T. So B, L, K are new.
   - We haven't tested B, L, K yet.

- ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G. F, L, G: new and allowed.

- ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G. S, L, G: new and allowed.

- ""CLING"": but C is forbidden (from first guess), so no.

- ""SHINS"": S-H-I-N-S. S, H: new, but ends with S. And we have double S? But S is not forbidden yet.

However, we also need to consider that in ""point"", the I was in the correct position and N correct, but the other letters were absent. So if we try ""BLINK"", for instance, we test B, L, K.

But note: we have limited guesses, and we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Another word: ""MINUS"" -> M-I-N-U-S -> but the pattern requires I in the 3rd and N in the 4th? MINUS has M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> Wrong positions. We need I at 3 and N at 4, so MINUS doesn't fit.

Another: ""DAILY"" -> D-A-I-L-Y -> has A (forbidden). No.

""SUNNY"" -> S-U-N-N-Y -> pattern is _ _ I N _, but SUNNY has U in 3rd? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no I. Doesn't fit.

We must have I at position 3 and N at 4.

So the word must look like: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter5 not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T}.

Also, since the word length is 5, and no repeated letters so far? We don't know.

Possible words:

- ""BLINK"": B,L,I,N,K
- ""SLINK"": S,L,I,N,K
- ""FLING"": F,L,I,N,G
- ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G
- ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> W is new
- ""THING"": T is forbidden (from guess2: T(x)) so we cannot have T -> ruled out.
- ""THINK"": T is forbidden -> no.
- ""UNFIT"": but U in 1st, N in 2nd, F in 3rd? Doesn't fit pattern.

We need to consider that letter1, letter2, letter5 are not any of the forbidden letters.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had A absent, and in second, O and T absent, so we avoid those.

Now, let me list a few more:

- ""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D -> but pattern: U is at position 2, L at 5? B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at 4th, not L. Doesn't fit.

- ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> same issue.

- ""BLIMP"": B,L,I,M,P -> but P is forbidden.

- ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D -> D is new? B,L,D.
  - Pattern: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches.

Yes, ""BLIND"" would work: B, L, I, N, D.

Similarly, ""BLINK"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)

""FLING"": F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""SWING"": S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> but R is forbidden.

""SHINE"": S,H,I,N,E -> but E is forbidden.

""WHINE"": W,H,I,N,E -> E forbidden.

So let's focus on ones without forbidden letters.

We can try:

- BLINK: tests B, L, K
- BLIND: tests B, L, D
- SLING: tests S, L, G
- SWING: tests S, W, G
- FLING: tests F, L, G

We want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information if we don't guess correctly.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, etc.

L is very common, so testing L is good.

We can also consider ""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G -> pattern: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So letter5 = G. And L, Y, G are new.

Similarly, ""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G.

But note: we have not ruled out Y or G.

Since we know two letters (I and N) and their positions, we might try to guess the word if we can think of common words.

Common words ending with ""IN"": 
- with pattern: ? ? I N ? -> possible: BEGIN, but G has not been tested and E is forbidden. BEGIN has E? B,E,G,I,N -> E is forbidden.
- SHRIN: not a word.
- QUINT: Q,U,I,N,T -> but T is forbidden.

So, less common?

Also, ""BLIND"" and ""BLINK"" are common.

But perhaps we should choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested.

Tested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,T,I (from ""crane"" and ""point"")
N and I are known.

So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should avoid using multiple rare letters.

Perhaps ""SLUNG"": but pattern: S,L,U,N,G -> U at 3rd? No, it has S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). But position 3 must be I, not U.

Doesn't fit.

""SPRIG"": but S,P,R,I,G -> P and R forbidden.

I think ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"" are good.

But we might also consider ""SHINY"": but in previous feedback, we don't know about S and H, but the pattern _ _ I N _, SHINY has H at position 2? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes, that matches.

And S, H, Y are new and allowed.

Similarly, ""SHINE"" has E forbidden.

""SHINY"" is a valid word: meaning bright or shining.

And forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,P,O,T, and S,H,Y not forbidden.

So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Now, among these, which gives more coverage?

""BLINK"": letters B,L,K (all new, L common)
""SHINY"": letters S,H,Y (S and H common, Y less so)
""FLING"": F,L,G (L common, F and G less common)

But we have to consider that if we guess ""BLIND"" and it's wrong, we may get information about B,L,D.

Similarly for ""SHINY"".

Since we have I and N fixed, we might get lucky.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't need to have L, for example, but we want to test more letters.

Another word: ""SWIM"" is 4 letters.

Or ""BEGIN"": forbidden.

""MINIM"": M,I,N,I,M -> pattern: M(1), I(2)? No, position 2 needs to be something else, and we need position 3 to be I? MINIM: M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5). But we need N at position 4, not position 3. Doesn't fit.

After considering, I think ""SHINY"" is a good choice because it tests S and H, which are common.

But note: in ""SHINY"", the H is in position 2. We haven't tested H before.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" tests L in position 2.

We can also choose ""JUICE"" -> but J,U,I,C,E -> C and E forbidden.

Not valid.

I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it tests B, L, K, and L is very common.

So let's choose ""BLINK"".

But wait, what about ""SLINK""? S,L,I,N,K -> same pattern.

S is more common than B? S is more common.

But we are safe to test S.

Perhaps we should use S to see if it's present.

Similarly, we haven't tested S at all.

In ""point"", we didn't test S.

So a word with S might be better.

How about ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G -> tests S, L, G.

But ""SLINK"" has K.

Another word: ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> tests S, W, G.

W is less common.

So ""SLING"" or ""SLINK"".

Both test S and L in positions 1 and 2.

Since L is common, we might get information on L.

I think ""SLINK"" is a word (meaning to move stealthily).

Similarly, ""BLINK"" is also common.

But to cover S, I'll go with ""SLINK"".

However, let me see if there's a word that doesn't have L and tests other letters.

What about ""SHINY"" as I thought earlier? It has S, H, Y.

H is also common.

Perhaps ""SHINY"" is better because it doesn't have L? We don't know if L is present.

I think testing L is good, but S is more common.

But we can do both? Not in one guess.

Another candidate: ""BUILD"" doesn't fit pattern.

We need to pick one.

I think ""SLING"" is safe: S-L-I-N-G.

Common letters: S, L, G.

So I'll go with ""SLING"".

But let me confirm: ""SLING"" is a valid English word, meaning to throw or a type of weapon.

And it fits the pattern: S (1), L (2), I (3), N (4), G (5).

Avoids all forbidden letters.

Feedback from this will tell us about S, L, G.

If we get ✓ for S or L, we narrow down.

If all wrong, then we know S, L, G are not in the word.

So let's use ""SLING"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have two letters known (I and N), so we might be close.

Perhaps we can think of a word that has U or D, but we don't know.

Another common word: ""WINN"" not 5.

""BEGIN"" not allowed.

I think ""SLING"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U,N,L,I,T -> pattern: U(1), N(2)? But we need N at 4. No.

I'll go with ""SLING"".

So guess: SLING

But wait, in the pattern, letter5 can be G, so maybe.

But we don't know if G is in the word.

Similarly, we don't know about L.

So that's the point.

To maximize new letters, ""SLING"" introduces three new letters: S, L, G.

Then we'll get feedback.

So decision: ""SLING""

<guess>sling</guess>We have two pieces of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
   - This means:  
     - N is in the secret word and in the correct position (4th).  
     - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ N _`.

2. **Guess 2: point** → P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
   - This means:  
     - I is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd).  
     - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  
     - P, O, T are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Combined with previous feedback, the pattern is now: `_ _ I N _`.  
   - Absolute exclusions: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  

### Key Constraints:
- The secret word is `_ _ I N _`.  
- Letters **excluded**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  
- The 5th letter cannot be any of the excluded letters.  
- We need to prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, L, U, D, G, M, B, H, K, Y, W) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new common letters to gain more information if this guess isn't correct.  
- Strong candidates:  
  - **SLING**: Tests S (position 1), L (position 2), and G (position 5)—all common and unused.  
  - Alternatively, words like **BLINK** (B, L, K) or **SHINY** (S, H, Y) are viable, but **SLING** covers more high-frequency letters (S, L, G).  
- **SLING** is valid:  
  - Pattern match: S(`?`), L(`?`), I(`✓`, position 3), N(`✓`, position 4), G(`?`).  
  - No excluded letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, T absent).  
  - Tests 3 new common letters.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or wealth) that is often used as a starting word because it contains common letters.
 However, let me check if ""ROATE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""SOARE"" (a young hawk) is also used.

 But let's choose a word that is more common. Another popular choice is ""CRANE"".

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes the common vowels A and E, and the common consonants C, R, N.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very popular.

 After considering, I will go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the word and it is in the 4th position (since in ""crane"", N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'N' in the 4th position.
   - Does not contain C, R, A, E.
   - Is a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have 'N' as the 4th letter.

 The pattern is: _ _ _ N _

 We need to fill the first three letters and the last letter, avoiding C, R, A, E.

 Common letters that are still available: We can use other vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

 We should try to include as many common letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's list some words that fit the pattern _ _ _ N _ and do not contain C, R, A, E.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> but we have to check if it contains any forbidden letters? It has P, O, I, T. None of C, R, A, E. So it's allowed.
 - ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> same, no forbidden letters.
 - ""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T -> no forbidden letters.
 - ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but wait, the pattern requires the 4th letter to be N, so the word must be _ _ _ N _ -> MINTS has M in 1st, I in 2nd, N in 3rd? No, that's not the same. We need the 4th letter to be N.

 Let me clarify: the word must have the 4th letter as N. So the positions are:
   Position 1: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 2: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 3: any letter (not C,R,A,E)
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: any letter (not C,R,A,E)

 So, for ""POINT"": 
   P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 Similarly, ""JOINT"": J (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 ""MOUNT"": M (1st), O (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.

 But note: we also want to cover new letters to maximize information.

 We have already used the letters P, O, I, T in ""POINT"", but we haven't used them in previous guess? Actually, in the first guess we used C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding those.

 We haven't used P, O, I, T, so they are new.

 Similarly, for ""JOINT"": we haven't used J, O, I, T.

 However, we also know that the word does not have R, A, E, so we can avoid them.

 Another idea: we might want to try a word that has a double letter? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters that we haven't tried.

 The most common letters we haven't tried: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try to include T, O, I, S, L.

 The word ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T. That's good because O, I, T are common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""JOINT"", but J is less common.

 Another word: ""TOWN"" is 4 letters, not 5.

 How about ""SHUNT"": S-H-U-N-T -> S, H, U, N, T. U is a vowel we haven't tried, and S, T are common.

 But we have to choose one.

 Let me think of more words: 
   ""BLUNT"": B-L-U-N-T -> B, L, U, T. 
   ""FLINT"": F-L-I-N-T -> F, L, I, T.

 However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E. So ""BLUNT"" and ""FLINT"" are acceptable.

 But we also want to avoid using too many rare letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can afford to get more information.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 However, let me check if there are words that have more common letters.

 Another word: ""STINT"": S-T-I-N-T -> but T is repeated? The word is S-T-I-N-T. The 4th letter is N, but the 5th is T. Also, the 2nd is T. So it has two T's. That might be acceptable, but we don't know if the word has a T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T. We already know N is in the word, so we are testing P, O, I, T.

 We might get feedback on these.

 But note: we are going to get feedback for each position.

 Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> but wait, the 4th letter must be N. So ""MOIST"" doesn't have N at the 4th position.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let's stick to the pattern.

 I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

 However, we can also consider ""JOINS"" but that would be J-O-I-N-S -> 4th is N, but the 5th is S. But ""JOINS"" is a word? Yes, but we are avoiding E and we have S.

 But note: we are not restricted to not using S. So it's acceptable.

 But I think ""POINT"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""SHINY"": S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th is N? Let's see: S (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), Y (5). Yes. And it has S, H, I, Y. H and Y are less common.

 I think ""POINT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""POINT"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

 So I will go with ""POINT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, E). ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **N is correct and in the 4th position** (as indicated by ✓).
- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word (as indicated by x).

For the next guess:
- The word must have **N in the 4th position** (e.g., \_ \_ \_ N \_).
- It **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- To maximize new information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P).

A strong candidate is **""POINT""**:
- Fits the pattern \_ \_ \_ N \_ (P-O-I-N-T).
- Tests new common letters: **P, O, I, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   - So, N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

2. Second guess ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
   - N is again in the correct position (4th), which we already knew.
   - P, O, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- The secret word has:
   - 3rd letter: I (from 'point' feedback)
   - 4th letter: N (from both guesses)
- The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has only one of the guessed letters that was correct (N), and the others are absent. Similarly, in the second guess, only I and N were correct.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ I N _

We need to fill the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, G, H, M, B, etc.

We also know that the first and second letters cannot be any of the forbidden letters, and the fifth letter also cannot be forbidden.

Since the word has I in 3rd and N in 4th, common words with this pattern? For example, ""BEGIN"", ""BLINK"", ""CHAIN"" (but CHAIN has A and is forbidden), ""MINCE"" (has E and C).

But we have to avoid forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that match _ _ I N _ and don't contain C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Possible words:

- ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K. Check forbidden: B, L, K are allowed? Yes, because no C,R,A,E,P,O,T. So B, L, K are new.
   - We haven't tested B, L, K yet.

- ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G. F, L, G: new and allowed.

- ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G. S, L, G: new and allowed.

- ""CLING"": but C is forbidden (from first guess), so no.

- ""SHINS"": S-H-I-N-S. S, H: new, but ends with S. And we have double S? But S is not forbidden yet.

However, we also need to consider that in ""point"", the I was in the correct position and N correct, but the other letters were absent. So if we try ""BLINK"", for instance, we test B, L, K.

But note: we have limited guesses, and we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Another word: ""MINUS"" -> M-I-N-U-S -> but the pattern requires I in the 3rd and N in the 4th? MINUS has M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> Wrong positions. We need I at 3 and N at 4, so MINUS doesn't fit.

Another: ""DAILY"" -> D-A-I-L-Y -> has A (forbidden). No.

""SUNNY"" -> S-U-N-N-Y -> pattern is _ _ I N _, but SUNNY has U in 3rd? S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no I. Doesn't fit.

We must have I at position 3 and N at 4.

So the word must look like: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter5 not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T}.

Also, since the word length is 5, and no repeated letters so far? We don't know.

Possible words:

- ""BLINK"": B,L,I,N,K
- ""SLINK"": S,L,I,N,K
- ""FLING"": F,L,I,N,G
- ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G
- ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> W is new
- ""THING"": T is forbidden (from guess2: T(x)) so we cannot have T -> ruled out.
- ""THINK"": T is forbidden -> no.
- ""UNFIT"": but U in 1st, N in 2nd, F in 3rd? Doesn't fit pattern.

We need to consider that letter1, letter2, letter5 are not any of the forbidden letters.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had A absent, and in second, O and T absent, so we avoid those.

Now, let me list a few more:

- ""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D -> but pattern: U is at position 2, L at 5? B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at 4th, not L. Doesn't fit.

- ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> same issue.

- ""BLIMP"": B,L,I,M,P -> but P is forbidden.

- ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D -> D is new? B,L,D.
  - Pattern: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches.

Yes, ""BLIND"" would work: B, L, I, N, D.

Similarly, ""BLINK"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)

""FLING"": F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""SWING"": S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> but R is forbidden.

""SHINE"": S,H,I,N,E -> but E is forbidden.

""WHINE"": W,H,I,N,E -> E forbidden.

So let's focus on ones without forbidden letters.

We can try:

- BLINK: tests B, L, K
- BLIND: tests B, L, D
- SLING: tests S, L, G
- SWING: tests S, W, G
- FLING: tests F, L, G

We want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information if we don't guess correctly.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, etc.

L is very common, so testing L is good.

We can also consider ""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G -> pattern: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So letter5 = G. And L, Y, G are new.

Similarly, ""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G.

But note: we have not ruled out Y or G.

Since we know two letters (I and N) and their positions, we might try to guess the word if we can think of common words.

Common words ending with ""IN"": 
- with pattern: ? ? I N ? -> possible: BEGIN, but G has not been tested and E is forbidden. BEGIN has E? B,E,G,I,N -> E is forbidden.
- SHRIN: not a word.
- QUINT: Q,U,I,N,T -> but T is forbidden.

So, less common?

Also, ""BLIND"" and ""BLINK"" are common.

But perhaps we should choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested.

Tested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,T,I (from ""crane"" and ""point"")
N and I are known.

So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should avoid using multiple rare letters.

Perhaps ""SLUNG"": but pattern: S,L,U,N,G -> U at 3rd? No, it has S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). But position 3 must be I, not U.

Doesn't fit.

""SPRIG"": but S,P,R,I,G -> P and R forbidden.

I think ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"" are good.

But we might also consider ""SHINY"": but in previous feedback, we don't know about S and H, but the pattern _ _ I N _, SHINY has H at position 2? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes, that matches.

And S, H, Y are new and allowed.

Similarly, ""SHINE"" has E forbidden.

""SHINY"" is a valid word: meaning bright or shining.

And forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,P,O,T, and S,H,Y not forbidden.

So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Now, among these, which gives more coverage?

""BLINK"": letters B,L,K (all new, L common)
""SHINY"": letters S,H,Y (S and H common, Y less so)
""FLING"": F,L,G (L common, F and G less common)

But we have to consider that if we guess ""BLIND"" and it's wrong, we may get information about B,L,D.

Similarly for ""SHINY"".

Since we have I and N fixed, we might get lucky.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't need to have L, for example, but we want to test more letters.

Another word: ""SWIM"" is 4 letters.

Or ""BEGIN"": forbidden.

""MINIM"": M,I,N,I,M -> pattern: M(1), I(2)? No, position 2 needs to be something else, and we need position 3 to be I? MINIM: M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5). But we need N at position 4, not position 3. Doesn't fit.

After considering, I think ""SHINY"" is a good choice because it tests S and H, which are common.

But note: in ""SHINY"", the H is in position 2. We haven't tested H before.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" tests L in position 2.

We can also choose ""JUICE"" -> but J,U,I,C,E -> C and E forbidden.

Not valid.

I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it tests B, L, K, and L is very common.

So let's choose ""BLINK"".

But wait, what about ""SLINK""? S,L,I,N,K -> same pattern.

S is more common than B? S is more common.

But we are safe to test S.

Perhaps we should use S to see if it's present.

Similarly, we haven't tested S at all.

In ""point"", we didn't test S.

So a word with S might be better.

How about ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G -> tests S, L, G.

But ""SLINK"" has K.

Another word: ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> tests S, W, G.

W is less common.

So ""SLING"" or ""SLINK"".

Both test S and L in positions 1 and 2.

Since L is common, we might get information on L.

I think ""SLINK"" is a word (meaning to move stealthily).

Similarly, ""BLINK"" is also common.

But to cover S, I'll go with ""SLINK"".

However, let me see if there's a word that doesn't have L and tests other letters.

What about ""SHINY"" as I thought earlier? It has S, H, Y.

H is also common.

Perhaps ""SHINY"" is better because it doesn't have L? We don't know if L is present.

I think testing L is good, but S is more common.

But we can do both? Not in one guess.

Another candidate: ""BUILD"" doesn't fit pattern.

We need to pick one.

I think ""SLING"" is safe: S-L-I-N-G.

Common letters: S, L, G.

So I'll go with ""SLING"".

But let me confirm: ""SLING"" is a valid English word, meaning to throw or a type of weapon.

And it fits the pattern: S (1), L (2), I (3), N (4), G (5).

Avoids all forbidden letters.

Feedback from this will tell us about S, L, G.

If we get ✓ for S or L, we narrow down.

If all wrong, then we know S, L, G are not in the word.

So let's use ""SLING"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have two letters known (I and N), so we might be close.

Perhaps we can think of a word that has U or D, but we don't know.

Another common word: ""WINN"" not 5.

""BEGIN"" not allowed.

I think ""SLING"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U,N,L,I,T -> pattern: U(1), N(2)? But we need N at 4. No.

I'll go with ""SLING"".

So guess: SLING

But wait, in the pattern, letter5 can be G, so maybe.

But we don't know if G is in the word.

Similarly, we don't know about L.

So that's the point.

To maximize new letters, ""SLING"" introduces three new letters: S, L, G.

Then we'll get feedback.

So decision: ""SLING""

<guess>sling</guess>We have two pieces of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
   - This means:  
     - N is in the secret word and in the correct position (4th).  
     - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ N _`.

2. **Guess 2: point** → P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
   - This means:  
     - I is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd).  
     - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  
     - P, O, T are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Combined with previous feedback, the pattern is now: `_ _ I N _`.  
   - Absolute exclusions: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  

### Key Constraints:
- The secret word is `_ _ I N _`.  
- Letters **excluded**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  
- The 5th letter cannot be any of the excluded letters.  
- We need to prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, L, U, D, G, M, B, H, K, Y, W) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new common letters to gain more information if this guess isn't correct.  
- Strong candidates:  
  - **SLING**: Tests S (position 1), L (position 2), and G (position 5)—all common and unused.  
  - Alternatively, words like **BLINK** (B, L, K) or **SHINY** (S, H, Y) are viable, but **SLING** covers more high-frequency letters (S, L, G).  
- **SLING** is valid:  
  - Pattern match: S(`?`), L(`?`), I(`✓`, position 3), N(`✓`, position 4), G(`?`).  
  - No excluded letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, T absent).  
  - Tests 3 new common letters.

It has P, O, I, T. None of C, R, A, E. So it\'s allowed.\n - ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> same, no forbidden letters.\n - ""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T -> no forbidden letters.\n - ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but wait, the pattern requires the 4th letter to be N, so the word must be _ _ _ N _ -> MINTS has M in 1st, I in 2nd, N in 3rd? No, that\'s not the same. We need the 4th letter to be N.\n\n Let me clarify: the word must have the 4th letter as N. So the positions are:\n   Position 1: any letter (not C,R,A,E)\n   Position 2: any letter (not C,R,A,E)\n   Position 3: any letter (not C,R,A,E)\n   Position 4: N\n   Position 5: any letter (not C,R,A,E)\n\n So, for ""POINT"": \n   P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.\n\n Similarly, ""JOINT"": J (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.\n\n ""MOUNT"": M (1st), O (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th) -> matches.\n\n But note: we also want to cover new letters to maximize information.\n\n We have already used the letters P, O, I, T in ""POINT"", but we haven\'t used them in previous guess?

But we don\'t have any indication of that yet.\n\n Let\'s consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n The most common letters we haven\'t tried: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n We can try to include T, O, I, S, L.\n\n The word ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T. That\'s good because O, I, T are common.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""JOINT"", but J is less common.\n\n Another word: ""TOWN"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n\n How about ""SHUNT"": S-H-U-N-T -> S, H, U, N, T. U is a vowel we haven\'t tried, and S, T are common.\n\n But we have to choose one.\n\n Let me think of more words: \n   ""BLUNT"": B-L-U-N-T -> B, L, U, T. \n   ""FLINT"": F-L-I-N-T -> F, L, I, T.\n\n However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E. So ""BLUNT"" and ""FLINT"" are acceptable.\n\n But we also want to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can afford to get more information.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\n However, let me check if there are words that have more common letters.\n\n Another word: ""STINT"": S-T-I-N-T -> but T is repeated? The word is S-T-I-N-T. The 4th letter is N, but the 5th is T. Also, the 2nd is T. So it has two T\'s. That might be acceptable, but we don\'t know if the word has a T.\n\n Alternatively, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T. We already know N is in the word, so we are testing P, O, I, T.\n\n We might get feedback on these.\n\n But note: we are going to get feedback for each position.\n\n Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> but wait, the 4th letter must be N. So ""MOIST"" doesn\'t have N at the 4th position.\n\n We must have the 4th letter as N.\n\n So let\'s stick to the pattern.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, we can also consider ""JOINS"" but that would be J-O-I-N-S -> 4th is N, but the 5th is S. But ""JOINS"" is a word? Yes, but we are avoiding E and we have S.\n\n But note: we are not restricted to not using S. So it\'s acceptable.\n\n But I think ""POINT"" is more common.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHINY"": S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th is N? Let\'s see: S (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), Y (5). Yes. And it has S, H, I, Y. H and Y are less common.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is better.\n\n Let me see: ""POINT"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.\n\n So I will go with ""POINT"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

Check forbidden: B, L, K are allowed? Yes, because no C,R,A,E,P,O,T. So B, L, K are new.\n   - We haven\'t tested B, L, K yet.\n\n- ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G. F, L, G: new and allowed.\n\n- ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G. S, L, G: new and allowed.\n\n- ""CLING"": but C is forbidden (from first guess), so no.\n\n- ""SHINS"": S-H-I-N-S. S, H: new, but ends with S. And we have double S? But S is not forbidden yet.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider that in ""point"", the I was in the correct position and N correct, but the other letters were absent.

MINUS has M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> Wrong positions. We need I at 3 and N at 4, so MINUS doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""DAILY"" -> D-A-I-L-Y -> has A (forbidden).

B,L,D.\n  - Pattern: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches.\n\nYes, ""BLIND"" would work: B, L, I, N, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLINK"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)\n\n""FLING"": F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)\n\n""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)\n\n""SWING"": S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)\n\n""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> but R is forbidden.\n\n""SHINE"": S,H,I,N,E -> but E is forbidden.\n\n""WHINE"": W,H,I,N,E -> E forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s focus on ones without forbidden letters.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- BLINK: tests B, L, K\n- BLIND: tests B, L, D\n- SLING: tests S, L, G\n- SWING: tests S, W, G\n- FLING: tests F, L, G\n\nWe want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information if we don\'t guess correctly.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, U, D, etc.\n\nL is very common, so testing L is good.\n\nWe can also consider ""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G -> pattern: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So letter5 = G. And L, Y, G are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G.\n\nBut note: we have not ruled out Y or G.\n\nSince we know two letters (I and N) and their positions, we might try to guess the word if we can think of common words.\n\nCommon words ending with ""IN"": \n- with pattern: ? ? I N ? -> possible: BEGIN, but G has not been tested and E is forbidden. BEGIN has E? B,E,G,I,N -> E is forbidden.\n- SHRIN: not a word.\n- QUINT: Q,U,I,N,T -> but T is forbidden.\n\nSo, less common?\n\nAlso, ""BLIND"" and ""BLINK"" are common.\n\nBut perhaps we should choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nTested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,T,I (from ""crane"" and ""point"")\nN and I are known.\n\nSo available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe should avoid using multiple rare letters.\n\nPerhaps ""SLUNG"": but pattern: S,L,U,N,G -> U at 3rd? No, it has S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). But position 3 must be I, not U.\n\nDoesn\'t fit.\n\n""SPRIG"": but S,P,R,I,G -> P and R forbidden.\n\nI think ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"" are good.\n\nBut we might also consider ""SHINY"": but in previous feedback, we don\'t know about S and H, but the pattern _ _ I N _, SHINY has H at position 2? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes, that matches.\n\nAnd S, H, Y are new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHINE"" has E forbidden.\n\n""SHINY"" is a valid word: meaning bright or shining.\n\nAnd forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,P,O,T, and S,H,Y not forbidden.\n\nSo ""SHINY"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, among these, which gives more coverage?\n\n""BLINK"": letters B,L,K (all new, L common)\n""SHINY"": letters S,H,Y (S and H common, Y less so)\n""FLING"": F,L,G (L common, F and G less common)\n\nBut we have to consider that if we guess ""BLIND"" and it\'s wrong, we may get information about B,L,D.\n\nSimilarly for ""SHINY"".\n\nSince we have I and N fixed, we might get lucky.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t need to have L, for example, but we want to test more letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SWIM"" is 4 letters.\n\nOr ""BEGIN"": forbidden.\n\n""MINIM"": M,I,N,I,M -> pattern: M(1), I(2)? No, position 2 needs to be something else, and we need position 3 to be I? MINIM: M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5). But we need N at position 4, not position 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SHINY"" is a good choice because it tests S and H, which are common.\n\nBut note: in ""SHINY"", the H is in position 2. We haven\'t tested H before.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLINK"" tests L in position 2.\n\nWe can also choose ""JUICE"" -> but J,U,I,C,E -> C and E forbidden.\n\nNot valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BLINK"" because it tests B, L, K, and L is very common.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BLINK"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""SLINK""? S,L,I,N,K -> same pattern.\n\nS is more common than B? S is more common.\n\nBut we are safe to test S.\n\nPerhaps we should use S to see if it\'s present.\n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested S at all.\n\nIn ""point"", we didn\'t test S.\n\nSo a word with S might be better.\n\nHow about ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G -> tests S, L, G.\n\nBut ""SLINK"" has K.\n\nAnother word: ""SWING"": S,W,I,N,G -> tests S, W, G.\n\nW is less common.\n\nSo ""SLING"" or ""SLINK"".\n\nBoth test S and L in positions 1 and 2.\n\nSince L is common, we might get information on L.\n\nI think ""SLINK"" is a word (meaning to move stealthily).\n\nSimilarly, ""BLINK"" is also common.\n\nBut to cover S, I\'ll go with ""SLINK"".\n\nHowever, let me see if there\'s a word that doesn\'t have L and tests other letters.\n\nWhat about ""SHINY"" as I thought earlier? It has S, H, Y.\n\nH is also common.\n\nPerhaps ""SHINY"" is better because it doesn\'t have L? We don\'t know if L is present.\n\nI think testing L is good, but S is more common.\n\nBut we can do both? Not in one guess.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BUILD"" doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nWe need to pick one.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is safe: S-L-I-N-G.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, G.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SLING"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""SLING"" is a valid English word, meaning to throw or a type of weapon.\n\nAnd it fits the pattern: S (1), L (2), I (3), N (4), G (5).\n\nAvoids all forbidden letters.\n\nFeedback from this will tell us about S, L, G.\n\nIf we get ✓ for S or L, we narrow down.\n\nIf all wrong, then we know S, L, G are not in the word.\n\nSo let\'s use ""SLING"".\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess, and we have two letters known (I and N), so we might be close.\n\nPerhaps we can think of a word that has U or D, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother common word: ""WINN"" not 5.\n\n""BEGIN"" not allowed.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is fine.\n\nAlternatively, ""UNLIT"": U,N,L,I,T -> pattern: U(1), N(2)? But we need N at 4. No.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLING"".\n\nSo guess: SLING\n\nBut wait, in the pattern, letter5 can be G, so maybe.\n\nBut we don\'t know if G is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, we don\'t know about L.\n\nSo that\'s the point.\n\nTo maximize new letters, ""SLING"" introduces three new letters: S, L, G.\n\nThen we\'ll get feedback.\n\nSo decision: ""SLING""\n\n<guess>sling</guess>We have two pieces of feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n   - This means:  \n     - N is in the secret word and in the correct position (4th).  \n     - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n   - Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ N _`.\n\n2. **Guess 2: point** → P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  \n   - This means:  \n     - I is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd).  \n     - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  \n     - P, O, T are **not** in the secret word.  \n   - Combined with previous feedback, the pattern is now: `_ _ I N _`.  \n   - Absolute exclusions: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  \n\n### Key Constraints:\n- The secret word is `_ _ I N _`.  \n- Letters **excluded**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.  \n- The 5th letter cannot be any of the excluded letters.  \n- We need to prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, L, U, D, G, M, B, H, K, Y, W) to maximize information.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test new common letters to gain more information if this guess isn\'t correct.  \n- Strong candidates:  \n  - **SLING**: Tests S (position 1), L (position 2), and G (position 5)—all common and unused.  \n  - Alternatively, words like **BLINK** (B, L, K) or **SHINY** (S, H, Y) are viable, but **SLING** covers more high-frequency letters (S, L, G).  \n- **SLING** is valid:  \n  - Pattern match: S(`?`), L(`?`), I(`✓`, position 3), N(`✓`, position 4), G(`?`).  \n  - No excluded letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, T absent).  \n  - Tests 3 new common letters.  \n\n### Selected Guess: **SLING**\n\n<guess>sling</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: sling -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

2. ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
   - N is in the correct position (4th) (already known).
   - P, O, T are not in the word.

3. ""sling"": S(x), L(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)
   - I is in the correct position (3rd) (already known).
   - N is in the correct position (4th) (already known).
   - G is in the word and in the correct position (5th) -> so the 5th letter is G.
   - L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, but it's not there).
   - S is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N G
- The 3rd letter is I, 4th is N, 5th is G.
- The word contains the letter L, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""sling"" it was in position 2 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
- Additionally, the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S.

We also know that L is in the word but not in position 2. Since the pattern is _ _ I N G, L can be in position 1 or possibly in position 2? But wait, position 2 is the second letter, and we have L in the second position in ""sling"" and it was marked as present but wrong position. So L cannot be in position 2. Therefore, L must be in position 1 (since positions 3,4,5 are fixed as I, N, G).

But note: the feedback for ""sling"" says L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But we don't have a letter in position 1 yet. So L must be in position 1? Not necessarily, because we have two positions: 1 and 2. But we know it's not in 2, so it must be in 1? Or could it be that L is in the word but we haven't tried it in position 1? Yes, that's possible.

But let's think: the word is _ _ I N G. The only positions left are 1 and 2. We know L is in the word and it's not in position 2 (from the feedback of ""sling""). Therefore, L must be in position 1.

Is that correct? Yes, because if L were in position 1, then in ""sling"" we had L in position 2 (which is wrong) and the L in the word is actually in position 1. So the feedback would show that L is present (but not in position 2). Alternatively, if L were in position 1, then when we put L in position 2, it would be marked as present but wrong position.

So we can deduce that L is in position 1.

Therefore, the word is L _ I N G.

Now, we need to find the second letter. The word is L ? I N G.

What can the second letter be? It must be a letter that is not in the excluded list: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S. Also, it must be a letter that we haven't ruled out.

We also know that the letter in position 2 must not be L (because if it were, then in ""sling"" we would have had two L's? But ""sling"" has only one L. And the secret word might have only one L? We don't know for sure, but the feedback doesn't show any duplicate, so we assume one L for now.

But note: the feedback for ""sling"" only shows one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the word had two L's, one in position 1 and one in position 2, then when we put L in position 2, it would be marked as correct? But we got a minus, meaning it's present but not in that position. So if there were an L in position 1, then the L in position 2 would be an extra L? But the word might not have two L's.

To be safe, let's assume the word has exactly one L. Then, since L is in the word and not in position 2, it must be in position 1. So the word is L ? I N G.

Now, what letters are possible for the second position?

Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S.

We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,T,I,S,L,G. (N, I, G are in the word, L is in the word, the others are excluded).

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with L, then one of these letters, then I, N, G.

Common words: 
- ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G -> but Y is available. However, we have to check if it's valid. ""LYING"" is a word (present participle of lie). But in the feedback from ""sling"", we have G as correct in the 5th position, so G is fixed. And I and N are fixed. So ""LYING"" would be L-Y-I-N-G. The second letter is Y.

But is Y allowed? Yes, because we haven't excluded it.

Other possibilities:
- ""LAWNG"" -> not a word.
- ""LIVING"" -> too long.
- ""LEGIN"" -> not a word.

Actually, common words with pattern L _ I N G:
- ""LYING"": as above.
- ""LOGIN"": but O is excluded (from guess2: O(x)).
- ""LIVING"": 6 letters.

Another: ""LOSING"": but O and S are excluded.

""LYING"" seems to be the only common word.

But let me think: is there ""LUMIN""? Not a common word.

""LAVING"": L-A-V-I-N-G -> but A is excluded.

""LEVIN"": L-E-V-I-N -> E excluded and it's 5 letters but ends with N, not G.

We need to end with G.

Another: ""LYTIC"" -> not ending with G.

Perhaps ""LYING"" is the only common word.

But we have to consider less common words? Or did we miss any?

""LYING"" is L-Y-I-N-G.

But in the feedback, we have L marked as present but not in position 2. If the word is ""LYING"", then L is in position 1. In ""sling"", we had L in position 2, which is not the correct position (because it should be in position 1). So that matches.

Also, in ""sling"", we had S (which is not in the word) and G in the correct position.

So ""LYING"" seems to fit.

But let's check if there are other possibilities.

What about ""FLING""? But we already tried ""sling"", and F is not excluded? In ""sling"", we didn't test F. But in ""FLING"", the pattern would be F-L-I-N-G. But we have L in position 2? And we think L is in position 1. Also, in ""sling"", we had L in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word were ""FLING"", then L is in position 2, but then in ""sling"" we put L in position 2 and it should be correct? But we got a minus, meaning it's not correct. So ""FLING"" would require L in position 2, but the feedback says it's not in position 2. So ""FLING"" is impossible.

Similarly, ""BLING"": B-L-I-N-G -> same issue, L in position 2, which would be correct? But we got a minus for L in position 2, so it cannot be in position 2. Therefore, words with L in position 2 are ruled out.

So the only possibility is L in position 1.

Therefore, the word must be L ? I N G.

Now, what letters can be in the second position? We have the available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G -> valid.
- ""LIVING"": too long.
- ""LEVING"": not a word.
- ""LOVING"": O excluded.
- ""LAVING"": A excluded.
- ""LYING"" is the most common.

But is there ""LUBING""? Not a word.

""LYING"" is a word.

Another: ""LYTED""? Not a word.

""LYNCH"": but that's L-Y-N-C-H -> pattern: L(1), Y(2), N(3)? But we need I in position 3, not N. So no.

""LYCRA"": not ending with G.

So I think ""LYING"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me confirm the feedback for ""sling"" in the context of ""LYING"":

- ""sling"": S (x) -> not in word -> correct because ""LYING"" has no S.
- L (-) -> L is in the word but not in position 2 -> correct, because in ""LYING"" L is in position 1.
- I (✓) -> correct position -> matches.
- N (✓) -> correct position -> matches.
- G (✓) -> correct position -> matches.

Perfect.

So the word should be ""LYING"".

But we have to make sure that Y is not excluded. We haven't used Y before, and it's not in the excluded list.

Therefore, we can guess ""LYING"".

But note: we are only on the fourth guess, and we have two more if needed, but this seems to be the only possibility.

Alternatively, we might consider ""DEIGN"" but that is D-E-I-G-N -> E excluded and pattern is not matching (we need I in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th, but ""DEIGN"" has E in 2nd? D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5) -> no, doesn't match.

""REIGN"": R and E excluded.

So I think ""LYING"" is the answer.

But to be thorough, are there any other words?

- ""HYING"": H-Y-I-N-G -> but ""HYING"" is a word (archaic present participle of ""hie""). However, H is not excluded. But then the first letter would be H, but we think it must be L? No, we have L in the word. In ""HYING"", there is no L. But the feedback says L is in the word. So ""HYING"" cannot be because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, ""TYING"": T is excluded.

""DYING"": D-Y-I-N-G -> but again, no L. But we know L is in the word.

So only ""LYING"" has L and fits the pattern.

Therefore, we guess ""LYING"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - N is in the secret word and in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: point** → P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - I is in the secret word and in the 3rd position.  
  - P, O, T are absent.  

- **Guess 3: sling** → S(x), L(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - G is in the secret word and in the 5th position.  
  - L is present but not in the 2nd position.  
  - S is absent.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is: `_ _ I N G` (3rd: I, 4th: N, 5th: G).  
- L is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from ""sling"" feedback). Since positions 3–5 are fixed, L must be in position 1.  
  - Thus, the pattern is now: `L _ I N G`.  
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S.  
- The only unknown is the 2nd letter, which must be a letter not excluded and not used in incorrect positions (available: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

### Analysis for Position 2:
- The word must be a valid English word matching `L _ I N G`.  
- Common options:  
  - **LYING**: L-Y-I-N-G (valid word, meaning present participle of ""lie"").  
  - Other possibilities like ""LOVING"" (O excluded), ""LIVING"" (6 letters), ""LAVING"" (A excluded), or ""LOGIN"" (O excluded) are invalid.  
- ""LYING"" fits all constraints:  
  - Y is not excluded.  
  - Confirms L in position 1 (not position 2).  
  - Matches known positions (I in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th).  

### Conclusion:
""LYING"" is the only common word that satisfies all feedback. This guess will confirm if the secret word is ""LYING"" or provide further clues if incorrect.  

<guess>lying</guess>",lying,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

2. ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
   - N is in the correct position (4th) (already known).
   - P, O, T are not in the word.

3. ""sling"": S(x), L(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)
   - I is in the correct position (3rd) (already known).
   - N is in the correct position (4th) (already known).
   - G is in the word and in the correct position (5th) -> so the 5th letter is G.
   - L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, but it's not there).
   - S is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N G
- The 3rd letter is I, 4th is N, 5th is G.
- The word contains the letter L, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""sling"" it was in position 2 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
- Additionally, the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S.

We also know that L is in the word but not in position 2. Since the pattern is _ _ I N G, L can be in position 1 or possibly in position 2? But wait, position 2 is the second letter, and we have L in the second position in ""sling"" and it was marked as present but wrong position. So L cannot be in position 2. Therefore, L must be in position 1 (since positions 3,4,5 are fixed as I, N, G).

But note: the feedback for ""sling"" says L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But we don't have a letter in position 1 yet. So L must be in position 1? Not necessarily, because we have two positions: 1 and 2. But we know it's not in 2, so it must be in 1? Or could it be that L is in the word but we haven't tried it in position 1? Yes, that's possible.

But let's think: the word is _ _ I N G. The only positions left are 1 and 2. We know L is in the word and it's not in position 2 (from the feedback of ""sling""). Therefore, L must be in position 1.

Is that correct? Yes, because if L were in position 1, then in ""sling"" we had L in position 2 (which is wrong) and the L in the word is actually in position 1. So the feedback would show that L is present (but not in position 2). Alternatively, if L were in position 1, then when we put L in position 2, it would be marked as present but wrong position.

So we can deduce that L is in position 1.

Therefore, the word is L _ I N G.

Now, we need to find the second letter. The word is L ? I N G.

What can the second letter be? It must be a letter that is not in the excluded list: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S. Also, it must be a letter that we haven't ruled out.

We also know that the letter in position 2 must not be L (because if it were, then in ""sling"" we would have had two L's? But ""sling"" has only one L. And the secret word might have only one L? We don't know for sure, but the feedback doesn't show any duplicate, so we assume one L for now.

But note: the feedback for ""sling"" only shows one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the word had two L's, one in position 1 and one in position 2, then when we put L in position 2, it would be marked as correct? But we got a minus, meaning it's present but not in that position. So if there were an L in position 1, then the L in position 2 would be an extra L? But the word might not have two L's.

To be safe, let's assume the word has exactly one L. Then, since L is in the word and not in position 2, it must be in position 1. So the word is L ? I N G.

Now, what letters are possible for the second position?

Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S.

We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,T,I,S,L,G. (N, I, G are in the word, L is in the word, the others are excluded).

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with L, then one of these letters, then I, N, G.

Common words: 
- ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G -> but Y is available. However, we have to check if it's valid. ""LYING"" is a word (present participle of lie). But in the feedback from ""sling"", we have G as correct in the 5th position, so G is fixed. And I and N are fixed. So ""LYING"" would be L-Y-I-N-G. The second letter is Y.

But is Y allowed? Yes, because we haven't excluded it.

Other possibilities:
- ""LAWNG"" -> not a word.
- ""LIVING"" -> too long.
- ""LEGIN"" -> not a word.

Actually, common words with pattern L _ I N G:
- ""LYING"": as above.
- ""LOGIN"": but O is excluded (from guess2: O(x)).
- ""LIVING"": 6 letters.

Another: ""LOSING"": but O and S are excluded.

""LYING"" seems to be the only common word.

But let me think: is there ""LUMIN""? Not a common word.

""LAVING"": L-A-V-I-N-G -> but A is excluded.

""LEVIN"": L-E-V-I-N -> E excluded and it's 5 letters but ends with N, not G.

We need to end with G.

Another: ""LYTIC"" -> not ending with G.

Perhaps ""LYING"" is the only common word.

But we have to consider less common words? Or did we miss any?

""LYING"" is L-Y-I-N-G.

But in the feedback, we have L marked as present but not in position 2. If the word is ""LYING"", then L is in position 1. In ""sling"", we had L in position 2, which is not the correct position (because it should be in position 1). So that matches.

Also, in ""sling"", we had S (which is not in the word) and G in the correct position.

So ""LYING"" seems to fit.

But let's check if there are other possibilities.

What about ""FLING""? But we already tried ""sling"", and F is not excluded? In ""sling"", we didn't test F. But in ""FLING"", the pattern would be F-L-I-N-G. But we have L in position 2? And we think L is in position 1. Also, in ""sling"", we had L in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word were ""FLING"", then L is in position 2, but then in ""sling"" we put L in position 2 and it should be correct? But we got a minus, meaning it's not correct. So ""FLING"" would require L in position 2, but the feedback says it's not in position 2. So ""FLING"" is impossible.

Similarly, ""BLING"": B-L-I-N-G -> same issue, L in position 2, which would be correct? But we got a minus for L in position 2, so it cannot be in position 2. Therefore, words with L in position 2 are ruled out.

So the only possibility is L in position 1.

Therefore, the word must be L ? I N G.

Now, what letters can be in the second position? We have the available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G -> valid.
- ""LIVING"": too long.
- ""LEVING"": not a word.
- ""LOVING"": O excluded.
- ""LAVING"": A excluded.
- ""LYING"" is the most common.

But is there ""LUBING""? Not a word.

""LYING"" is a word.

Another: ""LYTED""? Not a word.

""LYNCH"": but that's L-Y-N-C-H -> pattern: L(1), Y(2), N(3)? But we need I in position 3, not N. So no.

""LYCRA"": not ending with G.

So I think ""LYING"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me confirm the feedback for ""sling"" in the context of ""LYING"":

- ""sling"": S (x) -> not in word -> correct because ""LYING"" has no S.
- L (-) -> L is in the word but not in position 2 -> correct, because in ""LYING"" L is in position 1.
- I (✓) -> correct position -> matches.
- N (✓) -> correct position -> matches.
- G (✓) -> correct position -> matches.

Perfect.

So the word should be ""LYING"".

But we have to make sure that Y is not excluded. We haven't used Y before, and it's not in the excluded list.

Therefore, we can guess ""LYING"".

But note: we are only on the fourth guess, and we have two more if needed, but this seems to be the only possibility.

Alternatively, we might consider ""DEIGN"" but that is D-E-I-G-N -> E excluded and pattern is not matching (we need I in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th, but ""DEIGN"" has E in 2nd? D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5) -> no, doesn't match.

""REIGN"": R and E excluded.

So I think ""LYING"" is the answer.

But to be thorough, are there any other words?

- ""HYING"": H-Y-I-N-G -> but ""HYING"" is a word (archaic present participle of ""hie""). However, H is not excluded. But then the first letter would be H, but we think it must be L? No, we have L in the word. In ""HYING"", there is no L. But the feedback says L is in the word. So ""HYING"" cannot be because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, ""TYING"": T is excluded.

""DYING"": D-Y-I-N-G -> but again, no L. But we know L is in the word.

So only ""LYING"" has L and fits the pattern.

Therefore, we guess ""LYING"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - N is in the secret word and in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: point** → P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - I is in the secret word and in the 3rd position.  
  - P, O, T are absent.  

- **Guess 3: sling** → S(x), L(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - G is in the secret word and in the 5th position.  
  - L is present but not in the 2nd position.  
  - S is absent.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is: `_ _ I N G` (3rd: I, 4th: N, 5th: G).  
- L is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from ""sling"" feedback). Since positions 3–5 are fixed, L must be in position 1.  
  - Thus, the pattern is now: `L _ I N G`.  
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): C, R, A, E, P, O, T, S.  
- The only unknown is the 2nd letter, which must be a letter not excluded and not used in incorrect positions (available: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

### Analysis for Position 2:
- The word must be a valid English word matching `L _ I N G`.  
- Common options:  
  - **LYING**: L-Y-I-N-G (valid word, meaning present participle of ""lie"").  
  - Other possibilities like ""LOVING"" (O excluded), ""LIVING"" (6 letters), ""LAVING"" (A excluded), or ""LOGIN"" (O excluded) are invalid.  
- ""LYING"" fits all constraints:  
  - Y is not excluded.  
  - Confirms L in position 1 (not position 2).  
  - Matches known positions (I in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th).  

### Conclusion:
""LYING"" is the only common word that satisfies all feedback. This guess will confirm if the secret word is ""LYING"" or provide further clues if incorrect.",Guess 4: lying -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
