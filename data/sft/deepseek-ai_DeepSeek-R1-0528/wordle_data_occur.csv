We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: '-' meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the word.
- N: 'x' meaning N is not in the word.
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the word.

Key information:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
- Since C and R are present but in the wrong positions, they must be in different positions in the secret word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include both C and R (since they are in the word).
2. Avoid A, N, and E.
3. We want to test other common letters to cover more ground.

Positions matter:
- In ""crane"", C was in position 1, R in position 2. Since they are misplaced, in the secret word:
  - C cannot be in position 1.
  - R cannot be in position 2.

We have 6 tries. We are on our second try.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes C and R (and not A, N, E). We can use other vowels if needed (like I, O, U) or consonants.

Considering common words:

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words like ""curly"", ""crisp"", ""crocs"", ""crops"", etc. But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Since A, N, E are out, we can focus on other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

List potential words:
- ""curly"": C at position 1 (but feedback said C is misplaced and was in position 1, so C should not be in position 1). So avoid C in position 1.
- Therefore, we should place C in a different position (2,3,4, or5) and similarly R not in position 2.

We can try words where C is after the first position.

Examples:
- ""scare"" -> but has A and E which are out -> invalid.
- ""price"": P, R, I, C, E -> but E is eliminated -> avoid.
- ""prick"": P, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E? Let's check: contains P,R,I,C,K. No A,N,E. But we must consider positions.

Let me check ""prick"":
- C is in position 4, R in position 2? 
  - In ""prick"": P(position1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)
  - We know from feedback that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (so position 4 might be okay), and R is not in position 2 (so having R in position2 is bad?).

Wait: our first guess had R in position2 and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has R, but not in position2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R in position2, it might still be wrong (if the secret word doesn't have it there) and we might get a '-', but we know it's wrong? Actually, no, the secret word doesn't have R in position2, so if we put it in position2 again, we'd get '-' again? But we want to try R in a new position to find the correct one.

Similarly for C, avoid position1.

So, we should avoid placing R in position2 and C in position1.

In ""prick"":
- R is in position2 -> avoid because we know R is not in position2? Actually, yes, since in the first guess at position2 it was misplaced, so position2 is wrong for R. So we must not put R in position2 in our next guess? Actually, we are allowed to, but it would be inefficient because we know it's wrong. We should put R in a different position.

Therefore, avoid R in position2 and C in position1.

Consider words with R and C in different positions.

Examples:
- ""crony"" but C is in position1 -> avoid C in position1 -> not good.
- ""rocky"": R at position1? But R in ""crane"" was at position2 which was wrong, but position1 might be okay. Also, ""rocky"" has O, C, K, Y. But C is at position2? And rocky: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - But we know R wasn't in position2 in the secret, but position1 is new. And C is in position3 (avoided position1).

But is O and Y okay? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can try ""crops"": but C in position1 -> avoid.

Better words: how about ""cores""? but E is out -> invalid.

Another idea: ""royce"" -> E is out? And C at the end? ""Royce"" has E -> invalid.

Maybe ""crisp"": C is at position1 -> avoid.

What about ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). But N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": too short? Needs 5 letters.

""court"": C at position2. And U? But no R? We need R.

We need both C and R.

Consider: ""cruel"" -> has E -> invalid.
""crumb"" -> has U, M, B. No A,N,E? But U is untested. But also, positions: C(1) -> we must avoid C in position1 -> ""crumb"" has C in position1 -> invalid.

How about ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- C is in position4 (not position1), R is in position3 (not position2). No A, N, E.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - same pattern.

But we should also try to include more of the common letters? We have tested none of O, U, etc.

Since we know the word has C and R, and excludes A, N, E, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? We need to test vowels: I, O, U are still possibilities.

Both ""porch"" and ""torch"" use O and have positions: R at 3, C at 4.

But note: in ""crane"", R was at position2 and C at position1. Now we are trying R at position3 and C at position4. That is two new positions for both letters.

Also, we introduce O and two new consonants (P and H for ""porch"", T and H for ""torch"").

Another common starting strategy is to use words with more vowels? But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.

We can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R? So without R, we can't verify R's position.

We must include both C and R.

Another word: ""crier"": has E -> invalid? c-r-i-e-r -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""curry"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""curio"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""crowd"": C at position1 -> avoid.

After some thought, a word with R at start and C in middle? But R: we don't know if it can be at position1 because in first guess it was at position2 only. Similarly, we avoid C at position1.

So let me try ""rocky"": R at position1 and O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). R in position1 is new (not position2). C in position3. And we get to test O, K, Y. No A,N,E.

But R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don't know.

Similarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be '-' and we wouldn't get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.

Therefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.

We can do ""rocky"" but note that it's a valid word? I think so.

Another option: ""crypt"": C at1 -> avoid? ""crypt"" has C at1 -> invalid.

""cramp"": C at1 and A -> invalid.

Why not ""troop"": no C -> doesn't contain C.

We need a word that includes both C and R.

List: 
- ""crook"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""brock"": B(1), R(2) -> R at2? but position2 is known wrong -> avoid R at2.
- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.

I think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.

Also consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.

""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.

Also, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.

Wait, we must include R.

How about ""curch""? Not a common word.

""bicep"": no R.

After searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.

But wait, let's think about ""rocky"" again: 
- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don't know.

But R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.

But what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.

But hold on: the feedback for C was '-' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.

Comparing:
- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.
- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.

Which one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.

But we don't know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.

Since we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.

Another candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.

""price"": has E -> invalid.

Perhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We'd get '-' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.

So avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.

Therefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.

""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 

So ""lurch"" seems valid.

Now, what to choose? 

We have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.

We should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.

In ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).
In ""torch"", we test O.
In ""lurch"", we test U.

Let me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.

""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.

""chirp"": no R? Wait.

I think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.

Thus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.

But we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don't know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don't know.

The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate? So maybe?

But in ""rocky"", no duplicates.

Similarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".

I choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".

Let me pick ""torch"":

User asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.

So we'll guess ""torch"".

But let's confirm: 
- T: not tested? no problem.
- O: new vowel.
- R: at position3 (avoided position2)
- C: at position4 (avoided position1)
- H: new.

A valid guess.

Alternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? 

So the guess is ""torch"".

But wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something? We don't know.

Final choice: ""torch"".

In the next step, the feedback will tell us.

I'll proceed with ""torch"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (now placed in position 4 for testing).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (now placed in position 3 for testing).
- A, N, and E are not in the word, so they are excluded.
- The new guess includes other common letters (T, O, H) and avoids repeated positions for C and R.

The guess ""torch"" tests these conditions efficiently.

<guess>torch</guess>",...,"We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: '-' meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.

- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.

I think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.

Also consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.

""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.

Also, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.

Wait, we must include R.

How about ""curch""? Not a common word.

""bicep"": no R.

After searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.

But wait, let's think about ""rocky"" again: 
- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don't know.

But R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.

But what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.

But hold on: the feedback for C was '-' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.

Comparing:
- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.
- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.

Which one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.

But we don't know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.

Since we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.

Another candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.

""price"": has E -> invalid.

Perhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We'd get '-' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.

So avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.

Therefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.

""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 

So ""lurch"" seems valid.

Now, what to choose? 

We have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.

We should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.

In ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).
In ""torch"", we test O.
In ""lurch"", we test U.

Let me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.

""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.

""chirp"": no R? Wait.

I think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.

Thus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.

But we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don't know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don't know.

The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate? So maybe?

But in ""rocky"", no duplicates.

Similarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".

I choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".

Let me pick ""torch"":

User asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.

So we'll guess ""torch"".

But let's confirm: 
- T: not tested? no problem.
- O: new vowel.
- R: at position3 (avoided position2)
- C: at position4 (avoided position1)
- H: new.

A valid guess.

Alternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? 

So the guess is ""torch"".

But wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something? We don't know.

Final choice: ""torch"".

In the next step, the feedback will tell us.

I'll proceed with ""torch"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (now placed in position 4 for testing).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (now placed in position 3 for testing).
- A, N, and E are not in the word, so they are excluded.
- The new guess includes other common letters (T, O, H) and avoids repeated positions for C and R.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: '-' meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the word.
- N: 'x' meaning N is not in the word.
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the word.

Key information:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
- Since C and R are present but in the wrong positions, they must be in different positions in the secret word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include both C and R (since they are in the word).
2. Avoid A, N, and E.
3. We want to test other common letters to cover more ground.

Positions matter:
- In ""crane"", C was in position 1, R in position 2. Since they are misplaced, in the secret word:
  - C cannot be in position 1.
  - R cannot be in position 2.

We have 6 tries. We are on our second try.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes C and R (and not A, N, E). We can use other vowels if needed (like I, O, U) or consonants.

Considering common words:

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words like ""curly"", ""crisp"", ""crocs"", ""crops"", etc. But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Since A, N, E are out, we can focus on other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

List potential words:
- ""curly"": C at position 1 (but feedback said C is misplaced and was in position 1, so C should not be in position 1). So avoid C in position 1.
- Therefore, we should place C in a different position (2,3,4, or5) and similarly R not in position 2.

We can try words where C is after the first position.

Examples:
- ""scare"" -> but has A and E which are out -> invalid.
- ""price"": P, R, I, C, E -> but E is eliminated -> avoid.
- ""prick"": P, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E? Let's check: contains P,R,I,C,K. No A,N,E. But we must consider positions.

Let me check ""prick"":
- C is in position 4, R in position 2? 
  - In ""prick"": P(position1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)
  - We know from feedback that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (so position 4 might be okay), and R is not in position 2 (so having R in position2 is bad?).

Wait: our first guess had R in position2 and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has R, but not in position2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R in position2, it might still be wrong (if the secret word doesn't have it there) and we might get a '-', but we know it's wrong? Actually, no, the secret word doesn't have R in position2, so if we put it in position2 again, we'd get '-' again? But we want to try R in a new position to find the correct one.

Similarly for C, avoid position1.

So, we should avoid placing R in position2 and C in position1.

In ""prick"":
- R is in position2 -> avoid because we know R is not in position2? Actually, yes, since in the first guess at position2 it was misplaced, so position2 is wrong for R. So we must not put R in position2 in our next guess? Actually, we are allowed to, but it would be inefficient because we know it's wrong. We should put R in a different position.

Therefore, avoid R in position2 and C in position1.

Consider words with R and C in different positions.

Examples:
- ""crony"" but C is in position1 -> avoid C in position1 -> not good.
- ""rocky"": R at position1? But R in ""crane"" was at position2 which was wrong, but position1 might be okay. Also, ""rocky"" has O, C, K, Y. But C is at position2? And rocky: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - But we know R wasn't in position2 in the secret, but position1 is new. And C is in position3 (avoided position1).

But is O and Y okay? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can try ""crops"": but C in position1 -> avoid.

Better words: how about ""cores""? but E is out -> invalid.

Another idea: ""royce"" -> E is out? And C at the end? ""Royce"" has E -> invalid.

Maybe ""crisp"": C is at position1 -> avoid.

What about ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). But N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": too short? Needs 5 letters.

""court"": C at position2. And U? But no R? We need R.

We need both C and R.

Consider: ""cruel"" -> has E -> invalid.
""crumb"" -> has U, M, B. No A,N,E? But U is untested. But also, positions: C(1) -> we must avoid C in position1 -> ""crumb"" has C in position1 -> invalid.

How about ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- C is in position4 (not position1), R is in position3 (not position2). No A, N, E.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - same pattern.

But we should also try to include more of the common letters? We have tested none of O, U, etc.

Since we know the word has C and R, and excludes A, N, E, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? We need to test vowels: I, O, U are still possibilities.

Both ""porch"" and ""torch"" use O and have positions: R at 3, C at 4.

But note: in ""crane"", R was at position2 and C at position1. Now we are trying R at position3 and C at position4. That is two new positions for both letters.

Also, we introduce O and two new consonants (P and H for ""porch"", T and H for ""torch"").

Another common starting strategy is to use words with more vowels? But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.

We can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R? So without R, we can't verify R's position.

We must include both C and R.

Another word: ""crier"": has E -> invalid? c-r-i-e-r -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""curry"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""curio"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""crowd"": C at position1 -> avoid.

After some thought, a word with R at start and C in middle? But R: we don't know if it can be at position1 because in first guess it was at position2 only. Similarly, we avoid C at position1.

So let me try ""rocky"": R at position1 and O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). R in position1 is new (not position2). C in position3. And we get to test O, K, Y. No A,N,E.

But R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don't know.

Similarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be '-' and we wouldn't get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.

Therefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.

We can do ""rocky"" but note that it's a valid word? I think so.

Another option: ""crypt"": C at1 -> avoid? ""crypt"" has C at1 -> invalid.

""cramp"": C at1 and A -> invalid.

Why not ""troop"": no C -> doesn't contain C.

We need a word that includes both C and R.

List: 
- ""crook"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""brock"": B(1), R(2) -> R at2? but position2 is known wrong -> avoid R at2.
- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.

I think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.

Also consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.

""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.

Also, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.

Wait, we must include R.

How about ""curch""? Not a common word.

""bicep"": no R.

After searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.

But wait, let's think about ""rocky"" again: 
- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don't know.

But R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.

But what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.

But hold on: the feedback for C was '-' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.

Comparing:
- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.
- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.

Which one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.

But we don't know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.

Since we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.

Another candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.

""price"": has E -> invalid.

Perhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We'd get '-' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.

So avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.

Therefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.

""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 

So ""lurch"" seems valid.

Now, what to choose? 

We have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.

We should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.

In ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).
In ""torch"", we test O.
In ""lurch"", we test U.

Let me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.

""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.

""chirp"": no R? Wait.

I think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.

Thus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.

But we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don't know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don't know.

The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate? So maybe?

But in ""rocky"", no duplicates.

Similarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".

I choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".

Let me pick ""torch"":

User asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.

So we'll guess ""torch"".

But let's confirm: 
- T: not tested? no problem.
- O: new vowel.
- R: at position3 (avoided position2)
- C: at position4 (avoided position1)
- H: new.

A valid guess.

Alternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? 

So the guess is ""torch"".

But wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something? We don't know.

Final choice: ""torch"".

In the next step, the feedback will tell us.

I'll proceed with ""torch"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (now placed in position 4 for testing).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (now placed in position 3 for testing).
- A, N, and E are not in the word, so they are excluded.
- The new guess includes other common letters (T, O, H) and avoids repeated positions for C and R.

The guess ""torch"" tests these conditions efficiently.

But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.\n\nWe can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R?

No A,N,E.\n\nBut R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said \'-\' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be \'-\' and we wouldn\'t get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.\n\nTherefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.\n\nWe can do ""rocky"" but note that it\'s a valid word?

- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (guessed in position 2 and misplaced).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains C and R.
- It does not contain A, N, E.
- C is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

We are making the second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes C and R (since they are in the word).
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Places C in a position other than 1 (positions 2,3,4,5).
- Places R in a position other than 2 (positions 1,3,4,5).

We should also aim to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible letters to use: Since A,N,E are out, we have vowels: I, O, U, and consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and avoiding previously eliminated letters.

  - C is at position 4 (not 1) -> valid.
  - Letters: T, O, R, C, H - all new except R and C, which we must include.

- ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - similar.

- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5)
  - But note: R is at position 1? That's allowed since we only know position 2 is wrong for R. However, we are placing R at a new position (1) which is good for testing.
  - C is at position 3 (not 1) - ok.

Choosing ""rocky"" has R at position 1, but it uses the letter O and Y, which may be useful.

However, let's stick with ""torch"" for the second guess because:

Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and R are in the secret word but in incorrect positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2).
- A, N, and E are not in the word.
- The new guess must include C and R, avoid A/N/E, and test C/R in new positions.

For the second guess, ""torch"" is chosen because:
- It places C in position 4 (avoiding position 1) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, H.
- It avoids eliminated letters (A/N/E).

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: '-' meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the word.
- N: 'x' meaning N is not in the word.
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the word.

Key information:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
- Since C and R are present but in the wrong positions, they must be in different positions in the secret word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include both C and R (since they are in the word).
2. Avoid A, N, and E.
3. We want to test other common letters to cover more ground.

Positions matter:
- In ""crane"", C was in position 1, R in position 2. Since they are misplaced, in the secret word:
  - C cannot be in position 1.
  - R cannot be in position 2.

We have 6 tries. We are on our second try.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes C and R (and not A, N, E). We can use other vowels if needed (like I, O, U) or consonants.

Considering common words:

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words like ""curly"", ""crisp"", ""crocs"", ""crops"", etc. But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Since A, N, E are out, we can focus on other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

List potential words:
- ""curly"": C at position 1 (but feedback said C is misplaced and was in position 1, so C should not be in position 1). So avoid C in position 1.
- Therefore, we should place C in a different position (2,3,4, or5) and similarly R not in position 2.

We can try words where C is after the first position.

Examples:
- ""scare"" -> but has A and E which are out -> invalid.
- ""price"": P, R, I, C, E -> but E is eliminated -> avoid.
- ""prick"": P, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E? Let's check: contains P,R,I,C,K. No A,N,E. But we must consider positions.

Let me check ""prick"":
- C is in position 4, R in position 2? 
  - In ""prick"": P(position1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)
  - We know from feedback that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (so position 4 might be okay), and R is not in position 2 (so having R in position2 is bad?).

Wait: our first guess had R in position2 and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has R, but not in position2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R in position2, it might still be wrong (if the secret word doesn't have it there) and we might get a '-', but we know it's wrong? Actually, no, the secret word doesn't have R in position2, so if we put it in position2 again, we'd get '-' again? But we want to try R in a new position to find the correct one.

Similarly for C, avoid position1.

So, we should avoid placing R in position2 and C in position1.

In ""prick"":
- R is in position2 -> avoid because we know R is not in position2? Actually, yes, since in the first guess at position2 it was misplaced, so position2 is wrong for R. So we must not put R in position2 in our next guess? Actually, we are allowed to, but it would be inefficient because we know it's wrong. We should put R in a different position.

Therefore, avoid R in position2 and C in position1.

Consider words with R and C in different positions.

Examples:
- ""crony"" but C is in position1 -> avoid C in position1 -> not good.
- ""rocky"": R at position1? But R in ""crane"" was at position2 which was wrong, but position1 might be okay. Also, ""rocky"" has O, C, K, Y. But C is at position2? And rocky: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - But we know R wasn't in position2 in the secret, but position1 is new. And C is in position3 (avoided position1).

But is O and Y okay? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can try ""crops"": but C in position1 -> avoid.

Better words: how about ""cores""? but E is out -> invalid.

Another idea: ""royce"" -> E is out? And C at the end? ""Royce"" has E -> invalid.

Maybe ""crisp"": C is at position1 -> avoid.

What about ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). But N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": too short? Needs 5 letters.

""court"": C at position2. And U? But no R? We need R.

We need both C and R.

Consider: ""cruel"" -> has E -> invalid.
""crumb"" -> has U, M, B. No A,N,E? But U is untested. But also, positions: C(1) -> we must avoid C in position1 -> ""crumb"" has C in position1 -> invalid.

How about ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- C is in position4 (not position1), R is in position3 (not position2). No A, N, E.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - same pattern.

But we should also try to include more of the common letters? We have tested none of O, U, etc.

Since we know the word has C and R, and excludes A, N, E, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? We need to test vowels: I, O, U are still possibilities.

Both ""porch"" and ""torch"" use O and have positions: R at 3, C at 4.

But note: in ""crane"", R was at position2 and C at position1. Now we are trying R at position3 and C at position4. That is two new positions for both letters.

Also, we introduce O and two new consonants (P and H for ""porch"", T and H for ""torch"").

Another common starting strategy is to use words with more vowels? But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.

We can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R? So without R, we can't verify R's position.

We must include both C and R.

Another word: ""crier"": has E -> invalid? c-r-i-e-r -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""curry"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""curio"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""crowd"": C at position1 -> avoid.

After some thought, a word with R at start and C in middle? But R: we don't know if it can be at position1 because in first guess it was at position2 only. Similarly, we avoid C at position1.

So let me try ""rocky"": R at position1 and O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). R in position1 is new (not position2). C in position3. And we get to test O, K, Y. No A,N,E.

But R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don't know.

Similarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be '-' and we wouldn't get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.

Therefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.

We can do ""rocky"" but note that it's a valid word? I think so.

Another option: ""crypt"": C at1 -> avoid? ""crypt"" has C at1 -> invalid.

""cramp"": C at1 and A -> invalid.

Why not ""troop"": no C -> doesn't contain C.

We need a word that includes both C and R.

List: 
- ""crook"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""brock"": B(1), R(2) -> R at2? but position2 is known wrong -> avoid R at2.
- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.

I think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.

Also consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.

""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.

Also, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.

Wait, we must include R.

How about ""curch""? Not a common word.

""bicep"": no R.

After searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.

But wait, let's think about ""rocky"" again: 
- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don't know.

But R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.

But what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.

But hold on: the feedback for C was '-' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.

Comparing:
- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.
- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.

Which one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.

But we don't know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.

Since we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.

Another candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.

""price"": has E -> invalid.

Perhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We'd get '-' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.

So avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.

Therefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.

""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 

So ""lurch"" seems valid.

Now, what to choose? 

We have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.

We should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.

In ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).
In ""torch"", we test O.
In ""lurch"", we test U.

Let me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.

""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.

""chirp"": no R? Wait.

I think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.

Thus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.

But we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don't know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don't know.

The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate? So maybe?

But in ""rocky"", no duplicates.

Similarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".

I choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".

Let me pick ""torch"":

User asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.

So we'll guess ""torch"".

But let's confirm: 
- T: not tested? no problem.
- O: new vowel.
- R: at position3 (avoided position2)
- C: at position4 (avoided position1)
- H: new.

A valid guess.

Alternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? 

So the guess is ""torch"".

But wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something? We don't know.

Final choice: ""torch"".

In the next step, the feedback will tell us.

I'll proceed with ""torch"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (now placed in position 4 for testing).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (now placed in position 3 for testing).
- A, N, and E are not in the word, so they are excluded.
- The new guess includes other common letters (T, O, H) and avoids repeated positions for C and R.

The guess ""torch"" tests these conditions efficiently.

<guess>...</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ... -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 1: crane -> C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and is misplaced).
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (guessed in position 2 and misplaced).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains C and R.
- It does not contain A, N, E.
- C is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

We are making the second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes C and R (since they are in the word).
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Places C in a position other than 1 (positions 2,3,4,5).
- Places R in a position other than 2 (positions 1,3,4,5).

We should also aim to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible letters to use: Since A,N,E are out, we have vowels: I, O, U, and consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and avoiding previously eliminated letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)
  - R is at position 3 (not 2) -> valid.
  - C is at position 4 (not 1) -> valid.
  - Letters: T, O, R, C, H - all new except R and C, which we must include.

- ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - similar.

- ""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - tests U.

- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5)
  - But note: R is at position 1? That's allowed since we only know position 2 is wrong for R. However, we are placing R at a new position (1) which is good for testing.
  - C is at position 3 (not 1) - ok.

Choosing ""rocky"" has R at position 1, but it uses the letter O and Y, which may be useful.

However, let's stick with ""torch"" for the second guess because:
- It tests R at position 3 and C at position 4, which are new positions.
- It introduces T, O, H, which are common letters.

Therefore, I choose ""torch"".

Response:
<guess>torch</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and R are in the secret word but in incorrect positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2).
- A, N, and E are not in the word.
- The new guess must include C and R, avoid A/N/E, and test C/R in new positions.

For the second guess, ""torch"" is chosen because:
- It places C in position 4 (avoiding position 1) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, H.
- It avoids eliminated letters (A/N/E).

This maximizes information gain about the word and letter positions.

We can use other vowels if needed (like I, O, U) or consonants.\n\nConsidering common words:\n\nLet\'s think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Words like ""curly"", ""crisp"", ""crocs"", ""crops"", etc. But we must avoid using eliminated letters.\n\nSince A, N, E are out, we can focus on other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nAlso, note that the word must be 5 letters.\n\nList potential words:\n- ""curly"": C at position 1 (but feedback said C is misplaced and was in position 1, so C should not be in position 1). So avoid C in position 1.\n- Therefore, we should place C in a different position (2,3,4, or5) and similarly R not in position 2.\n\nWe can try words where C is after the first position.\n\nExamples:\n- ""scare"" -> but has A and E which are out -> invalid.\n- ""price"": P, R, I, C, E -> but E is eliminated -> avoid.\n- ""prick"": P, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E? Let\'s check: contains P,R,I,C,K. No A,N,E. But we must consider positions.\n\nLet me check ""prick"":\n- C is in position 4, R in position 2? \n  - In ""prick"": P(position1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)\n  - We know from feedback that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (so position 4 might be okay), and R is not in position 2 (so having R in position2 is bad?).\n\nWait: our first guess had R in position2 and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has R, but not in position2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R in position2, it might still be wrong (if the secret word doesn\'t have it there) and we might get a \'-\', but we know it\'s wrong? Actually, no, the secret word doesn\'t have R in position2, so if we put it in position2 again, we\'d get \'-\' again? But we want to try R in a new position to find the correct one.\n\nSimilarly for C, avoid position1.\n\nSo, we should avoid placing R in position2 and C in position1.\n\nIn ""prick"":\n- R is in position2 -> avoid because we know R is not in position2? Actually, yes, since in the first guess at position2 it was misplaced, so position2 is wrong for R. So we must not put R in position2 in our next guess? Actually, we are allowed to, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s wrong. We should put R in a different position.\n\nTherefore, avoid R in position2 and C in position1.\n\nConsider words with R and C in different positions.\n\nExamples:\n- ""crony"" but C is in position1 -> avoid C in position1 -> not good.\n- ""rocky"": R at position1? But R in ""crane"" was at position2 which was wrong, but position1 might be okay. Also, ""rocky"" has O, C, K, Y. But C is at position2? And rocky: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). \n  - But we know R wasn\'t in position2 in the secret, but position1 is new. And C is in position3 (avoided position1).\n\nBut is O and Y okay? We don\'t know yet.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""crops"": but C in position1 -> avoid.\n\nBetter words: how about ""cores""? but E is out -> invalid.\n\nAnother idea: ""royce"" -> E is out? And C at the end? ""Royce"" has E -> invalid.\n\nMaybe ""crisp"": C is at position1 -> avoid.\n\nWhat about ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). But N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""score"": too short? Needs 5 letters.\n\n""court"": C at position2. And U? But no R? We need R.\n\nWe need both C and R.\n\nConsider: ""cruel"" -> has E -> invalid.\n""crumb"" -> has U, M, B. No A,N,E? But U is untested. But also, positions: C(1) -> we must avoid C in position1 -> ""crumb"" has C in position1 -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). \n- C is in position4 (not position1), R is in position3 (not position2). No A, N, E.\n\nThis seems acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - same pattern.\n\nBut we should also try to include more of the common letters? We have tested none of O, U, etc.\n\nSince we know the word has C and R, and excludes A, N, E, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? We need to test vowels: I, O, U are still possibilities.\n\nBoth ""porch"" and ""torch"" use O and have positions: R at 3, C at 4.\n\nBut note: in ""crane"", R was at position2 and C at position1. Now we are trying R at position3 and C at position4. That is two new positions for both letters.\n\nAlso, we introduce O and two new consonants (P and H for ""porch"", T and H for ""torch"").\n\nAnother common starting strategy is to use words with more vowels? But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.\n\nWe can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R? So without R, we can\'t verify R\'s position.\n\nWe must include both C and R.\n\nAnother word: ""crier"": has E -> invalid? c-r-i-e-r -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""curry"": C at position1 -> avoid.\n\n""curio"": C at position1 -> avoid.\n\n""crowd"": C at position1 -> avoid.\n\nAfter some thought, a word with R at start and C in middle? But R: we don\'t know if it can be at position1 because in first guess it was at position2 only. Similarly, we avoid C at position1.\n\nSo let me try ""rocky"": R at position1 and O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). R in position1 is new (not position2). C in position3. And we get to test O, K, Y. No A,N,E.\n\nBut R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said \'-\' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be \'-\' and we wouldn\'t get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.\n\nTherefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.\n\nWe can do ""rocky"" but note that it\'s a valid word? I think so.\n\nAnother option: ""crypt"": C at1 -> avoid? ""crypt"" has C at1 -> invalid.\n\n""cramp"": C at1 and A -> invalid.\n\nWhy not ""troop"": no C -> doesn\'t contain C.\n\nWe need a word that includes both C and R.\n\nList: \n- ""crook"": C at1 -> avoid.\n- ""brock"": B(1), R(2) -> R at2? but position2 is known wrong -> avoid R at2.\n- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.\n- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.\n\nI think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.\n\nAlso consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.\n\n""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.\n\nAlso, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.\n\nWait, we must include R.\n\nHow about ""curch""? Not a common word.\n\n""bicep"": no R.\n\nAfter searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.\n\nBut wait, let\'s think about ""rocky"" again: \n- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don\'t know.\n\nBut R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.\n\nBut what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.\n\nBut hold on: the feedback for C was \'-\' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.\n\nComparing:\n- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.\n- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.\n\nWhich one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.\n\nBut we don\'t know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.\n\nSince we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.\n\n""force"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""price"": has E -> invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We\'d get \'-\' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.\n\nSo avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.\n\nTherefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.\n\n""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). \n\nSo ""lurch"" seems valid.\n\nNow, what to choose? \n\nWe have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.\n\nWe should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.\n\nIn ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).\nIn ""torch"", we test O.\nIn ""lurch"", we test U.\n\nLet me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.\n\n""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.\n\n""chirp"": no R? Wait.\n\nI think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.\n\nThus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.\n\nBut we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don\'t know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don\'t know.\n\nThe feedback didn\'t say anything about duplicate? So maybe?\n\nBut in ""rocky"", no duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".\n\nI choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".\n\nLet me pick ""torch"":\n\nUser asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""torch"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- T: not tested? no problem.\n- O: new vowel.\n- R: at position3 (avoided position2)\n- C: at position4 (avoided position1)\n- H: new.\n\nA valid guess.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? \n\nSo the guess is ""torch"".\n\nBut wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something?

We are on Guess 3, with previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: torch -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) R(-) C(-) H(x)

Let's interpret the feedback:

From Guess 1:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A, N, and E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (torch):
- T: x -> T is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- R: - -> R is in the word, but not in position 3. (Note: in torch, R is at position 3, so secret word has R, but not there)
- C: - -> C is in the word, but not in position 4. (In torch, C is at position 4)
- H: x -> H is not in the word.

So, combining:

Known letters in the word: C, R, O (and we know they are in the word from both guesses).

Known absent letters: A, N, E, T, H.

We have constraints on positions:

- For C: 
  - From guess 1: not position 1.
  - From guess 2: not position 4.
  - Also, from guess 1, it was at position 1 and got -, so C must be in positions 2,3, or 5? But we only know it's not 1 and not 4.

- For R:
  - From guess 1: not position 2.
  - From guess 2: not position 3.
  - So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

- For O:
  - From guess 2: not position 2.
  - So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

Also, there are two more letters to be found (since we have a 5-letter word with C, R, O and two others). The total distinct letters we have so far: C, R, O. But note secret word might have duplicates? Possible, but until we see feedback about duplicates, we assume not? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? For instance, if there are two Rs, but we haven't seen that. So far we don't have indication of duplicates.

Now, we know the word contains at least three distinct letters: C, R, O.

But there are five positions, so two more letters. Since A,N,E,T,H are out, we need to pick from the remaining letters.

We are missing two letters? And we have to form a word.

Recall: from guess 1, we tried positions: crane: C(1), R(2), and that was wrong. Now, for R, it cannot be at positions 2 or 3. For C, not 1 or 4.

Also, from guess 2: torch: T(1) not in word, O(2) is in word but wrong position, R(3) wrong position, C(4) wrong position, H(5) not in word.

So, O is not at position 2.

Now, we need to form a word that includes C, R, O, and two other letters that are not A,N,E,T,H.

And meet position constraints:

- R must be at one of: 1,4,5
- C must be at one of: 2,3, or maybe 5? But positions 1,4 are forbidden.

Possible positions for C: 2,3,5
For R: 1,4,5

But note: position 5 cannot have both, so they can't both be at 5? Unless duplicate? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Since we haven't seen any indication.

We should consider words that have C, R, O and two other letters.

Also, avoid positions that are forbidden for each.

List possible words:

First, think of common words with C,R,O.

Examples: ""crowd"", ""crock"", ""crony"", ""micro"", ""crook"", etc.

But check:

- ""crowd"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), D(5) 
  - But C at position 1: forbidden? From guess1, C cannot be at 1. So no.
  - Also, R at position2: forbidden? From guess1, R cannot be at2? Yes, from guess1 (R was at2 and wrong). So definitely not.

- ""crock"": C(1), R(2), O(3), C(4) -> duplicate C? But also C at1 forbidden and R at2 forbidden? So no.

- ""crony"": C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> N is eliminated? From guess1, N is not in word -> invalid.

- ""micro"": M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5) 
  - Now, C at position3: which is allowed (only forbidden positions for C:1 and4, so 3 is ok).
  - R at position4: for R, we allowed positions 1,4,5? So 4 is ok.
  - O at position5: but for O, we don't have a position constraint? Except it cannot be at2? And here it's at5, which is fine.
  - Letters: M,I,C,R,O -> M and I are new? And not eliminated.
  - Eliminated letters: A,N,E,T,H — M,I are not in that list? So they are possible.

But we also have to check for O? We know O is in the word. Also, we haven't tested M and I before? So yes.

But is ""micro"" a word? Yes, as in microcomputer.

Let's see positions more carefully:

- R is at position4: which is allowed? R forbidden positions: from guess1 not2, from guess2 not3? So position4 is new? Yes.

- C is at position3: allowed? Not1, not4? So yes.

Another word: ""ocrra"" — not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid.

""occur"": has U? But double C? And R? ""occur"" is O,C,C,U,R -> duplicate C? Not efficient? But also, U is not eliminated? However, O at position1: possible? And C at position2: which for C? Position2 is allowed? Yes, because C forbidden positions: not1 and not4? Position2 is ok? But wait: we have C at position2? In this word? ""occur"": O(1), C(2), C(3), U(4), R(5). So one C at position2 and one at3? But we don't know about duplicates. However, let's avoid for now.

Back to ""micro"": seems good.

Another candidate: ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": 4 letters? No.

""corps"": C(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), S(5) -> C at position1: forbidden? Yes -> invalid.

""porch"": we already guessed? Not exactly, but we considered.

In guess2 we guessed torch? But not porch.

But let me check ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)
- O at position2: but from guess2, O is not at position2? We know O is not at position2? In torch? Feedback: O(-) meaning O is in word but not position2. So putting O at position2 again would be redundant? And we can avoid that.

But note: the feedback doesn't say the position is wrong for O only in that instance? It means in the secret word, O is not at position2? Exactly, so we should not put O at position2 in any guess? Because we know it's wrong? So avoid O at position2.

Therefore, for any new guess, we must avoid:
- Putting C at pos1 or pos4
- Putting R at pos2 or pos3
- Putting O at pos2

And the word must contain C,R,O, and not contain A,N,E,T,H.

In ""micro"": 
- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5)
- C at3: ok
- R at4: ok
- O at5: ok (not at2)
- O is at position5? Yes.

Now, are there other constraints? 

We might consider the possibility that O is in a position we haven't tested? But with ""micro"" we test O at position5.

Another word? For example, ""clock"": C at1 -> forbidden.

""crisp"": C at1 -> no.

Let's find words where C is at position2,3, or5; R at1,4,5; O not at2 and in one of 1,3,4,5.

For example:
- Position for R: let's say position4? Then C could be at position2,3, or5? But we have to use O somewhere else.

""micro"" is one.

""crowd"": already discarded? Because C and R at wrong positions? That is, crow: C1 R2 -> forbidden positions.

If R is at position5? For example, ""macro"": M(1), A? A eliminated -> invalid.

What about ""minor"": but N, O? N eliminated? And no C? And has N -> invalid.

Another word: ""virus"": has V,I,R,U,S? But no C? We must have C.

We need C,R,O.

Perhaps ""crois"": not common? And O at4? But it might be spelled ""crois""? Maybe not.

""curio"": C at1 -> forbidden? C at1, no.

""orcic"": not a word.

I think ""micro"" is a good candidate.

But another common word? ""porch"" might be revisited? ""porch"": P(1), O(2) but O at position2? Forbidden! We know O not at position2.

So if we guess ""porch"", we will get O(-) meaning it's not there? But we know O is in the word? So we would waste a slot? Therefore, avoid O at position2.

Similarly, what if we put O at another position?

""croup"": C(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> C at1 forbidden, R at2 forbidden.

""group"": G(1), R(2) -> R at2 forbidden.

""brook"": no C.

""crock"": C1 R2 -> invalid.

So other option: ""covert"": but has E? Invalid.

Actually, ""motor"": M(1), O(2) -> O at2 forbidden? And no C? Has T? But T eliminated? And O at2 is bad? Also no C.

Perhaps ""color"": double O? And C at1 -> invalid.

So ""micro"" seems solid.

Let me confirm:
- M: not eliminated? Eliminated: A, N, E, T, H -> so M is ok.
- I: not eliminated? Ok.
- C: at pos3 -> allowed, and we know C is in the word.
- R: at pos4 -> allowed positions: we allowed 1,4,5? Yes, pos4.
- O: at pos5 -> allowed? Yes? And we know O is in the word.

Also, we haven't tested M or I? So feedback will give us new information.

But we are not sure? There might be better words.

Another candidate: ""civic"": has C at two positions? And R not present? We need R.

No R? So invalid.

""chord"": H is eliminated? And C at1? -> invalid. Also H? From guess2, H is out? Yes, H(x) so not in word.

Not possible.

""broke"": no C? Has E? Eliminated? E out? -> invalid.

So ""micro"" is one of the few words that fit.

But we can have ""lyric"": L(1), Y(2), R(3) -> R at3? But wait: R forbidden at position3? From guess2, R(guess pos3) got -, meaning secret R not at3? So we cannot put R at position3.

""lyric"": R at position3 -> that's forbidden? Yes.

Similarly, ""topic"": no R.

Therefore, ""micro"" is a good choice.

In ""micro"", R is at4, so not forbidden.

Another possibility: ""crony"" but N? Eliminated? No.

So I'll go with ""micro"".

But let's list the letters: M, I, C, R, O.

C is in the word? Yes.

R in the word? Yes.

O in the word? Yes.

M and I: unknown.

Positions:
- C at3: not in forbidden positions? Not1, not4? So ok.
- R at4: not forbidden? Not2, not3? So ok.
- O at5? Not forbidden? Not at2? And we are putting at5? Ok.

Yes.

We guess ""micro"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
     - C and R are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
     - A, N, and E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (torch):** T(x), O(-), R(-), C(-), H(x)
     - O is in the word, but not in position 2.
     - R is not in position 3 (confirms R is not in positions 2 or 3 from previous feedback).
     - C is not in position 4 (confirms C is not in positions 1 or 4).
     - T and H are not in the word.
   
2. **Known Constraints:**
   - **Letters in the word:** C, R, O (confirmed by feedback).
   - **Letters not in the word:** A, N, E, T, H (eliminated).
   - **Position Constraints for Letters:**
     - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
     - C cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
     - O cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word contains C, R, O, plus two additional letters not yet tested and not in the eliminated set (A, N, E, T, H). These letters must come from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - Since no duplicates have been indicated, we assume all letters are distinct for now.

3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Guess:**
   - Prioritize testing new positions for C, R, and O while incorporating new common letters.
   - Avoid positions forbidden for each letter (e.g., R at 2 or 3, C at 1 or 4, O at 2).
   - Test untested vowels/consonants: O is known, so vowels like I, U or consonants like M, P, S could be tested.
   - Words like ""crook"" or ""crowd"" are invalid due to position issues (C in forbidden position 1). Similarly, ""porch"" places O in position 2, which is forbidden.

4. **Valid Candidate Words:**
   - **""micro""** (letters: M, I, C, R, O):
     - Positions: C at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4), R at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3), O at position 5 (allowed, not 2).
     - Tests new letters M and I (not eliminated).
     - Confirms R at position 4 and O at position 5 while placing C at a new position (3).
     - Common word (""micro"").
   - Other candidates like ""circuit"" (too long), ""crock"" (C at position 1, forbidden), or ""lyric"" (R at position 3, forbidden) are invalid.

5. **Final Choice:**
   - ""micro"" meets all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing new letter positions (C at 3, R at 4, O at 5) and introducing two new letters (M, I).

<guess>micro</guess>",micro,"We are on Guess 3, with previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: torch -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) R(-) C(-) H(x)

Let's interpret the feedback:

From Guess 1:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A, N, and E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (torch):
- T: x -> T is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- R: - -> R is in the word, but not in position 3. (Note: in torch, R is at position 3, so secret word has R, but not there)
- C: - -> C is in the word, but not in position 4. (In torch, C is at position 4)
- H: x -> H is not in the word.

So, combining:

Known letters in the word: C, R, O (and we know they are in the word from both guesses).

Known absent letters: A, N, E, T, H.

We have constraints on positions:

- For C: 
  - From guess 1: not position 1.
  - From guess 2: not position 4.
  - Also, from guess 1, it was at position 1 and got -, so C must be in positions 2,3, or 5? But we only know it's not 1 and not 4.

- For R:
  - From guess 1: not position 2.
  - From guess 2: not position 3.
  - So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

- For O:
  - From guess 2: not position 2.
  - So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

Also, there are two more letters to be found (since we have a 5-letter word with C, R, O and two others). The total distinct letters we have so far: C, R, O. But note secret word might have duplicates? Possible, but until we see feedback about duplicates, we assume not? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? For instance, if there are two Rs, but we haven't seen that. So far we don't have indication of duplicates.

Now, we know the word contains at least three distinct letters: C, R, O.

But there are five positions, so two more letters. Since A,N,E,T,H are out, we need to pick from the remaining letters.

We are missing two letters? And we have to form a word.

Recall: from guess 1, we tried positions: crane: C(1), R(2), and that was wrong. Now, for R, it cannot be at positions 2 or 3. For C, not 1 or 4.

Also, from guess 2: torch: T(1) not in word, O(2) is in word but wrong position, R(3) wrong position, C(4) wrong position, H(5) not in word.

So, O is not at position 2.

Now, we need to form a word that includes C, R, O, and two other letters that are not A,N,E,T,H.

And meet position constraints:

- R must be at one of: 1,4,5
- C must be at one of: 2,3, or maybe 5? But positions 1,4 are forbidden.

Possible positions for C: 2,3,5
For R: 1,4,5

But note: position 5 cannot have both, so they can't both be at 5? Unless duplicate? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Since we haven't seen any indication.

We should consider words that have C, R, O and two other letters.

Also, avoid positions that are forbidden for each.

List possible words:

First, think of common words with C,R,O.

Examples: ""crowd"", ""crock"", ""crony"", ""micro"", ""crook"", etc.

But check:

- ""crowd"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), D(5) 
  - But C at position 1: forbidden? From guess1, C cannot be at 1. So no.
  - Also, R at position2: forbidden? From guess1, R cannot be at2? Yes, from guess1 (R was at2 and wrong). So definitely not.

- ""crock"": C(1), R(2), O(3), C(4) -> duplicate C? But also C at1 forbidden and R at2 forbidden? So no.

- ""crony"": C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> N is eliminated? From guess1, N is not in word -> invalid.

- ""micro"": M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5) 
  - Now, C at position3: which is allowed (only forbidden positions for C:1 and4, so 3 is ok).
  - R at position4: for R, we allowed positions 1,4,5? So 4 is ok.
  - O at position5: but for O, we don't have a position constraint? Except it cannot be at2? And here it's at5, which is fine.
  - Letters: M,I,C,R,O -> M and I are new? And not eliminated.
  - Eliminated letters: A,N,E,T,H — M,I are not in that list? So they are possible.

But we also have to check for O? We know O is in the word. Also, we haven't tested M and I before? So yes.

But is ""micro"" a word? Yes, as in microcomputer.

Let's see positions more carefully:

- R is at position4: which is allowed? R forbidden positions: from guess1 not2, from guess2 not3? So position4 is new? Yes.

- C is at position3: allowed? Not1, not4? So yes.

Another word: ""ocrra"" — not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid.

""occur"": has U? But double C? And R? ""occur"" is O,C,C,U,R -> duplicate C? Not efficient? But also, U is not eliminated? However, O at position1: possible? And C at position2: which for C? Position2 is allowed? Yes, because C forbidden positions: not1 and not4? Position2 is ok? But wait: we have C at position2? In this word? ""occur"": O(1), C(2), C(3), U(4), R(5). So one C at position2 and one at3? But we don't know about duplicates. However, let's avoid for now.

Back to ""micro"": seems good.

Another candidate: ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": 4 letters? No.

""corps"": C(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), S(5) -> C at position1: forbidden? Yes -> invalid.

""porch"": we already guessed? Not exactly, but we considered.

In guess2 we guessed torch? But not porch.

But let me check ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)
- O at position2: but from guess2, O is not at position2? We know O is not at position2? In torch? Feedback: O(-) meaning O is in word but not position2. So putting O at position2 again would be redundant? And we can avoid that.

But note: the feedback doesn't say the position is wrong for O only in that instance? It means in the secret word, O is not at position2? Exactly, so we should not put O at position2 in any guess? Because we know it's wrong? So avoid O at position2.

Therefore, for any new guess, we must avoid:
- Putting C at pos1 or pos4
- Putting R at pos2 or pos3
- Putting O at pos2

And the word must contain C,R,O, and not contain A,N,E,T,H.

- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5)

- O at5: ok (not at2)
- O is at position5? Yes.

Now, are there other constraints? 

We might consider the possibility that O is in a position we haven't tested? But with ""micro"" we test O at position5.

Perhaps ""crois"": not common? And O at4? But it might be spelled ""crois""? Maybe not.

""curio"": C at1 -> forbidden? C at1, no.

""orcic"": not a word.

I think ""micro"" is a good candidate.

But another common word? ""porch"" might be revisited? ""porch"": P(1), O(2) but O at position2? Forbidden! We know O not at position2.

So if we guess ""porch"", we will get O(-) meaning it's not there? But we know O is in the word? So we would waste a slot? Therefore, avoid O at position2.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: '-' meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the word.
- N: 'x' meaning N is not in the word.
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the word.

Key information:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
- Since C and R are present but in the wrong positions, they must be in different positions in the secret word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include both C and R (since they are in the word).
2. Avoid A, N, and E.
3. We want to test other common letters to cover more ground.

Positions matter:
- In ""crane"", C was in position 1, R in position 2. Since they are misplaced, in the secret word:
  - C cannot be in position 1.
  - R cannot be in position 2.

We have 6 tries. We are on our second try.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes C and R (and not A, N, E). We can use other vowels if needed (like I, O, U) or consonants.

Considering common words:

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words like ""curly"", ""crisp"", ""crocs"", ""crops"", etc. But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Since A, N, E are out, we can focus on other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

List potential words:
- ""curly"": C at position 1 (but feedback said C is misplaced and was in position 1, so C should not be in position 1). So avoid C in position 1.
- Therefore, we should place C in a different position (2,3,4, or5) and similarly R not in position 2.

We can try words where C is after the first position.

Examples:
- ""scare"" -> but has A and E which are out -> invalid.
- ""price"": P, R, I, C, E -> but E is eliminated -> avoid.
- ""prick"": P, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E? Let's check: contains P,R,I,C,K. No A,N,E. But we must consider positions.

Let me check ""prick"":
- C is in position 4, R in position 2? 
  - In ""prick"": P(position1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)
  - We know from feedback that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (so position 4 might be okay), and R is not in position 2 (so having R in position2 is bad?).

Wait: our first guess had R in position2 and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has R, but not in position2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R in position2, it might still be wrong (if the secret word doesn't have it there) and we might get a '-', but we know it's wrong? Actually, no, the secret word doesn't have R in position2, so if we put it in position2 again, we'd get '-' again? But we want to try R in a new position to find the correct one.

Similarly for C, avoid position1.

So, we should avoid placing R in position2 and C in position1.

In ""prick"":
- R is in position2 -> avoid because we know R is not in position2? Actually, yes, since in the first guess at position2 it was misplaced, so position2 is wrong for R. So we must not put R in position2 in our next guess? Actually, we are allowed to, but it would be inefficient because we know it's wrong. We should put R in a different position.

Therefore, avoid R in position2 and C in position1.

Consider words with R and C in different positions.

Examples:
- ""crony"" but C is in position1 -> avoid C in position1 -> not good.
- ""rocky"": R at position1? But R in ""crane"" was at position2 which was wrong, but position1 might be okay. Also, ""rocky"" has O, C, K, Y. But C is at position2? And rocky: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - But we know R wasn't in position2 in the secret, but position1 is new. And C is in position3 (avoided position1).

But is O and Y okay? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can try ""crops"": but C in position1 -> avoid.

Better words: how about ""cores""? but E is out -> invalid.

Another idea: ""royce"" -> E is out? And C at the end? ""Royce"" has E -> invalid.

Maybe ""crisp"": C is at position1 -> avoid.

What about ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). But N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": too short? Needs 5 letters.

""court"": C at position2. And U? But no R? We need R.

We need both C and R.

Consider: ""cruel"" -> has E -> invalid.
""crumb"" -> has U, M, B. No A,N,E? But U is untested. But also, positions: C(1) -> we must avoid C in position1 -> ""crumb"" has C in position1 -> invalid.

How about ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- C is in position4 (not position1), R is in position3 (not position2). No A, N, E.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - same pattern.

But we should also try to include more of the common letters? We have tested none of O, U, etc.

Since we know the word has C and R, and excludes A, N, E, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? We need to test vowels: I, O, U are still possibilities.

Both ""porch"" and ""torch"" use O and have positions: R at 3, C at 4.

But note: in ""crane"", R was at position2 and C at position1. Now we are trying R at position3 and C at position4. That is two new positions for both letters.

Also, we introduce O and two new consonants (P and H for ""porch"", T and H for ""torch"").

Another common starting strategy is to use words with more vowels? But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.

We can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R? So without R, we can't verify R's position.

We must include both C and R.

Another word: ""crier"": has E -> invalid? c-r-i-e-r -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""curry"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""curio"": C at position1 -> avoid.

""crowd"": C at position1 -> avoid.

After some thought, a word with R at start and C in middle? But R: we don't know if it can be at position1 because in first guess it was at position2 only. Similarly, we avoid C at position1.

So let me try ""rocky"": R at position1 and O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). R in position1 is new (not position2). C in position3. And we get to test O, K, Y. No A,N,E.

But R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don't know.

Similarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be '-' and we wouldn't get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.

Therefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.

We can do ""rocky"" but note that it's a valid word? I think so.

Another option: ""crypt"": C at1 -> avoid? ""crypt"" has C at1 -> invalid.

""cramp"": C at1 and A -> invalid.

Why not ""troop"": no C -> doesn't contain C.

We need a word that includes both C and R.

List: 
- ""crook"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""brock"": B(1), R(2) -> R at2? but position2 is known wrong -> avoid R at2.
- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.
- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.

I think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.

Also consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.

""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.

Also, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.

Wait, we must include R.

How about ""curch""? Not a common word.

""bicep"": no R.

After searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.

But wait, let's think about ""rocky"" again: 
- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don't know.

But R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.

But what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.

But hold on: the feedback for C was '-' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.

Comparing:
- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.
- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.

Which one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.

But we don't know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.

Since we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.

Another candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.

""price"": has E -> invalid.

Perhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We'd get '-' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.

So avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.

Therefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.

""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 

So ""lurch"" seems valid.

Now, what to choose? 

We have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.

We should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.

In ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).
In ""torch"", we test O.
In ""lurch"", we test U.

Let me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.

""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.

""chirp"": no R? Wait.

I think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.

Thus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.

But we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don't know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don't know.

The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate? So maybe?

But in ""rocky"", no duplicates.

Similarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".

I choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".

Let me pick ""torch"":

User asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.

So we'll guess ""torch"".

But let's confirm: 
- T: not tested? no problem.
- O: new vowel.
- R: at position3 (avoided position2)
- C: at position4 (avoided position1)
- H: new.

A valid guess.

Alternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? 

So the guess is ""torch"".

But wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something? We don't know.

Final choice: ""torch"".

In the next step, the feedback will tell us.

I'll proceed with ""torch"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (now placed in position 4 for testing).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (now placed in position 3 for testing).
- A, N, and E are not in the word, so they are excluded.
- The new guess includes other common letters (T, O, H) and avoids repeated positions for C and R.

The guess ""torch"" tests these conditions efficiently.

<guess>...</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ... -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 1: crane -> C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and is misplaced).
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (guessed in position 2 and misplaced).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains C and R.
- It does not contain A, N, E.
- C is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

We are making the second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes C and R (since they are in the word).
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Places C in a position other than 1 (positions 2,3,4,5).
- Places R in a position other than 2 (positions 1,3,4,5).

We should also aim to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible letters to use: Since A,N,E are out, we have vowels: I, O, U, and consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to maximize information by using common letters and avoiding previously eliminated letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)
  - R is at position 3 (not 2) -> valid.
  - C is at position 4 (not 1) -> valid.
  - Letters: T, O, R, C, H - all new except R and C, which we must include.

- ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - similar.

- ""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - tests U.

- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5)
  - But note: R is at position 1? That's allowed since we only know position 2 is wrong for R. However, we are placing R at a new position (1) which is good for testing.
  - C is at position 3 (not 1) - ok.

Choosing ""rocky"" has R at position 1, but it uses the letter O and Y, which may be useful.

However, let's stick with ""torch"" for the second guess because:
- It tests R at position 3 and C at position 4, which are new positions.
- It introduces T, O, H, which are common letters.

Therefore, I choose ""torch"".

Response:
<guess>torch</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and R are in the secret word but in incorrect positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2).
- A, N, and E are not in the word.
- The new guess must include C and R, avoid A/N/E, and test C/R in new positions.

For the second guess, ""torch"" is chosen because:
- It places C in position 4 (avoiding position 1) and R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, H.
- It avoids eliminated letters (A/N/E).

This maximizes information gain about the word and letter positions.

<guess>torch</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ... -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: torch -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) R(-) C(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on Guess 3, with previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: torch -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) R(-) C(-) H(x)

Let's interpret the feedback:

From Guess 1:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A, N, and E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (torch):
- T: x -> T is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- R: - -> R is in the word, but not in position 3. (Note: in torch, R is at position 3, so secret word has R, but not there)
- C: - -> C is in the word, but not in position 4. (In torch, C is at position 4)
- H: x -> H is not in the word.

So, combining:

Known letters in the word: C, R, O (and we know they are in the word from both guesses).

Known absent letters: A, N, E, T, H.

We have constraints on positions:

- For C: 
  - From guess 1: not position 1.
  - From guess 2: not position 4.
  - Also, from guess 1, it was at position 1 and got -, so C must be in positions 2,3, or 5? But we only know it's not 1 and not 4.

- For R:
  - From guess 1: not position 2.
  - From guess 2: not position 3.
  - So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

- For O:
  - From guess 2: not position 2.
  - So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

Also, there are two more letters to be found (since we have a 5-letter word with C, R, O and two others). The total distinct letters we have so far: C, R, O. But note secret word might have duplicates? Possible, but until we see feedback about duplicates, we assume not? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? For instance, if there are two Rs, but we haven't seen that. So far we don't have indication of duplicates.

Now, we know the word contains at least three distinct letters: C, R, O.

But there are five positions, so two more letters. Since A,N,E,T,H are out, we need to pick from the remaining letters.

We are missing two letters? And we have to form a word.

Recall: from guess 1, we tried positions: crane: C(1), R(2), and that was wrong. Now, for R, it cannot be at positions 2 or 3. For C, not 1 or 4.

Also, from guess 2: torch: T(1) not in word, O(2) is in word but wrong position, R(3) wrong position, C(4) wrong position, H(5) not in word.

So, O is not at position 2.

Now, we need to form a word that includes C, R, O, and two other letters that are not A,N,E,T,H.

And meet position constraints:

- R must be at one of: 1,4,5
- C must be at one of: 2,3, or maybe 5? But positions 1,4 are forbidden.

Possible positions for C: 2,3,5
For R: 1,4,5

But note: position 5 cannot have both, so they can't both be at 5? Unless duplicate? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Since we haven't seen any indication.

We should consider words that have C, R, O and two other letters.

Also, avoid positions that are forbidden for each.

List possible words:

First, think of common words with C,R,O.

Examples: ""crowd"", ""crock"", ""crony"", ""micro"", ""crook"", etc.

But check:

- ""crowd"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), D(5) 
  - But C at position 1: forbidden? From guess1, C cannot be at 1. So no.
  - Also, R at position2: forbidden? From guess1, R cannot be at2? Yes, from guess1 (R was at2 and wrong). So definitely not.

- ""crock"": C(1), R(2), O(3), C(4) -> duplicate C? But also C at1 forbidden and R at2 forbidden? So no.

- ""crony"": C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> N is eliminated? From guess1, N is not in word -> invalid.

- ""micro"": M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5) 
  - Now, C at position3: which is allowed (only forbidden positions for C:1 and4, so 3 is ok).
  - R at position4: for R, we allowed positions 1,4,5? So 4 is ok.
  - O at position5: but for O, we don't have a position constraint? Except it cannot be at2? And here it's at5, which is fine.
  - Letters: M,I,C,R,O -> M and I are new? And not eliminated.
  - Eliminated letters: A,N,E,T,H — M,I are not in that list? So they are possible.

But we also have to check for O? We know O is in the word. Also, we haven't tested M and I before? So yes.

But is ""micro"" a word? Yes, as in microcomputer.

Let's see positions more carefully:

- R is at position4: which is allowed? R forbidden positions: from guess1 not2, from guess2 not3? So position4 is new? Yes.

- C is at position3: allowed? Not1, not4? So yes.

Another word: ""ocrra"" — not a word.

""force"": has E -> invalid.

""voice"": has E -> invalid.

""occur"": has U? But double C? And R? ""occur"" is O,C,C,U,R -> duplicate C? Not efficient? But also, U is not eliminated? However, O at position1: possible? And C at position2: which for C? Position2 is allowed? Yes, because C forbidden positions: not1 and not4? Position2 is ok? But wait: we have C at position2? In this word? ""occur"": O(1), C(2), C(3), U(4), R(5). So one C at position2 and one at3? But we don't know about duplicates. However, let's avoid for now.

Back to ""micro"": seems good.

Another candidate: ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""score"": 4 letters? No.

""corps"": C(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), S(5) -> C at position1: forbidden? Yes -> invalid.

""porch"": we already guessed? Not exactly, but we considered.

In guess2 we guessed torch? But not porch.

But let me check ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)
- O at position2: but from guess2, O is not at position2? We know O is not at position2? In torch? Feedback: O(-) meaning O is in word but not position2. So putting O at position2 again would be redundant? And we can avoid that.

But note: the feedback doesn't say the position is wrong for O only in that instance? It means in the secret word, O is not at position2? Exactly, so we should not put O at position2 in any guess? Because we know it's wrong? So avoid O at position2.

Therefore, for any new guess, we must avoid:
- Putting C at pos1 or pos4
- Putting R at pos2 or pos3
- Putting O at pos2

And the word must contain C,R,O, and not contain A,N,E,T,H.

In ""micro"": 
- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5)
- C at3: ok
- R at4: ok
- O at5: ok (not at2)
- O is at position5? Yes.

Now, are there other constraints? 

We might consider the possibility that O is in a position we haven't tested? But with ""micro"" we test O at position5.

Another word? For example, ""clock"": C at1 -> forbidden.

""crisp"": C at1 -> no.

Let's find words where C is at position2,3, or5; R at1,4,5; O not at2 and in one of 1,3,4,5.

For example:
- Position for R: let's say position4? Then C could be at position2,3, or5? But we have to use O somewhere else.

""micro"" is one.

""crowd"": already discarded? Because C and R at wrong positions? That is, crow: C1 R2 -> forbidden positions.

If R is at position5? For example, ""macro"": M(1), A? A eliminated -> invalid.

What about ""minor"": but N, O? N eliminated? And no C? And has N -> invalid.

Another word: ""virus"": has V,I,R,U,S? But no C? We must have C.

We need C,R,O.

Perhaps ""crois"": not common? And O at4? But it might be spelled ""crois""? Maybe not.

""curio"": C at1 -> forbidden? C at1, no.

""orcic"": not a word.

I think ""micro"" is a good candidate.

But another common word? ""porch"" might be revisited? ""porch"": P(1), O(2) but O at position2? Forbidden! We know O not at position2.

So if we guess ""porch"", we will get O(-) meaning it's not there? But we know O is in the word? So we would waste a slot? Therefore, avoid O at position2.

Similarly, what if we put O at another position?

""croup"": C(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> C at1 forbidden, R at2 forbidden.

""group"": G(1), R(2) -> R at2 forbidden.

""brook"": no C.

""crock"": C1 R2 -> invalid.

So other option: ""covert"": but has E? Invalid.

Actually, ""motor"": M(1), O(2) -> O at2 forbidden? And no C? Has T? But T eliminated? And O at2 is bad? Also no C.

Perhaps ""color"": double O? And C at1 -> invalid.

So ""micro"" seems solid.

Let me confirm:
- M: not eliminated? Eliminated: A, N, E, T, H -> so M is ok.
- I: not eliminated? Ok.
- C: at pos3 -> allowed, and we know C is in the word.
- R: at pos4 -> allowed positions: we allowed 1,4,5? Yes, pos4.
- O: at pos5 -> allowed? Yes? And we know O is in the word.

Also, we haven't tested M or I? So feedback will give us new information.

But we are not sure? There might be better words.

Another candidate: ""civic"": has C at two positions? And R not present? We need R.

No R? So invalid.

""chord"": H is eliminated? And C at1? -> invalid. Also H? From guess2, H is out? Yes, H(x) so not in word.

Not possible.

""broke"": no C? Has E? Eliminated? E out? -> invalid.

So ""micro"" is one of the few words that fit.

But we can have ""lyric"": L(1), Y(2), R(3) -> R at3? But wait: R forbidden at position3? From guess2, R(guess pos3) got -, meaning secret R not at3? So we cannot put R at position3.

""lyric"": R at position3 -> that's forbidden? Yes.

Similarly, ""topic"": no R.

Therefore, ""micro"" is a good choice.

In ""micro"", R is at4, so not forbidden.

Another possibility: ""crony"" but N? Eliminated? No.

So I'll go with ""micro"".

But let's list the letters: M, I, C, R, O.

C is in the word? Yes.

R in the word? Yes.

O in the word? Yes.

M and I: unknown.

Positions:
- C at3: not in forbidden positions? Not1, not4? So ok.
- R at4: not forbidden? Not2, not3? So ok.
- O at5? Not forbidden? Not at2? And we are putting at5? Ok.

Yes.

We guess ""micro"".

     - C cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
     - O cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word contains C, R, O, plus two additional letters not yet tested and not in the eliminated set (A, N, E, T, H). These letters must come from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - Since no duplicates have been indicated, we assume all letters are distinct for now.

3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Guess:**
   - Prioritize testing new positions for C, R, and O while incorporating new common letters.
   - Avoid positions forbidden for each letter (e.g., R at 2 or 3, C at 1 or 4, O at 2).
   - Test untested vowels/consonants: O is known, so vowels like I, U or consonants like M, P, S could be tested.
   - Words like ""crook"" or ""crowd"" are invalid due to position issues (C in forbidden position 1). Similarly, ""porch"" places O in position 2, which is forbidden.

4. **Valid Candidate Words:**
   - **""micro""** (letters: M, I, C, R, O):
     - Positions: C at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4), R at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3), O at position 5 (allowed, not 2).
     - Tests new letters M and I (not eliminated).
     - Confirms R at position 4 and O at position 5 while placing C at a new position (3).
     - Common word (""micro"").
   - Other candidates like ""circuit"" (too long), ""crock"" (C at position 1, forbidden), or ""lyric"" (R at position 3, forbidden) are invalid.

5. **Final Choice:**
   - ""micro"" meets all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing new letter positions (C at 3, R at 4, O at 5) and introducing two new letters (M, I).

Include both C and R (since they are in the word).\n2. Avoid A, N, and E.\n3. We want to test other common letters to cover more ground.\n\nPositions matter:\n- In ""crane"", C was in position 1, R in position 2. Since they are misplaced, in the secret word:\n  - C cannot be in position 1.\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n\nWe have 6 tries. We are on our second try.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes C and R (and not A, N, E). We can use other vowels if needed (like I, O, U) or consonants.\n\nConsidering common words:\n\nLet\'s think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Words like ""curly"", ""crisp"", ""crocs"", ""crops"", etc. But we must avoid using eliminated letters.\n\nSince A, N, E are out, we can focus on other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nAlso, note that the word must be 5 letters.\n\nList potential words:\n- ""curly"": C at position 1 (but feedback said C is misplaced and was in position 1, so C should not be in position 1). So avoid C in position 1.\n- Therefore, we should place C in a different position (2,3,4, or5) and similarly R not in position 2.\n\nWe can try words where C is after the first position.\n\nExamples:\n- ""scare"" -> but has A and E which are out -> invalid.\n- ""price"": P, R, I, C, E -> but E is eliminated -> avoid.\n- ""prick"": P, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E? Let\'s check: contains P,R,I,C,K. No A,N,E. But we must consider positions.\n\nLet me check ""prick"":\n- C is in position 4, R in position 2? \n  - In ""prick"": P(position1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)\n  - We know from feedback that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (so position 4 might be okay), and R is not in position 2 (so having R in position2 is bad?).\n\nWait: our first guess had R in position2 and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has R, but not in position2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R in position2, it might still be wrong (if the secret word doesn\'t have it there) and we might get a \'-\', but we know it\'s wrong? Actually, no, the secret word doesn\'t have R in position2, so if we put it in position2 again, we\'d get \'-\' again? But we want to try R in a new position to find the correct one.\n\nSimilarly for C, avoid position1.\n\nSo, we should avoid placing R in position2 and C in position1.\n\nIn ""prick"":\n- R is in position2 -> avoid because we know R is not in position2? Actually, yes, since in the first guess at position2 it was misplaced, so position2 is wrong for R. So we must not put R in position2 in our next guess? Actually, we are allowed to, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s wrong. We should put R in a different position.\n\nTherefore, avoid R in position2 and C in position1.\n\nConsider words with R and C in different positions.\n\nExamples:\n- ""crony"" but C is in position1 -> avoid C in position1 -> not good.\n- ""rocky"": R at position1? But R in ""crane"" was at position2 which was wrong, but position1 might be okay. Also, ""rocky"" has O, C, K, Y. But C is at position2? And rocky: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). \n  - But we know R wasn\'t in position2 in the secret, but position1 is new. And C is in position3 (avoided position1).\n\nBut is O and Y okay? We don\'t know yet.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""crops"": but C in position1 -> avoid.\n\nBetter words: how about ""cores""? but E is out -> invalid.\n\nAnother idea: ""royce"" -> E is out? And C at the end? ""Royce"" has E -> invalid.\n\nMaybe ""crisp"": C is at position1 -> avoid.\n\nWhat about ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). But N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""score"": too short? Needs 5 letters.\n\n""court"": C at position2. And U? But no R? We need R.\n\nWe need both C and R.\n\nConsider: ""cruel"" -> has E -> invalid.\n""crumb"" -> has U, M, B. No A,N,E? But U is untested. But also, positions: C(1) -> we must avoid C in position1 -> ""crumb"" has C in position1 -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). \n- C is in position4 (not position1), R is in position3 (not position2). No A, N, E.\n\nThis seems acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - same pattern.\n\nBut we should also try to include more of the common letters? We have tested none of O, U, etc.\n\nSince we know the word has C and R, and excludes A, N, E, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? We need to test vowels: I, O, U are still possibilities.\n\nBoth ""porch"" and ""torch"" use O and have positions: R at 3, C at 4.\n\nBut note: in ""crane"", R was at position2 and C at position1. Now we are trying R at position3 and C at position4. That is two new positions for both letters.\n\nAlso, we introduce O and two new consonants (P and H for ""porch"", T and H for ""torch"").\n\nAnother common starting strategy is to use words with more vowels? But we have only 2 known letters (C,R) and we must avoid A,N,E.\n\nWe can try words with I and O? For example, ""music"": but C at end? But has S and I? And M? But E is absent -> but ""music"": M(1), U(2), S(3), I(4), C(5). C is at position5 (we avoid position1) and no R -> but we need R? So without R, we can\'t verify R\'s position.\n\nWe must include both C and R.\n\nAnother word: ""crier"": has E -> invalid? c-r-i-e-r -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""curry"": C at position1 -> avoid.\n\n""curio"": C at position1 -> avoid.\n\n""crowd"": C at position1 -> avoid.\n\nAfter some thought, a word with R at start and C in middle? But R: we don\'t know if it can be at position1 because in first guess it was at position2 only. Similarly, we avoid C at position1.\n\nSo let me try ""rocky"": R at position1 and O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). R in position1 is new (not position2). C in position3. And we get to test O, K, Y. No A,N,E.\n\nBut R was in position2 in first guess and was misplaced, so position2 is bad. Position1 might be good? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""proxy"": P(1), R(2) -> but R is in position2? We know position2 is wrong for R? So putting R in position2 again would be pointless? Actually, in our first guess, we had R in position2 and the feedback said \'-\' meaning R is in the word but not at position2. So if we put R again in position2, it would still be \'-\' and we wouldn\'t get new position information? We should avoid placing R in known wrong positions.\n\nTherefore, put R in a new position: positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, C: avoid position1, so positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn ""rocky"", R is at1 and C at3 -> positions are new.\n\nWe can do ""rocky"" but note that it\'s a valid word? I think so.\n\nAnother option: ""crypt"": C at1 -> avoid? ""crypt"" has C at1 -> invalid.\n\n""cramp"": C at1 and A -> invalid.\n\nWhy not ""troop"": no C -> doesn\'t contain C.\n\nWe need a word that includes both C and R.\n\nList: \n- ""crook"": C at1 -> avoid.\n- ""brock"": B(1), R(2) -> R at2? but position2 is known wrong -> avoid R at2.\n- ""corps"": C at1 -> avoid.\n- ""scarf"": S(1), C(2), A? -> invalid because A.\n\nI think ""porch"" and ""torch"" are good candidates.\n\nAlso consider ""march"": has A -> invalid.\n\n""perch"": P(1), E(2) -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""lurch"": L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). No A,N,E. And positions: R at3, C at4 -> different from first guess.\n\nAlso, ""lurch"" includes L, U, H which are untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""pouch"": P(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but no R? So missing R.\n\nWait, we must include R.\n\nHow about ""curch""? Not a common word.\n\n""bicep"": no R.\n\nAfter searching, I think ""porch"" or ""torch"" is fine.\n\nBut wait, let\'s think about ""rocky"" again: \n- ""rocky"": R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) - R at1 and C at3? And O,K,Y: we don\'t know.\n\nBut R: in first guess R was at position2 and misplaced, so position2 is wrong. Position1 is new? Yes.\n\nBut what about C? C was at position1 in first guess and misplaced, and now in ""rocky"" C is at position3? That is okay.\n\nBut hold on: the feedback for C was \'-\' meaning C is somewhere else? Yes, so position3 is a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, ""torch"": T(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) - R at3 and C at4.\n\nComparing:\n- ""rocky"": tests R at1, C at3, and O,K,Y.\n- ""torch"": tests R at3, C at4, O,T,H.\n\nWhich one gives more information? We know that in the secret word, neither C nor R are in positions that were in the first guess? Specifically, C was at1 (wrong), R at2 (wrong). So for R, position2 is bad, position1 might be good? Similarly position3,4,5. Same for C.\n\nBut we don\'t know any correct positions yet? Only wrong ones.\n\nSince we need to find the positions, we want to test both letters in new slots. Both options are good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""girch""? Not a word.\n\n""force"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""voice"": has E -> invalid? ""voice"" is V,O,I,C,E -> E eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""price"": has E -> invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""brick"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position2? which we know is bad -> avoid. We\'d get \'-\' for R at2 again, which we already know -> inefficient.\n\nSo avoid words with R at position2 or C at position1.\n\nTherefore, words like ""rocky"", ""porch"", ""torch"", ""lurch"", ""pitch"" (but no R?) etc.\n\n""lurch"": L,U,R,C,H -> R at position3? Yes, L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). \n\nSo ""lurch"" seems valid.\n\nNow, what to choose? \n\nWe have limited vowels: A,N,E out -> we have O,I,U and sometimes Y.\n\nWe should test a vowel? Either O, or U, or I.\n\nIn ""rocky"", we test O and Y (which can be a vowel).\nIn ""torch"", we test O.\nIn ""lurch"", we test U.\n\nLet me pick ""rocky"" because it tests Y as well? But Y is less common.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word with I? For example, ""crimp"": but C at1 -> avoid.\n\n""primo"": P(1), R(2) -> R at2? avoid.\n\n""chirp"": no R? Wait.\n\nI think ""pitch"" is not helpful without R.\n\nThus, I decide to go with ""rocky"" as it avoids known bad positions and introduces new letters.\n\nBut we can consider efficiency: we can also avoid using duplicate letters? Since we don\'t know, but many words have unique letters? We assume unique? No, but we don\'t know.\n\nThe feedback didn\'t say anything about duplicate? So maybe?\n\nBut in ""rocky"", no duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""torch"" or ""porch"".\n\nI choose ""torch"" because T, O, H are common letters? Or ""porch"".\n\nLet me pick ""torch"":\n\nUser asked to respond in <guess>...</guess> format.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""torch"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- T: not tested? no problem.\n- O: new vowel.\n- R: at position3 (avoided position2)\n- C: at position4 (avoided position1)\n- H: new.\n\nA valid guess.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test U, we can do ""lurch"".\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""torch"" since it might be a more common word? \n\nSo the guess is ""torch"".\n\nBut wait: we should also consider that the secret word might have the C and R in positions that are adjacent or something? We don\'t know.\n\nFinal choice: ""torch"".\n\nIn the next step, the feedback will tell us.\n\nI\'ll proceed with ""torch"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (now placed in position 4 for testing).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (now placed in position 3 for testing).\n- A, N, and E are not in the word, so they are excluded.\n- The new guess includes other common letters (T, O, H) and avoids repeated positions for C and R.\n\nThe guess ""torch"" tests these conditions efficiently.\n\n<guess>...</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ... -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 1: crane -> C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nThis means:\n- C is in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and is misplaced).\n- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (guessed in position 2 and misplaced).\n- A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains C and R.\n- It does not contain A, N, E.\n- C is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.\n\nWe are making the second guess.

But we only know it\'s not 1 and not 4.\n\n- For R:\n  - From guess 1: not position 2.\n  - From guess 2: not position 3.\n  - So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.\n\n- For O:\n  - From guess 2: not position 2.\n  - So O can be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nAlso, there are two more letters to be found (since we have a 5-letter word with C, R, O and two others). The total distinct letters we have so far: C, R, O. But note secret word might have duplicates? Possible, but until we see feedback about duplicates, we assume not? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? For instance, if there are two Rs, but we haven\'t seen that. So far we don\'t have indication of duplicates.\n\nNow, we know the word contains at least three distinct letters: C, R, O.\n\nBut there are five positions, so two more letters. Since A,N,E,T,H are out, we need to pick from the remaining letters.\n\nWe are missing two letters? And we have to form a word.\n\nRecall: from guess 1, we tried positions: crane: C(1), R(2), and that was wrong. Now, for R, it cannot be at positions 2 or 3. For C, not 1 or 4.\n\nAlso, from guess 2: torch: T(1) not in word, O(2) is in word but wrong position, R(3) wrong position, C(4) wrong position, H(5) not in word.\n\nSo, O is not at position 2.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that includes C, R, O, and two other letters that are not A,N,E,T,H.\n\nAnd meet position constraints:\n\n- R must be at one of: 1,4,5\n- C must be at one of: 2,3, or maybe 5? But positions 1,4 are forbidden.\n\nPossible positions for C: 2,3,5\nFor R: 1,4,5\n\nBut note: position 5 cannot have both, so they can\'t both be at 5? Unless duplicate? So let\'s assume no duplicates for now? Since we haven\'t seen any indication.\n\nWe should consider words that have C, R, O and two other letters.\n\nAlso, avoid positions that are forbidden for each.\n\nList possible words:\n\nFirst, think of common words with C,R,O.\n\nExamples: ""crowd"", ""crock"", ""crony"", ""micro"", ""crook"", etc.\n\nBut check:\n\n- ""crowd"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), D(5) \n  - But C at position 1: forbidden? From guess1, C cannot be at 1. So no.\n  - Also, R at position2: forbidden? From guess1, R cannot be at2? Yes, from guess1 (R was at2 and wrong). So definitely not.\n\n- ""crock"": C(1), R(2), O(3), C(4) -> duplicate C? But also C at1 forbidden and R at2 forbidden? So no.\n\n- ""crony"": C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> N is eliminated? From guess1, N is not in word -> invalid.\n\n- ""micro"": M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5) \n  - Now, C at position3: which is allowed (only forbidden positions for C:1 and4, so 3 is ok).\n  - R at position4: for R, we allowed positions 1,4,5? So 4 is ok.\n  - O at position5: but for O, we don\'t have a position constraint? Except it cannot be at2? And here it\'s at5, which is fine.\n  - Letters: M,I,C,R,O -> M and I are new? And not eliminated.\n  - Eliminated letters: A,N,E,T,H — M,I are not in that list? So they are possible.\n\nBut we also have to check for O? We know O is in the word. Also, we haven\'t tested M and I before? So yes.\n\nBut is ""micro"" a word? Yes, as in microcomputer.\n\nLet\'s see positions more carefully:\n\n- R is at position4: which is allowed? R forbidden positions: from guess1 not2, from guess2 not3? So position4 is new? Yes.\n\n- C is at position3: allowed? Not1, not4? So yes.\n\nAnother word: ""ocrra"" — not a word.\n\n""force"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""voice"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""occur"": has U? But double C? And R? ""occur"" is O,C,C,U,R -> duplicate C? Not efficient? But also, U is not eliminated? However, O at position1: possible? And C at position2: which for C? Position2 is allowed? Yes, because C forbidden positions: not1 and not4? Position2 is ok? But wait: we have C at position2? In this word? ""occur"": O(1), C(2), C(3), U(4), R(5). So one C at position2 and one at3? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, let\'s avoid for now.\n\nBack to ""micro"": seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""scorn"": S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""score"": 4 letters?

But not porch.\n\nBut let me check ""porch"": P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)\n- O at position2: but from guess2, O is not at position2? We know O is not at position2? In torch? Feedback: O(-) meaning O is in word but not position2. So putting O at position2 again would be redundant? And we can avoid that.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t say the position is wrong for O only in that instance? It means in the secret word, O is not at position2? Exactly, so we should not put O at position2 in any guess? Because we know it\'s wrong? So avoid O at position2.\n\nTherefore, for any new guess, we must avoid:\n- Putting C at pos1 or pos4\n- Putting R at pos2 or pos3\n- Putting O at pos2\n\nAnd the word must contain C,R,O, and not contain A,N,E,T,H.\n\nIn ""micro"": \n- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5)\n- C at3: ok\n- R at4: ok\n- O at5: ok (not at2)\n- O is at position5? Yes.\n\nNow, are there other constraints? \n\nWe might consider the possibility that O is in a position we haven\'t tested? But with ""micro"" we test O at position5.\n\nAnother word? For example, ""clock"": C at1 -> forbidden.\n\n""crisp"": C at1 -> no.\n\nLet\'s find words where C is at position2,3, or5; R at1,4,5; O not at2 and in one of 1,3,4,5.\n\nFor example:\n- Position for R: let\'s say position4? Then C could be at position2,3, or5? But we have to use O somewhere else.\n\n""micro"" is one.\n\n""crowd"": already discarded? Because C and R at wrong positions? That is, crow: C1 R2 -> forbidden positions.\n\nIf R is at position5? For example, ""macro"": M(1), A? A eliminated -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""minor"": but N, O? N eliminated? And no C? And has N -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""virus"": has V,I,R,U,S? But no C? We must have C.\n\nWe need C,R,O.\n\nPerhaps ""crois"": not common? And O at4? But it might be spelled ""crois""? Maybe not.\n\n""curio"": C at1 -> forbidden? C at1, no.\n\n""orcic"": not a word.\n\nI think ""micro"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut another common word? ""porch"" might be revisited? ""porch"": P(1), O(2) but O at position2? Forbidden! We know O not at position2.\n\nSo if we guess ""porch"", we will get O(-) meaning it\'s not there? But we know O is in the word? So we would waste a slot? Therefore, avoid O at position2.\n\nSimilarly, what if we put O at another position?\n\n""croup"": C(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> C at1 forbidden, R at2 forbidden.\n\n""group"": G(1), R(2) -> R at2 forbidden.\n\n""brook"": no C.\n\n""crock"": C1 R2 -> invalid.\n\nSo other option: ""covert"": but has E? Invalid.\n\nActually, ""motor"": M(1), O(2) -> O at2 forbidden? And no C? Has T? But T eliminated? And O at2 is bad? Also no C.\n\nPerhaps ""color"": double O? And C at1 -> invalid.\n\nSo ""micro"" seems solid.\n\nLet me confirm:\n- M: not eliminated? Eliminated: A, N, E, T, H -> so M is ok.\n- I: not eliminated? Ok.\n- C: at pos3 -> allowed, and we know C is in the word.\n- R: at pos4 -> allowed positions: we allowed 1,4,5? Yes, pos4.\n- O: at pos5 -> allowed? Yes? And we know O is in the word.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested M or I? So feedback will give us new information.\n\nBut we are not sure? There might be better words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""civic"": has C at two positions? And R not present? We need R.\n\nNo R? So invalid.\n\n""chord"": H is eliminated? And C at1? -> invalid. Also H? From guess2, H is out? Yes, H(x) so not in word.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""broke"": no C? Has E? Eliminated? E out? -> invalid.\n\nSo ""micro"" is one of the few words that fit.\n\nBut we can have ""lyric"": L(1), Y(2), R(3) -> R at3? But wait: R forbidden at position3? From guess2, R(guess pos3) got -, meaning secret R not at3? So we cannot put R at position3.\n\n""lyric"": R at position3 -> that\'s forbidden? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""topic"": no R.\n\nTherefore, ""micro"" is a good choice.\n\nIn ""micro"", R is at4, so not forbidden.\n\nAnother possibility: ""crony"" but N? Eliminated? No.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""micro"".\n\nBut let\'s list the letters: M, I, C, R, O.\n\nC is in the word? Yes.\n\nR in the word? Yes.\n\nO in the word? Yes.\n\nM and I: unknown.\n\nPositions:\n- C at3: not in forbidden positions? Not1, not4? So ok.\n- R at4: not forbidden? Not2, not3? So ok.\n- O at5? Not forbidden? Not at2? And we are putting at5? Ok.\n\nYes.\n\nWe guess ""micro"".\n\nResponse format: <guess>micro</guess>?### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\n     - C and R are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.\n     - A, N, and E are not in the word.\n   - **Guess 2 (torch):** T(x), O(-), R(-), C(-), H(x)\n     - O is in the word, but not in position 2.\n     - R is not in position 3 (confirms R is not in positions 2 or 3 from previous feedback).\n     - C is not in position 4 (confirms C is not in positions 1 or 4).\n     - T and H are not in the word.\n   \n2. **Known Constraints:**\n   - **Letters in the word:** C, R, O (confirmed by feedback).\n   - **Letters not in the word:** A, N, E, T, H (eliminated).\n   - **Position Constraints for Letters:**\n     - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n     - C cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n     - O cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n   - **Word Structure:** The secret word contains C, R, O, plus two additional letters not yet tested and not in the eliminated set (A, N, E, T, H). These letters must come from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n   - Since no duplicates have been indicated, we assume all letters are distinct for now.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Guess:**\n   - Prioritize testing new positions for C, R, and O while incorporating new common letters.\n   - Avoid positions forbidden for each letter (e.g., R at 2 or 3, C at 1 or 4, O at 2).\n   - Test untested vowels/consonants: O is known, so vowels like I, U or consonants like M, P, S could be tested.\n   - Words like ""crook"" or ""crowd"" are invalid due to position issues (C in forbidden position 1). Similarly, ""porch"" places O in position 2, which is forbidden.\n\n4. **Valid Candidate Words:**\n   - **""micro""** (letters: M, I, C, R, O):\n     - Positions: C at position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4), R at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3), O at position 5 (allowed, not 2).\n     - Tests new letters M and I (not eliminated).\n     - Confirms R at position 4 and O at position 5 while placing C at a new position (3).\n     - Common word (""micro"").\n   - Other candidates like ""circuit"" (too long), ""crock"" (C at position 1, forbidden), or ""lyric"" (R at position 3, forbidden) are invalid.\n\n5. **Final Choice:**\n   - ""micro"" meets all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing new letter positions (C at 3, R at 4, O at 5) and introducing two new letters (M, I).\n\n<guess>micro</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ... -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 3: torch -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) R(-) C(-) H(x)\nGuess 4: micro -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) C(✓) R(-) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 4: micro -> M(x) I(x) C(✓) R(-) O(-)
This means:
- M: not in the word → eliminated.
- I: not in the word → eliminated.
- C: ✓ → correct position! So C is at position 3.
- R: - → in the word but wrong position. Since C is fixed at position 3, and R was guessed at position 4, it means R is not at position 4. But we already knew R is not at position 2 or 3? And now position 4 is incorrect? But wait, we know R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1) and position 3 (from guess2), and now from guess4 at position4? So R is not at 2,3,4? Then R must be at position 1 or 5? Since the word has 5 positions.
- O: - → in the word but wrong position. In ""micro"", O was at position 5? And feedback is -, so O is not at position 5.

Also, from previous feedback, O cannot be at position 2? Then O must be at position 1, 3, or 4? But position 3 is taken by C? Since C is fixed at position 3? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, O must be at position 1 or 4? 

Now, we know the secret word:
- Position 3: C (must be C)
- R is in the word but not at positions 2,3,4 → must be at 1 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at positions 2 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 4? But positions available: 1,2,4,5? However, position 3 is fixed? So positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: ? 
  3: C (fixed)
  4: ? 
  5: ?

O can be at 1 or 4? Because it cannot be at 2 (from earlier) and cannot be at 5 (from guess4)? And position3 is taken? So only positions 1 and 4 are possible for O.

Similarly, R can only be at 1 or 5.

But note: R and O cannot be at the same position? So they might be at 1? Or one at 1 and one at 5/4.

Case 1: If R is at 1, O cannot be at 1? Then O must be at 4? And R at 1.
Case 2: If R is at 5, then O must be at 1 or 4? 

But also, there are two more letters? Since we have three known letters: C, R, O? But O is not placed yet? Actually, the word has five positions: we know position3, we need to fill others.

Therefore, the secret word must contain C (at3), R, O, and two more letters.

We know eliminated letters: A, N, E, T, H, M, I.

So the letter set: we need two more letters that are not A,N,E,T,H,M,I? and from the remaining alphabet? and must form a word.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Now, we have constraints for positions:
- Position 1: Either R (if R is at1) or O (if O is at1) or a new letter? Because both R and O might not be at1? But R must be at1 or5? And O at1 or4? So:
  If R is at1, then O must be at4? 
  If R is at5, then O can be at1 or4? 

Also, for position2: We haven't fixed anything? But we know it's not R? Because R cannot be at2? So position2 must be some letter that is either new? Similarly, position4: if O is not there, then it must be the other letter.

We need to test? We have two tries left? We are on guess5? We have tried 4 guesses? So two left? Actually, the user didn't specify? But we can proceed.

But we must make a guess? We need to disambiguate R and O positions? 

We can consider words that test R at1 and O at4? Or the other combinations? But we can also test with new letters.

We know R must be at1 or5? O must be at1 or4? 

But we cannot have both at1? So the possibilities:

Case A: R at1, O at4
Case B: R at5, O at1
Case C: R at5, O at4

We need a word that fits one of these? But we don't know? So we should make a guess that helps distinguish? And also fits with the two new letters.

Moreover, we need to avoid eliminated letters? 

List the possibilities:

Option: Word structure:
- Case A: R _ C O _ 
  Position: 1:R, 2:?, 3:C, 4:O, 5:? 
  And R and O are placed? Then we need two new letters at positions 2 and 5.

- Case B: O _ C _ R
  Positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:C, 4:?, 5:R 
  New letters at 2 and 4.

- Case C: _ _ C O R 
  Positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:C, 4:O, 5:R 
  New letters at 1 and 2.

In Case C, we have R at5 and O at4? 

Now, we need a word that can fit one of these? And we have to choose a guess that maximizes information? Or directly solve? We can test a word that tries case B? Or case A? 

But we must form a valid English word.

We also know the word has C at3? So whatever we guess, position3 must be C? So we write: _ _ C _ _ 

We also have R and O? 

For Case A: R ? C O ? 
For Case B: O ? C ? R 
For Case C: ? ? C O R 

Let me think of possible words:

Case A: R ? C O ? 
- Possibilities: ""recoy""? Not a word? ""broco""? Not? 
Common words: like ""crook"" but C at3? R at1, O at4? Then O at5? Not. 
""rock?"" Not 5 letters? 
Actually, ""rocky"": R O C K Y -> but O at position2? But we know O cannot be at position2? Because from guess2, O is not at2? So invalid? So no word? 

But consider: In Case A: R at1, O at4? Positions: 1:R, 2:?, 3:C, 4:O, 5:?

We need letter at2 and5? So words: ""broco""? Not real? ""rucos""? Not? 

Perhaps not common in English? 

Case B: O _ C _ R 
Words: ""ocean""? But E? Eliminated? A? Eliminated? No? 
""occur"": O C C U R -> but duplicate C? And O at1, C at2? But we have C fixed at3? So not: because ""occur"" is O(1),C(2),C(3),U(4),R(5) -> but C at3? Yes? And O at1? Then R at5? 
But C at2? That would be another C? So secret word has two C? But we haven't seen any duplicate? 

""occur"": 
- Position1: O 
- Position2: C 
- Position3: C 
- Position4: U 
- Position5: R 

But the feedback: we know from previous that C is at3? So if we have ""occur"", then position3 is C? And also position2 is C? But our feedback from guess? We have only seen one C? 

In guess1: C at1 -> '-', meaning there's C? And in guess4: C at3 -> ✓? That doesn't say there are multiple? It's possible? But we don't know? 

So ""occur"" could be a candidate? Then:
- O at1? But we know O cannot be at position2? But position1 is fine? 
- C at position3? Fixed? And also C at position2? 
- R at5? 

Then O at1? Which is allowed? 

Case C: ? ? C O R 
Words: ""micro"" but changed? Or ""picor""? Not a word? 

Common words: ""scorn""? Not? But N eliminated? 
""decor""? D? Could be? But E? Eliminated? E is out? 
""favor""? V? But A? Eliminated? 
Therefore, back to ""occur""?

But we have eliminated M,I,T,H,A,N,E? So U? U is not eliminated? 

And we can try ""occur""? 

But ""occur"" has two C? And we see C in position3? Also, what about the other C? Position2? 

In the word? 

In Case B: ""occur"" → O, C, C, U, R? 

But positions: 
- Position1: O 
- Position2: C 
- Position3: C 
- Position4: U 
- Position5: R 

Feedback for O? We know O is at position1? And we can get feedback? 

But we are about to guess? We have R at5? And O at1? 

Also, does this match the previous requirements? 

From guess4 we guessed ""micro"": positions: M I C R O → and got feedback for O at5? Feedback: O(-) meaning O is in the word but not position5? Therefore, in ""occur"", O is at position1? Which is not position5? So it might be? 

Also, U: not eliminated? 

But we have C at position? Position2 is C? But we know from guess1 and guess2 that C is not at1? And guess2 C not at4? Guess4 C at3? But here C at2? And C at3? 

We have feedback only for positions? 

If secret word is ""occur"": 
- For guess4: micro → M(x), I(x), C(✓) at position3, R at4 → secret word R? Secret word R is at position5? So guess at position4: R? Secret: U at4? So R is not at4? Hence R(-) → it matches? 
- O at5? Guess O at5? Secret word O at1? So O(-) → it matches? 
- And M and I missing? ✓ 

Now for guess? We are on guess5? We need to guess? 

Can we guess ""occur""? 

But ""occur"" has letter C at position2? And position3? And we are about to guess? It might not? 

But ""occur"" is a word? Meaning is to happen? But in Wordle words? Accepted? 

Alternatively, other words? 

But Case A? R? C O? Words: ""rock?"" Not? ""croup""? C at1? No? So maybe Case A doesn't work? 

Case B: O ? C ? R → like ""occur"", ""oncer""? Not? 

Another word? ""outdo"": O at1? Then U? But D? And O again? But then C? Must have C? No? 

We need C? So position3 must be C? So always? 

Therefore, ""occur"" fits the pattern? 

But we have two letters: U and R? 

But we can try? 

But in ""occur"", R is at5? Which is allowed? 

Also, O is at1? And position2 is C? 

But we know O cannot be at position2? Position1 is fine? 

And R at5? 

So why not? 

But let me see if there is another word? 

Case C: ? ? C O R → with R at5? 

Words: like ""macro""? But R at5? But A? Eliminated? 
""decor"": E eliminated? 
""favor"": A eliminated? 
""micro"" we already guessed? 
""corps"": but S? And O at2? O cannot be at2? 
No good? 

Therefore, ""occur"" is a candidate? 

With U at position4? 

We haven't tested U? 

Hence, we can guess ""occur""? 

But note: we don't know if there is duplicate C? 

We might assume not? But we haven't received feedback about duplicates? 

For example, if we guessed a word with duplicate? 

But ""occur"" has two C? So it allows for that? 

Alternatively, there might be a word without duplicates that fits? 

Consider: 

Case B: O at1, R at5? 
Then positions: 
1:O, 2:?, 3:C, 4:?, 5:R 

We need letters at positions 2 and4? 

Letters not eliminated? And not A,N,E,T,H,M,I? 

So choose common? 

Possible English words? 
- O? C ? R 
- Example: ""occur"" with U at4? And C at2? 
But duplicated C? 

Without duplicate? For example, ""oaker""? Not English? 
""older""? O at1, L at2, D? E? Eliminated? 
""other"": O T H E R -> T,H,E eliminated? 
So hard? 

Another: ""opium""? No C? 
Must have C at3? 

So with C at3? 

So O ? C ? R 

Now, common endings? ""R"" 

For example, ""ocean""? But E,A? Eliminated? 
""occur"" seems the only one? 

Moreover, U? Not eliminated? We haven't tested U? 

Therefore, we guess ""occur"". 

But wait: another possibility? Case C: R at5? and O at4? Then positions: 
? ? C O R 

Then for positions 1 and2? 

Examples: ""micro"" but changed? ""decry""? D,E,C,R,Y? E eliminated? 
""lyric"": L,Y,R,I,C? But I eliminated? 
""magic"": M,A,G,I,C? M,A,I eliminated? 
No? 

Therefore, the best candidate is ""occur"". 

But we can consider Case A? With R at1? And O at4? Then positions: R ? C O ? 

Words: ""recap""? R,E,C,A,P -> A,E eliminated? 
""reck?"" Not? 
""recon"": R,E,C,O,N -> N eliminated? 
""r?c??"" 

Not common? 

Therefore, we go with ""occur"". 

So guess: ""occur""

But it's 5 letters? O-C-C-U-R? 

Yes. 

Feedback is expected to be: 
- Position1: O? We don't know if O is at1? Feedback will tell? 
- Position2: C? If the word has duplicate C, might be ' - '? Or if not duplicate? But we place C at2? 
But we know C at3 is correct? So if the word has another C? Then C at2? 

But we guess to check? 

So I'll say.

Response: <guess>occur</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
     - A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (torch):** T(x), O(-), R(-), C(-), H(x)  
     - O is in the word but not in position 2.
     - R is not in position 3.
     - C is not in position 4.
     - T and H are not in the word.
   - **Guess 4 (micro):** M(x), I(x), C(✓), R(-), O(-)  
     - M and I are not in the word.
     - C is correct at position 3 (✓).
     - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since got ""-"" at that position).
     - O is in the word but not in position 5 (since got ""-"" at that position).

2. **Current Constraints:**
   - **Confirmed Letters & Positions:** 
     - Position 3 must be **C**.
   - **Present Letters (incorrect positions):** 
     - **R**: Cannot be in positions 2 (from Guess 1), 3 (from Guess 2), or 4 (from Guess 4).
     - **O**: Cannot be in positions 2 (from Guess 2) or 5 (from Guess 4).
   - **Eliminated Letters:** A, N, E, T, H, M, I.
   - **Possible Positions for R and O:**
     - R must be at position 1 or 5 (only positions left).
     - O must be at position 1 or 4 (only positions left, as position 3 is occupied by C).
   - **Possible Letter Combinations:** The secret word must include R, O, C (at position 3), and two additional letters not eliminated. The remaining letters are from the alphabet excluding A, N, E, T, H, M, I (e.g., B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Scenario Analysis for R and O Positions:**  
   - **Case A:** R at position 1, O at position 4 → Word structure: `R ? C O ?`  
     - Requires new letters at positions 2 and 5. Possible words? Few common options: ""recoy"" (invalid), ""broco"" (invalid), ""recon"" (N eliminated). Unlikely.
   - **Case B:** R at position 5, O at position 1 → Word structure: `O ? C ? R`  
     - Requires new letters at positions 2 and 4. Possible words: ""occur"" (valid English word meaning ""to happen""). Uses U (not eliminated) at position 4, and the double C is acceptable due to positional inconsistency.
   - **Case C:** R at position 5, O at position 4 → Word structure: `? ? C O R`  
     - Requires new letters at positions 1 and 2. Possible words: ""decor"" (E eliminated), ""favor"" (A eliminated), ""macro"" (A eliminated). No valid options.

4. **Optimal Guess Selection:**  
   - ""occur"" (`O C C U R`) is the only common word fitting Case B:
     - O at position 1 (allowed).
     - C at position 2 (possible, since C is known at position 3 but may exist elsewhere).
     - C at position 3 (fixed and confirmed).
     - U at position 4 (not eliminated; U is untested).
     - R at position 5.  
   - This guess tests all unresolved positions:
     - Confirms if O is at position 1.
     - Tests if R is at position 5.
     - Checks for potential duplicate C (position 2).
     - Introduces U, a new vowel.
   - If invalid, Case B is ruled out, leaving Case A or unknown duplicates (with limited tries). No other common words fit the constraints, making ""occur"" the most efficient diagnostic guess.

<guess>occur</guess>",occur,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: micro -> M(x) I(x) C(✓) R(-) O(-)
This means:
- M: not in the word → eliminated.
- I: not in the word → eliminated.
- C: ✓ → correct position! So C is at position 3.
- R: - → in the word but wrong position. Since C is fixed at position 3, and R was guessed at position 4, it means R is not at position 4. But we already knew R is not at position 2 or 3? And now position 4 is incorrect? But wait, we know R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1) and position 3 (from guess2), and now from guess4 at position4? So R is not at 2,3,4? Then R must be at position 1 or 5? Since the word has 5 positions.
- O: - → in the word but wrong position. In ""micro"", O was at position 5? And feedback is -, so O is not at position 5.

Also, from previous feedback, O cannot be at position 2? Then O must be at position 1, 3, or 4? But position 3 is taken by C? Since C is fixed at position 3? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, O must be at position 1 or 4? 

Now, we know the secret word:
- Position 3: C (must be C)
- R is in the word but not at positions 2,3,4 → must be at 1 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at positions 2 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 4? But positions available: 1,2,4,5? However, position 3 is fixed? So positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: ? 
  3: C (fixed)
  4: ? 
  5: ?

O can be at 1 or 4? Because it cannot be at 2 (from earlier) and cannot be at 5 (from guess4)? And position3 is taken? So only positions 1 and 4 are possible for O.

Similarly, R can only be at 1 or 5.

But note: R and O cannot be at the same position? So they might be at 1? Or one at 1 and one at 5/4.

Case 1: If R is at 1, O cannot be at 1? Then O must be at 4? And R at 1.
Case 2: If R is at 5, then O must be at 1 or 4? 

But also, there are two more letters? Since we have three known letters: C, R, O? But O is not placed yet? Actually, the word has five positions: we know position3, we need to fill others.

Therefore, the secret word must contain C (at3), R, O, and two more letters.

We know eliminated letters: A, N, E, T, H, M, I.

So the letter set: we need two more letters that are not A,N,E,T,H,M,I? and from the remaining alphabet? and must form a word.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Now, we have constraints for positions:
- Position 1: Either R (if R is at1) or O (if O is at1) or a new letter? Because both R and O might not be at1? But R must be at1 or5? And O at1 or4? So:
  If R is at1, then O must be at4? 
  If R is at5, then O can be at1 or4? 

Also, for position2: We haven't fixed anything? But we know it's not R? Because R cannot be at2? So position2 must be some letter that is either new? Similarly, position4: if O is not there, then it must be the other letter.

We need to test? We have two tries left? We are on guess5? We have tried 4 guesses? So two left? Actually, the user didn't specify? But we can proceed.

But we must make a guess? We need to disambiguate R and O positions? 

We can consider words that test R at1 and O at4? Or the other combinations? But we can also test with new letters.

We know R must be at1 or5? O must be at1 or4? 

But we cannot have both at1? So the possibilities:

Case A: R at1, O at4
Case B: R at5, O at1
Case C: R at5, O at4

We need a word that fits one of these? But we don't know? So we should make a guess that helps distinguish? And also fits with the two new letters.

Moreover, we need to avoid eliminated letters? 

List the possibilities:

Option: Word structure:
- Case A: R _ C O _ 
  Position: 1:R, 2:?, 3:C, 4:O, 5:? 
  And R and O are placed? Then we need two new letters at positions 2 and 5.

- Case B: O _ C _ R
  Positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:C, 4:?, 5:R 
  New letters at 2 and 4.

- Case C: _ _ C O R 
  Positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:C, 4:O, 5:R 
  New letters at 1 and 2.

In Case C, we have R at5 and O at4? 

Now, we need a word that can fit one of these? And we have to choose a guess that maximizes information? Or directly solve? We can test a word that tries case B? Or case A? 

But we must form a valid English word.

We also know the word has C at3? So whatever we guess, position3 must be C? So we write: _ _ C _ _ 

We also have R and O? 

For Case A: R ? C O ? 
For Case B: O ? C ? R 
For Case C: ? ? C O R 

Let me think of possible words:

Case A: R ? C O ? 
- Possibilities: ""recoy""? Not a word? ""broco""? Not? 
Common words: like ""crook"" but C at3? R at1, O at4? Then O at5? Not. 
""rock?"" Not 5 letters? 
Actually, ""rocky"": R O C K Y -> but O at position2? But we know O cannot be at position2? Because from guess2, O is not at2? So invalid? So no word? 

But consider: In Case A: R at1, O at4? Positions: 1:R, 2:?, 3:C, 4:O, 5:?

We need letter at2 and5? So words: ""broco""? Not real? ""rucos""? Not? 

Perhaps not common in English? 

Case B: O _ C _ R 
Words: ""ocean""? But E? Eliminated? A? Eliminated? No? 
""occur"": O C C U R -> but duplicate C? And O at1, C at2? But we have C fixed at3? So not: because ""occur"" is O(1),C(2),C(3),U(4),R(5) -> but C at3? Yes? And O at1? Then R at5? 
But C at2? That would be another C? So secret word has two C? But we haven't seen any duplicate? 

""occur"": 
- Position1: O 
- Position2: C 
- Position3: C 
- Position4: U 
- Position5: R 

But the feedback: we know from previous that C is at3? So if we have ""occur"", then position3 is C? And also position2 is C? But our feedback from guess? We have only seen one C? 

In guess1: C at1 -> '-', meaning there's C? And in guess4: C at3 -> ✓? That doesn't say there are multiple? It's possible? But we don't know? 

So ""occur"" could be a candidate? Then:
- O at1? But we know O cannot be at position2? But position1 is fine? 
- C at position3? Fixed? And also C at position2? 
- R at5? 

Then O at1? Which is allowed? 

Case C: ? ? C O R 
Words: ""micro"" but changed? Or ""picor""? Not a word? 

Common words: ""scorn""? Not? But N eliminated? 
""decor""? D? Could be? But E? Eliminated? E is out? 
""favor""? V? But A? Eliminated? 
Therefore, back to ""occur""?

But we have eliminated M,I,T,H,A,N,E? So U? U is not eliminated? 

And we can try ""occur""? 

But ""occur"" has two C? And we see C in position3? Also, what about the other C? Position2? 

In the word? 

In Case B: ""occur"" → O, C, C, U, R? 

But positions: 
- Position1: O 
- Position2: C 
- Position3: C 
- Position4: U 
- Position5: R 

Feedback for O? We know O is at position1? And we can get feedback? 

But we are about to guess? We have R at5? And O at1? 

Also, does this match the previous requirements? 

From guess4 we guessed ""micro"": positions: M I C R O → and got feedback for O at5? Feedback: O(-) meaning O is in the word but not position5? Therefore, in ""occur"", O is at position1? Which is not position5? So it might be? 

Also, U: not eliminated? 

But we have C at position? Position2 is C? But we know from guess1 and guess2 that C is not at1? And guess2 C not at4? Guess4 C at3? But here C at2? And C at3? 

We have feedback only for positions? 

If secret word is ""occur"": 
- For guess4: micro → M(x), I(x), C(✓) at position3, R at4 → secret word R? Secret word R is at position5? So guess at position4: R? Secret: U at4? So R is not at4? Hence R(-) → it matches? 
- O at5? Guess O at5? Secret word O at1? So O(-) → it matches? 
- And M and I missing? ✓ 

Now for guess? We are on guess5? We need to guess? 

Can we guess ""occur""? 

But ""occur"" has letter C at position2? And position3? And we are about to guess? It might not? 

But ""occur"" is a word? Meaning is to happen? But in Wordle words? Accepted? 

Alternatively, other words? 

But Case A? R? C O? Words: ""rock?"" Not? ""croup""? C at1? No? So maybe Case A doesn't work? 

Case B: O ? C ? R → like ""occur"", ""oncer""? Not? 

Another word? ""outdo"": O at1? Then U? But D? And O again? But then C? Must have C? No? 

We need C? So position3 must be C? So always? 

Therefore, ""occur"" fits the pattern? 

But we have two letters: U and R? 

But we can try? 

But in ""occur"", R is at5? Which is allowed? 

Also, O is at1? And position2 is C? 

But we know O cannot be at position2? Position1 is fine? 

And R at5? 

So why not? 

But let me see if there is another word? 

Case C: ? ? C O R → with R at5? 

Words: like ""macro""? But R at5? But A? Eliminated? 
""decor"": E eliminated? 
""favor"": A eliminated? 
""micro"" we already guessed? 
""corps"": but S? And O at2? O cannot be at2? 
No good? 

Therefore, ""occur"" is a candidate? 

With U at position4? 

We haven't tested U? 

Hence, we can guess ""occur""? 

But note: we don't know if there is duplicate C? 

We might assume not? But we haven't received feedback about duplicates? 

For example, if we guessed a word with duplicate? 

But ""occur"" has two C? So it allows for that? 

Alternatively, there might be a word without duplicates that fits? 

Consider: 

Case B: O at1, R at5? 
Then positions: 
1:O, 2:?, 3:C, 4:?, 5:R 

We need letters at positions 2 and4? 

Letters not eliminated? And not A,N,E,T,H,M,I? 

So choose common? 

Possible English words? 
- O? C ? R 
- Example: ""occur"" with U at4? And C at2? 
But duplicated C? 

Without duplicate? For example, ""oaker""? Not English? 
""older""? O at1, L at2, D? E? Eliminated? 
""other"": O T H E R -> T,H,E eliminated? 
So hard? 

Another: ""opium""? No C? 
Must have C at3? 

So with C at3? 

So O ? C ? R 

Now, common endings? ""R"" 

For example, ""ocean""? But E,A? Eliminated? 
""occur"" seems the only one? 

Moreover, U? Not eliminated? We haven't tested U? 

Therefore, we guess ""occur"". 

But wait: another possibility? Case C: R at5? and O at4? Then positions: 
? ? C O R 

Then for positions 1 and2? 

Examples: ""micro"" but changed? ""decry""? D,E,C,R,Y? E eliminated? 
""lyric"": L,Y,R,I,C? But I eliminated? 
""magic"": M,A,G,I,C? M,A,I eliminated? 
No? 

Therefore, the best candidate is ""occur"". 

But we can consider Case A? With R at1? And O at4? Then positions: R ? C O ? 

Words: ""recap""? R,E,C,A,P -> A,E eliminated? 
""reck?"" Not? 
""recon"": R,E,C,O,N -> N eliminated? 
""r?c??"" 

Not common? 

Therefore, we go with ""occur"". 

So guess: ""occur""

But it's 5 letters? O-C-C-U-R? 

Yes. 

Feedback is expected to be: 
- Position1: O? We don't know if O is at1? Feedback will tell? 
- Position2: C? If the word has duplicate C, might be ' - '? Or if not duplicate? But we place C at2? 
But we know C at3 is correct? So if the word has another C? Then C at2? 

But we guess to check? 

So I'll say.

Response: <guess>occur</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
     - A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (torch):** T(x), O(-), R(-), C(-), H(x)  
     - O is in the word but not in position 2.
     - R is not in position 3.
     - C is not in position 4.
     - T and H are not in the word.
   - **Guess 4 (micro):** M(x), I(x), C(✓), R(-), O(-)  
     - M and I are not in the word.
     - C is correct at position 3 (✓).
     - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since got ""-"" at that position).
     - O is in the word but not in position 5 (since got ""-"" at that position).

2. **Current Constraints:**
   - **Confirmed Letters & Positions:** 
     - Position 3 must be **C**.
   - **Present Letters (incorrect positions):** 
     - **R**: Cannot be in positions 2 (from Guess 1), 3 (from Guess 2), or 4 (from Guess 4).
     - **O**: Cannot be in positions 2 (from Guess 2) or 5 (from Guess 4).
   - **Eliminated Letters:** A, N, E, T, H, M, I.
   - **Possible Positions for R and O:**
     - R must be at position 1 or 5 (only positions left).
     - O must be at position 1 or 4 (only positions left, as position 3 is occupied by C).
   - **Possible Letter Combinations:** The secret word must include R, O, C (at position 3), and two additional letters not eliminated. The remaining letters are from the alphabet excluding A, N, E, T, H, M, I (e.g., B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Scenario Analysis for R and O Positions:**  
   - **Case A:** R at position 1, O at position 4 → Word structure: `R ? C O ?`  
     - Requires new letters at positions 2 and 5. Possible words? Few common options: ""recoy"" (invalid), ""broco"" (invalid), ""recon"" (N eliminated). Unlikely.
   - **Case B:** R at position 5, O at position 1 → Word structure: `O ? C ? R`  
     - Requires new letters at positions 2 and 4. Possible words: ""occur"" (valid English word meaning ""to happen""). Uses U (not eliminated) at position 4, and the double C is acceptable due to positional inconsistency.
   - **Case C:** R at position 5, O at position 4 → Word structure: `? ? C O R`  
     - Requires new letters at positions 1 and 2. Possible words: ""decor"" (E eliminated), ""favor"" (A eliminated), ""macro"" (A eliminated). No valid options.

4. **Optimal Guess Selection:**  
   - ""occur"" (`O C C U R`) is the only common word fitting Case B:
     - O at position 1 (allowed).
     - C at position 2 (possible, since C is known at position 3 but may exist elsewhere).
     - C at position 3 (fixed and confirmed).
     - U at position 4 (not eliminated; U is untested).
     - R at position 5.  
   - This guess tests all unresolved positions:
     - Confirms if O is at position 1.
     - Tests if R is at position 5.
     - Checks for potential duplicate C (position 2).
     - Introduces U, a new vowel.
   - If invalid, Case B is ruled out, leaving Case A or unknown duplicates (with limited tries). No other common words fit the constraints, making ""occur"" the most efficient diagnostic guess.",Guess 5: occur -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) C(✓) C(✓) U(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
