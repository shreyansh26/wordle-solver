We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: we have B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Some good starting letters (besides the ones we already tried and failed) might include: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Example words: 
   ""sight"" -> uses S, I, G, H, T -> none of the forbidden letters.
   ""could"" -> but has C and we know C is out -> not allowed.
   ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> not allowed.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me think of a word: 
   ""slimy"" -> S, L, I, M, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
        S: allowed, L: allowed, I: allowed, M: allowed, Y: allowed.

 But is ""slimy"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ghost"" -> G, H, O, S, T -> no forbidden letters? 
        G, H, O, S, T are all allowed.

 ""ghost"" is a common word and might be a good choice.

 Another option: ""built"" -> but we need 5 letters, so ""build"" -> but has U, I, L, D -> but D is allowed? 
        But ""build"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""build"" is 5 letters: B,U,I,L,D.

 However, we have to avoid E and we are not using any forbidden. But let's check: 
        B: allowed, U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, D: allowed.

 But we might want to cover more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U.

 We haven't tested O or U yet. So maybe a word with O and U would be good.

 Example: ""pouty"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> all allowed.

 However, I think ""ghost"" is a solid choice because it has common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O).

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" -> S, T, O, M, P -> all allowed.

 But note: we have already tried S and T? Actually, we haven't tried them in the context of the secret word, but we know that in the first guess, S, T, O, M, P were not tried because we used ""crane"". Wait, no: the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x's, so the secret word does not contain any of C, R, A, N, E. But we haven't tested S, T, O, M, P, etc.

 So, I think ""ghost"" is a good candidate.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""shtik"" but that is not very common. 

 Alternatively, ""moult"" -> M, O, U, L, T -> all allowed.

 But I think ""ghost"" is a standard word.

 Let's go with ""ghost"".

 So, the next guess is ""ghost"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.

For the second guess, I selected ""ghost"" because:
- It uses common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O) not yet tested.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It provides broad coverage of new letters to gather more information.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. For ""ghost"": 
   - G, H, O, T are absent (x)
   - S is present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the last position (since in ""ghost"", S is the fourth letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

Therefore, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

We know the word must have an S, and it cannot be in the fourth position (because in ""ghost"" it was in the fourth and that was wrong).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (but not in the fourth position)
- Excludes the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones, so 17 left: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S is allowed and must be included.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that uses some of the available letters and includes S.

Let's think of common words that have S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible positions for S: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let me try to come up with words:

- If S is at the start: words like ""silly"" (but has I, L, Y) -> but we must check if the letters are allowed. 
  - S: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, Y: allowed -> but ""silly"" has two L's? Actually, ""silly"" is S,I,L,L,Y -> but L is allowed, so that's okay? However, we don't know if L is in the word or not.

But we have no information about other letters, so we need to test new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words:

- ""spiky"": S, P, I, K, Y -> all letters are allowed? 
  - S: allowed, P: allowed, I: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed. 
  - And S is in position 1 (not 4). 
  - This word is valid.

- ""sulky"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? 
  - S, U, L, K, Y: yes.

- ""skimp"": S, K, I, M, P -> all allowed.

- ""jumps"": J, U, M, P, S -> S is in the last position (5th) which is allowed. And all letters are allowed.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we have to remember that we only have 6 guesses total, and we are on the third.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word, we can try to put it in a different position to get more information about its location.

In ""ghost"", S was in position 4 and that was wrong. So we can try S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But we don't know which one is correct. So a word that has S in a new position might help.

Let me try to think of words that have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and use common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, Y.

We might avoid Q, X, Z for now because they are less common.

So, let's try:

- Position 1: S _ _ _ _ 
  - e.g., ""skulk"" -> but has K and U, L -> but ""skulk"" is valid? It means to wait or move stealthily. But it has two K's? S,K,U,L,K -> but K is allowed, so okay.

But we might prefer words without repeated letters to test more.

So, ""spiky"" (S in pos1) or ""skimp"" (S in pos1) are without repeats.

- Position 2: _ S _ _ _
  - e.g., ""usurp"" -> U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden! (from first guess: R is absent). So we cannot use R.

  - ""islet"" -> I,S,L,E,T -> but E and T are forbidden (E from first guess, T from second guess). So not allowed.

  - ""psst"" is not 5 letters.

  - ""basil"" -> B,A,S,I,L -> but A is forbidden (from first guess). So not allowed.

  - ""music"" -> M,U,S,I,C -> but C is forbidden. Not allowed.

  - ""dusky"" -> D,U,S,K,Y -> all allowed? D: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed. And S is in position 3? Wait: D (1), U (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). So S is in position 3. But we are considering position 2? This has S in position 3.

  - For position 2: ""psalm"" -> P,S,A,L,M -> but A is forbidden.

  - ""wispy"" -> W,I,S,P,Y -> S is in position 3? W(1), I(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). So not position 2.

  - ""asset"" -> A,S,S,E,T -> A and E and T forbidden.

  - ""issue"" -> I,S,S,U,E -> E forbidden.

  - ""lusty"" -> L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from second guess). Not allowed.

  - ""busby"" -> B,U,S,B,Y -> has two B's? And S is in position 3? B(1), U(2), S(3), B(4), Y(5). So not position 2.

  - It's hard to find a word with S in position 2 without forbidden letters.

  - How about ""disco"" -> D,I,S,C,O -> C and O forbidden.

  - ""fussy"" -> F,U,S,S,Y -> S in position 3? F(1), U(2), S(3), S(4), Y(5). Not position 2.

  - Maybe ""jisms"" -> but that might not be common. And S is in multiple positions.

  - Perhaps ""pushy"" -> P,U,S,H,Y -> but H is forbidden (from second guess). Not allowed.

  - I think it's difficult. Let me try position 3.

- Position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - e.g., ""basis"" -> B,A,S,I,S -> A forbidden.
  - ""daisy"" -> D,A,I,S,Y -> A forbidden.
  - ""lusty"" -> L,U,S,T,Y -> T forbidden.
  - ""mossy"" -> M,O,S,S,Y -> O forbidden.
  - ""pussy"" -> P,U,S,S,Y -> allowed? P: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, Y: allowed. But S is in position 3 and 4? We have two S's. The word is P-U-S-S-Y. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, in the feedback for ""ghost"", we had only one S and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word might have one or more S's? We don't know. But ""pussy"" is a valid word.

  - However, we might avoid words with repeated letters to test more letters.

  - ""fiscs"" -> not common.

  - ""busks"" -> B,U,S,K,S -> S in position 3 and 5? And K is allowed. But again, repeated S.

  - ""musky"" -> M,U,S,K,Y -> all allowed: M, U, S, K, Y. And S is in position 3. This is a good candidate.

- Position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - e.g., ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> O and C forbidden.
  - ""lupus"" -> L,U,P,U,S -> allowed? L, U, P, U, S -> U repeated, but allowed. And S at the end.
  - ""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> P repeated, but allowed? P, U, M, P, S -> and M, S allowed. But we have two P's.
  - ""jumps"" -> J,U,M,P,S -> all allowed: J, U, M, P, S. And S at the end. This is a good candidate.

So, we have several options:
1. ""spiky"" - S at start, tests S, P, I, K, Y.
2. ""musky"" - S at position 3, tests M, U, S, K, Y.
3. ""jumps"" - S at the end, tests J, U, M, P, S.

We want to maximize the information. Since we know S is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested yet. We tested S in position 4 (in ""ghost"") and it was wrong. So we haven't tested positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

But in ""musky"", S is in position 3, and in ""jumps"", S is in position 5, and in ""spiky"", S in position 1.

We also want to cover new letters. Let's compare:

- ""spiky"": letters S, P, I, K, Y -> all new except S (but we are testing S in a new position).
- ""musky"": letters M, U, S, K, Y -> all new except S, and note that K and Y are repeated from ""spiky"" if we choose that? But we haven't used them yet.
- ""jumps"": letters J, U, M, P, S -> all new except S.

We are on the third guess, so we can choose any.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters, and all these words do.

I think ""spiky"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests S in the first position. Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

Alternatively, ""jumps"" is good because it tests J and M, which are less common, but we might get more information.

But I think ""spiky"" is a solid choice.

Another word: ""sulky"" -> S, U, L, K, Y -> S in position 1, and tests U, L, K, Y.

But we have ""spiky"" and ""sulky"". Both are good.

I'll go with ""spiky"" because it has P and I, which are common.

So, the next guess is ""spiky"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""spiky"" is a valid English word (meaning having spikes).

Therefore, I choose ""spiky"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""ghost"" had G, H, O, T marked as absent (x), and S marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the fourth position.
  - G, H, O, T are also not in the word.

The secret word must include S (in a position other than fourth) and exclude all previously absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

For the next guess, I chose ""spiky"" because:
- It includes S (in position 1, a new position to test).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and uses new common letters (P, I, K, Y) to maximize information.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>spiky</guess>",spiky,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. For ""ghost"": 
   - G, H, O, T are absent (x)
   - S is present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the last position (since in ""ghost"", S is the fourth letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

Therefore, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

We know the word must have an S, and it cannot be in the fourth position (because in ""ghost"" it was in the fourth and that was wrong).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (but not in the fourth position)
- Excludes the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones, so 17 left: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S is allowed and must be included.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that uses some of the available letters and includes S.

Let's think of common words that have S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible positions for S: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

  - Maybe ""jisms"" -> but that might not be common. And S is in multiple positions.

  - Perhaps ""pushy"" -> P,U,S,H,Y -> but H is forbidden (from second guess). Not allowed.

  - I think it's difficult. Let me try position 3.

- Position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - e.g., ""basis"" -> B,A,S,I,S -> A forbidden.
  - ""daisy"" -> D,A,I,S,Y -> A forbidden.
  - ""lusty"" -> L,U,S,T,Y -> T forbidden.

  - ""fiscs"" -> not common.

  - ""busks"" -> B,U,S,K,S -> S in position 3 and 5? And K is allowed. But again, repeated S.

  - ""musky"" -> M,U,S,K,Y -> all allowed: M, U, S, K, Y. And S is in position 3. This is a good candidate.

- Position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - e.g., ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> O and C forbidden.
  - ""lupus"" -> L,U,P,U,S -> allowed? L, U, P, U, S -> U repeated, but allowed. And S at the end.
  - ""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> P repeated, but allowed? P, U, M, P, S -> and M, S allowed. But we have two P's.
  - ""jumps"" -> J,U,M,P,S -> all allowed: J, U, M, P, S. And S at the end. This is a good candidate.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: we have B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Some good starting letters (besides the ones we already tried and failed) might include: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Example words: 
   ""sight"" -> uses S, I, G, H, T -> none of the forbidden letters.
   ""could"" -> but has C and we know C is out -> not allowed.
   ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> not allowed.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me think of a word: 
   ""slimy"" -> S, L, I, M, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
        S: allowed, L: allowed, I: allowed, M: allowed, Y: allowed.

 But is ""slimy"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ghost"" -> G, H, O, S, T -> no forbidden letters? 
        G, H, O, S, T are all allowed.

 ""ghost"" is a common word and might be a good choice.

 Another option: ""built"" -> but we need 5 letters, so ""build"" -> but has U, I, L, D -> but D is allowed? 
        But ""build"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""build"" is 5 letters: B,U,I,L,D.

 However, we have to avoid E and we are not using any forbidden. But let's check: 
        B: allowed, U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, D: allowed.

 But we might want to cover more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U.

 We haven't tested O or U yet. So maybe a word with O and U would be good.

 Example: ""pouty"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> all allowed.

 However, I think ""ghost"" is a solid choice because it has common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O).

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" -> S, T, O, M, P -> all allowed.

 But note: we have already tried S and T? Actually, we haven't tried them in the context of the secret word, but we know that in the first guess, S, T, O, M, P were not tried because we used ""crane"". Wait, no: the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x's, so the secret word does not contain any of C, R, A, N, E. But we haven't tested S, T, O, M, P, etc.

 So, I think ""ghost"" is a good candidate.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""shtik"" but that is not very common. 

 Alternatively, ""moult"" -> M, O, U, L, T -> all allowed.

 But I think ""ghost"" is a standard word.

 Let's go with ""ghost"".

 So, the next guess is ""ghost"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.

For the second guess, I selected ""ghost"" because:
- It uses common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O) not yet tested.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It provides broad coverage of new letters to gather more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ghost -> FEEDBACK: G(x) H(x) O(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. For ""ghost"": 
   - G, H, O, T are absent (x)
   - S is present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the last position (since in ""ghost"", S is the fourth letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

Therefore, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

We know the word must have an S, and it cannot be in the fourth position (because in ""ghost"" it was in the fourth and that was wrong).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (but not in the fourth position)
- Excludes the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones, so 17 left: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S is allowed and must be included.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that uses some of the available letters and includes S.

Let's think of common words that have S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible positions for S: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let me try to come up with words:

- If S is at the start: words like ""silly"" (but has I, L, Y) -> but we must check if the letters are allowed. 
  - S: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, Y: allowed -> but ""silly"" has two L's? Actually, ""silly"" is S,I,L,L,Y -> but L is allowed, so that's okay? However, we don't know if L is in the word or not.

But we have no information about other letters, so we need to test new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words:

- ""spiky"": S, P, I, K, Y -> all letters are allowed? 
  - S: allowed, P: allowed, I: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed. 
  - And S is in position 1 (not 4). 
  - This word is valid.

- ""sulky"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? 
  - S, U, L, K, Y: yes.

- ""skimp"": S, K, I, M, P -> all allowed.

- ""jumps"": J, U, M, P, S -> S is in the last position (5th) which is allowed. And all letters are allowed.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we have to remember that we only have 6 guesses total, and we are on the third.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word, we can try to put it in a different position to get more information about its location.

In ""ghost"", S was in position 4 and that was wrong. So we can try S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But we don't know which one is correct. So a word that has S in a new position might help.

Let me try to think of words that have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and use common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, Y.

We might avoid Q, X, Z for now because they are less common.

So, let's try:

- Position 1: S _ _ _ _ 
  - e.g., ""skulk"" -> but has K and U, L -> but ""skulk"" is valid? It means to wait or move stealthily. But it has two K's? S,K,U,L,K -> but K is allowed, so okay.

But we might prefer words without repeated letters to test more.

So, ""spiky"" (S in pos1) or ""skimp"" (S in pos1) are without repeats.

- Position 2: _ S _ _ _
  - e.g., ""usurp"" -> U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden! (from first guess: R is absent). So we cannot use R.

  - ""islet"" -> I,S,L,E,T -> but E and T are forbidden (E from first guess, T from second guess). So not allowed.

  - ""psst"" is not 5 letters.

  - ""basil"" -> B,A,S,I,L -> but A is forbidden (from first guess). So not allowed.

  - ""music"" -> M,U,S,I,C -> but C is forbidden. Not allowed.

  - ""dusky"" -> D,U,S,K,Y -> all allowed? D: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed. And S is in position 3? Wait: D (1), U (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). So S is in position 3. But we are considering position 2? This has S in position 3.

  - For position 2: ""psalm"" -> P,S,A,L,M -> but A is forbidden.

  - ""wispy"" -> W,I,S,P,Y -> S is in position 3? W(1), I(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). So not position 2.

  - ""asset"" -> A,S,S,E,T -> A and E and T forbidden.

  - ""issue"" -> I,S,S,U,E -> E forbidden.

  - ""lusty"" -> L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from second guess). Not allowed.

  - ""busby"" -> B,U,S,B,Y -> has two B's? And S is in position 3? B(1), U(2), S(3), B(4), Y(5). So not position 2.

  - It's hard to find a word with S in position 2 without forbidden letters.

  - How about ""disco"" -> D,I,S,C,O -> C and O forbidden.

  - ""fussy"" -> F,U,S,S,Y -> S in position 3? F(1), U(2), S(3), S(4), Y(5). Not position 2.

  - Maybe ""jisms"" -> but that might not be common. And S is in multiple positions.

  - Perhaps ""pushy"" -> P,U,S,H,Y -> but H is forbidden (from second guess). Not allowed.

  - I think it's difficult. Let me try position 3.

- Position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - e.g., ""basis"" -> B,A,S,I,S -> A forbidden.
  - ""daisy"" -> D,A,I,S,Y -> A forbidden.
  - ""lusty"" -> L,U,S,T,Y -> T forbidden.
  - ""mossy"" -> M,O,S,S,Y -> O forbidden.
  - ""pussy"" -> P,U,S,S,Y -> allowed? P: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, Y: allowed. But S is in position 3 and 4? We have two S's. The word is P-U-S-S-Y. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, in the feedback for ""ghost"", we had only one S and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word might have one or more S's? We don't know. But ""pussy"" is a valid word.

  - However, we might avoid words with repeated letters to test more letters.

  - ""fiscs"" -> not common.

  - ""busks"" -> B,U,S,K,S -> S in position 3 and 5? And K is allowed. But again, repeated S.

  - ""musky"" -> M,U,S,K,Y -> all allowed: M, U, S, K, Y. And S is in position 3. This is a good candidate.

- Position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - e.g., ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> O and C forbidden.
  - ""lupus"" -> L,U,P,U,S -> allowed? L, U, P, U, S -> U repeated, but allowed. And S at the end.
  - ""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> P repeated, but allowed? P, U, M, P, S -> and M, S allowed. But we have two P's.
  - ""jumps"" -> J,U,M,P,S -> all allowed: J, U, M, P, S. And S at the end. This is a good candidate.

So, we have several options:
1. ""spiky"" - S at start, tests S, P, I, K, Y.
2. ""musky"" - S at position 3, tests M, U, S, K, Y.
3. ""jumps"" - S at the end, tests J, U, M, P, S.

We want to maximize the information. Since we know S is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested yet. We tested S in position 4 (in ""ghost"") and it was wrong. So we haven't tested positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

But in ""musky"", S is in position 3, and in ""jumps"", S is in position 5, and in ""spiky"", S in position 1.

We also want to cover new letters. Let's compare:

- ""spiky"": letters S, P, I, K, Y -> all new except S (but we are testing S in a new position).
- ""musky"": letters M, U, S, K, Y -> all new except S, and note that K and Y are repeated from ""spiky"" if we choose that? But we haven't used them yet.
- ""jumps"": letters J, U, M, P, S -> all new except S.

We are on the third guess, so we can choose any.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters, and all these words do.

I think ""spiky"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests S in the first position. Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

Alternatively, ""jumps"" is good because it tests J and M, which are less common, but we might get more information.

But I think ""spiky"" is a solid choice.

Another word: ""sulky"" -> S, U, L, K, Y -> S in position 1, and tests U, L, K, Y.

But we have ""spiky"" and ""sulky"". Both are good.

I'll go with ""spiky"" because it has P and I, which are common.

So, the next guess is ""spiky"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""spiky"" is a valid English word (meaning having spikes).

Therefore, I choose ""spiky"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""ghost"" had G, H, O, T marked as absent (x), and S marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the fourth position.
  - G, H, O, T are also not in the word.

The secret word must include S (in a position other than fourth) and exclude all previously absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T.

For the next guess, I chose ""spiky"" because:
- It includes S (in position 1, a new position to test).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and uses new common letters (P, I, K, Y) to maximize information.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → None of these letters are in the word.
2. **Guess 2: ghost** → G(x), H(x), O(x), S(-), T(x) → S is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was tried in position 4 and marked as wrong position). G, H, O, T are not in the word.
3. **Guess 3: spiky** → S(✓), P(x), I(✓), K(x), Y(✓) → 
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
   - P and K are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- **Correct positions**: 
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 5: Y
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T, P, K (all marked as x in the feedbacks).
- **Present letter**: We already accounted for S, I, Y which are correct. Also from guess 2, we know S is present (but was in wrong position then, now we know it's at position 1).

Additionally, from guess 2, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we know it's at position 1. Since S is at position 1, that explains why it was marked as wrong position in guess 2 (because it was misplaced).

So the secret word pattern so far is: S _ I _ Y

We have the second and fourth positions missing. The second position is unknown, and the fourth position is unknown.

We also know that the word contains only letters that haven't been ruled out. Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T, P, K. So we can't use these.

Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and of course S, I, Y are already placed and used).

But note: the word might have repeated letters? However, so far we haven't seen any indication of duplicates. But we should not rule out completely. However, in the feedback for ""spiky"", we have S, I, Y correct and P and K absent, so no additional letters.

Now, the word must be of the form: S _ I _ Y

We need to fill in positions 2 and 4 with letters from the available set (excluding the absent letters).

Available letters for position 2 and 4: B, D, F, J, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly Q but rare).

We need to choose a word that matches S?I?Y.

Let's list possible words:

- S L I V Y → ""slivy"" — not a word.
- S M I T Y → ""smity"" — not a word, and T is absent? T is in the absent list (from guess 2: T(x)).
- S L I B Y → ""sliby"" — not a word.
- S W I B Y → ""swiby"" — not a word.
- S L I M Y → ""slimy"" — valid word! S-L-I-M-Y.
- S U I V Y → ""suivy"" — not common; ""suivy"" isn't standard.
- S L I F Y → ""slify"" — not a word.
- S L I D Y → ""slidy"" — not standard, or ""slydy"" no.
- S L I V Y — no.
- S B I L Y → ""sbil y"" — not possible.

Other possibilities:
- ""silly"" — S-I-L-L-Y → pattern S?I?Y, so position 2 would be L, position 4 would be L → S L I L Y. But is that valid? ""silly"" is a word. However, we have two L's? But are L's allowed? Yes, L hasn't been tested or ruled out.

But note: in ""silly"", the pattern is S I L L Y? Wait, let's break:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: I? But in the pattern we have position 3 as I, so position 2 must be a different letter.

Actually: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: Y

So ""silly"" would be S (1), I (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5) — that doesn't match because position 3 should be I, but in ""silly"", position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be I. So ""silly"" is S-I-L-L-Y, not S-?-I-?-Y.

The correct pattern is S _ I _ Y, meaning:
- First letter: S
- Second letter: unknown
- Third letter: I
- Fourth letter: unknown
- Fifth letter: Y

So the word is of the form: S X I Z Y, where X and Z are the missing letters.

Now, words that fit:
- ""slimy"" — S-L-I-M-Y → L for position 2, M for position 4.
- ""shily"" — but H is absent (from guess 2: H(x)), so not allowed.
- ""skyey"" — too long.
- ""sowey"" — not 5 letters.
- ""sulky"" — S-U-L-K-Y → but K is absent from guess 3 (K(x)), so not allowed.
- ""smily"" — S-M-I-L-Y → M for position 2, L for position 4. But is ""smily"" a word? It might be an archaic or variant spelling of ""smiley"", but often considered not a separate word. However, ""smiley"" is six letters. So probably not.
- ""silyb"" — no.
- ""wispy"" — W not first.

Common words: 
- ""slimy"" seems the most straightforward. Let me confirm if there are others.
- ""spiky"" we already guessed, which is S-P-I-K-Y, but we ruled out P and K.
- ""silty"" — S-I-L-T-Y → pattern: if we build it, it would be S(1), I(2) but then position 3 would be L? But we need position 3 to be I. Wait: ""silty"" is S-I-L-T-Y, so position 3 is L, not I. So not matching.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of that fits S _ I _ Y with the available letters is ""slimy"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: Y

Both L and M are not ruled out (they haven't been tried before).

Also, we must ensure there are no forbidden letters: L and M are in the available set.

So, the word should be ""slimy"".

But let me double-check if ""slimy"" uses any absent letters:
- S: correct position
- L: not tested before → allowed
- I: correct position
- M: not tested before → allowed
- Y: correct position

And absent letter list: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,O,T,P,K — none of which are L or M.

So ""slimy"" is a valid candidate.

Are there other possibilities? 
- What about ""swimy""? Not a word.
- ""sdivy""? Not a word.
- ""sjiyb""? No.
- ""sfumy""? Not common; ""sfumato"" is art term but not 5-letter word ending with Y.

So, ""slimy"" seems the most plausible.

Therefore, we should guess ""slimy"".

But note: we are only on guess 4, and we have the pattern nearly solved, so this might be it.

### Thought Process Step by Step:

1. **Summary of Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**:
     - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (ghost)**:
     - G(x), H(x), O(x), S(-), T(x): S is in the word but not in position 4. G, H, O, T are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (spiky)**:
     - S(✓), P(x), I(✓), K(x), Y(✓): S is correct in position 1, I is correct in position 3, Y is correct in position 5. P and K are absent.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - The secret word must start with S (position 1), have I in position 3, and end with Y (position 5).
   - Pattern: **S _ I _ Y** (positions 2 and 4 are unknown).
   - Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T, P, K. These letters cannot appear in the word.
   - Available letters: B, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S, I, Y are already placed).

3. **Filling Positions 2 and 4**:
   - Position 2: Must be one of the available letters (e.g., B, D, F, J, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z).
   - Position 4: Similarly constrained to available letters.
   - **Possible Words**:
     - Slimy: S (1), L (2), I (3), M (4), Y (5).
     - Other combinations like ""sbimy"" or ""swivy"" are invalid words.
   - ""Slimy"" fits perfectly:
     - L and M are not ruled out by previous feedback.
     - It is a valid English word meaning ""having a slimy texture"".

4. **Cross-Check**:
   - Avoids all forbidden letters (e.g., no P, K, G, etc.).
   - Confirms S, I, Y positions from Guess 3.
   - Uses new letters (L, M) to test remaining uncertainty.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - ""Slimy"" is the most plausible guess given the pattern and feedback. If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, it provides critical info for the next guess.

<guess>slimy</guess>",slimy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → None of these letters are in the word.
2. **Guess 2: ghost** → G(x), H(x), O(x), S(-), T(x) → S is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was tried in position 4 and marked as wrong position). G, H, O, T are not in the word.
3. **Guess 3: spiky** → S(✓), P(x), I(✓), K(x), Y(✓) → 
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
   - P and K are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- **Correct positions**: 
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 5: Y
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T, P, K (all marked as x in the feedbacks).
- **Present letter**: We already accounted for S, I, Y which are correct. Also from guess 2, we know S is present (but was in wrong position then, now we know it's at position 1).

Additionally, from guess 2, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we know it's at position 1. Since S is at position 1, that explains why it was marked as wrong position in guess 2 (because it was misplaced).

So the secret word pattern so far is: S _ I _ Y

We have the second and fourth positions missing. The second position is unknown, and the fourth position is unknown.

We also know that the word contains only letters that haven't been ruled out. Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, T, P, K. So we can't use these.

Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and of course S, I, Y are already placed and used).

But note: the word might have repeated letters? However, so far we haven't seen any indication of duplicates. But we should not rule out completely. However, in the feedback for ""spiky"", we have S, I, Y correct and P and K absent, so no additional letters.

Now, the word must be of the form: S _ I _ Y

We need to fill in positions 2 and 4 with letters from the available set (excluding the absent letters).

Available letters for position 2 and 4: B, D, F, J, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly Q but rare).

We need to choose a word that matches S?I?Y.

Let's list possible words:

- S L I V Y → ""slivy"" — not a word.
- S M I T Y → ""smity"" — not a word, and T is absent? T is in the absent list (from guess 2: T(x)).
- S L I B Y → ""sliby"" — not a word.
- S W I B Y → ""swiby"" — not a word.
- S L I M Y → ""slimy"" — valid word! S-L-I-M-Y.
- S U I V Y → ""suivy"" — not common; ""suivy"" isn't standard.
- S L I F Y → ""slify"" — not a word.
- S L I D Y → ""slidy"" — not standard, or ""slydy"" no.
- S L I V Y — no.
- S B I L Y → ""sbil y"" — not possible.

Other possibilities:
- ""silly"" — S-I-L-L-Y → pattern S?I?Y, so position 2 would be L, position 4 would be L → S L I L Y. But is that valid? ""silly"" is a word. However, we have two L's? But are L's allowed? Yes, L hasn't been tested or ruled out.

But note: in ""silly"", the pattern is S I L L Y? Wait, let's break:

Actually: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: Y

So ""silly"" would be S (1), I (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5) — that doesn't match because position 3 should be I, but in ""silly"", position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be I. So ""silly"" is S-I-L-L-Y, not S-?-I-?-Y.

The correct pattern is S _ I _ Y, meaning:
- First letter: S
- Second letter: unknown
- Third letter: I
- Fourth letter: unknown
- Fifth letter: Y

So the word is of the form: S X I Z Y, where X and Z are the missing letters.

Now, words that fit:
- ""slimy"" — S-L-I-M-Y → L for position 2, M for position 4.
- ""shily"" — but H is absent (from guess 2: H(x)), so not allowed.
- ""skyey"" — too long.
- ""sowey"" — not 5 letters.
- ""sulky"" — S-U-L-K-Y → but K is absent from guess 3 (K(x)), so not allowed.
- ""smily"" — S-M-I-L-Y → M for position 2, L for position 4. But is ""smily"" a word? It might be an archaic or variant spelling of ""smiley"", but often considered not a separate word. However, ""smiley"" is six letters. So probably not.
- ""silyb"" — no.
- ""wispy"" — W not first.

Common words: 
- ""slimy"" seems the most straightforward. Let me confirm if there are others.
- ""spiky"" we already guessed, which is S-P-I-K-Y, but we ruled out P and K.
- ""silty"" — S-I-L-T-Y → pattern: if we build it, it would be S(1), I(2) but then position 3 would be L? But we need position 3 to be I. Wait: ""silty"" is S-I-L-T-Y, so position 3 is L, not I. So not matching.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of that fits S _ I _ Y with the available letters is ""slimy"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: Y

Both L and M are not ruled out (they haven't been tried before).

Also, we must ensure there are no forbidden letters: L and M are in the available set.

So, the word should be ""slimy"".

But let me double-check if ""slimy"" uses any absent letters:
- S: correct position
- L: not tested before → allowed
- I: correct position
- M: not tested before → allowed
- Y: correct position

And absent letter list: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,O,T,P,K — none of which are L or M.

So ""slimy"" is a valid candidate.

Are there other possibilities? 
- What about ""swimy""? Not a word.
- ""sdivy""? Not a word.
- ""sjiyb""? No.
- ""sfumy""? Not common; ""sfumato"" is art term but not 5-letter word ending with Y.
