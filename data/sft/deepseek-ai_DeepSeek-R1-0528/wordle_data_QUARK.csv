We are making the first guess. There are no prior clues, so we want to choose a word that can give us maximum information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and try to cover multiple common vowels and consonants.
 Some commonly used starting words are: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", etc. Let's choose one that has a mix.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels: A, E (and sometimes R is considered vowel-like)
 - It has two common consonants: C, R, N

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

I'm starting with the word ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This combination tests three vowels (A and E – R can sometimes function vowel-like) and two common consonants (C, N), helping gather broad information about the secret word's letter composition and positions efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E). Therefore, the third letter of the secret word is A.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. Since the third position is taken by A, R must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note that position 4 and 5 are currently unknown.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (because we know that's correct).
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the second position (because in the first guess R was in the second position and it was marked as wrong position). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Avoids the letters C, N, and E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to test other letters to get more information. We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

We know the word has an A in the third position and an R somewhere else.

Let me think of words that have A in the third position and include R, and avoid C, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- _ _ A _ _

We can try to put R in the first position? For example: R _ A _ _
But we need to fill the other blanks. We must avoid C, N, E.

What about ""RADAR""? But that has two R's and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, it has D and R again. But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. However, in the feedback for the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So if the word has two R's, we might get more information.

But let's avoid using duplicate letters for now to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try ""RAPID""? But we have to avoid E and we don't know about P, I, D.

But note: we haven't tested P, I, D, so that would be good.

But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have R in the fourth or fifth position.

Another idea: since we know A is in the third position, we can try to use a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Let me list some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We should try to include some of these.

Possible words with A in the third position and R in the first, fourth, or fifth:

- R in first: R _ A _ _
  - Words: RATIO (but has O and I, and T) -> but note we haven't tested T, I, O. Also, avoids C, N, E.
  - RABID (has B, I, D) -> but B and D are new.
  - RADIO (has D, I, O) -> but O is a vowel.

- R in fourth: _ _ A R _
  - Words: BOARD (has B, O, D) -> but O and D are new. Also, we have B and D to test.
  - GUARD (has G, U, D) -> G and U are new.
  - HEARD (has H, E, D) -> but E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.

- R in fifth: _ _ A _ R
  - Words: LEMAR (but has L, E, M -> E is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - SUGAR (has S, U, G) -> avoids E, C, N.

But note: we must avoid E, C, N.

So let's consider:

Option 1: R in first position: R _ A _ _
  - We can try ""RATIO"": R, A (third), T, I, O. This tests T, I, O and has R in first (which is a new position for R). Also, no duplicate letters and avoids C, N, E.

Option 2: R in fourth position: _ _ A R _
  - We can try ""BOARD"": B, O, A (third), R, D. Tests B, O, D. Avoids C, N, E.

Option 3: R in fifth position: _ _ A _ R
  - We can try ""SUGAR"": S, U, G, A (third), R. Tests S, U, G. Avoids C, N, E.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize the information we get. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

In ""RATIO"": we test R (in new position), T, I, O -> 4 new letters (T, I, O) and R in a different position.

In ""BOARD"": we test B, O, D -> 3 new letters.

In ""SUGAR"": we test S, U, G -> 3 new letters.

So ""RATIO"" tests more new letters (4, but note R is already known, so actually 3 new: T, I, O) and also places R in the first position to check if that's correct.

But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position, but by putting it there we can get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in the first position but tests more common letters? But we have to include R somewhere.

Another idea: we know R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like first, fourth, or fifth) and also test other common consonants.

I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in the third position (required).
- It has R in the first position (which is a new position for R, so we can see if it's correct or not).
- It tests T, I, O which are common letters.

If R is in the first position, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash for R if it's in the word but in a different position? But wait, we already know R is in the word, so if it's not in first, then we'll get a dash and know that R is in the fourth or fifth. Also, we get feedback on T, I, O.

So let's go with ""RATIO"".

But note: the word ""RATIO"" is valid.

Therefore, my second guess is ""RATIO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the word (marked with x).
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ✓).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must have A in the 3rd position.
- It must include R (in position 1, 4, or 5).
- It must avoid C, N, and E.
- To maximize information, I'll test new common letters (like T, I, O) and place R in a new position (1st) to verify its location.

The word ""RATIO"" fits these criteria:
- A is in the 3rd position.
- R is in the 1st position (a new position to test).
- It introduces new letters: T, I, O.
- It avoids C, N, E.

  - We can try ""BOARD"": B, O, A (third), R, D. Tests B, O, D. Avoids C, N, E.

Option 3: R in fifth position: _ _ A _ R
  - We can try ""SUGAR"": S, U, G, A (third), R. Tests S, U, G. Avoids C, N, E.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize the information we get. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

In ""RATIO"": we test R (in new position), T, I, O -> 4 new letters (T, I, O) and R in a different position.

In ""BOARD"": we test B, O, D -> 3 new letters.

In ""SUGAR"": we test S, U, G -> 3 new letters.

So ""RATIO"" tests more new letters (4, but note R is already known, so actually 3 new: T, I, O) and also places R in the first position to check if that's correct.

But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position, but by putting it there we can get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in the first position but tests more common letters? But we have to include R somewhere.

Another idea: we know R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like first, fourth, or fifth) and also test other common consonants.

I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in the third position (required).
- It has R in the first position (which is a new position for R, so we can see if it's correct or not).
- It tests T, I, O which are common letters.

If R is in the first position, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash for R if it's in the word but in a different position? But wait, we already know R is in the word, so if it's not in first, then we'll get a dash and know that R is in the fourth or fifth. Also, we get feedback on T, I, O.

So let's go with ""RATIO"".

But note: the word ""RATIO"" is valid.

Therefore, my second guess is ""RATIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the word (marked with x).
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ✓).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must have A in the 3rd position.
- It must include R (in position 1, 4, or 5).
- It must avoid C, N, and E.
- To maximize information, I'll test new common letters (like T, I, O) and place R in a new position (1st) to verify its location.

The word ""RATIO"" fits these criteria:
- A is in the 3rd position.
- R is in the 1st position (a new position to test).
- It introduces new letters: T, I, O.
- It avoids C, N, E.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).

Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
- R is again marked as present but wrong position, but now in the 1st position? Wait, in ""ratio"", R is the first letter, and it's marked as (-) meaning it is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is now in the second position? In ""ratio"", A is the second letter? Wait no: R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). But the feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. But we already know A is the 3rd letter from guess 1. So this is contradictory? Let me double-check.

In guess 1: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
So A is correctly in position 3.

In guess 2: ratio -> positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> Feedback: R(-) [so R is in word, but not position 1], A(-) [A is in word but not position 2], T(x), I(x), O(x)

The feedback for A in guess 2 is A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. However, we know from guess 1 that A is in position 3. So why is it marked as (-)? Because in guess 2, A is in position 2, which is not the same as position 3. And since we know the secret word has A in position 3, so when we put A in position 2, it is indeed in the word but not in the correct position (because correct position is 3). So that makes sense: the symbol refers to the position in the guess.

So from guess 2:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1 (we already knew from guess 1 it wasn't in 2, so now not in 1 either).
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (we already know it is in 3, so this is consistent).
- T, I, O are not in the word.

Thus, we have:
- Letters not in word: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Letters in word: R, A (and we know A is in position 3)
- Position of A: fixed at position 3.

Moreover, R is in the word, but neither position 1 nor 2 (from guess 1 R was in position 2 and was -, now in position 1 and also -, so R must be in position 4 or 5).

Also, we need to find the secret word which has 5 letters, A at position 3, R at either position 4 or 5, and no C, N, E, T, I, O.

Additionally, we have tried 10 different letters, and we know 2 are in the word: A and R. There are 3 more letters to find.

We must choose a word that:
- Has 5 letters, A in 3rd position.
- R in 4th or 5th position.
- Avoids letters C, N, E, T, I, O.
- Contains R and A.

Since R is only in positions 4 or 5, we can consider two cases.

Also, we need to test other letters. We have many common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.

We should make a guess that tests common letters and sets R in either 4th or 5th to see which one it is.

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries total.

Let's plan:

Option 1: Assume R is in 4th position: then word pattern: _ _ A R _
Option 2: Assume R is in 5th position: then word pattern: _ _ A _ R

But we don't know which one, so we should design a guess that helps us determine R's position and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have R? But wait, we must include R? No, we are not required to include R. However, if we don't include R, we might not get information about its position. But we know R is in the word, so we want to pin down the position.

But in Wordle, you don't have to use all known letters in every guess; sometimes it's good to test other letters. However, since we know two letters and have limited unknown spots, let's list possible positions.

The word has: position 1: unknown, position 2: unknown, position 3: A, position 4: unknown or R, position 5: unknown or R.

But from feedback, R cannot be in 1 or 2, so it must be in 4 or 5.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A [R or letter4] [R or letter5]

And if R is in 4, then position 5 is a new letter; if R is in 5, then position 4 is a new letter.

Now, the letters we cannot use: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We want to form a valid English word under these constraints.

Let's generate some possibilities.

First, if R is in position 4: then word is _ _ A R ?

We need a 5-letter word ending with R? No: if R is in 4, then position 5 can be another letter, and the word must be valid.

Words like: _ _ A R _
Examples: BOARD, GUARD, HEARD (but E is not allowed), LARD? But LARD has letters: L, A, R, D -> but positions: L in 1, A in 3? Wait, no: positions must be: [1] [2] A[3] R[4] [5]. So word must be of the form ??A R?.

Actually, BOARD: B-O-A-R-D -> positions: B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). But O is not allowed? We know O is not in the word because in guess 2, O was at position 5 and was x. So O cannot be in the word. Similarly, T, I not allowed.

So BOARD has O -> invalid.

GUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> U at position 2, U is still allowed (we haven't tested U). And avoid O? Wait, no O in GUARD. Letters: G, U, A, R, D.

We have avoided forbidden letters? Forbidden: C, N, E, T, I, O are not in GUARD.

Similarly, HEARD: forbidden E -> not allowed.

WARD? Not 5 letters.

BARD: B-A-R-D -> but that's 4 letters? No, 5 letters? BARD is 4.

What about CARD? But C forbidden.

What about ""PARKA""? But that has P, A (but we need two A?), PARKA: P-A-R-K-A -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), A(5). But we have A at position 2 and 5, but we know A is fixed at position 3? So the word must have A at position 3. Therefore, PARKA has A at 1 and 5? No: P(1)-A(2)? Wait, if written as P-A-R-K-A, then A is at position 2 and 5? No, positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:K, 5:A. So position 3 is R, but we need A at position 3. So not matching.

Another word: ""MARSH""? But S and H. Positions: M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position 3? No. Not matching the pattern.

We need words where A is specifically position 3.

If R is in position 4: pattern: _ _ A R _

Examples: 
- GUARD: G(1) U(2) A(3) R(4) D(5) -> G, U, D allowed? Yes, not forbidden. And the word is valid.
- BARD? Not 5 letters.
- ""YARD"" only 4.
- ""HARDY""? H-A-R-D-Y -> positions: H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> not A at position 3.
- ""LARVA"": L(1) A(2) R(3) V(4) A(5) -> again A at 2 and 5? Not 3.
- ""PARTY"": P(1) A(2) R(3) T(4) -> forbidden T.

It seems ""GUARD"" is a candidate.

Now, if R is in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ R

Examples: 
- SUGAR: S(1) U(2) G(3) A(4) R(5) -> but A is at 4? Not 3.
We need A at position 3: so _ _ A [letter] R

Like: GLAUR? Not word.
""LIAR"" -> too short.
""DELAR"" not word.
""SEDAR"" not common.
""VAPOR"" forbidden O and V? But O forbidden.
""WAFER"" forbidden E? Yes, E forbidden.
""PALAR"" not Wordle word? Not standard.
""JABAR"" not standard.

What are common words?
- ""RADAR"": R(1) A(2) D(3) A(4) R(5) -> but position 2 is A? We need position 3 to be A? No.

It might be harder to find words with R at the end and A at position 3.

But a common one might be: ""PIZAR"" not word.

Actually, I know ""TIDAR"" not word.

Similarly, ""PADAR"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOLAR""? S-O-L-A-R -> O forbidden, and A is at position 4? Not 3.

Is there a word with the pattern * * A * R ?

For example: ""DECAY"" but forbidden E and D? Wait, not forbidden D and Y? Decay: D(1) E(2) C(3) A(4) Y(5) -> no, not A at position 3.

Another: ""FATAL"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> T forbidden, A at position 3? Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:T? But T forbidden? Yes T forbidden, and also A at position 2 and 4? Not 3.

Perhaps ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T -> T forbidden, and A at 2.

Not finding good examples.

What about ""BASIL""? But I forbidden? Guess 2 I was x, so forbidden.

Actually, a better way: let's think of words ending with R and having A in position 3.

Examples: ""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R -> O forbidden? Yes.

""SUGAR"": S-U-G-A-R -> letters: S,U,G,A,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need A at position 3? Here G at 3 and A at 4? No.

""LUMAR""? not common.

Maybe words like ""ALARM"": A-L-A-R-M -> position 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M. So here position 3 is A? Yes! So ""ALARM"" has:
Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:A? Wait, but there are two A. The word is A-L-A-R-M -> so:
Letter 1: A
Letter 2: L
Letter 3: A -> yes, so A at position 3? Correct? But then letter 1 is also A? Wait, so we have A at two positions?

We know A is at position 3, but it could be present elsewhere? The feedback from guess 1 only showed A at position 3 as ✓, but it doesn't say that A cannot be elsewhere. However, in guess 2, when we put A at position 2, it showed -, meaning the A is present but not in that position? Since we know from guess 1 that there is an A and it is at position 3, so if there is only one A, then in guess 2 the A would be expected to be -, which it was.

But in ""ALARM"", there are two A's: one at position 1 and one at position 3? So if A is at both positions, then in the feedback:

In guess 1: crane, we had A at position 3: ✓ -> correct.
In guess 2: ratio, we had A at position 2: since there is no A at position 2 in secret? But if secret has A at position 1 and 3, then when we put A at position 2? It shouldn't be correct? But also, it is present? Well, it depends on the rules: usually in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, the feedback can be tricky. 

In this case, for secret ""ALARM"":
- Feedback for ""crane"": 
  - C: not in -> x
  - R: in the secret: at position 4? So in ""crane"", R is at position 2: no match? So should be -, yes.
  - A: at position 3: match with secret position 3: ✓.
  - N: not in -> x
  - E: not in -> x -> matches guess1 feedback.

Now guess2: ""ratio"" against ""ALARM"":
- R: in secret: position 4? But we put R at position 1: wrong? So should be -, but secret has no R at position 1? So -, correct.
- A: we put at position 2: secret has A at position 1 and 3? So at position 2: secret has L? So no A at position 2. But there is A in the word? Then it should be -, because at position 2 there is L? So we should mark A as present? But wait: in Wordle rules, if you guess a letter that is in the word but not in that position, you get -, but if there are multiple, it can be complicated? Actually, for ""ratio"": R at1, A at2, T at3, I at4, O at5.
Secret: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.

So for R: guessed at1, secret has R at4: not at1, but R is present? So -.
For A: guessed at2, secret has A at1 and3? But no A at2? So there is an A in the word? But we haven't given - to A? But wait, only one A? Since we already accounted for the A at position 3? Actually, in the feedback, we have:
- R: present but not position1 -> -
- A: we guessed A at2, secret has A at1 and3? The first occurrence: secret position1 A, we have A at2? No direct match? Then it depends on rule: typically, since the secret has two A's, we can mark the guessed A as present because the secret includes at least one extra A? But in standard Wordle feedback: for each letter in guess, mark green if exact match, then yellow for matches in wrong position but only if the letter has not been counted already? For A: we have two A in secret? So when guessing A at position2: position2 of secret is L? So no direct match? Then we can mark A in guess2 as yellow because there is another A? But then in feedback, we do mark A as - (yellow). So feedback A is -, which we received.

And for T: position3? Secret position3 is A? So no match? And no other T? So x -> matches: T(x)
I: x
O: x

So ""ALARM"" is a possible word? But wait: ""ALARM"" has A at position1? We didn't know about that. But is that possible? Yes.

Back to our case? We were considering possible words.

So for pattern: _ _ A _ R ... but wait: in ""ALARM"": it's A L A R M -> so letter1 is A? We don't know? So pattern: letter1 is A? But we haven't tested A in position1? In fact, from our feedback: in guess1 A was at position3? And in guess2 A was at position2? And got -, so if secret has A at position1 and we haven't guessed it? Then A in position1 would exist? So ""ALARM"" with positions: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.

And R at position4? Not position5? But we can have R at4.

Similarly, a word like ""BAWAR"" rare? Not common.

Another possibility: ""SAVOR"" forbidden O? No.

Another common word: ""TODAY"" -> T forbidden, A at4? No.

Or ""BACON"" forbidden O and N? Well, forbidden letters.

Another possibility with R at position5? Pattern: _ _ A _ R

For example: ""SUPAR"" not a word? ""SUPAR""? Not standard.

""SHAIR"" not common.

""STAIR"" has T and I? Both forbidden? Yes T and I.

""CHAIK"" not word.

It seems harder? But I know ""PALAR"" not word? Or ""JAZAR"" not word.

Perhaps ""BARREL""? But two R? And more than 5? No.

Wait: a word like ""SABER"" but forbidden E? Yes.

""NAVAL"" N forbidden.

Thus, perhaps the only common word with A at position3 and R in the word (at position4) is ""GUARD"" or ""ALARM"" or other.

Another: ""DIARY"" forbidden I? Yes.

""HAIR"" too short.

So likely? Candidates: GUARD, ALARM.

But GUARD: if secret is GUARD: G U A R D.
Then in guess1: crane -> C not, R in word? R at secret position4? But in crane R at guess position2? No match? And A at position3: match? Because secret A at3? Yes. So ✓ for A.

Then in guess2: ratio -> R at1? Secret has no R at1? So -, A at2? Secret position2 is U? Not A? So -, T not, I not, O not? -> matches feedback.

Now, for ALARM: as above also matches feedback.

But in ALARM: there is an additional A at position1? Could that be?

But in our guess1: crane, we had C, R, A, N, E: only A was ✓? And at position3? So for A? We accounted for A at position3? But if there is an extra A? That doesn't show in feedback? Because in feedback, we only mark for each guessed letter? So for crane, we guessed A at position3: and since secret has A at position3? We mark ✓? But the extra A at position1? Because we didn't guess a letter at position1? That letter is not accounted? So it wouldn't show? So ALARM is possible? Similarly, GUARD has no extra A? But both are possible?

But wait: in guess1: crane? We didn't have any A at other positions? So we don't know if there are multiple A.

Thus, possible candidates: GUARD? But also others? And ALARM.

How about ""GAWKY""? But no A at position3? Only one A? Position2: G-A-W-K-Y? Not position3.

So back: we need to choose a word for guess3 that tests letters?

If we guess GUARD:

Pattern: G U A R D -> all letters new? G, U, D? And R in position4? We know R is in the word.

But R is at position4? If we guess GUARD? And if R is at position4? Then we get G at1?, U at2? Etc.

But if the word is GUARD? Then we solve it.

But if it is ALARM? Then we don't? And we'll get feedback?

Similarly, we can guess ALARM? But ALARM has A at the beginning? Which we haven't tested? And if we guess ALARM? Then it has two A? But we'll get feedback.

But we are limited in letters? Also, we must avoid forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests other positions and letters? Without necessarily including R? Because we want to determine the first two letters and the last letter.

For example? We know A at position3? So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4 or R] [letter5 or R]

Suppose we choose a word that tries common? But note: we cannot use forbidden? So available letters? Many: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.

But we don't know the position of R? It is either position4 or position5? So best to test that.

So let's try to include R in position4 or 5? And test common letters? Or we can try to exclude possibilities.

But an efficient way? Since we have two cases? We can choose a word that has R in position5? To see if it's there? Or not.

For example? Guess a word with pattern: _ _ A _ R? But we saw it's hard to find? Or with A at3 and R at5.

Let's find one? Despite the challenge? We can use ""SUPER"" but E forbidden? And pattern... 

""PAPER"" forbidden E? and P? Also A? But position3: we have A? So in ""PAPER"": P(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), R(5) -> not A at3? Position3 is P? No.

""RAPER"" forbidden E? Similarly.

""TAPIR"" forbidden T and I? And not A at3.

Another? ""AZURA"" not word.

Perhaps ""JASPER"" too long? ""JASPER"" is not 5? No, 6.

Wait? Common words? ""LARCO"" forbidden O? Not.

Oh? How about ""SAVOR""? But O forbidden? And not pattern? S-A-V-O-R -> A at position2.

Not.

""VAPAR"" not standard.

Another idea: ""ZEBRA"" forbidden E? Yes.

So maybe no common word? But there is ""WATER"" forbidden T and E? Yes.

For the pattern? Wait, I remember ""CHAIR"" forbidden C and I? Yes.

Perhaps ""MOWER"" forbidden O and E? Yes.

Thus? The only common ones? are likely GUARD and ALARM? But ALARM has A at position1? And we haven't tested it.

Now? Another candidate? ""HEARD"" forbidden E? Yes.

""HEARD"" is H-E-A-R-D -> E forbidden? Cannot use.

""PARTY"" forbidden T? Yes.

Thus, if there is an R at position4? Then possible words are few? Including GUARD? And ALARM? although ALARM has an extra A.

Also? ""AWARD"" -> A-W-A-R-D -> positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). So that fits? A at position1,3? And R at4? Letters: W and D? Not forbidden.

Thus? ""AWARD"" is possible? And A-W-A-R-D? Not forbidden letters.

Therefore? Candidates? For secret word: GUARD? ALARM? AWARD? All have A at position3 and R at position4? And vary in other letters.

But note? GUARD? U at position2? ALARM? L at position2? AWARD? W at position2? And then letter1: G? A? A? A? For GUARD? G at1? For ALARM and AWARD? A at1.

But? In guess1? We had crane? If secret has A at position1? Then when we guessed crane with no A at position1? The feedback only showed A at position3 as ✓? And nothing else? So we didn't detect A at position1? Because we didn't guess position1.

Similarly? For guess2? ratio? If secret has A at position1? We guessed A at position2? And secret has no A at position2? But has A at position1? So feedback would still give A as? Yellow? Correct because A is in the word? So we do get A(-)? As we got.

So? Multiple A in secret are possible.

Thus? For third guess? We? Can guess a word that distinguishes between these? Or can be any valid word.

But we want information.

Now? To test for R's position? If we put R in a different position? Since R must be in4 or5? We can try a word with R in position4? Or position5? To see.

But for position5? It's hard to find a word for the pattern _ _ A _ R? So maybe not? Alternatively? Guess a word with R in a completely new? But we have no position left except 4 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are not? And 3 is A? R must be in4 or5.

Perhaps we can guess GUARD? Which has R in position4? So if we get R-? Then means R is not in position4? Or ✓? Then it is.

Similarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? We win? But if not? We get information.

Similarly? Guess ALARM? Or AWARD.

But? We can guess a word that doesn't include R? To test other letters? But then we don't get information on R's position? But we might deduce it later.

Example: avoid R? Then pattern? For example: guess ""SULKY"" -> S U L K Y? But doesn't have A at3? We must have A at position3? So any? Guess must have A at position3? Because we know it's there? And? The position3 letter is fixed to A.

So? Our guess must have A in position3? To satisfy that.

Thus? Guess pattern: ? ? A ? ?

And include letters not forbidden? And if we want to test R at4? We can put R in4? Or not.

Let me list available letters? Let's try to find a word that includes many common letters? And? Has A in position3.

For example: SALAD? S A L A D -> has A at position2 and4? But not position3? Position3 is L? So not SALAD? That's S-A-L-A-D? Positions:1 S, 2 A, 3 L, 4 A, 5 D? Not A at3.

Words with A at3: 
- P _ A _ _
- For example: P L A N T? But N and T forbidden? N and T are forbidden? Yes.
- P L A S H? Not common? And not familiar
- SPEAK? S P E A K -> E forbidden.
- BEAKS? E forbidden.
- BREAK? E forbidden.
- DRAWL? D R, but R is known? And pattern: D-R-A-W-L? But A is at position3? Yes: so D(1) R(2) A(3) W(4) or L(5)? No: D-R-A-W-L is positions:1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L? But in secret? R cannot be at position2? Because in guess1 we had R at position2 and was marked as wrong position? And for ""DRAWL""? If R is at position2? But secret has R in it? At position4 or5? But in DRAWL we have in position2 R? That's forbidden? R cannot be at position2? But ""DRAWL"" of course has R at position2? And that position is disallowed? So we cannot use a word that has R in position2? Because we know R must not be at position2.

Similarly? R cannot be at position1 from guess2.

So? For guess3? R cannot be at position1 or position2? So if we include R? It must be in position4 or5.

And? We must have A in position3.

So? Guess pattern: position1: not R, not C,N,E,T,I,O? So new letter.
Position2: new letter? Not R? And not forbidden.
Position3: A
Position4: if we put R? or new? But if we don't put R? Then it's new letter.
Position5: new letter.

But if we put R in either4 or5.

For example? S L A P M? But 'SLAPM' not word.

B L A Z E? E forbidden.

FLASH? F L A S H -> positions:1:F,2:L,3:A,4:S,5:H? Sounds good? Common word? And avoids forbidden letters? Letters tested: F, L, S, H? And we don't include R? So if R is in secret? We expect to get feedback for R? But we didn't include R in the guess? So how will feedback show R? It won't? Because we are not guessing R? So we won't know if it's there or not? But we know it is there from before.

But since we know R is in the word? If we guess a word without R? Then the feedback will not mention? But it will show the yellow and green for our guess? But for R? We won't get new information? So we need to keep in mind? But we can still guess it.

But? Guess ""FLASH""?

However? We know the secret has R? But in our guess ""FLASH""? We don't have R? So after guess? The feedback will tell us only about F,L,A,S,H.

But? If we aim to reduce the possibilities? Why not guess a word that will tell us about the R position immediately.

Since there are common words? Like GUARD, AWARD, ALARM? We can guess one of them? To test.

For example? Guess ""GUARD""?

If GUARD is secret? Bingo.

But if not? Then feedback will tell us which letters are correct.

If secret is ALARM? And we guess GUARD?

Guessing GUARD when secret is ALARM:

G at1? Secret has A? So G not in word? x
U at2? Secret has L? So U not in word? x
A at3: match? ✓
R at4: match? ✓ (secret is R at4)
D at5? Secret has M? So D not? x

So feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)

Which tells us? Positions 3 and 4 are A and R? And letters G,U,D not in word.

But we already knew that? Mostly? Not U? Now we know U is not in word.

Similarly? If secret is AWARD? Guess GUARD:

G at1? Secret has A? So x? 
U at2? Secret has W? So U not? x?
A at3: ✓
R at4: ✓
D at5: ✓? Since AWARD has D? So D✓?

Secret AWARD: A-W-A-R-D -> positions:1:A,2:W,3:A,4:R,5:D
GUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> 
G? Not A? x
U? Not W? x
A? Secret position3: A? So ✓
R? Position4: R? ✓
D? Position5: secret D? so ✓

So feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)

But then we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D? So word is ? ? A R D? So AWARD? BARDY? Etc? But BARDY? Is valid? Or LARDY? Etc? But we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D. And first letter is not G or U? But second? Etc.

Thus? By guessing GUARD? We get much information.

Similarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? Then win.

Otherwise? We'll get some positions.

Moreover? We can also consider guessing ""AWARD""? Or ""ALARM""? But GUARD seems a good test.

Also? GUARD is a valid word? And uses new letters: G,U,D? Which are untested? So good.

So? Guess ""GUARD"".

Third guess: GUARD

Now? In thinking step? We are to make the guess based on available information.

Therefore? I will guess ""GUARD"".
</think>
Building on the previous feedback, the key deductions and reasoning are as follows:

1. **From Guess 1 (""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x))**:
   - A is firmly in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - R is present in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - C, N, and E are absent from the word.

2. **From Guess 2 (""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x))**:
   - R is still present but not in the 1st position (combining with Guess 1, it can't be in positions 1 or 2).
   - A is confirmed present but not in the 2nd position (consistent with its known correct 3rd position from Guess 1).
   - T, I, and O are absent from the word.

3. **Constraints Update**:
   - **Position**: A must be in position 3. R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1 or 2).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O are eliminated. Remaining letters are possible.
   - **Present Letters**: A (position 3) and R (position 4 or 5) are confirmed.
   - **Structure**: The word follows one of two patterns based on R's position:
     - R in position 4: `_ _ A R _`
     - R in position 5: `_ _ A _ R`

4. **Strategy for Third Guess**:
   - Test R's exact position while leveraging common letters to maximize information.
   - ""GUARD"" is chosen as a test word because:
     - It satisfies the pattern `_ _ A R _` (R in position 4).
     - Positions: G (1st), U (2nd), A (3rd), R (4th), D (5th). This places A correctly and R in a new position.
     - Letters G, U, D are untested and common; including them can verify their presence or absence.
     - If ""GUARD"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will clarify R's position and key letters:
       - If G is correct/absent, U correct/absent, or D correct/absent, it narrows down the word pool significantly.
       - Feedback on R's position (e.g., ✓ or -) will confirm if R belongs in position 4 or 5.
     - Alternatives like ""AWARD"" or ""ALARM"" were considered but omitted to prioritize testing new letters (G, U, D) over duplicating A tests, per feedback.

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If R is in position 4, R gets ✓ and feedback on other letters refines options.
   - If R is in position 5, R gets (-), indicating R must be in position 5.
   - Absentee feedback for G, U, D eliminates more letters.

Thus, ""GUARD"" tests R's position efficiently while introducing high-yield new letters.

<guess>guard</guess>",guard,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).

Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
- R is again marked as present but wrong position, but now in the 1st position? Wait, in ""ratio"", R is the first letter, and it's marked as (-) meaning it is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is now in the second position? In ""ratio"", A is the second letter? Wait no: R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). But the feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. But we already know A is the 3rd letter from guess 1. So this is contradictory? Let me double-check.

In guess 1: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
So A is correctly in position 3.

In guess 2: ratio -> positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> Feedback: R(-) [so R is in word, but not position 1], A(-) [A is in word but not position 2], T(x), I(x), O(x)

The feedback for A in guess 2 is A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. However, we know from guess 1 that A is in position 3. So why is it marked as (-)? Because in guess 2, A is in position 2, which is not the same as position 3. And since we know the secret word has A in position 3, so when we put A in position 2, it is indeed in the word but not in the correct position (because correct position is 3). So that makes sense: the symbol refers to the position in the guess.

So from guess 2:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1 (we already knew from guess 1 it wasn't in 2, so now not in 1 either).
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (we already know it is in 3, so this is consistent).
- T, I, O are not in the word.

Thus, we have:
- Letters not in word: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Letters in word: R, A (and we know A is in position 3)
- Position of A: fixed at position 3.

Moreover, R is in the word, but neither position 1 nor 2 (from guess 1 R was in position 2 and was -, now in position 1 and also -, so R must be in position 4 or 5).

Also, we need to find the secret word which has 5 letters, A at position 3, R at either position 4 or 5, and no C, N, E, T, I, O.

Additionally, we have tried 10 different letters, and we know 2 are in the word: A and R. There are 3 more letters to find.

We must choose a word that:
- Has 5 letters, A in 3rd position.
- R in 4th or 5th position.
- Avoids letters C, N, E, T, I, O.
- Contains R and A.

Since R is only in positions 4 or 5, we can consider two cases.

Also, we need to test other letters. We have many common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.

We should make a guess that tests common letters and sets R in either 4th or 5th to see which one it is.

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries total.

Let's plan:

Option 1: Assume R is in 4th position: then word pattern: _ _ A R _
Option 2: Assume R is in 5th position: then word pattern: _ _ A _ R

But we don't know which one, so we should design a guess that helps us determine R's position and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have R? But wait, we must include R? No, we are not required to include R. However, if we don't include R, we might not get information about its position. But we know R is in the word, so we want to pin down the position.

But in Wordle, you don't have to use all known letters in every guess; sometimes it's good to test other letters. However, since we know two letters and have limited unknown spots, let's list possible positions.

The word has: position 1: unknown, position 2: unknown, position 3: A, position 4: unknown or R, position 5: unknown or R.

But from feedback, R cannot be in 1 or 2, so it must be in 4 or 5.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A [R or letter4] [R or letter5]

And if R is in 4, then position 5 is a new letter; if R is in 5, then position 4 is a new letter.

Now, the letters we cannot use: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We want to form a valid English word under these constraints.

Let's generate some possibilities.

First, if R is in position 4: then word is _ _ A R ?

We need a 5-letter word ending with R? No: if R is in 4, then position 5 can be another letter, and the word must be valid.

Words like: _ _ A R _
Examples: BOARD, GUARD, HEARD (but E is not allowed), LARD? But LARD has letters: L, A, R, D -> but positions: L in 1, A in 3? Wait, no: positions must be: [1] [2] A[3] R[4] [5]. So word must be of the form ??A R?.

Actually, BOARD: B-O-A-R-D -> positions: B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). But O is not allowed? We know O is not in the word because in guess 2, O was at position 5 and was x. So O cannot be in the word. Similarly, T, I not allowed.

So BOARD has O -> invalid.

GUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> U at position 2, U is still allowed (we haven't tested U). And avoid O? Wait, no O in GUARD. Letters: G, U, A, R, D.

We have avoided forbidden letters? Forbidden: C, N, E, T, I, O are not in GUARD.

Similarly, HEARD: forbidden E -> not allowed.

WARD? Not 5 letters.

BARD: B-A-R-D -> but that's 4 letters? No, 5 letters? BARD is 4.

What about CARD? But C forbidden.

What about ""PARKA""? But that has P, A (but we need two A?), PARKA: P-A-R-K-A -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), A(5). But we have A at position 2 and 5, but we know A is fixed at position 3? So the word must have A at position 3. Therefore, PARKA has A at 1 and 5? No: P(1)-A(2)? Wait, if written as P-A-R-K-A, then A is at position 2 and 5? No, positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:K, 5:A. So position 3 is R, but we need A at position 3. So not matching.

Another word: ""MARSH""? But S and H. Positions: M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position 3? No. Not matching the pattern.

We need words where A is specifically position 3.

If R is in position 4: pattern: _ _ A R _

Examples: 
- GUARD: G(1) U(2) A(3) R(4) D(5) -> G, U, D allowed? Yes, not forbidden. And the word is valid.
- BARD? Not 5 letters.
- ""YARD"" only 4.
- ""HARDY""? H-A-R-D-Y -> positions: H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> not A at position 3.
- ""LARVA"": L(1) A(2) R(3) V(4) A(5) -> again A at 2 and 5? Not 3.
- ""PARTY"": P(1) A(2) R(3) T(4) -> forbidden T.

It seems ""GUARD"" is a candidate.

Now, if R is in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ R

Examples: 
- SUGAR: S(1) U(2) G(3) A(4) R(5) -> but A is at 4? Not 3.
We need A at position 3: so _ _ A [letter] R

Like: GLAUR? Not word.
""LIAR"" -> too short.
""DELAR"" not word.
""SEDAR"" not common.
""VAPOR"" forbidden O and V? But O forbidden.
""WAFER"" forbidden E? Yes, E forbidden.
""PALAR"" not Wordle word? Not standard.
""JABAR"" not standard.

What are common words?
- ""RADAR"": R(1) A(2) D(3) A(4) R(5) -> but position 2 is A? We need position 3 to be A? No.

It might be harder to find words with R at the end and A at position 3.

But a common one might be: ""PIZAR"" not word.

Actually, I know ""TIDAR"" not word.

Similarly, ""PADAR"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOLAR""? S-O-L-A-R -> O forbidden, and A is at position 4? Not 3.

Is there a word with the pattern * * A * R ?

For example: ""DECAY"" but forbidden E and D? Wait, not forbidden D and Y? Decay: D(1) E(2) C(3) A(4) Y(5) -> no, not A at position 3.

Another: ""FATAL"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> T forbidden, A at position 3? Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:T? But T forbidden? Yes T forbidden, and also A at position 2 and 4? Not 3.

Perhaps ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T -> T forbidden, and A at 2.

Not finding good examples.

What about ""BASIL""? But I forbidden? Guess 2 I was x, so forbidden.

Actually, a better way: let's think of words ending with R and having A in position 3.

Examples: ""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R -> O forbidden? Yes.

""SUGAR"": S-U-G-A-R -> letters: S,U,G,A,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need A at position 3? Here G at 3 and A at 4? No.

""LUMAR""? not common.

Maybe words like ""ALARM"": A-L-A-R-M -> position 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M. So here position 3 is A? Yes! So ""ALARM"" has:
Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:A? Wait, but there are two A. The word is A-L-A-R-M -> so:
Letter 1: A
Letter 2: L
Letter 3: A -> yes, so A at position 3? Correct? But then letter 1 is also A? Wait, so we have A at two positions?

We know A is at position 3, but it could be present elsewhere? The feedback from guess 1 only showed A at position 3 as ✓, but it doesn't say that A cannot be elsewhere. However, in guess 2, when we put A at position 2, it showed -, meaning the A is present but not in that position? Since we know from guess 1 that there is an A and it is at position 3, so if there is only one A, then in guess 2 the A would be expected to be -, which it was.

But in ""ALARM"", there are two A's: one at position 1 and one at position 3? So if A is at both positions, then in the feedback:

In guess 1: crane, we had A at position 3: ✓ -> correct.
In guess 2: ratio, we had A at position 2: since there is no A at position 2 in secret? But if secret has A at position 1 and 3, then when we put A at position 2? It shouldn't be correct? But also, it is present? Well, it depends on the rules: usually in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, the feedback can be tricky. 

In this case, for secret ""ALARM"":
- Feedback for ""crane"": 
  - C: not in -> x
  - R: in the secret: at position 4? So in ""crane"", R is at position 2: no match? So should be -, yes.
  - A: at position 3: match with secret position 3: ✓.
  - N: not in -> x
  - E: not in -> x -> matches guess1 feedback.

Now guess2: ""ratio"" against ""ALARM"":
- R: in secret: position 4? But we put R at position 1: wrong? So should be -, but secret has no R at position 1? So -, correct.
- A: we put at position 2: secret has A at position 1 and 3? So at position 2: secret has L? So no A at position 2. But there is A in the word? Then it should be -, because at position 2 there is L? So we should mark A as present? But wait: in Wordle rules, if you guess a letter that is in the word but not in that position, you get -, but if there are multiple, it can be complicated? Actually, for ""ratio"": R at1, A at2, T at3, I at4, O at5.
Secret: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.

So for R: guessed at1, secret has R at4: not at1, but R is present? So -.
For A: guessed at2, secret has A at1 and3? But no A at2? So there is an A in the word? But we haven't given - to A? But wait, only one A? Since we already accounted for the A at position 3? Actually, in the feedback, we have:
- R: present but not position1 -> -
- A: we guessed A at2, secret has A at1 and3? The first occurrence: secret position1 A, we have A at2? No direct match? Then it depends on rule: typically, since the secret has two A's, we can mark the guessed A as present because the secret includes at least one extra A? But in standard Wordle feedback: for each letter in guess, mark green if exact match, then yellow for matches in wrong position but only if the letter has not been counted already? For A: we have two A in secret? So when guessing A at position2: position2 of secret is L? So no direct match? Then we can mark A in guess2 as yellow because there is another A? But then in feedback, we do mark A as - (yellow). So feedback A is -, which we received.

And for T: position3? Secret position3 is A? So no match? And no other T? So x -> matches: T(x)
I: x
O: x

So ""ALARM"" is a possible word? But wait: ""ALARM"" has A at position1? We didn't know about that. But is that possible? Yes.

Back to our case? We were considering possible words.

So for pattern: _ _ A _ R ... but wait: in ""ALARM"": it's A L A R M -> so letter1 is A? We don't know? So pattern: letter1 is A? But we haven't tested A in position1? In fact, from our feedback: in guess1 A was at position3? And in guess2 A was at position2? And got -, so if secret has A at position1 and we haven't guessed it? Then A in position1 would exist? So ""ALARM"" with positions: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.

And R at position4? Not position5? But we can have R at4.

Similarly, a word like ""BAWAR"" rare? Not common.

Another possibility: ""SAVOR"" forbidden O? No.

Another common word: ""TODAY"" -> T forbidden, A at4? No.

Or ""BACON"" forbidden O and N? Well, forbidden letters.

Another possibility with R at position5? Pattern: _ _ A _ R

For example: ""SUPAR"" not a word? ""SUPAR""? Not standard.

""SHAIR"" not common.

""STAIR"" has T and I? Both forbidden? Yes T and I.

""CHAIK"" not word.

It seems harder? But I know ""PALAR"" not word? Or ""JAZAR"" not word.

Perhaps ""BARREL""? But two R? And more than 5? No.

Wait: a word like ""SABER"" but forbidden E? Yes.

""NAVAL"" N forbidden.

Thus, perhaps the only common word with A at position3 and R in the word (at position4) is ""GUARD"" or ""ALARM"" or other.

Another: ""DIARY"" forbidden I? Yes.

""HAIR"" too short.

So likely? Candidates: GUARD, ALARM.

But GUARD: if secret is GUARD: G U A R D.
Then in guess1: crane -> C not, R in word? R at secret position4? But in crane R at guess position2? No match? And A at position3: match? Because secret A at3? Yes. So ✓ for A.

Then in guess2: ratio -> R at1? Secret has no R at1? So -, A at2? Secret position2 is U? Not A? So -, T not, I not, O not? -> matches feedback.

Now, for ALARM: as above also matches feedback.

But in ALARM: there is an additional A at position1? Could that be?

But in our guess1: crane, we had C, R, A, N, E: only A was ✓? And at position3? So for A? We accounted for A at position3? But if there is an extra A? That doesn't show in feedback? Because in feedback, we only mark for each guessed letter? So for crane, we guessed A at position3: and since secret has A at position3? We mark ✓? But the extra A at position1? Because we didn't guess a letter at position1? That letter is not accounted? So it wouldn't show? So ALARM is possible? Similarly, GUARD has no extra A? But both are possible?

But wait: in guess1: crane? We didn't have any A at other positions? So we don't know if there are multiple A.

Thus, possible candidates: GUARD? But also others? And ALARM.

How about ""GAWKY""? But no A at position3? Only one A? Position2: G-A-W-K-Y? Not position3.

So back: we need to choose a word for guess3 that tests letters?

If we guess GUARD:

Pattern: G U A R D -> all letters new? G, U, D? And R in position4? We know R is in the word.

But R is at position4? If we guess GUARD? And if R is at position4? Then we get G at1?, U at2? Etc.

But if the word is GUARD? Then we solve it.

But if it is ALARM? Then we don't? And we'll get feedback?

Similarly, we can guess ALARM? But ALARM has A at the beginning? Which we haven't tested? And if we guess ALARM? Then it has two A? But we'll get feedback.

But we are limited in letters? Also, we must avoid forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests other positions and letters? Without necessarily including R? Because we want to determine the first two letters and the last letter.

For example? We know A at position3? So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4 or R] [letter5 or R]

Suppose we choose a word that tries common? But note: we cannot use forbidden? So available letters? Many: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.

But we don't know the position of R? It is either position4 or position5? So best to test that.

So let's try to include R in position4 or 5? And test common letters? Or we can try to exclude possibilities.

But an efficient way? Since we have two cases? We can choose a word that has R in position5? To see if it's there? Or not.

For example? Guess a word with pattern: _ _ A _ R? But we saw it's hard to find? Or with A at3 and R at5.

Let's find one? Despite the challenge? We can use ""SUPER"" but E forbidden? And pattern... 

""PAPER"" forbidden E? and P? Also A? But position3: we have A? So in ""PAPER"": P(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), R(5) -> not A at3? Position3 is P? No.

""RAPER"" forbidden E? Similarly.

""TAPIR"" forbidden T and I? And not A at3.

Another? ""AZURA"" not word.

Perhaps ""JASPER"" too long? ""JASPER"" is not 5? No, 6.

Wait? Common words? ""LARCO"" forbidden O? Not.

Oh? How about ""SAVOR""? But O forbidden? And not pattern? S-A-V-O-R -> A at position2.

Not.

""VAPAR"" not standard.

Another idea: ""ZEBRA"" forbidden E? Yes.

So maybe no common word? But there is ""WATER"" forbidden T and E? Yes.

For the pattern? Wait, I remember ""CHAIR"" forbidden C and I? Yes.

Perhaps ""MOWER"" forbidden O and E? Yes.

Thus? The only common ones? are likely GUARD and ALARM? But ALARM has A at position1? And we haven't tested it.

Now? Another candidate? ""HEARD"" forbidden E? Yes.

""HEARD"" is H-E-A-R-D -> E forbidden? Cannot use.

""PARTY"" forbidden T? Yes.

Thus, if there is an R at position4? Then possible words are few? Including GUARD? And ALARM? although ALARM has an extra A.

Also? ""AWARD"" -> A-W-A-R-D -> positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). So that fits? A at position1,3? And R at4? Letters: W and D? Not forbidden.

Thus? ""AWARD"" is possible? And A-W-A-R-D? Not forbidden letters.

Therefore? Candidates? For secret word: GUARD? ALARM? AWARD? All have A at position3 and R at position4? And vary in other letters.

But note? GUARD? U at position2? ALARM? L at position2? AWARD? W at position2? And then letter1: G? A? A? A? For GUARD? G at1? For ALARM and AWARD? A at1.

But? In guess1? We had crane? If secret has A at position1? Then when we guessed crane with no A at position1? The feedback only showed A at position3 as ✓? And nothing else? So we didn't detect A at position1? Because we didn't guess position1.

Similarly? For guess2? ratio? If secret has A at position1? We guessed A at position2? And secret has no A at position2? But has A at position1? So feedback would still give A as? Yellow? Correct because A is in the word? So we do get A(-)? As we got.

So? Multiple A in secret are possible.

Thus? For third guess? We? Can guess a word that distinguishes between these? Or can be any valid word.

But we want information.

Now? To test for R's position? If we put R in a different position? Since R must be in4 or5? We can try a word with R in position4? Or position5? To see.

But for position5? It's hard to find a word for the pattern _ _ A _ R? So maybe not? Alternatively? Guess a word with R in a completely new? But we have no position left except 4 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are not? And 3 is A? R must be in4 or5.

Perhaps we can guess GUARD? Which has R in position4? So if we get R-? Then means R is not in position4? Or ✓? Then it is.

Similarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? We win? But if not? We get information.

Similarly? Guess ALARM? Or AWARD.

But? We can guess a word that doesn't include R? To test other letters? But then we don't get information on R's position? But we might deduce it later.

Example: avoid R? Then pattern? For example: guess ""SULKY"" -> S U L K Y? But doesn't have A at3? We must have A at position3? So any? Guess must have A at position3? Because we know it's there? And? The position3 letter is fixed to A.

So? Our guess must have A in position3? To satisfy that.

Thus? Guess pattern: ? ? A ? ?

And include letters not forbidden? And if we want to test R at4? We can put R in4? Or not.

Let me list available letters? Let's try to find a word that includes many common letters? And? Has A in position3.

For example: SALAD? S A L A D -> has A at position2 and4? But not position3? Position3 is L? So not SALAD? That's S-A-L-A-D? Positions:1 S, 2 A, 3 L, 4 A, 5 D? Not A at3.

Words with A at3: 
- P _ A _ _
- For example: P L A N T? But N and T forbidden? N and T are forbidden? Yes.
- P L A S H? Not common? And not familiar
- SPEAK? S P E A K -> E forbidden.
- BEAKS? E forbidden.
- BREAK? E forbidden.
- DRAWL? D R, but R is known? And pattern: D-R-A-W-L? But A is at position3? Yes: so D(1) R(2) A(3) W(4) or L(5)? No: D-R-A-W-L is positions:1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L? But in secret? R cannot be at position2? Because in guess1 we had R at position2 and was marked as wrong position? And for ""DRAWL""? If R is at position2? But secret has R in it? At position4 or5? But in DRAWL we have in position2 R? That's forbidden? R cannot be at position2? But ""DRAWL"" of course has R at position2? And that position is disallowed? So we cannot use a word that has R in position2? Because we know R must not be at position2.

Similarly? R cannot be at position1 from guess2.

So? For guess3? R cannot be at position1 or position2? So if we include R? It must be in position4 or5.

And? We must have A in position3.

So? Guess pattern: position1: not R, not C,N,E,T,I,O? So new letter.
Position2: new letter? Not R? And not forbidden.
Position3: A
Position4: if we put R? or new? But if we don't put R? Then it's new letter.
Position5: new letter.

But if we put R in either4 or5.

For example? S L A P M? But 'SLAPM' not word.

B L A Z E? E forbidden.

FLASH? F L A S H -> positions:1:F,2:L,3:A,4:S,5:H? Sounds good? Common word? And avoids forbidden letters? Letters tested: F, L, S, H? And we don't include R? So if R is in secret? We expect to get feedback for R? But we didn't include R in the guess? So how will feedback show R? It won't? Because we are not guessing R? So we won't know if it's there or not? But we know it is there from before.

But since we know R is in the word? If we guess a word without R? Then the feedback will not mention? But it will show the yellow and green for our guess? But for R? We won't get new information? So we need to keep in mind? But we can still guess it.

But? Guess ""FLASH""?

However? We know the secret has R? But in our guess ""FLASH""? We don't have R? So after guess? The feedback will tell us only about F,L,A,S,H.

But? If we aim to reduce the possibilities? Why not guess a word that will tell us about the R position immediately.

Since there are common words? Like GUARD, AWARD, ALARM? We can guess one of them? To test.

For example? Guess ""GUARD""?

If GUARD is secret? Bingo.

But if not? Then feedback will tell us which letters are correct.

If secret is ALARM? And we guess GUARD?

Guessing GUARD when secret is ALARM:

G at1? Secret has A? So G not in word? x
U at2? Secret has L? So U not in word? x
A at3: match? ✓
R at4: match? ✓ (secret is R at4)
D at5? Secret has M? So D not? x

So feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)

Which tells us? Positions 3 and 4 are A and R? And letters G,U,D not in word.

But we already knew that? Mostly? Not U? Now we know U is not in word.

Similarly? If secret is AWARD? Guess GUARD:

G at1? Secret has A? So x? 
U at2? Secret has W? So U not? x?
A at3: ✓
R at4: ✓
D at5: ✓? Since AWARD has D? So D✓?

Secret AWARD: A-W-A-R-D -> positions:1:A,2:W,3:A,4:R,5:D
GUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> 
G? Not A? x
U? Not W? x
A? Secret position3: A? So ✓
R? Position4: R? ✓
D? Position5: secret D? so ✓

So feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)

But then we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D? So word is ? ? A R D? So AWARD? BARDY? Etc? But BARDY? Is valid? Or LARDY? Etc? But we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D. And first letter is not G or U? But second? Etc.

Thus? By guessing GUARD? We get much information.

Similarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? Then win.

Otherwise? We'll get some positions.

Moreover? We can also consider guessing ""AWARD""? Or ""ALARM""? But GUARD seems a good test.

Also? GUARD is a valid word? And uses new letters: G,U,D? Which are untested? So good.

So? Guess ""GUARD"".

Third guess: GUARD

Now? In thinking step? We are to make the guess based on available information.

Therefore? I will guess ""GUARD"".Building on the previous feedback, the key deductions and reasoning are as follows:

1. **From Guess 1 (""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x))**:
   - A is firmly in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - R is present in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - C, N, and E are absent from the word.

2. **From Guess 2 (""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x))**:
   - R is still present but not in the 1st position (combining with Guess 1, it can't be in positions 1 or 2).
   - A is confirmed present but not in the 2nd position (consistent with its known correct 3rd position from Guess 1).
   - T, I, and O are absent from the word.

3. **Constraints Update**:
   - **Position**: A must be in position 3. R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1 or 2).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O are eliminated. Remaining letters are possible.
   - **Present Letters**: A (position 3) and R (position 4 or 5) are confirmed.
   - **Structure**: The word follows one of two patterns based on R's position:
     - R in position 4: `_ _ A R _`
     - R in position 5: `_ _ A _ R`

4. **Strategy for Third Guess**:
   - Test R's exact position while leveraging common letters to maximize information.
   - ""GUARD"" is chosen as a test word because:
     - It satisfies the pattern `_ _ A R _` (R in position 4).
     - Positions: G (1st), U (2nd), A (3rd), R (4th), D (5th). This places A correctly and R in a new position.
     - Letters G, U, D are untested and common; including them can verify their presence or absence.
     - If ""GUARD"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will clarify R's position and key letters:
       - If G is correct/absent, U correct/absent, or D correct/absent, it narrows down the word pool significantly.
       - Feedback on R's position (e.g., ✓ or -) will confirm if R belongs in position 4 or 5.
     - Alternatives like ""AWARD"" or ""ALARM"" were considered but omitted to prioritize testing new letters (G, U, D) over duplicating A tests, per feedback.

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If R is in position 4, R gets ✓ and feedback on other letters refines options.
   - If R is in position 5, R gets (-), indicating R must be in position 5.
   - Absentee feedback for G, U, D eliminates more letters.

Thus, ""GUARD"" tests R's position efficiently while introducing high-yield new letters.",Guess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,QUARK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There are no prior clues, so we want to choose a word that can give us maximum information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and try to cover multiple common vowels and consonants.
 Some commonly used starting words are: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", etc. Let's choose one that has a mix.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels: A, E (and sometimes R is considered vowel-like)
 - It has two common consonants: C, R, N

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I'm starting with the word ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This combination tests three vowels (A and E – R can sometimes function vowel-like) and two common consonants (C, N), helping gather broad information about the secret word's letter composition and positions efficiently.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E). Therefore, the third letter of the secret word is A.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. Since the third position is taken by A, R must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note that position 4 and 5 are currently unknown.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (because we know that's correct).
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the second position (because in the first guess R was in the second position and it was marked as wrong position). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Avoids the letters C, N, and E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to test other letters to get more information. We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

We know the word has an A in the third position and an R somewhere else.

Let me think of words that have A in the third position and include R, and avoid C, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- _ _ A _ _

We can try to put R in the first position? For example: R _ A _ _
But we need to fill the other blanks. We must avoid C, N, E.

What about ""RADAR""? But that has two R's and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, it has D and R again. But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. However, in the feedback for the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So if the word has two R's, we might get more information.

But let's avoid using duplicate letters for now to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try ""RAPID""? But we have to avoid E and we don't know about P, I, D.

But note: we haven't tested P, I, D, so that would be good.

But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have R in the fourth or fifth position.

Another idea: since we know A is in the third position, we can try to use a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Let me list some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We should try to include some of these.

Possible words with A in the third position and R in the first, fourth, or fifth:

- R in first: R _ A _ _
  - Words: RATIO (but has O and I, and T) -> but note we haven't tested T, I, O. Also, avoids C, N, E.
  - RABID (has B, I, D) -> but B and D are new.
  - RADIO (has D, I, O) -> but O is a vowel.

- R in fourth: _ _ A R _
  - Words: BOARD (has B, O, D) -> but O and D are new. Also, we have B and D to test.
  - GUARD (has G, U, D) -> G and U are new.
  - HEARD (has H, E, D) -> but E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.

- R in fifth: _ _ A _ R
  - Words: LEMAR (but has L, E, M -> E is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - SUGAR (has S, U, G) -> avoids E, C, N.

But note: we must avoid E, C, N.

So let's consider:

Option 1: R in first position: R _ A _ _
  - We can try ""RATIO"": R, A (third), T, I, O. This tests T, I, O and has R in first (which is a new position for R). Also, no duplicate letters and avoids C, N, E.

Option 2: R in fourth position: _ _ A R _
  - We can try ""BOARD"": B, O, A (third), R, D. Tests B, O, D. Avoids C, N, E.

Option 3: R in fifth position: _ _ A _ R
  - We can try ""SUGAR"": S, U, G, A (third), R. Tests S, U, G. Avoids C, N, E.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize the information we get. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

In ""RATIO"": we test R (in new position), T, I, O -> 4 new letters (T, I, O) and R in a different position.

In ""BOARD"": we test B, O, D -> 3 new letters.

In ""SUGAR"": we test S, U, G -> 3 new letters.

So ""RATIO"" tests more new letters (4, but note R is already known, so actually 3 new: T, I, O) and also places R in the first position to check if that's correct.

But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position, but by putting it there we can get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in the first position but tests more common letters? But we have to include R somewhere.

Another idea: we know R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like first, fourth, or fifth) and also test other common consonants.

I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in the third position (required).
- It has R in the first position (which is a new position for R, so we can see if it's correct or not).
- It tests T, I, O which are common letters.

If R is in the first position, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash for R if it's in the word but in a different position? But wait, we already know R is in the word, so if it's not in first, then we'll get a dash and know that R is in the fourth or fifth. Also, we get feedback on T, I, O.

So let's go with ""RATIO"".

But note: the word ""RATIO"" is valid.

Therefore, my second guess is ""RATIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the word (marked with x).
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ✓).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must have A in the 3rd position.
- It must include R (in position 1, 4, or 5).
- It must avoid C, N, and E.
- To maximize information, I'll test new common letters (like T, I, O) and place R in a new position (1st) to verify its location.

The word ""RATIO"" fits these criteria:
- A is in the 3rd position.
- R is in the 1st position (a new position to test).
- It introduces new letters: T, I, O.
- It avoids C, N, E.

<guess>ratio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).

Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
- R is again marked as present but wrong position, but now in the 1st position? Wait, in ""ratio"", R is the first letter, and it's marked as (-) meaning it is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is now in the second position? In ""ratio"", A is the second letter? Wait no: R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). But the feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. But we already know A is the 3rd letter from guess 1. So this is contradictory? Let me double-check.

In guess 1: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
So A is correctly in position 3.

In guess 2: ratio -> positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> Feedback: R(-) [so R is in word, but not position 1], A(-) [A is in word but not position 2], T(x), I(x), O(x)

The feedback for A in guess 2 is A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. However, we know from guess 1 that A is in position 3. So why is it marked as (-)? Because in guess 2, A is in position 2, which is not the same as position 3. And since we know the secret word has A in position 3, so when we put A in position 2, it is indeed in the word but not in the correct position (because correct position is 3). So that makes sense: the symbol refers to the position in the guess.

So from guess 2:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1 (we already knew from guess 1 it wasn't in 2, so now not in 1 either).
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (we already know it is in 3, so this is consistent).
- T, I, O are not in the word.

Thus, we have:
- Letters not in word: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Letters in word: R, A (and we know A is in position 3)
- Position of A: fixed at position 3.

Moreover, R is in the word, but neither position 1 nor 2 (from guess 1 R was in position 2 and was -, now in position 1 and also -, so R must be in position 4 or 5).

Also, we need to find the secret word which has 5 letters, A at position 3, R at either position 4 or 5, and no C, N, E, T, I, O.

Additionally, we have tried 10 different letters, and we know 2 are in the word: A and R. There are 3 more letters to find.

We must choose a word that:
- Has 5 letters, A in 3rd position.
- R in 4th or 5th position.
- Avoids letters C, N, E, T, I, O.
- Contains R and A.

Since R is only in positions 4 or 5, we can consider two cases.

Also, we need to test other letters. We have many common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.

We should make a guess that tests common letters and sets R in either 4th or 5th to see which one it is.

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries total.

Let's plan:

Option 1: Assume R is in 4th position: then word pattern: _ _ A R _
Option 2: Assume R is in 5th position: then word pattern: _ _ A _ R

But we don't know which one, so we should design a guess that helps us determine R's position and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have R? But wait, we must include R? No, we are not required to include R. However, if we don't include R, we might not get information about its position. But we know R is in the word, so we want to pin down the position.

But in Wordle, you don't have to use all known letters in every guess; sometimes it's good to test other letters. However, since we know two letters and have limited unknown spots, let's list possible positions.

The word has: position 1: unknown, position 2: unknown, position 3: A, position 4: unknown or R, position 5: unknown or R.

But from feedback, R cannot be in 1 or 2, so it must be in 4 or 5.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A [R or letter4] [R or letter5]

And if R is in 4, then position 5 is a new letter; if R is in 5, then position 4 is a new letter.

Now, the letters we cannot use: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We want to form a valid English word under these constraints.

Let's generate some possibilities.

First, if R is in position 4: then word is _ _ A R ?

We need a 5-letter word ending with R? No: if R is in 4, then position 5 can be another letter, and the word must be valid.

Words like: _ _ A R _
Examples: BOARD, GUARD, HEARD (but E is not allowed), LARD? But LARD has letters: L, A, R, D -> but positions: L in 1, A in 3? Wait, no: positions must be: [1] [2] A[3] R[4] [5]. So word must be of the form ??A R?.

Actually, BOARD: B-O-A-R-D -> positions: B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). But O is not allowed? We know O is not in the word because in guess 2, O was at position 5 and was x. So O cannot be in the word. Similarly, T, I not allowed.

So BOARD has O -> invalid.

GUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> U at position 2, U is still allowed (we haven't tested U). And avoid O? Wait, no O in GUARD. Letters: G, U, A, R, D.

We have avoided forbidden letters? Forbidden: C, N, E, T, I, O are not in GUARD.

Similarly, HEARD: forbidden E -> not allowed.

WARD? Not 5 letters.

BARD: B-A-R-D -> but that's 4 letters? No, 5 letters? BARD is 4.

What about CARD? But C forbidden.

What about ""PARKA""? But that has P, A (but we need two A?), PARKA: P-A-R-K-A -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), A(5). But we have A at position 2 and 5, but we know A is fixed at position 3? So the word must have A at position 3. Therefore, PARKA has A at 1 and 5? No: P(1)-A(2)? Wait, if written as P-A-R-K-A, then A is at position 2 and 5? No, positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:K, 5:A. So position 3 is R, but we need A at position 3. So not matching.

Another word: ""MARSH""? But S and H. Positions: M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position 3? No. Not matching the pattern.

We need words where A is specifically position 3.

If R is in position 4: pattern: _ _ A R _

Examples: 
- GUARD: G(1) U(2) A(3) R(4) D(5) -> G, U, D allowed? Yes, not forbidden. And the word is valid.
- BARD? Not 5 letters.
- ""YARD"" only 4.
- ""HARDY""? H-A-R-D-Y -> positions: H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> not A at position 3.
- ""LARVA"": L(1) A(2) R(3) V(4) A(5) -> again A at 2 and 5? Not 3.
- ""PARTY"": P(1) A(2) R(3) T(4) -> forbidden T.

It seems ""GUARD"" is a candidate.

Now, if R is in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ R

Examples: 
- SUGAR: S(1) U(2) G(3) A(4) R(5) -> but A is at 4? Not 3.
We need A at position 3: so _ _ A [letter] R

Like: GLAUR? Not word.
""LIAR"" -> too short.
""DELAR"" not word.
""SEDAR"" not common.
""VAPOR"" forbidden O and V? But O forbidden.
""WAFER"" forbidden E? Yes, E forbidden.
""PALAR"" not Wordle word? Not standard.
""JABAR"" not standard.

What are common words?
- ""RADAR"": R(1) A(2) D(3) A(4) R(5) -> but position 2 is A? We need position 3 to be A? No.

It might be harder to find words with R at the end and A at position 3.

But a common one might be: ""PIZAR"" not word.

Actually, I know ""TIDAR"" not word.

Similarly, ""PADAR"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOLAR""? S-O-L-A-R -> O forbidden, and A is at position 4? Not 3.

Is there a word with the pattern * * A * R ?

For example: ""DECAY"" but forbidden E and D? Wait, not forbidden D and Y? Decay: D(1) E(2) C(3) A(4) Y(5) -> no, not A at position 3.

Another: ""FATAL"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> T forbidden, A at position 3? Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:T? But T forbidden? Yes T forbidden, and also A at position 2 and 4? Not 3.

Perhaps ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T -> T forbidden, and A at 2.

Not finding good examples.

What about ""BASIL""? But I forbidden? Guess 2 I was x, so forbidden.

Actually, a better way: let's think of words ending with R and having A in position 3.

Examples: ""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R -> O forbidden? Yes.

""SUGAR"": S-U-G-A-R -> letters: S,U,G,A,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need A at position 3? Here G at 3 and A at 4? No.

""LUMAR""? not common.

Maybe words like ""ALARM"": A-L-A-R-M -> position 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M. So here position 3 is A? Yes! So ""ALARM"" has:
Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:A? Wait, but there are two A. The word is A-L-A-R-M -> so:
Letter 1: A
Letter 2: L
Letter 3: A -> yes, so A at position 3? Correct? But then letter 1 is also A? Wait, so we have A at two positions?

We know A is at position 3, but it could be present elsewhere? The feedback from guess 1 only showed A at position 3 as ✓, but it doesn't say that A cannot be elsewhere. However, in guess 2, when we put A at position 2, it showed -, meaning the A is present but not in that position? Since we know from guess 1 that there is an A and it is at position 3, so if there is only one A, then in guess 2 the A would be expected to be -, which it was.

But in ""ALARM"", there are two A's: one at position 1 and one at position 3? So if A is at both positions, then in the feedback:

In guess 1: crane, we had A at position 3: ✓ -> correct.
In guess 2: ratio, we had A at position 2: since there is no A at position 2 in secret? But if secret has A at position 1 and 3, then when we put A at position 2? It shouldn't be correct? But also, it is present? Well, it depends on the rules: usually in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, the feedback can be tricky. 

In this case, for secret ""ALARM"":
- Feedback for ""crane"": 
  - C: not in -> x
  - R: in the secret: at position 4? So in ""crane"", R is at position 2: no match? So should be -, yes.
  - A: at position 3: match with secret position 3: ✓.
  - N: not in -> x
  - E: not in -> x -> matches guess1 feedback.

Now guess2: ""ratio"" against ""ALARM"":
- R: in secret: position 4? But we put R at position 1: wrong? So should be -, but secret has no R at position 1? So -, correct.
- A: we put at position 2: secret has A at position 1 and 3? So at position 2: secret has L? So no A at position 2. But there is A in the word? Then it should be -, because at position 2 there is L? So we should mark A as present? But wait: in Wordle rules, if you guess a letter that is in the word but not in that position, you get -, but if there are multiple, it can be complicated? Actually, for ""ratio"": R at1, A at2, T at3, I at4, O at5.
Secret: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.

So for R: guessed at1, secret has R at4: not at1, but R is present? So -.
For A: guessed at2, secret has A at1 and3? But no A at2? So there is an A in the word? But we haven't given - to A? But wait, only one A? Since we already accounted for the A at position 3? Actually, in the feedback, we have:
- R: present but not position1 -> -
- A: we guessed A at2, secret has A at1 and3? The first occurrence: secret position1 A, we have A at2? No direct match? Then it depends on rule: typically, since the secret has two A's, we can mark the guessed A as present because the secret includes at least one extra A? But in standard Wordle feedback: for each letter in guess, mark green if exact match, then yellow for matches in wrong position but only if the letter has not been counted already? For A: we have two A in secret? So when guessing A at position2: position2 of secret is L? So no direct match? Then we can mark A in guess2 as yellow because there is another A? But then in feedback, we do mark A as - (yellow). So feedback A is -, which we received.

And for T: position3? Secret position3 is A? So no match? And no other T? So x -> matches: T(x)
I: x
O: x

So ""ALARM"" is a possible word? But wait: ""ALARM"" has A at position1? We didn't know about that. But is that possible? Yes.

Back to our case? We were considering possible words.

So for pattern: _ _ A _ R ... but wait: in ""ALARM"": it's A L A R M -> so letter1 is A? We don't know? So pattern: letter1 is A? But we haven't tested A in position1? In fact, from our feedback: in guess1 A was at position3? And in guess2 A was at position2? And got -, so if secret has A at position1 and we haven't guessed it? Then A in position1 would exist? So ""ALARM"" with positions: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.

And R at position4? Not position5? But we can have R at4.

Similarly, a word like ""BAWAR"" rare? Not common.

Another possibility: ""SAVOR"" forbidden O? No.

Another common word: ""TODAY"" -> T forbidden, A at4? No.

Or ""BACON"" forbidden O and N? Well, forbidden letters.

Another possibility with R at position5? Pattern: _ _ A _ R

For example: ""SUPAR"" not a word? ""SUPAR""? Not standard.

""SHAIR"" not common.

""STAIR"" has T and I? Both forbidden? Yes T and I.

""CHAIK"" not word.

It seems harder? But I know ""PALAR"" not word? Or ""JAZAR"" not word.

Perhaps ""BARREL""? But two R? And more than 5? No.

Wait: a word like ""SABER"" but forbidden E? Yes.

""NAVAL"" N forbidden.

Thus, perhaps the only common word with A at position3 and R in the word (at position4) is ""GUARD"" or ""ALARM"" or other.

Another: ""DIARY"" forbidden I? Yes.

""HAIR"" too short.

So likely? Candidates: GUARD, ALARM.

But GUARD: if secret is GUARD: G U A R D.
Then in guess1: crane -> C not, R in word? R at secret position4? But in crane R at guess position2? No match? And A at position3: match? Because secret A at3? Yes. So ✓ for A.

Then in guess2: ratio -> R at1? Secret has no R at1? So -, A at2? Secret position2 is U? Not A? So -, T not, I not, O not? -> matches feedback.

Now, for ALARM: as above also matches feedback.

But in ALARM: there is an additional A at position1? Could that be?

But in our guess1: crane, we had C, R, A, N, E: only A was ✓? And at position3? So for A? We accounted for A at position3? But if there is an extra A? That doesn't show in feedback? Because in feedback, we only mark for each guessed letter? So for crane, we guessed A at position3: and since secret has A at position3? We mark ✓? But the extra A at position1? Because we didn't guess a letter at position1? That letter is not accounted? So it wouldn't show? So ALARM is possible? Similarly, GUARD has no extra A? But both are possible?

But wait: in guess1: crane? We didn't have any A at other positions? So we don't know if there are multiple A.

Thus, possible candidates: GUARD? But also others? And ALARM.

How about ""GAWKY""? But no A at position3? Only one A? Position2: G-A-W-K-Y? Not position3.

So back: we need to choose a word for guess3 that tests letters?

If we guess GUARD:

Pattern: G U A R D -> all letters new? G, U, D? And R in position4? We know R is in the word.

But R is at position4? If we guess GUARD? And if R is at position4? Then we get G at1?, U at2? Etc.

But if the word is GUARD? Then we solve it.

But if it is ALARM? Then we don't? And we'll get feedback?

Similarly, we can guess ALARM? But ALARM has A at the beginning? Which we haven't tested? And if we guess ALARM? Then it has two A? But we'll get feedback.

But we are limited in letters? Also, we must avoid forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests other positions and letters? Without necessarily including R? Because we want to determine the first two letters and the last letter.

For example? We know A at position3? So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4 or R] [letter5 or R]

Suppose we choose a word that tries common? But note: we cannot use forbidden? So available letters? Many: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.

But we don't know the position of R? It is either position4 or position5? So best to test that.

So let's try to include R in position4 or 5? And test common letters? Or we can try to exclude possibilities.

But an efficient way? Since we have two cases? We can choose a word that has R in position5? To see if it's there? Or not.

For example? Guess a word with pattern: _ _ A _ R? But we saw it's hard to find? Or with A at3 and R at5.

Let's find one? Despite the challenge? We can use ""SUPER"" but E forbidden? And pattern... 

""PAPER"" forbidden E? and P? Also A? But position3: we have A? So in ""PAPER"": P(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), R(5) -> not A at3? Position3 is P? No.

""RAPER"" forbidden E? Similarly.

""TAPIR"" forbidden T and I? And not A at3.

Another? ""AZURA"" not word.

Perhaps ""JASPER"" too long? ""JASPER"" is not 5? No, 6.

Wait? Common words? ""LARCO"" forbidden O? Not.

Oh? How about ""SAVOR""? But O forbidden? And not pattern? S-A-V-O-R -> A at position2.

Not.

""VAPAR"" not standard.

Another idea: ""ZEBRA"" forbidden E? Yes.

So maybe no common word? But there is ""WATER"" forbidden T and E? Yes.

For the pattern? Wait, I remember ""CHAIR"" forbidden C and I? Yes.

Perhaps ""MOWER"" forbidden O and E? Yes.

Thus? The only common ones? are likely GUARD and ALARM? But ALARM has A at position1? And we haven't tested it.

Now? Another candidate? ""HEARD"" forbidden E? Yes.

""HEARD"" is H-E-A-R-D -> E forbidden? Cannot use.

""PARTY"" forbidden T? Yes.

Thus, if there is an R at position4? Then possible words are few? Including GUARD? And ALARM? although ALARM has an extra A.

Also? ""AWARD"" -> A-W-A-R-D -> positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). So that fits? A at position1,3? And R at4? Letters: W and D? Not forbidden.

Thus? ""AWARD"" is possible? And A-W-A-R-D? Not forbidden letters.

Therefore? Candidates? For secret word: GUARD? ALARM? AWARD? All have A at position3 and R at position4? And vary in other letters.

But note? GUARD? U at position2? ALARM? L at position2? AWARD? W at position2? And then letter1: G? A? A? A? For GUARD? G at1? For ALARM and AWARD? A at1.

But? In guess1? We had crane? If secret has A at position1? Then when we guessed crane with no A at position1? The feedback only showed A at position3 as ✓? And nothing else? So we didn't detect A at position1? Because we didn't guess position1.

Similarly? For guess2? ratio? If secret has A at position1? We guessed A at position2? And secret has no A at position2? But has A at position1? So feedback would still give A as? Yellow? Correct because A is in the word? So we do get A(-)? As we got.

So? Multiple A in secret are possible.

Thus? For third guess? We? Can guess a word that distinguishes between these? Or can be any valid word.

But we want information.

Now? To test for R's position? If we put R in a different position? Since R must be in4 or5? We can try a word with R in position4? Or position5? To see.

But for position5? It's hard to find a word for the pattern _ _ A _ R? So maybe not? Alternatively? Guess a word with R in a completely new? But we have no position left except 4 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are not? And 3 is A? R must be in4 or5.

Perhaps we can guess GUARD? Which has R in position4? So if we get R-? Then means R is not in position4? Or ✓? Then it is.

Similarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? We win? But if not? We get information.

Similarly? Guess ALARM? Or AWARD.

But? We can guess a word that doesn't include R? To test other letters? But then we don't get information on R's position? But we might deduce it later.

Example: avoid R? Then pattern? For example: guess ""SULKY"" -> S U L K Y? But doesn't have A at3? We must have A at position3? So any? Guess must have A at position3? Because we know it's there? And? The position3 letter is fixed to A.

So? Our guess must have A in position3? To satisfy that.

Thus? Guess pattern: ? ? A ? ?

And include letters not forbidden? And if we want to test R at4? We can put R in4? Or not.

Let me list available letters? Let's try to find a word that includes many common letters? And? Has A in position3.

For example: SALAD? S A L A D -> has A at position2 and4? But not position3? Position3 is L? So not SALAD? That's S-A-L-A-D? Positions:1 S, 2 A, 3 L, 4 A, 5 D? Not A at3.

Words with A at3: 
- P _ A _ _
- For example: P L A N T? But N and T forbidden? N and T are forbidden? Yes.
- P L A S H? Not common? And not familiar
- SPEAK? S P E A K -> E forbidden.
- BEAKS? E forbidden.
- BREAK? E forbidden.
- DRAWL? D R, but R is known? And pattern: D-R-A-W-L? But A is at position3? Yes: so D(1) R(2) A(3) W(4) or L(5)? No: D-R-A-W-L is positions:1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L? But in secret? R cannot be at position2? Because in guess1 we had R at position2 and was marked as wrong position? And for ""DRAWL""? If R is at position2? But secret has R in it? At position4 or5? But in DRAWL we have in position2 R? That's forbidden? R cannot be at position2? But ""DRAWL"" of course has R at position2? And that position is disallowed? So we cannot use a word that has R in position2? Because we know R must not be at position2.

Similarly? R cannot be at position1 from guess2.

So? For guess3? R cannot be at position1 or position2? So if we include R? It must be in position4 or5.

And? We must have A in position3.

So? Guess pattern: position1: not R, not C,N,E,T,I,O? So new letter.
Position2: new letter? Not R? And not forbidden.
Position3: A
Position4: if we put R? or new? But if we don't put R? Then it's new letter.
Position5: new letter.

But if we put R in either4 or5.

For example? S L A P M? But 'SLAPM' not word.

B L A Z E? E forbidden.

FLASH? F L A S H -> positions:1:F,2:L,3:A,4:S,5:H? Sounds good? Common word? And avoids forbidden letters? Letters tested: F, L, S, H? And we don't include R? So if R is in secret? We expect to get feedback for R? But we didn't include R in the guess? So how will feedback show R? It won't? Because we are not guessing R? So we won't know if it's there or not? But we know it is there from before.

But since we know R is in the word? If we guess a word without R? Then the feedback will not mention? But it will show the yellow and green for our guess? But for R? We won't get new information? So we need to keep in mind? But we can still guess it.

But? Guess ""FLASH""?

However? We know the secret has R? But in our guess ""FLASH""? We don't have R? So after guess? The feedback will tell us only about F,L,A,S,H.

But? If we aim to reduce the possibilities? Why not guess a word that will tell us about the R position immediately.

Since there are common words? Like GUARD, AWARD, ALARM? We can guess one of them? To test.

For example? Guess ""GUARD""?

If GUARD is secret? Bingo.

But if not? Then feedback will tell us which letters are correct.

If secret is ALARM? And we guess GUARD?

Guessing GUARD when secret is ALARM:

G at1? Secret has A? So G not in word? x
U at2? Secret has L? So U not in word? x
A at3: match? ✓
R at4: match? ✓ (secret is R at4)
D at5? Secret has M? So D not? x

So feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)

Which tells us? Positions 3 and 4 are A and R? And letters G,U,D not in word.

But we already knew that? Mostly? Not U? Now we know U is not in word.

Similarly? If secret is AWARD? Guess GUARD:

G at1? Secret has A? So x? 
U at2? Secret has W? So U not? x?
A at3: ✓
R at4: ✓
D at5: ✓? Since AWARD has D? So D✓?

Secret AWARD: A-W-A-R-D -> positions:1:A,2:W,3:A,4:R,5:D
GUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> 
G? Not A? x
U? Not W? x
A? Secret position3: A? So ✓
R? Position4: R? ✓
D? Position5: secret D? so ✓

So feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)

But then we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D? So word is ? ? A R D? So AWARD? BARDY? Etc? But BARDY? Is valid? Or LARDY? Etc? But we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D. And first letter is not G or U? But second? Etc.

Thus? By guessing GUARD? We get much information.

Similarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? Then win.

Otherwise? We'll get some positions.

Moreover? We can also consider guessing ""AWARD""? Or ""ALARM""? But GUARD seems a good test.

Also? GUARD is a valid word? And uses new letters: G,U,D? Which are untested? So good.

So? Guess ""GUARD"".

Third guess: GUARD

Now? In thinking step? We are to make the guess based on available information.

Therefore? I will guess ""GUARD"".Building on the previous feedback, the key deductions and reasoning are as follows:

1. **From Guess 1 (""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x))**:
   - A is firmly in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - R is present in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - C, N, and E are absent from the word.

2. **From Guess 2 (""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x))**:
   - R is still present but not in the 1st position (combining with Guess 1, it can't be in positions 1 or 2).
   - A is confirmed present but not in the 2nd position (consistent with its known correct 3rd position from Guess 1).
   - T, I, and O are absent from the word.

3. **Constraints Update**:
   - **Position**: A must be in position 3. R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1 or 2).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O are eliminated. Remaining letters are possible.
   - **Present Letters**: A (position 3) and R (position 4 or 5) are confirmed.
   - **Structure**: The word follows one of two patterns based on R's position:
     - R in position 4: `_ _ A R _`
     - R in position 5: `_ _ A _ R`

4. **Strategy for Third Guess**:
   - Test R's exact position while leveraging common letters to maximize information.
   - ""GUARD"" is chosen as a test word because:
     - It satisfies the pattern `_ _ A R _` (R in position 4).
     - Positions: G (1st), U (2nd), A (3rd), R (4th), D (5th). This places A correctly and R in a new position.
     - Letters G, U, D are untested and common; including them can verify their presence or absence.
     - If ""GUARD"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will clarify R's position and key letters:
       - If G is correct/absent, U correct/absent, or D correct/absent, it narrows down the word pool significantly.
       - Feedback on R's position (e.g., ✓ or -) will confirm if R belongs in position 4 or 5.
     - Alternatives like ""AWARD"" or ""ALARM"" were considered but omitted to prioritize testing new letters (G, U, D) over duplicating A tests, per feedback.

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If R is in position 4, R gets ✓ and feedback on other letters refines options.
   - If R is in position 5, R gets (-), indicating R must be in position 5.
   - Absentee feedback for G, U, D eliminates more letters.

Thus, ""GUARD"" tests R's position efficiently while introducing high-yield new letters.

This combination tests three vowels (A and E – R can sometimes function vowel-like) and two common consonants (C, N), helping gather broad information about the secret word\'s letter composition and positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this we know:\n- The letter A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E). Therefore, the third letter of the secret word is A.\n- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position. Since the third position is taken by A, R must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note that position 4 and 5 are currently unknown.\n- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Has A in the third position (because we know that\'s correct).\n- Includes the letter R (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the second position (because in the first guess R was in the second position and it was marked as wrong position). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- Avoids the letters C, N, and E (since they are not in the word).\n\nAdditionally, we want to test other letters to get more information. We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe know the word has an A in the third position and an R somewhere else.\n\nLet me think of words that have A in the third position and include R, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- _ _ A _ _\n\nWe can try to put R in the first position? For example: R _ A _ _\nBut we need to fill the other blanks. We must avoid C, N, E.\n\nWhat about ""RADAR""? But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, it has D and R again. But note: we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. However, in the feedback for the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So if the word has two R\'s, we might get more information.\n\nBut let\'s avoid using duplicate letters for now to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""RAPID""? But we have to avoid E and we don\'t know about P, I, D.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested P, I, D, so that would be good.\n\nBut wait, we also have to consider that the word might have R in the fourth or fifth position.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the third position, we can try to use a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\nLet me list some common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try to include some of these.\n\nPossible words with A in the third position and R in the first, fourth, or fifth:\n\n- R in first: R _ A _ _\n  - Words: RATIO (but has O and I, and T) -> but note we haven\'t tested T, I, O. Also, avoids C, N, E.\n  - RABID (has B, I, D) -> but B and D are new.\n  - RADIO (has D, I, O) -> but O is a vowel.\n\n- R in fourth: _ _ A R _\n  - Words: BOARD (has B, O, D) -> but O and D are new. Also, we have B and D to test.\n  - GUARD (has G, U, D) -> G and U are new.\n  - HEARD (has H, E, D) -> but E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.\n\n- R in fifth: _ _ A _ R\n  - Words: LEMAR (but has L, E, M -> E is not allowed) -> invalid.\n  - SUGAR (has S, U, G) -> avoids E, C, N.\n\nBut note: we must avoid E, C, N.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n\nOption 1: R in first position: R _ A _ _\n  - We can try ""RATIO"": R, A (third), T, I, O. This tests T, I, O and has R in first (which is a new position for R). Also, no duplicate letters and avoids C, N, E.\n\nOption 2: R in fourth position: _ _ A R _\n  - We can try ""BOARD"": B, O, A (third), R, D. Tests B, O, D. Avoids C, N, E.\n\nOption 3: R in fifth position: _ _ A _ R\n  - We can try ""SUGAR"": S, U, G, A (third), R. Tests S, U, G. Avoids C, N, E.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to maximize the information we get. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""RATIO"": we test R (in new position), T, I, O -> 4 new letters (T, I, O) and R in a different position.\n\nIn ""BOARD"": we test B, O, D -> 3 new letters.\n\nIn ""SUGAR"": we test S, U, G -> 3 new letters.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" tests more new letters (4, but note R is already known, so actually 3 new: T, I, O) and also places R in the first position to check if that\'s correct.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if R is in the first position, but by putting it there we can get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R in the first position but tests more common letters? But we have to include R somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: we know R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a position we haven\'t tested (like first, fourth, or fifth) and also test other common consonants.\n\nI think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because:\n- It has A in the third position (required).\n- It has R in the first position (which is a new position for R, so we can see if it\'s correct or not).\n- It tests T, I, O which are common letters.\n\nIf R is in the first position, we\'ll get a check. If not, we might get a dash for R if it\'s in the word but in a different position? But wait, we already know R is in the word, so if it\'s not in first, then we\'ll get a dash and know that R is in the fourth or fifth. Also, we get feedback on T, I, O.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""RATIO"".\n\nBut note: the word ""RATIO"" is valid.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""RATIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the word (marked with x).\n- A is in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ✓).\n- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have A in the 3rd position.\n- It must include R (in position 1, 4, or 5).\n- It must avoid C, N, and E.\n- To maximize information, I\'ll test new common letters (like T, I, O) and place R in a new position (1st) to verify its location.\n\nThe word ""RATIO"" fits these criteria:\n- A is in the 3rd position.\n- R is in the 1st position (a new position to test).\n- It introduces new letters: T, I, O.\n- It avoids C, N, E.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n- C, N, E are not in the word.\n- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).\n\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n- R is again marked as present but wrong position, but now in the 1st position? Wait, in ""ratio"", R is the first letter, and it\'s marked as (-) meaning it is in the word but not in the first position.\n- A is now in the second position? In ""ratio"", A is the second letter? Wait no: R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). But the feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. But we already know A is the 3rd letter from guess 1. So this is contradictory? Let me double-check.\n\nIn guess 1: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\nSo A is correctly in position 3.\n\nIn guess 2: ratio -> positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> Feedback: R(-) [so R is in word, but not position 1], A(-) [A is in word but not position 2], T(x), I(x), O(x)\n\nThe feedback for A in guess 2 is A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in the second position. However, we know from guess 1 that A is in position 3. So why is it marked as (-)? Because in guess 2, A is in position 2, which is not the same as position 3. And since we know the secret word has A in position 3, so when we put A in position 2, it is indeed in the word but not in the correct position (because correct position is 3). So that makes sense: the symbol refers to the position in the guess.\n\nSo from guess 2:\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1 (we already knew from guess 1 it wasn\'t in 2, so now not in 1 either).\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (we already know it is in 3, so this is consistent).\n- T, I, O are not in the word.\n\nThus, we have:\n- Letters not in word: C, N, E, T, I, O\n- Letters in word: R, A (and we know A is in position 3)\n- Position of A: fixed at position 3.\n\nMoreover, R is in the word, but neither position 1 nor 2 (from guess 1 R was in position 2 and was -, now in position 1 and also -, so R must be in position 4 or 5).\n\nAlso, we need to find the secret word which has 5 letters, A at position 3, R at either position 4 or 5, and no C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nAdditionally, we have tried 10 different letters, and we know 2 are in the word: A and R. There are 3 more letters to find.\n\nWe must choose a word that:\n- Has 5 letters, A in 3rd position.\n- R in 4th or 5th position.\n- Avoids letters C, N, E, T, I, O.\n- Contains R and A.\n\nSince R is only in positions 4 or 5, we can consider two cases.\n\nAlso, we need to test other letters. We have many common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.\n\nWe should make a guess that tests common letters and sets R in either 4th or 5th to see which one it is.\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries total.\n\nLet\'s plan:\n\nOption 1: Assume R is in 4th position: then word pattern: _ _ A R _\nOption 2: Assume R is in 5th position: then word pattern: _ _ A _ R\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we should design a guess that helps us determine R\'s position and also tests new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have R? But wait, we must include R? No, we are not required to include R. However, if we don\'t include R, we might not get information about its position. But we know R is in the word, so we want to pin down the position.\n\nBut in Wordle, you don\'t have to use all known letters in every guess; sometimes it\'s good to test other letters. However, since we know two letters and have limited unknown spots, let\'s list possible positions.\n\nThe word has: position 1: unknown, position 2: unknown, position 3: A, position 4: unknown or R, position 5: unknown or R.\n\nBut from feedback, R cannot be in 1 or 2, so it must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSo the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A [R or letter4] [R or letter5]\n\nAnd if R is in 4, then position 5 is a new letter; if R is in 5, then position 4 is a new letter.\n\nNow, the letters we cannot use: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe want to form a valid English word under these constraints.\n\nLet\'s generate some possibilities.\n\nFirst, if R is in position 4: then word is _ _ A R ?\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending with R? No: if R is in 4, then position 5 can be another letter, and the word must be valid.\n\nWords like: _ _ A R _\nExamples: BOARD, GUARD, HEARD (but E is not allowed), LARD? But LARD has letters: L, A, R, D -> but positions: L in 1, A in 3? Wait, no: positions must be: [1] [2] A[3] R[4] [5]. So word must be of the form ??A R?.\n\nActually, BOARD: B-O-A-R-D -> positions: B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). But O is not allowed? We know O is not in the word because in guess 2, O was at position 5 and was x. So O cannot be in the word. Similarly, T, I not allowed.\n\nSo BOARD has O -> invalid.\n\nGUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> U at position 2, U is still allowed (we haven\'t tested U). And avoid O? Wait, no O in GUARD. Letters: G, U, A, R, D.\n\nWe have avoided forbidden letters? Forbidden: C, N, E, T, I, O are not in GUARD.\n\nSimilarly, HEARD: forbidden E -> not allowed.\n\nWARD? Not 5 letters.\n\nBARD: B-A-R-D -> but that\'s 4 letters? No, 5 letters? BARD is 4.\n\nWhat about CARD? But C forbidden.\n\nWhat about ""PARKA""? But that has P, A (but we need two A?), PARKA: P-A-R-K-A -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), A(5). But we have A at position 2 and 5, but we know A is fixed at position 3? So the word must have A at position 3. Therefore, PARKA has A at 1 and 5? No: P(1)-A(2)? Wait, if written as P-A-R-K-A, then A is at position 2 and 5? No, positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:K, 5:A. So position 3 is R, but we need A at position 3. So not matching.\n\nAnother word: ""MARSH""? But S and H. Positions: M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position 3? No. Not matching the pattern.\n\nWe need words where A is specifically position 3.\n\nIf R is in position 4: pattern: _ _ A R _\n\nExamples: \n- GUARD: G(1) U(2) A(3) R(4) D(5) -> G, U, D allowed? Yes, not forbidden. And the word is valid.\n- BARD? Not 5 letters.\n- ""YARD"" only 4.\n- ""HARDY""? H-A-R-D-Y -> positions: H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> not A at position 3.\n- ""LARVA"": L(1) A(2) R(3) V(4) A(5) -> again A at 2 and 5? Not 3.\n- ""PARTY"": P(1) A(2) R(3) T(4) -> forbidden T.\n\nIt seems ""GUARD"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, if R is in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ R\n\nExamples: \n- SUGAR: S(1) U(2) G(3) A(4) R(5) -> but A is at 4? Not 3.\nWe need A at position 3: so _ _ A [letter] R\n\nLike: GLAUR? Not word.\n""LIAR"" -> too short.\n""DELAR"" not word.\n""SEDAR"" not common.\n""VAPOR"" forbidden O and V? But O forbidden.\n""WAFER"" forbidden E? Yes, E forbidden.\n""PALAR"" not Wordle word? Not standard.\n""JABAR"" not standard.\n\nWhat are common words?\n- ""RADAR"": R(1) A(2) D(3) A(4) R(5) -> but position 2 is A? We need position 3 to be A? No.\n\nIt might be harder to find words with R at the end and A at position 3.\n\nBut a common one might be: ""PIZAR"" not word.\n\nActually, I know ""TIDAR"" not word.\n\nSimilarly, ""PADAR"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLAR""? S-O-L-A-R -> O forbidden, and A is at position 4? Not 3.\n\nIs there a word with the pattern * * A * R ?\n\nFor example: ""DECAY"" but forbidden E and D? Wait, not forbidden D and Y? Decay: D(1) E(2) C(3) A(4) Y(5) -> no, not A at position 3.\n\nAnother: ""FATAL"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> T forbidden, A at position 3? Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:T? But T forbidden? Yes T forbidden, and also A at position 2 and 4? Not 3.\n\nPerhaps ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T -> T forbidden, and A at 2.\n\nNot finding good examples.\n\nWhat about ""BASIL""? But I forbidden? Guess 2 I was x, so forbidden.\n\nActually, a better way: let\'s think of words ending with R and having A in position 3.\n\nExamples: ""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R -> O forbidden? Yes.\n\n""SUGAR"": S-U-G-A-R -> letters: S,U,G,A,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need A at position 3? Here G at 3 and A at 4? No.\n\n""LUMAR""? not common.\n\nMaybe words like ""ALARM"": A-L-A-R-M -> position 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M. So here position 3 is A? Yes! So ""ALARM"" has:\nPositions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:A? Wait, but there are two A. The word is A-L-A-R-M -> so:\nLetter 1: A\nLetter 2: L\nLetter 3: A -> yes, so A at position 3? Correct? But then letter 1 is also A? Wait, so we have A at two positions?\n\nWe know A is at position 3, but it could be present elsewhere? The feedback from guess 1 only showed A at position 3 as ✓, but it doesn\'t say that A cannot be elsewhere. However, in guess 2, when we put A at position 2, it showed -, meaning the A is present but not in that position? Since we know from guess 1 that there is an A and it is at position 3, so if there is only one A, then in guess 2 the A would be expected to be -, which it was.\n\nBut in ""ALARM"", there are two A\'s: one at position 1 and one at position 3? So if A is at both positions, then in the feedback:\n\nIn guess 1: crane, we had A at position 3: ✓ -> correct.\nIn guess 2: ratio, we had A at position 2: since there is no A at position 2 in secret? But if secret has A at position 1 and 3, then when we put A at position 2? It shouldn\'t be correct? But also, it is present? Well, it depends on the rules: usually in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, the feedback can be tricky. \n\nIn this case, for secret ""ALARM"":\n- Feedback for ""crane"": \n  - C: not in -> x\n  - R: in the secret: at position 4? So in ""crane"", R is at position 2: no match? So should be -, yes.\n  - A: at position 3: match with secret position 3: ✓.\n  - N: not in -> x\n  - E: not in -> x -> matches guess1 feedback.\n\nNow guess2: ""ratio"" against ""ALARM"":\n- R: in secret: position 4? But we put R at position 1: wrong? So should be -, but secret has no R at position 1? So -, correct.\n- A: we put at position 2: secret has A at position 1 and 3? So at position 2: secret has L? So no A at position 2. But there is A in the word? Then it should be -, because at position 2 there is L? So we should mark A as present? But wait: in Wordle rules, if you guess a letter that is in the word but not in that position, you get -, but if there are multiple, it can be complicated? Actually, for ""ratio"": R at1, A at2, T at3, I at4, O at5.\nSecret: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.\n\nSo for R: guessed at1, secret has R at4: not at1, but R is present? So -.\nFor A: guessed at2, secret has A at1 and3? But no A at2? So there is an A in the word? But we haven\'t given - to A? But wait, only one A? Since we already accounted for the A at position 3? Actually, in the feedback, we have:\n- R: present but not position1 -> -\n- A: we guessed A at2, secret has A at1 and3? The first occurrence: secret position1 A, we have A at2? No direct match? Then it depends on rule: typically, since the secret has two A\'s, we can mark the guessed A as present because the secret includes at least one extra A? But in standard Wordle feedback: for each letter in guess, mark green if exact match, then yellow for matches in wrong position but only if the letter has not been counted already? For A: we have two A in secret? So when guessing A at position2: position2 of secret is L? So no direct match? Then we can mark A in guess2 as yellow because there is another A? But then in feedback, we do mark A as - (yellow). So feedback A is -, which we received.\n\nAnd for T: position3? Secret position3 is A? So no match? And no other T? So x -> matches: T(x)\nI: x\nO: x\n\nSo ""ALARM"" is a possible word? But wait: ""ALARM"" has A at position1? We didn\'t know about that. But is that possible? Yes.\n\nBack to our case? We were considering possible words.\n\nSo for pattern: _ _ A _ R ... but wait: in ""ALARM"": it\'s A L A R M -> so letter1 is A? We don\'t know? So pattern: letter1 is A? But we haven\'t tested A in position1? In fact, from our feedback: in guess1 A was at position3? And in guess2 A was at position2? And got -, so if secret has A at position1 and we haven\'t guessed it? Then A in position1 would exist? So ""ALARM"" with positions: A at1, L at2, A at3, R at4, M at5.\n\nAnd R at position4? Not position5? But we can have R at4.\n\nSimilarly, a word like ""BAWAR"" rare? Not common.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SAVOR"" forbidden O? No.\n\nAnother common word: ""TODAY"" -> T forbidden, A at4? No.\n\nOr ""BACON"" forbidden O and N? Well, forbidden letters.\n\nAnother possibility with R at position5? Pattern: _ _ A _ R\n\nFor example: ""SUPAR"" not a word? ""SUPAR""? Not standard.\n\n""SHAIR"" not common.\n\n""STAIR"" has T and I? Both forbidden? Yes T and I.\n\n""CHAIK"" not word.\n\nIt seems harder? But I know ""PALAR"" not word? Or ""JAZAR"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""BARREL""? But two R? And more than 5? No.\n\nWait: a word like ""SABER"" but forbidden E? Yes.\n\n""NAVAL"" N forbidden.\n\nThus, perhaps the only common word with A at position3 and R in the word (at position4) is ""GUARD"" or ""ALARM"" or other.\n\nAnother: ""DIARY"" forbidden I? Yes.\n\n""HAIR"" too short.\n\nSo likely? Candidates: GUARD, ALARM.\n\nBut GUARD: if secret is GUARD: G U A R D.\nThen in guess1: crane -> C not, R in word? R at secret position4? But in crane R at guess position2? No match? And A at position3: match? Because secret A at3? Yes. So ✓ for A.\n\nThen in guess2: ratio -> R at1? Secret has no R at1? So -, A at2? Secret position2 is U? Not A? So -, T not, I not, O not? -> matches feedback.\n\nNow, for ALARM: as above also matches feedback.\n\nBut in ALARM: there is an additional A at position1? Could that be?\n\nBut in our guess1: crane, we had C, R, A, N, E: only A was ✓? And at position3? So for A? We accounted for A at position3? But if there is an extra A? That doesn\'t show in feedback? Because in feedback, we only mark for each guessed letter? So for crane, we guessed A at position3: and since secret has A at position3? We mark ✓? But the extra A at position1? Because we didn\'t guess a letter at position1? That letter is not accounted? So it wouldn\'t show? So ALARM is possible? Similarly, GUARD has no extra A? But both are possible?\n\nBut wait: in guess1: crane? We didn\'t have any A at other positions? So we don\'t know if there are multiple A.\n\nThus, possible candidates: GUARD? But also others? And ALARM.\n\nHow about ""GAWKY""? But no A at position3? Only one A? Position2: G-A-W-K-Y? Not position3.\n\nSo back: we need to choose a word for guess3 that tests letters?\n\nIf we guess GUARD:\n\nPattern: G U A R D -> all letters new? G, U, D? And R in position4? We know R is in the word.\n\nBut R is at position4? If we guess GUARD? And if R is at position4? Then we get G at1?, U at2? Etc.\n\nBut if the word is GUARD? Then we solve it.\n\nBut if it is ALARM? Then we don\'t? And we\'ll get feedback?\n\nSimilarly, we can guess ALARM? But ALARM has A at the beginning? Which we haven\'t tested? And if we guess ALARM? Then it has two A? But we\'ll get feedback.\n\nBut we are limited in letters? Also, we must avoid forbidden letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that tests other positions and letters? Without necessarily including R? Because we want to determine the first two letters and the last letter.\n\nFor example? We know A at position3? So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4 or R] [letter5 or R]\n\nSuppose we choose a word that tries common? But note: we cannot use forbidden? So available letters? Many: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, Y, F, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know the position of R? It is either position4 or position5? So best to test that.\n\nSo let\'s try to include R in position4 or 5? And test common letters? Or we can try to exclude possibilities.\n\nBut an efficient way? Since we have two cases? We can choose a word that has R in position5? To see if it\'s there? Or not.\n\nFor example? Guess a word with pattern: _ _ A _ R? But we saw it\'s hard to find? Or with A at3 and R at5.\n\nLet\'s find one? Despite the challenge? We can use ""SUPER"" but E forbidden? And pattern... \n\n""PAPER"" forbidden E? and P? Also A? But position3: we have A? So in ""PAPER"": P(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), R(5) -> not A at3? Position3 is P? No.\n\n""RAPER"" forbidden E? Similarly.\n\n""TAPIR"" forbidden T and I? And not A at3.\n\nAnother? ""AZURA"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""JASPER"" too long? ""JASPER"" is not 5? No, 6.\n\nWait? Common words? ""LARCO"" forbidden O? Not.\n\nOh? How about ""SAVOR""? But O forbidden? And not pattern? S-A-V-O-R -> A at position2.\n\nNot.\n\n""VAPAR"" not standard.\n\nAnother idea: ""ZEBRA"" forbidden E? Yes.\n\nSo maybe no common word? But there is ""WATER"" forbidden T and E? Yes.\n\nFor the pattern? Wait, I remember ""CHAIR"" forbidden C and I? Yes.\n\nPerhaps ""MOWER"" forbidden O and E? Yes.\n\nThus? The only common ones? are likely GUARD and ALARM? But ALARM has A at position1? And we haven\'t tested it.\n\nNow? Another candidate? ""HEARD"" forbidden E? Yes.\n\n""HEARD"" is H-E-A-R-D -> E forbidden? Cannot use.\n\n""PARTY"" forbidden T? Yes.\n\nThus, if there is an R at position4? Then possible words are few? Including GUARD? And ALARM? although ALARM has an extra A.\n\nAlso? ""AWARD"" -> A-W-A-R-D -> positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). So that fits? A at position1,3? And R at4? Letters: W and D? Not forbidden.\n\nThus? ""AWARD"" is possible? And A-W-A-R-D? Not forbidden letters.\n\nTherefore? Candidates? For secret word: GUARD? ALARM? AWARD? All have A at position3 and R at position4? And vary in other letters.\n\nBut note? GUARD? U at position2? ALARM? L at position2? AWARD? W at position2? And then letter1: G? A? A? A? For GUARD? G at1? For ALARM and AWARD? A at1.\n\nBut? In guess1? We had crane? If secret has A at position1? Then when we guessed crane with no A at position1? The feedback only showed A at position3 as ✓? And nothing else? So we didn\'t detect A at position1? Because we didn\'t guess position1.\n\nSimilarly? For guess2? ratio? If secret has A at position1? We guessed A at position2? And secret has no A at position2? But has A at position1? So feedback would still give A as? Yellow? Correct because A is in the word? So we do get A(-)? As we got.\n\nSo? Multiple A in secret are possible.\n\nThus? For third guess? We? Can guess a word that distinguishes between these? Or can be any valid word.\n\nBut we want information.\n\nNow? To test for R\'s position? If we put R in a different position? Since R must be in4 or5? We can try a word with R in position4? Or position5? To see.\n\nBut for position5? It\'s hard to find a word for the pattern _ _ A _ R? So maybe not? Alternatively? Guess a word with R in a completely new? But we have no position left except 4 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are not? And 3 is A? R must be in4 or5.\n\nPerhaps we can guess GUARD? Which has R in position4? So if we get R-? Then means R is not in position4? Or ✓? Then it is.\n\nSimilarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? We win? But if not? We get information.\n\nSimilarly? Guess ALARM? Or AWARD.\n\nBut? We can guess a word that doesn\'t include R? To test other letters? But then we don\'t get information on R\'s position? But we might deduce it later.\n\nExample: avoid R? Then pattern? For example: guess ""SULKY"" -> S U L K Y? But doesn\'t have A at3? We must have A at position3? So any? Guess must have A at position3? Because we know it\'s there? And? The position3 letter is fixed to A.\n\nSo? Our guess must have A in position3? To satisfy that.\n\nThus? Guess pattern: ? ? A ? ?\n\nAnd include letters not forbidden? And if we want to test R at4? We can put R in4? Or not.\n\nLet me list available letters? Let\'s try to find a word that includes many common letters? And? Has A in position3.\n\nFor example: SALAD? S A L A D -> has A at position2 and4? But not position3? Position3 is L? So not SALAD? That\'s S-A-L-A-D? Positions:1 S, 2 A, 3 L, 4 A, 5 D? Not A at3.\n\nWords with A at3: \n- P _ A _ _\n- For example: P L A N T? But N and T forbidden? N and T are forbidden? Yes.\n- P L A S H? Not common? And not familiar\n- SPEAK? S P E A K -> E forbidden.\n- BEAKS? E forbidden.\n- BREAK? E forbidden.\n- DRAWL? D R, but R is known? And pattern: D-R-A-W-L? But A is at position3? Yes: so D(1) R(2) A(3) W(4) or L(5)? No: D-R-A-W-L is positions:1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L? But in secret? R cannot be at position2? Because in guess1 we had R at position2 and was marked as wrong position? And for ""DRAWL""? If R is at position2? But secret has R in it? At position4 or5? But in DRAWL we have in position2 R? That\'s forbidden? R cannot be at position2? But ""DRAWL"" of course has R at position2? And that position is disallowed? So we cannot use a word that has R in position2? Because we know R must not be at position2.\n\nSimilarly? R cannot be at position1 from guess2.\n\nSo? For guess3? R cannot be at position1 or position2? So if we include R? It must be in position4 or5.\n\nAnd? We must have A in position3.\n\nSo? Guess pattern: position1: not R, not C,N,E,T,I,O? So new letter.\nPosition2: new letter? Not R? And not forbidden.\nPosition3: A\nPosition4: if we put R? or new? But if we don\'t put R? Then it\'s new letter.\nPosition5: new letter.\n\nBut if we put R in either4 or5.\n\nFor example? S L A P M? But \'SLAPM\' not word.\n\nB L A Z E? E forbidden.\n\nFLASH? F L A S H -> positions:1:F,2:L,3:A,4:S,5:H? Sounds good? Common word? And avoids forbidden letters? Letters tested: F, L, S, H? And we don\'t include R? So if R is in secret? We expect to get feedback for R? But we didn\'t include R in the guess? So how will feedback show R? It won\'t? Because we are not guessing R? So we won\'t know if it\'s there or not? But we know it is there from before.\n\nBut since we know R is in the word? If we guess a word without R? Then the feedback will not mention? But it will show the yellow and green for our guess? But for R? We won\'t get new information? So we need to keep in mind? But we can still guess it.\n\nBut? Guess ""FLASH""?\n\nHowever? We know the secret has R? But in our guess ""FLASH""? We don\'t have R? So after guess? The feedback will tell us only about F,L,A,S,H.\n\nBut? If we aim to reduce the possibilities? Why not guess a word that will tell us about the R position immediately.\n\nSince there are common words? Like GUARD, AWARD, ALARM? We can guess one of them? To test.\n\nFor example? Guess ""GUARD""?\n\nIf GUARD is secret? Bingo.\n\nBut if not? Then feedback will tell us which letters are correct.\n\nIf secret is ALARM? And we guess GUARD?\n\nGuessing GUARD when secret is ALARM:\n\nG at1? Secret has A? So G not in word? x\nU at2? Secret has L? So U not in word? x\nA at3: match? ✓\nR at4: match? ✓ (secret is R at4)\nD at5? Secret has M? So D not? x\n\nSo feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)\n\nWhich tells us? Positions 3 and 4 are A and R? And letters G,U,D not in word.\n\nBut we already knew that? Mostly? Not U? Now we know U is not in word.\n\nSimilarly? If secret is AWARD? Guess GUARD:\n\nG at1? Secret has A? So x? \nU at2? Secret has W? So U not? x?\nA at3: ✓\nR at4: ✓\nD at5: ✓? Since AWARD has D? So D✓?\n\nSecret AWARD: A-W-A-R-D -> positions:1:A,2:W,3:A,4:R,5:D\nGUARD: G-U-A-R-D -> \nG? Not A? x\nU? Not W? x\nA? Secret position3: A? So ✓\nR? Position4: R? ✓\nD? Position5: secret D? so ✓\n\nSo feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)\n\nBut then we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D? So word is ? ? A R D? So AWARD? BARDY? Etc? But BARDY? Is valid? Or LARDY? Etc? But we know positions 3,4,5 are A,R,D. And first letter is not G or U? But second? Etc.\n\nThus? By guessing GUARD? We get much information.\n\nSimilarly? If we guess GUARD? And secret is GUARD? Then win.\n\nOtherwise? We\'ll get some positions.\n\nMoreover? We can also consider guessing ""AWARD""? Or ""ALARM""? But GUARD seems a good test.\n\nAlso? GUARD is a valid word? And uses new letters: G,U,D? Which are untested? So good.\n\nSo? Guess ""GUARD"".\n\nThird guess: GUARD\n\nNow? In thinking step? We are to make the guess based on available information.\n\nTherefore? I will guess ""GUARD"".Building on the previous feedback, the key deductions and reasoning are as follows:\n\n1. **From Guess 1 (""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x))**:\n   - A is firmly in the correct position (3rd letter).\n   - R is present in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n   - C, N, and E are absent from the word.\n\n2. **From Guess 2 (""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x))**:\n   - R is still present but not in the 1st position (combining with Guess 1, it can\'t be in positions 1 or 2).\n   - A is confirmed present but not in the 2nd position (consistent with its known correct 3rd position from Guess 1).\n   - T, I, and O are absent from the word.\n\n3. **Constraints Update**:\n   - **Position**: A must be in position 3. R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1 or 2).\n   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O are eliminated. Remaining letters are possible.\n   - **Present Letters**: A (position 3) and R (position 4 or 5) are confirmed.\n   - **Structure**: The word follows one of two patterns based on R\'s position:\n     - R in position 4: `_ _ A R _`\n     - R in position 5: `_ _ A _ R`\n\n4. **Strategy for Third Guess**:\n   - Test R\'s exact position while leveraging common letters to maximize information.\n   - ""GUARD"" is chosen as a test word because:\n     - It satisfies the pattern `_ _ A R _` (R in position 4).\n     - Positions: G (1st), U (2nd), A (3rd), R (4th), D (5th). This places A correctly and R in a new position.\n     - Letters G, U, D are untested and common; including them can verify their presence or absence.\n     - If ""GUARD"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will clarify R\'s position and key letters:\n       - If G is correct/absent, U correct/absent, or D correct/absent, it narrows down the word pool significantly.\n       - Feedback on R\'s position (e.g., ✓ or -) will confirm if R belongs in position 4 or 5.\n     - Alternatives like ""AWARD"" or ""ALARM"" were considered but omitted to prioritize testing new letters (G, U, D) over duplicating A tests, per feedback.\n\n5. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If R is in position 4, R gets ✓ and feedback on other letters refines options.\n   - If R is in position 5, R gets (-), indicating R must be in position 5.\n   - Absentee feedback for G, U, D eliminates more letters.\n\nThus, ""GUARD"" tests R\'s position efficiently while introducing high-yield new letters.\n\n<guess>guard</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""ratio"" → R(-), A(-), T(x), I(x), O(x)
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (so R cannot be in position 1 or 2).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (but we know it's in 3rd from guess 1, so this is consistent).
- T, I, O are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""guard"" → G(x), U(✓), A(✓), R(✓), D(x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd) — we already knew this.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- G and D are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: Unknown, but not C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D (from the x's). Also, R is not in position 1 (from guess 2).
  - Position 2: U is correct and in place (from guess 3: U(✓)).
  - Position 3: A is correct and in place (known from guess 1 and confirmed).
  - Position 4: R is correct and in place (from guess 3: R(✓)).
  - Position 5: Unknown, but not E, N, C, T, I, O, D (from x's in guesses). Also, from guess 1, E is not in the word, and from guess 3, D is not.

So the current known word structure is: _ U A R _

We know the word has the form: [letter1] U A R [letter5]

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ? U A R ?

And the missing letters (position 1 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, O, G, U, D. So absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for common English words.

The word must be: [1] U A R [5]

So the first and last letters are missing.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- ""SUGAR""? But we have U in position 2? In ""SUGAR"": S U G A R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need A at 3 and R at 4? Here A is at 4 and R at 5? Doesn't match. Our pattern is U at 2, A at 3, R at 4.

So ""SUGAR"" is S U G A R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need 3:A and 4:R, but here 3 is G and 4 is A? No.

We need exactly: position 2: U, position 3: A, position 4: R.

So the word must have U in second, A in third, R in fourth.

So pattern: ? U A R ?

Now, what words? 

- ""QUART"": Q U A R T -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so T cannot be in the word. So invalid.

- ""QUARK"": Q U A R K -> K is available? But is it a common word? Yes, in physics. But let's see if it's in Wordle dictionary? Often it is.

- ""GUARD"": we already guessed, but it had G and D which are absent? And in our pattern, position 1 and 5 are missing? But in ""GUARD"" it was G U A R D, which we guessed and got G(x) and D(x), so not that.

- ""SUMAC"": but S U M A C -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:M, 4:A, 5:C -> but we need A at 3 and R at 4? Not matching.

- ""LUMAR""? Not a word.

- ""HUMAN"": H U M A N -> but N is absent, and positions: 3:M, 4:A? Not A at 3? No.

- ""JUMAR""? Not common.

- ""RUMBA"": R U M B A -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:M, 4:B, 5:A -> not A at 3 and R at 4? No.

- ""DUCAT"": D is absent? And T absent.

- ""BURAN""? Not common, and N absent.

- ""CURAR""? Not common, and C absent.

- ""MURAL"": M U R A L -> but positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need A at 3 and R at 4? Here R is at 3 and A at 4? No.

We need the sequence: U (2nd), A (3rd), R (4th). So after U, the next letter must be A, then R.

So the word must have ""UAR"" in positions 2-4.

Now, what words have ""UAR"" in the middle?

- ""QUART"": as above, but T absent.

- ""QUARK"": Q U A R K

- ""GUARS"": G U A R S -> but G is absent? From guess 3, G(x). So G cannot be in the word. So invalid.

- ""SUARS""? Not a word.

- ""BUAZE""? Not a word.

- ""HUACA""? Not common.

- ""JUBAH""? Not matching pattern.

- ""PUPAE""? Not UAR.

Perhaps ""QUART"" is the only common one, but T is forbidden.

Another: ""SQUAB""? But S Q U A B -> positions: 1:S, 2:Q, 3:U, 4:A, 5:B -> not U at 2? Position 2 is Q, U is at 3? No.

""EQUIP""? E is absent.

""QUAFF""? Q U A F F -> but then positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F? So pattern: Q U A F F? That fits? Because position 2:U, 3:A, 4:F? But we need position 4 to be R? In our pattern, position 4 is R? But in ""QUAFF"", position 4 is F? So not R? But we know position 4 is R? From feedback? So it must be R at 4.

Therefore, the word must have R at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: ? U A R ?

So the only common word I can think of is ""QUART"", but T is absent? So not possible? Or ""QUARK""?

But ""QUARK"" is a valid English word, meaning a type of subatomic particle or a cheese.

Also, ""QUARE""? But E is absent? And not common.

""QUIRK""? But I is absent? And position 3 is I? Not A.

So ""QUARK"" seems a candidate: Q U A R K.

Now, check against feedback:

- Position 1: Q? We haven't tested Q? It's not in the absent list? So possible.
- Position 2: U? We know U is correct and in place? So ✓.
- Position 3: A? ✓.
- Position 4: R? ✓.
- Position 5: K? Not tested? And not absent? So possible.

But we need to confirm if Q and K are allowed? Since they are not in the absent list.

Also, are there other words?

Another possibility: ""SULAR""? But S U L A R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:L, 4:A, 5:R -> not A at 3? Position 3 is L? No.

""PULAS""? Not common.

""MUJIK""? Not UAR.

Perhaps ""YUCCA""? But Y U C C A -> C absent? And positions: 2:U, 3:C? Not A? No.

""JUMAR""? Not common.

""KUDZU""? K U D Z U -> positions: 1:K, 2:U, 3:D, 4:Z, 5:U -> D is absent? And not A at 3? No.

So ""QUARK"" seems the only common word that fits? But let's double-check.

Another word: ""SQUAD""? S Q U A D -> positions: 1:S, 2:Q, 3:U, 4:A, 5:D -> but D is absent? And position 2 is Q? Not U? We need position 2 to be U? Here position 3 is U? No.

""UNAPT""? U N A P T -> but N and T absent? And position 1:U? But we need position 2:U? No.

Perhaps ""USUAL""? U S U A L -> positions: 1:U, 2:S, 3:U, 4:A, 5:L -> not A at 3? Position 3 is U? No.

So I think ""QUARK"" is the best candidate.

But we have to make sure that Q is allowed? And K is allowed? Yes, they are not excluded.

Also, in the feedback, we have no information about Q and K? So we need to test.

But if we guess ""QUARK"", and it's correct? Then we win? If not? We get feedback.

But what if it's not? Are there other words?

Another word: ""QUAIR""? Not common? Or ""QUARL""? Not common.

""QUABS""? Not word.

Perhaps ""QUAKY""? But not common.

In Wordle, ""QUARK"" is accepted? I believe so.

Another possibility: ""YURTA""? But Y U R T A -> positions: 1:Y, 2:U, 3:R, 4:T, 5:A -> but we need A at 3? Not? And T absent? No.

So I think ""QUARK"" is the word.

But let's confirm the pattern: Q U A R K -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:K? Yes.

And U, A, R are in correct positions? Yes.

And Q and K are not forbidden? Yes.

So we'll guess ""QUARK"".

But is there a word like ""SUPER""? No, E absent.

Or ""JUPON""? J U P O N -> O and N absent? No.

So I think ""QUARK"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, fourth guess: QUARK.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position, 3rd), N (absent), E (absent).
     - Key takeaway: A is fixed at position 3, R is in the word but not at position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**:
     - R (present but wrong position, not at 1st), A (present but wrong position, not at 2nd), T (absent), I (absent), O (absent).
     - Key takeaway: R cannot be at positions 1 or 2, and T, I, O are absent. A's position 3 is confirmed.
   - **Guess 3 (""guard"")**:
     - G (absent), U (correct position, 2nd), A (correct position, 3rd), R (correct position, 4th), D (absent).
     - Key takeaway: U is fixed at position 2, R is fixed at position 4. G and D are absent.

2. **Current Word Structure**:
   - Position 2: U (confirmed).
   - Position 3: A (confirmed).
   - Position 4: R (confirmed).
   - Positions 1 and 5 are unknown.
   - The word structure is: `[letter1] U A R [letter5]`.

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D are absent. These cannot appear in the word.
   - Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - The word must match the pattern `?UAR?` and use only allowed letters.
   - Common English words fitting this pattern:
     - **QUARK**: Q (position 1), U (position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), K (position 5). This is a valid word (e.g., a physics term or cheese).
     - Other potential words (e.g., ""QUART"") were ruled out due to absent letters (T is forbidden).
     - ""QUARK"" uses untested letters (Q and K) and fits all constraints.

5. **Why ""QUARK""?**:
   - Tests position 1 (Q) and position 5 (K) efficiently.
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on Q and K will reduce possibilities significantly.
   - No other common 5-letter words match the pattern and constraints (e.g., ""GUARD"" was already guessed and ruled out, ""SUGAR"" has A at position 4, not 3).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - ""QUARK"" is the optimal guess to resolve the remaining unknowns (positions 1 and 5) while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>quark</guess>",quark,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""ratio"" → R(-), A(-), T(x), I(x), O(x)
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (so R cannot be in position 1 or 2).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (but we know it's in 3rd from guess 1, so this is consistent).
- T, I, O are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""guard"" → G(x), U(✓), A(✓), R(✓), D(x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd) — we already knew this.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- G and D are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: Unknown, but not C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D (from the x's). Also, R is not in position 1 (from guess 2).
  - Position 2: U is correct and in place (from guess 3: U(✓)).
  - Position 3: A is correct and in place (known from guess 1 and confirmed).
  - Position 4: R is correct and in place (from guess 3: R(✓)).
  - Position 5: Unknown, but not E, N, C, T, I, O, D (from x's in guesses). Also, from guess 1, E is not in the word, and from guess 3, D is not.

So the current known word structure is: _ U A R _

We know the word has the form: [letter1] U A R [letter5]

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ? U A R ?

And the missing letters (position 1 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, O, G, U, D. So absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for common English words.

The word must be: [1] U A R [5]

So the first and last letters are missing.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- ""SUGAR""? But we have U in position 2? In ""SUGAR"": S U G A R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need A at 3 and R at 4? Here A is at 4 and R at 5? Doesn't match. Our pattern is U at 2, A at 3, R at 4.

So ""SUGAR"" is S U G A R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R -> but we need 3:A and 4:R, but here 3 is G and 4 is A? No.

We need exactly: position 2: U, position 3: A, position 4: R.

So the word must have U in second, A in third, R in fourth.

So pattern: ? U A R ?

Now, what words? 

- ""QUART"": Q U A R T -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so T cannot be in the word. So invalid.

- ""QUARK"": Q U A R K -> K is available? But is it a common word? Yes, in physics. But let's see if it's in Wordle dictionary? Often it is.

- ""GUARD"": we already guessed, but it had G and D which are absent? And in our pattern, position 1 and 5 are missing? But in ""GUARD"" it was G U A R D, which we guessed and got G(x) and D(x), so not that.

- ""SUMAC"": but S U M A C -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:M, 4:A, 5:C -> but we need A at 3 and R at 4? Not matching.

- ""LUMAR""? Not a word.

- ""HUMAN"": H U M A N -> but N is absent, and positions: 3:M, 4:A? Not A at 3? No.

- ""JUMAR""? Not common.

- ""RUMBA"": R U M B A -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:M, 4:B, 5:A -> not A at 3 and R at 4? No.

- ""DUCAT"": D is absent? And T absent.

- ""BURAN""? Not common, and N absent.

- ""CURAR""? Not common, and C absent.

- ""MURAL"": M U R A L -> but positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need A at 3 and R at 4? Here R is at 3 and A at 4? No.

We need the sequence: U (2nd), A (3rd), R (4th). So after U, the next letter must be A, then R.

So the word must have ""UAR"" in positions 2-4.

Now, what words have ""UAR"" in the middle?

- ""QUART"": as above, but T absent.

- ""QUARK"": Q U A R K

- ""GUARS"": G U A R S -> but G is absent? From guess 3, G(x). So G cannot be in the word. So invalid.

- ""SUARS""? Not a word.

- ""BUAZE""? Not a word.

- ""HUACA""? Not common.

- ""JUBAH""? Not matching pattern.

- ""PUPAE""? Not UAR.

Perhaps ""QUART"" is the only common one, but T is forbidden.

Another: ""SQUAB""? But S Q U A B -> positions: 1:S, 2:Q, 3:U, 4:A, 5:B -> not U at 2? Position 2 is Q, U is at 3? No.

""EQUIP""? E is absent.

""QUAFF""? Q U A F F -> but then positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F? So pattern: Q U A F F? That fits? Because position 2:U, 3:A, 4:F? But we need position 4 to be R? In our pattern, position 4 is R? But in ""QUAFF"", position 4 is F? So not R? But we know position 4 is R? From feedback? So it must be R at 4.

Therefore, the word must have R at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: ? U A R ?

So the only common word I can think of is ""QUART"", but T is absent? So not possible? Or ""QUARK""?

But ""QUARK"" is a valid English word, meaning a type of subatomic particle or a cheese.

Also, ""QUARE""? But E is absent? And not common.

""QUIRK""? But I is absent? And position 3 is I? Not A.

So ""QUARK"" seems a candidate: Q U A R K.

Now, check against feedback:

- Position 1: Q? We haven't tested Q? It's not in the absent list? So possible.
- Position 2: U? We know U is correct and in place? So ✓.
- Position 3: A? ✓.
- Position 4: R? ✓.
- Position 5: K? Not tested? And not absent? So possible.

But we need to confirm if Q and K are allowed? Since they are not in the absent list.

Also, are there other words?

Another possibility: ""SULAR""? But S U L A R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:L, 4:A, 5:R -> not A at 3? Position 3 is L? No.

""PULAS""? Not common.

""MUJIK""? Not UAR.

Perhaps ""YUCCA""? But Y U C C A -> C absent? And positions: 2:U, 3:C? Not A? No.

""JUMAR""? Not common.

""KUDZU""? K U D Z U -> positions: 1:K, 2:U, 3:D, 4:Z, 5:U -> D is absent? And not A at 3? No.

So ""QUARK"" seems the only common word that fits? But let's double-check.

Another word: ""SQUAD""? S Q U A D -> positions: 1:S, 2:Q, 3:U, 4:A, 5:D -> but D is absent? And position 2 is Q? Not U? We need position 2 to be U? Here position 3 is U? No.

""UNAPT""? U N A P T -> but N and T absent? And position 1:U? But we need position 2:U? No.

Perhaps ""USUAL""? U S U A L -> positions: 1:U, 2:S, 3:U, 4:A, 5:L -> not A at 3? Position 3 is U? No.

So I think ""QUARK"" is the best candidate.

But we have to make sure that Q is allowed? And K is allowed? Yes, they are not excluded.

Also, in the feedback, we have no information about Q and K? So we need to test.

But if we guess ""QUARK"", and it's correct? Then we win? If not? We get feedback.

But what if it's not? Are there other words?

Another word: ""QUAIR""? Not common? Or ""QUARL""? Not common.

""QUABS""? Not word.

Perhaps ""QUAKY""? But not common.

In Wordle, ""QUARK"" is accepted? I believe so.

Another possibility: ""YURTA""? But Y U R T A -> positions: 1:Y, 2:U, 3:R, 4:T, 5:A -> but we need A at 3? Not? And T absent? No.

So I think ""QUARK"" is the word.

But let's confirm the pattern: Q U A R K -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:K? Yes.

And U, A, R are in correct positions? Yes.

And Q and K are not forbidden? Yes.

So we'll guess ""QUARK"".

But is there a word like ""SUPER""? No, E absent.

Or ""JUPON""? J U P O N -> O and N absent? No.

So I think ""QUARK"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, fourth guess: QUARK.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position, 3rd), N (absent), E (absent).
     - Key takeaway: A is fixed at position 3, R is in the word but not at position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**:
     - R (present but wrong position, not at 1st), A (present but wrong position, not at 2nd), T (absent), I (absent), O (absent).
     - Key takeaway: R cannot be at positions 1 or 2, and T, I, O are absent. A's position 3 is confirmed.
   - **Guess 3 (""guard"")**:
     - G (absent), U (correct position, 2nd), A (correct position, 3rd), R (correct position, 4th), D (absent).
     - Key takeaway: U is fixed at position 2, R is fixed at position 4. G and D are absent.

2. **Current Word Structure**:
   - Position 2: U (confirmed).
   - Position 3: A (confirmed).
   - Position 4: R (confirmed).
   - Positions 1 and 5 are unknown.
   - The word structure is: `[letter1] U A R [letter5]`.

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, D are absent. These cannot appear in the word.
   - Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - The word must match the pattern `?UAR?` and use only allowed letters.
   - Common English words fitting this pattern:
     - **QUARK**: Q (position 1), U (position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), K (position 5). This is a valid word (e.g., a physics term or cheese).
     - Other potential words (e.g., ""QUART"") were ruled out due to absent letters (T is forbidden).
     - ""QUARK"" uses untested letters (Q and K) and fits all constraints.

5. **Why ""QUARK""?**:
   - Tests position 1 (Q) and position 5 (K) efficiently.
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on Q and K will reduce possibilities significantly.
   - No other common 5-letter words match the pattern and constraints (e.g., ""GUARD"" was already guessed and ruled out, ""SUGAR"" has A at position 4, not 3).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - ""QUARK"" is the optimal guess to resolve the remaining unknowns (positions 1 and 5) while adhering to the feedback.",Guess 4: quark -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
