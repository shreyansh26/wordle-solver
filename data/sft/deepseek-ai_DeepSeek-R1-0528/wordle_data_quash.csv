We are starting fresh with no prior guesses. We need to make a first guess. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters and positions.

A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters. Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers vowels and common consonants.

Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess> crane </guess>
</think>
For the first guess, I want to maximize information by using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains commonly used letters: C, R, A, N, E.
- It covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants, which helps test a broad range of letters.
- All letters are unique, so each feedback will provide clear information about that specific letter.
- This word eliminates or confirms multiple high-frequency letters in one guess, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since ""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so A is the 3rd letter).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have the pattern _ _ A _ _

Some possibilities:
- SALAD (but has A twice, and we already know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again? Actually, the feedback only told us about the A in the 3rd position. It didn't say anything about other A's. However, since we are avoiding known absent letters, and we don't have information about other A's, we can use A again? But to maximize new information, it's better to use all new letters if possible. However, the word must have A in the third position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (in the correct position). If there were another A, it would have been indicated with a '-' or '✓' in another position? Actually, no. In the first guess, we only had one A. So we don't know if there are additional A's.

However, we are allowed to use A again? But to get more information, we should try to use new letters.

But the constraint is: we must have A in the third position.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible words:
- SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> but has two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, but the 5th is also A. We don't know if that's allowed. The word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are possible.

But to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters we already know (unless necessary). We know A is present, so using A again might not give new information about other letters.

So, ideally, we choose a word with A in the third position and four new letters.

Let me try to find such words.

Common words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E:

- STAFF? But has F twice and we don't know about F. Also, S and T are common. But let's see: S-T-A-F-F -> but it has duplicate F. And we are on the second guess, so we can try.

But we want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Better words:
- STAID: S-T-A-I-D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. All unique and new.
- PLAID: P-L-A-I-D -> but P, L, A, I, D. However, we don't know about P, L, I, D. But note: we have to avoid R, which we are, and also C, N, E.

But we don't have any information about P, L, I, D.

Another one: 
- SHALT? But that's not very common. 
- STAND? But N is not allowed (we got N as absent in the first guess).

We cannot use N because the first feedback said N is absent.

So, STAND is invalid because of N.

Similarly, we cannot use R, so words like TRACK are invalid.

Another word: 
- SQUAD: S-Q-U-A-D -> but Q is not very common and might not be in the word. Also, we are trying to use common letters.

Better to use common letters.

Another: 
- SWAMI: S-W-A-M-I -> W and M and I. W is less common.

But let's consider STAID: S-T-A-I-D. This seems good because S, T, I, D are common.

Another possibility: 
- PLAZA: P-L-A-Z-A -> has two A's and Z is not common. Not ideal.

- MANIA: but M is allowed? But we have A again and also we cannot use N? Wait, MANIA: M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent, so we cannot use N. Also, the pattern requires A in the third position? MANIA is M-A-N-I-A, so the third letter is N, not A. So it doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, let's stick with STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

But is STAID a valid word? Yes, it means reserved or unadventurous.

Another common word: 
- STAKE: but we cannot use E (absent) and K is allowed? But E is absent, so STAKE is invalid.

- STAMP: S-T-A-M-P -> M and P. But we cannot use M? We don't know about M. And P is new. But we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: the first guess said E is absent, so we can't use E. But M and P are new.

But STAMP has no E, so it's okay? But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. All new letters? Yes, and A in the third position.

But we are using A again? In the third position, which we know is correct, so we are not testing A again in a new position. But we are forced to put A in the third. The other positions are new.

But in terms of information, we are testing S, T, M, P in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.

Alternatively, we could use a word without A in the other positions? But we don't have to. The word must have A in the third, but it can have A elsewhere? But if we use A elsewhere, and if that position is correct, we get a ✓, or if it's present but wrong position, we get a '-'. But we already know A is in the word, so we might be wasting a slot.

So, ideally, we avoid using A in other positions to test more new letters.

Therefore, STAID and STAMP both have only one A (in the third position). 

STAID: S, T, A, I, D -> no duplicate A.
STAMP: S, T, A, M, P -> no duplicate A.

Both are valid.

But STAID has I and D, while STAMP has M and P.

Which letters are more common? S and T are common in both. Then I, D vs M, P.

In English, M and P are more common than I and D? Actually, I is a vowel and very common. D is also common.

But let's look at frequency. Without getting too detailed, both are reasonable.

Another word: 
- SLACK: but C is absent, so we cannot use C.

- BLACK: same, C is absent.

- PLAIT: P-L-A-I-T -> T is common. But we have T in the fifth position. And we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So P, L, A, I, T. All new? Yes.

But PLAIT has A in the third, and no duplicate A.

So, options: STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

We can also consider: 
- SNAIL? But N is absent, so no.

- TRAIL? R is absent, so no.

- ALIAS? But A is in the first position, not third. We need A in the third.

So, let's choose among STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

I think STAID is a good choice because it uses I and D, which are common, and we haven't tested them.

But let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We have A already, but we might need to test other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is absent. So we know E is not in the word. Therefore, the remaining vowels are I, O, U.

In STAID, we are testing I. In PLAIT, we are also testing I. In STAMP, we are testing no vowel (only consonants). So STAID and PLAIT test a vowel (I) which might be important.

Between STAID and PLAIT, which one? 
- STAID: S, T, A, I, D
- PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T

Both have I and T. STAID has S and D, PLAIT has P and L.

S is more common than P? And D vs L? L is more common than D.

But we are testing positions: 
In STAID: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

In PLAIT:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: T

We know the third is A, so we are testing the other four positions.

We don't have any information about which positions might be correct for other letters, so we are just testing presence.

Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but E and N are out, and A we know.

So, from the top: T, O, I, S, H, R, D, L, U. But R is out.

So, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We have tested S and T in the first guess? No, in the first guess we tested C, R, A, N, E. So S, T, O, I, etc. are untested.

In STAID, we are testing S, T, I, D.
In PLAIT, we are testing P, L, I, T.

T is in both. I is in both.

So, STAID tests S and D, PLAIT tests P and L.

S is more common than P, and L is more common than D? 
- S is the 8th most common letter, P is 23rd? 
- L is 4th? Actually, let me recall: 
Common letter frequencies (approximate):
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...

So, S is 7th, H is 8th, R is 9th, D is 10th, L is 11th, U is 12th. P is around 16th.

So, S is more common than L? S is 7th, L is 11th? But we are testing two letters: in STAID: S (7th) and D (10th); in PLAIT: L (11th) and P (16th). So STAID tests higher frequency letters.

Also, we are testing T in both, which is the 2nd most common, but we are testing it in different positions.

But since we don't know the position, testing T is good.

Moreover, we are testing I (vowel) in both.

So, STAID seems better because it tests S and D, which are more common than P and L? Actually, S is more common than P, but L is more common than D? 
- D is 10th, L is 11th? They are close. But S (7th) is much better than P (16th).

So, overall, STAID tests more common letters.

Another word: 
- SHALT? Not common.
- SWAMI: W is less common.

So, I think STAID is a good choice.

But let me confirm: is STAID a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""staid"".

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E. STAID has none of these.

So, the next guess: staid

<guess>staid</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).

The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _, and it must exclude C, R, N, E.

For the next guess:
- Choose a word with A in the 3rd position and new, common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters (C, R, N, E) and prioritize high-frequency unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, D, L, O).
- ""Staid"" fits well: it has A in the 3rd position, uses new common letters (S, T, I, D), and avoids absent letters. It tests S in position 1, T in position 2, I in position 4, and D in position 5.

<guess>staid</guess>",staid,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since ""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so A is the 3rd letter).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have the pattern _ _ A _ _

Some possibilities:
- SALAD (but has A twice, and we already know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again? Actually, the feedback only told us about the A in the 3rd position. It didn't say anything about other A's. However, since we are avoiding known absent letters, and we don't have information about other A's, we can use A again? But to maximize new information, it's better to use all new letters if possible. However, the word must have A in the third position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (in the correct position). If there were another A, it would have been indicated with a '-' or '✓' in another position? Actually, no. In the first guess, we only had one A. So we don't know if there are additional A's.

However, we are allowed to use A again? But to get more information, we should try to use new letters.

But the constraint is: we must have A in the third position.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible words:
- SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> but has two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, but the 5th is also A. We don't know if that's allowed. The word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are possible.

But to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters we already know (unless necessary). We know A is present, so using A again might not give new information about other letters.

So, ideally, we choose a word with A in the third position and four new letters.

Let me try to find such words.

Common words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E:

- STAFF? But has F twice and we don't know about F. Also, S and T are common. But let's see: S-T-A-F-F -> but it has duplicate F. And we are on the second guess, so we can try.

But we want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Better words:
- STAID: S-T-A-I-D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. All unique and new.
- PLAID: P-L-A-I-D -> but P, L, A, I, D. However, we don't know about P, L, I, D. But note: we have to avoid R, which we are, and also C, N, E.

But we don't have any information about P, L, I, D.

Another one: 
- SHALT? But that's not very common. 
- STAND? But N is not allowed (we got N as absent in the first guess).

We cannot use N because the first feedback said N is absent.

So, STAND is invalid because of N.

Similarly, we cannot use R, so words like TRACK are invalid.

Another word: 
- SQUAD: S-Q-U-A-D -> but Q is not very common and might not be in the word. Also, we are trying to use common letters.

Better to use common letters.

Another: 
- SWAMI: S-W-A-M-I -> W and M and I. W is less common.

But let's consider STAID: S-T-A-I-D. This seems good because S, T, I, D are common.

Another possibility: 
- PLAZA: P-L-A-Z-A -> has two A's and Z is not common. Not ideal.

- MANIA: but M is allowed? But we have A again and also we cannot use N? Wait, MANIA: M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent, so we cannot use N. Also, the pattern requires A in the third position? MANIA is M-A-N-I-A, so the third letter is N, not A. So it doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, let's stick with STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

But is STAID a valid word? Yes, it means reserved or unadventurous.

Another common word: 
- STAKE: but we cannot use E (absent) and K is allowed? But E is absent, so STAKE is invalid.

- STAMP: S-T-A-M-P -> M and P. But we cannot use M? We don't know about M. And P is new. But we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: the first guess said E is absent, so we can't use E. But M and P are new.

But STAMP has no E, so it's okay? But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. All new letters? Yes, and A in the third position.

But we are using A again? In the third position, which we know is correct, so we are not testing A again in a new position. But we are forced to put A in the third. The other positions are new.

But in terms of information, we are testing S, T, M, P in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.

Alternatively, we could use a word without A in the other positions? But we don't have to. The word must have A in the third, but it can have A elsewhere? But if we use A elsewhere, and if that position is correct, we get a ✓, or if it's present but wrong position, we get a '-'. But we already know A is in the word, so we might be wasting a slot.

So, ideally, we avoid using A in other positions to test more new letters.

Therefore, STAID and STAMP both have only one A (in the third position). 

STAID: S, T, A, I, D -> no duplicate A.
STAMP: S, T, A, M, P -> no duplicate A.

Both are valid.

But STAID has I and D, while STAMP has M and P.

Which letters are more common? S and T are common in both. Then I, D vs M, P.

In English, M and P are more common than I and D? Actually, I is a vowel and very common. D is also common.

But let's look at frequency. Without getting too detailed, both are reasonable.

Another word: 
- SLACK: but C is absent, so we cannot use C.

- BLACK: same, C is absent.

- PLAIT: P-L-A-I-T -> T is common. But we have T in the fifth position. And we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So P, L, A, I, T. All new? Yes.

But PLAIT has A in the third, and no duplicate A.

So, options: STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

We can also consider: 
- SNAIL? But N is absent, so no.

- TRAIL? R is absent, so no.

- ALIAS? But A is in the first position, not third. We need A in the third.

So, let's choose among STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

I think STAID is a good choice because it uses I and D, which are common, and we haven't tested them.

But let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We have A already, but we might need to test other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is absent. So we know E is not in the word. Therefore, the remaining vowels are I, O, U.

In STAID, we are testing I. In PLAIT, we are also testing I. In STAMP, we are testing no vowel (only consonants). So STAID and PLAIT test a vowel (I) which might be important.

Between STAID and PLAIT, which one? 
- STAID: S, T, A, I, D
- PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T

Both have I and T. STAID has S and D, PLAIT has P and L.

S is more common than P? And D vs L? L is more common than D.

But we are testing positions: 
In STAID: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

In PLAIT:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: T

We know the third is A, so we are testing the other four positions.

We don't have any information about which positions might be correct for other letters, so we are just testing presence.

Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but E and N are out, and A we know.

So, from the top: T, O, I, S, H, R, D, L, U. But R is out.

So, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We have tested S and T in the first guess? No, in the first guess we tested C, R, A, N, E. So S, T, O, I, etc. are untested.

In STAID, we are testing S, T, I, D.
In PLAIT, we are testing P, L, I, T.

T is in both. I is in both.

So, STAID tests S and D, PLAIT tests P and L.

S is more common than P, and L is more common than D? 
- S is the 8th most common letter, P is 23rd? 
- L is 4th? Actually, let me recall: 
Common letter frequencies (approximate):
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...

So, S is 7th, H is 8th, R is 9th, D is 10th, L is 11th, U is 12th. P is around 16th.

So, S is more common than L? S is 7th, L is 11th? But we are testing two letters: in STAID: S (7th) and D (10th); in PLAIT: L (11th) and P (16th). So STAID tests higher frequency letters.

Also, we are testing T in both, which is the 2nd most common, but we are testing it in different positions.

But since we don't know the position, testing T is good.

Moreover, we are testing I (vowel) in both.

So, STAID seems better because it tests S and D, which are more common than P and L? Actually, S is more common than P, but L is more common than D? 
- D is 10th, L is 11th? They are close. But S (7th) is much better than P (16th).

So, overall, STAID tests more common letters.

Another word: 
- SHALT? Not common.
- SWAMI: W is less common.

So, I think STAID is a good choice.

But let me confirm: is STAID a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""staid"".

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E. STAID has none of these.

So, the next guess: staid

<guess>staid</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).

The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _, and it must exclude C, R, N, E.

For the next guess:
- Choose a word with A in the 3rd position and new, common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters (C, R, N, E) and prioritize high-frequency unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, D, L, O).
- ""Staid"" fits well: it has A in the 3rd position, uses new common letters (S, T, I, D), and avoids absent letters. It tests S in position 1, T in position 2, I in position 4, and D in position 5.",Guess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting fresh with no prior guesses. We need to make a first guess. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters and positions.

A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters. Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers vowels and common consonants.

Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I want to maximize information by using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains commonly used letters: C, R, A, N, E.
- It covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants, which helps test a broad range of letters.
- All letters are unique, so each feedback will provide clear information about that specific letter.
- This word eliminates or confirms multiple high-frequency letters in one guess, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since ""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so A is the 3rd letter).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have the pattern _ _ A _ _

Some possibilities:
- SALAD (but has A twice, and we already know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again? Actually, the feedback only told us about the A in the 3rd position. It didn't say anything about other A's. However, since we are avoiding known absent letters, and we don't have information about other A's, we can use A again? But to maximize new information, it's better to use all new letters if possible. However, the word must have A in the third position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (in the correct position). If there were another A, it would have been indicated with a '-' or '✓' in another position? Actually, no. In the first guess, we only had one A. So we don't know if there are additional A's.

However, we are allowed to use A again? But to get more information, we should try to use new letters.

But the constraint is: we must have A in the third position.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible words:
- SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> but has two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, but the 5th is also A. We don't know if that's allowed. The word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are possible.

But to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters we already know (unless necessary). We know A is present, so using A again might not give new information about other letters.

So, ideally, we choose a word with A in the third position and four new letters.

Let me try to find such words.

Common words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E:

- STAFF? But has F twice and we don't know about F. Also, S and T are common. But let's see: S-T-A-F-F -> but it has duplicate F. And we are on the second guess, so we can try.

But we want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Better words:
- STAID: S-T-A-I-D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. All unique and new.
- PLAID: P-L-A-I-D -> but P, L, A, I, D. However, we don't know about P, L, I, D. But note: we have to avoid R, which we are, and also C, N, E.

But we don't have any information about P, L, I, D.

Another one: 
- SHALT? But that's not very common. 
- STAND? But N is not allowed (we got N as absent in the first guess).

We cannot use N because the first feedback said N is absent.

So, STAND is invalid because of N.

Similarly, we cannot use R, so words like TRACK are invalid.

Another word: 
- SQUAD: S-Q-U-A-D -> but Q is not very common and might not be in the word. Also, we are trying to use common letters.

Better to use common letters.

Another: 
- SWAMI: S-W-A-M-I -> W and M and I. W is less common.

But let's consider STAID: S-T-A-I-D. This seems good because S, T, I, D are common.

Another possibility: 
- PLAZA: P-L-A-Z-A -> has two A's and Z is not common. Not ideal.

- MANIA: but M is allowed? But we have A again and also we cannot use N? Wait, MANIA: M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent, so we cannot use N. Also, the pattern requires A in the third position? MANIA is M-A-N-I-A, so the third letter is N, not A. So it doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, let's stick with STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

But is STAID a valid word? Yes, it means reserved or unadventurous.

Another common word: 
- STAKE: but we cannot use E (absent) and K is allowed? But E is absent, so STAKE is invalid.

- STAMP: S-T-A-M-P -> M and P. But we cannot use M? We don't know about M. And P is new. But we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: the first guess said E is absent, so we can't use E. But M and P are new.

But STAMP has no E, so it's okay? But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. All new letters? Yes, and A in the third position.

But we are using A again? In the third position, which we know is correct, so we are not testing A again in a new position. But we are forced to put A in the third. The other positions are new.

But in terms of information, we are testing S, T, M, P in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.

Alternatively, we could use a word without A in the other positions? But we don't have to. The word must have A in the third, but it can have A elsewhere? But if we use A elsewhere, and if that position is correct, we get a ✓, or if it's present but wrong position, we get a '-'. But we already know A is in the word, so we might be wasting a slot.

So, ideally, we avoid using A in other positions to test more new letters.

Therefore, STAID and STAMP both have only one A (in the third position). 

STAID: S, T, A, I, D -> no duplicate A.
STAMP: S, T, A, M, P -> no duplicate A.

Both are valid.

But STAID has I and D, while STAMP has M and P.

Which letters are more common? S and T are common in both. Then I, D vs M, P.

In English, M and P are more common than I and D? Actually, I is a vowel and very common. D is also common.

But let's look at frequency. Without getting too detailed, both are reasonable.

Another word: 
- SLACK: but C is absent, so we cannot use C.

- BLACK: same, C is absent.

- PLAIT: P-L-A-I-T -> T is common. But we have T in the fifth position. And we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So P, L, A, I, T. All new? Yes.

But PLAIT has A in the third, and no duplicate A.

So, options: STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

We can also consider: 
- SNAIL? But N is absent, so no.

- TRAIL? R is absent, so no.

- ALIAS? But A is in the first position, not third. We need A in the third.

So, let's choose among STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

I think STAID is a good choice because it uses I and D, which are common, and we haven't tested them.

But let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We have A already, but we might need to test other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is absent. So we know E is not in the word. Therefore, the remaining vowels are I, O, U.

In STAID, we are testing I. In PLAIT, we are also testing I. In STAMP, we are testing no vowel (only consonants). So STAID and PLAIT test a vowel (I) which might be important.

Between STAID and PLAIT, which one? 
- STAID: S, T, A, I, D
- PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T

Both have I and T. STAID has S and D, PLAIT has P and L.

S is more common than P? And D vs L? L is more common than D.

But we are testing positions: 
In STAID: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

In PLAIT:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: T

We know the third is A, so we are testing the other four positions.

We don't have any information about which positions might be correct for other letters, so we are just testing presence.

Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but E and N are out, and A we know.

So, from the top: T, O, I, S, H, R, D, L, U. But R is out.

So, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We have tested S and T in the first guess? No, in the first guess we tested C, R, A, N, E. So S, T, O, I, etc. are untested.

In STAID, we are testing S, T, I, D.
In PLAIT, we are testing P, L, I, T.

T is in both. I is in both.

So, STAID tests S and D, PLAIT tests P and L.

S is more common than P, and L is more common than D? 
- S is the 8th most common letter, P is 23rd? 
- L is 4th? Actually, let me recall: 
Common letter frequencies (approximate):
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...

So, S is 7th, H is 8th, R is 9th, D is 10th, L is 11th, U is 12th. P is around 16th.

So, S is more common than L? S is 7th, L is 11th? But we are testing two letters: in STAID: S (7th) and D (10th); in PLAIT: L (11th) and P (16th). So STAID tests higher frequency letters.

Also, we are testing T in both, which is the 2nd most common, but we are testing it in different positions.

But since we don't know the position, testing T is good.

Moreover, we are testing I (vowel) in both.

So, STAID seems better because it tests S and D, which are more common than P and L? Actually, S is more common than P, but L is more common than D? 
- D is 10th, L is 11th? They are close. But S (7th) is much better than P (16th).

So, overall, STAID tests more common letters.

Another word: 
- SHALT? Not common.
- SWAMI: W is less common.

So, I think STAID is a good choice.

But let me confirm: is STAID a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""staid"".

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E. STAID has none of these.

So, the next guess: staid

<guess>staid</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).

The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _, and it must exclude C, R, N, E.

For the next guess:
- Choose a word with A in the 3rd position and new, common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters (C, R, N, E) and prioritize high-frequency unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, D, L, O).
- ""Staid"" fits well: it has A in the 3rd position, uses new common letters (S, T, I, D), and avoids absent letters. It tests S in position 1, T in position 2, I in position 4, and D in position 5.

L is more common than D.\n\nBut we are testing positions: \nIn STAID: \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: D\n\nIn PLAIT:\n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: T\n\nWe know the third is A, so we are testing the other four positions.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about which positions might be correct for other letters, so we are just testing presence.\n\nSince we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but E and N are out, and A we know.\n\nSo, from the top: T, O, I, S, H, R, D, L, U. But R is out.\n\nSo, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\nWe have tested S and T in the first guess? No, in the first guess we tested C, R, A, N, E. So S, T, O, I, etc. are untested.\n\nIn STAID, we are testing S, T, I, D.\nIn PLAIT, we are testing P, L, I, T.\n\nT is in both. I is in both.\n\nSo, STAID tests S and D, PLAIT tests P and L.\n\nS is more common than P, and L is more common than D? \n- S is the 8th most common letter, P is 23rd? \n- L is 4th? Actually, let me recall: \nCommon letter frequencies (approximate):\nE, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...\n\nSo, S is 7th, H is 8th, R is 9th, D is 10th, L is 11th, U is 12th. P is around 16th.\n\nSo, S is more common than L? S is 7th, L is 11th? But we are testing two letters: in STAID: S (7th) and D (10th); in PLAIT: L (11th) and P (16th). So STAID tests higher frequency letters.\n\nAlso, we are testing T in both, which is the 2nd most common, but we are testing it in different positions.\n\nBut since we don\'t know the position, testing T is good.\n\nMoreover, we are testing I (vowel) in both.\n\nSo, STAID seems better because it tests S and D, which are more common than P and L? Actually, S is more common than P, but L is more common than D? \n- D is 10th, L is 11th? They are close. But S (7th) is much better than P (16th).\n\nSo, overall, STAID tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word: \n- SHALT? Not common.\n- SWAMI: W is less common.\n\nSo, I think STAID is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: is STAID a valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""staid"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E. STAID has none of these.\n\nSo, the next guess: staid\n\n<guess>staid</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, and E are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).\n\nThe secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _, and it must exclude C, R, N, E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Choose a word with A in the 3rd position and new, common letters to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating absent letters (C, R, N, E) and prioritize high-frequency unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, D, L, O).\n- ""Staid"" fits well: it has A in the 3rd position, uses new common letters (S, T, I, D), and avoids absent letters. It tests S in position 1, T in position 2, I in position 4, and D in position 5.\n\n<guess>staid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Second guess: ""staid"" -> S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position (since in ""staid"", S is first but got '-', meaning it's misplaced).
- A is correct in the 3rd position (we already knew this).
- T, I, D are absent.

So, summarizing what we know:
- The word must have A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- Letters that are in the word: S (somewhere except 1st position) and A (in 3rd).
- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.

Additionally, from the first guess, we used letters C,R,A,N,E; from the second, S,T,A,I,D. So tested letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,I,D.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.

Present letters: A (position 3), S (somewhere, but not in position 1).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has A in the 3rd position.
- Does not use the absent letters: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.
- Must contain S (since S is present but misplaced), but not in the 1st position.

Also, we should use new letters to gain more information about the remaining positions.

The word pattern: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 3: A.
- Position 1 cannot be S (since S is misplaced when in 1st).

Therefore, the word is: [not S, and not absent] in pos1, [any letter not absent] in pos2, A in pos3, [any letter not absent] in pos4, [any letter not absent] in pos5.

Additionally, S must appear in one of positions 2,4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1).

Now, what letters haven't been tested? We have tested: A,C,D,E,I,N,R,S,T.

So missing letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we want common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common ones: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

We also know that S is present, so we must include S in the guess, but not in position 1.

Therefore, our next guess must include S in positions 2,4, or 5, and A in position 3.

We also avoid: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.

So, let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ _ , with S in 2,4, or 5, and using new letters.

Possible positions for S:
- Option1: S in position 2 -> pattern: _ S A _ _
- Option2: S in position 4 -> pattern: _ _ A S _
- Option3: S in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ A _ S

We should consider each case and find words that use common new letters.

But since we don't know which, we can choose a word that includes S and tests new letters.

Also, we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, if S is in position 4: _ _ A S _

What could it be? For example:
- with common letters: BALSA? B-A-L-S-A? But A in third? BALSA has letters B,A,L,S,A. Pattern: B(1) A(2) L(3) S(4) A(5) -> but we need A in 3rd? In BALSA: position 3 is L, not A. So no.

We need the third letter to be A, so if the word ends with S, it could be:

For S in position 4: _ _ A S _

Words like: 
- BASIS: but we have S twice? And I is absent? I is absent (from second guess), so BASIS uses I, which is invalid. Also, S is in pos4 and pos5? But we must avoid I.

Basis: B-A-S-I-S, but third letter is S? Not A.

Must have A in third.

Another: 
- MASON: M-A-S-O-N, but third letter is S? Not A. And N is absent.

Not working.

What about: CLASS? C is absent and pattern: C-L-A-S-S, third is A. But C is absent and also we need to avoid C.

But CLASS uses C? C in position 1: absent.

Also, it has two S's? But if S is present, we can use it twice? The feedback from ""staid"" only showed one S, but there might be more? We don't know.

However, we can't use CLASS because C is absent.

Similarly, GLASS: G-L-A-S-S -> third is A, and avoids absent letters? Absent are C,R,N,E,T,I,D. G,L,S are new. So GLASS: G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So positions: S is in 4 and 5? But we know S is present and not in position 1, so it could be in 4 or 5? But we have two S's? That's possible.

But GLASS has two S's, which might be inefficient for information, but it's acceptable.

Similarly, other options: BRASS? B-R-A-S-S -> but R is absent, so no.

But let's consider S in other positions.

Alternatively, S in position 2: pattern: _ S A _ _

For example, words like:
- PSA: but need 5 letters? Like PSALM? P-S-A-L-M -> yes, P(1), S(2), A(3), L(4), M(5). Avoids absent letters? Yes.

Similarly, IS: but I is absent.

Another: USUAL? U-S-U-A-L -> third is U? Not A. And U is repeated.

Not A in third.

What about: W: WS: W is not common.

PSALM is a valid word: P-S-A-L-M.

Similarly, S in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ S

For example, words like:
- MANAS: but M-A-N-A-S, third is N? Not A; and N absent.
- GALAS: G-A-L-A-S, third letter L? Not A.
- PAPAS: P-A-P-A-S, third P? Not A.

We need the third letter A.

Another: LO: but? e.g., D: LAMAS? L-A-M-A-S, but third is M? No.

What about BASAL? B-A-S-A-L, third letter S? Not A; and last L.

We need the third letter to be A.

So for S in position 5: the fourth letter can be anything, but we need the word to have A in third and S in fifth.

For example, CHAOS: C-H-A-O-S -> C absent? C is absent. And third is A, fifth is S. But C is absent, so invalid. Also, O is new.

CHAOS uses C? C in position 1: absent, so invalid.

Another: F: FA? FLABS? F-L-A-B-S, third A, fifth S? Yes: F(1), L(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). F, L, B, S are new? Yes, and avoids absent letters.

FLABS is a word? Flab is fat, flabs might be acceptable or plural? But let's check if valid.

Similarly, BLABS: B-L-A-B-S -> third A, fifth S.

But BLABS uses B twice? Not efficient.

GOALS? G-O-A-L-S -> fifth is S? Yes: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). Third is A, position 5 is S. Avoids absent letters? G,O,L,S all new and not absent.

Similarly, COALS? But C absent.

GOALS: G-O-A-L-S.

We could also use something like SH: SH? SHWA: doesn't work.

So, possible words:
- PSALM (P-S-A-L-M): S in position 2.
- GLASS (G-L-A-S-S): S in position 4 and 5? But we need to include S, and in this case it's in both positions? But we know S is present so having it twice is okay but might give redundant info.
- FLABS (F-L-A-B-S): S in position 5.
- GOALS (G-O-A-L-S): S in position 5.

Among these, GOALS seems common and straightforward.

PSALM might be less common.

Now, we also have the constraint that in our guess, we must not use S in position 1, which we are avoiding.

Additionally, since S is present and not in 1, we want to test a position for S. But in the words above, for PSALM, S is in position 2; in GOALS, S is in position 5; in GLASS, S in 4 and 5.

But GLASS has duplicate S, which might not be ideal because if both are incorrect positions, we don't learn which one is correct; but actually, the feedback will show if there are multiple S's.

However, to maximize distinct letters, we should avoid duplicates.

So, GOALS: G,O,A,L,S -> letters: G,O,L,S (and A) all distinct? G,O,A,L,S — A is already known, but we are testing new letters G,O,L.

Similarly, PSALM: P,S,A,L,M — distinct S,P,L,M.

But S is already known. So for information, we want to test new possible letters.

Now, GOALS has O and L, which are common, and G is less common.

PSALM has L, M, P? P is less common? O is a vowel and very common, more than P.

Letter frequencies: O is more common than P, L.

So GOALS might be better? But let's compare:

GOALS: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> we get feedback on G, O, L in positions 1,2,4.

PSALM: P(1), S(2), A(3), L(4), M(5) -> feedback on P in 1, S in 2 (we know S is present but misplaced, so position 2 might be correct or not), L in 4, M in 5.

In PSALM, S is in position 2, which we think might be possible.

But note: in GOALS, S is in position 5, which is also possible.

Another option: what we didn't consider S in position 4? Earlier we had GLASS but duplicates.

Is there a word with S in position 4, without duplicates? Pattern: _ _ A S _, and no absent letters, with distinct letters.

For example: 
- PANS: too short? Wait, 5 letters: like TRAMS? T is absent. 
- BE: BEAUS? Not common.
- ME: MEALS? M-E-A-L-S, but E is absent? E is absent (from first guess), so MEALS is invalid because E.

Similarly, LEADS? E and D absent.

So hard: because if S in position 4, the word must have two letters before A and one after, all avoiding absent letters.

Another: QUASH? Q-U-A-S-H -> third A? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes. And Q and U are new, H new. But Q is less common.

Not ideal.

Alternatively, SWASH? S in position 1? But we can't have S in pos1? In SWASH: S(1) W(2) A(3) S(4) H(5) -> S in position 1, which we know is not allowed? Because from feedback, S cannot be in position 1 (it was misplaced). Also, S in position 1 would be invalid because we know it's not there.

So SWASH is not allowed.

Back to the choices: PSALM, GOALS, FLABS.

FLABS: F(1) L(2) A(3) B(4) S(5) -> letters: F,L,B,S. Distinct? Yes. B and F are new.

But GOALS: G,O,L,S — O is a vowel, which we haven't tested much (only A and E are vowels, E is out, we have A, so other vowels could be useful).

PSALM: P,S,L,M — consonants.

Since we know S is present, by putting S in different positions we can pin down its location.

For example, in GOALS, S is in position 5; if S is not in position 5, we get feedback for S: if it moves to another position? No, the feedback will tell us for each letter.

But if in GOALS, we put S in position 5 and get S(✓), then we know S is in correct position 5.

Similarly, if we get S(-x), then S is not in 5, so it must be in 2 or 4? From previous, we only have three positions left: 2,4,5 (but 1 is out).

We can choose to test a position that is likely.

But we don't know, so either is fine.

I think GOALS is a reasonable choice because:
- It includes O, a common vowel.
- All distinct letters: G,O,A,L,S → A is known, but testing G,O,L in new positions.
- Avoids absent letters.

PSALM is also good, but P and M are less common than O and G? O is more common than P.

So, I will go with ""goals"".

Thus, next guess: goals

<guess>goals</guess>
</think>
Based of previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in the correct position (3rd), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""staid"": A is confirmed correct in the 3rd position, S is present but misplaced (not in position 1), and T, I, D are absent.

Key insights:
- The secret word pattern must be: _ _ A _ _
- S is present but cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.
- Remaining letters should prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., G, O, L, B, F, M, P).

For this guess, I chose ""goals"" because:
- It places A in the required 3rd position.
- It includes S in position 5, testing a possible location for S.
- It tests new common letters: G, O, L (untested vowels/consonants).
- Avoids all absent letters (C,R,N,E,T,I,D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information potential.

<guess>goals</guess>",goals,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Second guess: ""staid"" -> S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position (since in ""staid"", S is first but got '-', meaning it's misplaced).
- A is correct in the 3rd position (we already knew this).
- T, I, D are absent.

So, summarizing what we know:
- The word must have A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- Letters that are in the word: S (somewhere except 1st position) and A (in 3rd).
- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.

Additionally, from the first guess, we used letters C,R,A,N,E; from the second, S,T,A,I,D. So tested letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,I,D.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.

Present letters: A (position 3), S (somewhere, but not in position 1).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has A in the 3rd position.
- Does not use the absent letters: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.
- Must contain S (since S is present but misplaced), but not in the 1st position.

Also, we should use new letters to gain more information about the remaining positions.

The word pattern: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 3: A.
- Position 1 cannot be S (since S is misplaced when in 1st).

Therefore, the word is: [not S, and not absent] in pos1, [any letter not absent] in pos2, A in pos3, [any letter not absent] in pos4, [any letter not absent] in pos5.

Additionally, S must appear in one of positions 2,4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1).

Now, what letters haven't been tested? We have tested: A,C,D,E,I,N,R,S,T.

So missing letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we want common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common ones: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

We also know that S is present, so we must include S in the guess, but not in position 1.

Therefore, our next guess must include S in positions 2,4, or 5, and A in position 3.

We also avoid: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.

So, let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ _ , with S in 2,4, or 5, and using new letters.

Possible positions for S:
- Option1: S in position 2 -> pattern: _ S A _ _
- Option2: S in position 4 -> pattern: _ _ A S _
- Option3: S in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ A _ S

We should consider each case and find words that use common new letters.

But since we don't know which, we can choose a word that includes S and tests new letters.

Also, we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, if S is in position 4: _ _ A S _

What could it be? For example:
- with common letters: BALSA? B-A-L-S-A? But A in third? BALSA has letters B,A,L,S,A. Pattern: B(1) A(2) L(3) S(4) A(5) -> but we need A in 3rd? In BALSA: position 3 is L, not A. So no.

Must have A in third.

Not working.

What about: CLASS? C is absent and pattern: C-L-A-S-S, third is A. But C is absent and also we need to avoid C.

But CLASS uses C? C in position 1: absent.

Also, it has two S's? But if S is present, we can use it twice? The feedback from ""staid"" only showed one S, but there might be more? We don't know.

Another: USUAL? U-S-U-A-L -> third is U? Not A. And U is repeated.

Not A in third.

What about: W: WS: W is not common.

PSALM is a valid word: P-S-A-L-M.

Similarly, S in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ S

For example, words like:
- MANAS: but M-A-N-A-S, third is N? Not A; and N absent.
- GALAS: G-A-L-A-S, third letter L? Not A.
- PAPAS: P-A-P-A-S, third P? Not A.

We need the third letter A.

Another: LO: but? e.g., D: LAMAS? L-A-M-A-S, but third is M? No.

What about BASAL? B-A-S-A-L, third letter S? Not A; and last L.

We need the third letter to be A.

So for S in position 5: the fourth letter can be anything, but we need the word to have A in third and S in fifth.

For example, CHAOS: C-H-A-O-S -> C absent? C is absent. And third is A, fifth is S. But C is absent, so invalid. Also, O is new.

CHAOS uses C? C in position 1: absent, so invalid.

Another: F: FA? FLABS? F-L-A-B-S, third A, fifth S? Yes: F(1), L(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). F, L, B, S are new? Yes, and avoids absent letters.

FLABS is a word? Flab is fat, flabs might be acceptable or plural? But let's check if valid.

Similarly, BLABS: B-L-A-B-S -> third A, fifth S.

But BLABS uses B twice? Not efficient.

GOALS? G-O-A-L-S -> fifth is S? Yes: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). Third is A, position 5 is S. Avoids absent letters? G,O,L,S all new and not absent.

Similarly, COALS? But C absent.

GOALS: G-O-A-L-S.

We could also use something like SH: SH? SHWA: doesn't work.

So, possible words:
- PSALM (P-S-A-L-M): S in position 2.
- GLASS (G-L-A-S-S): S in position 4 and 5? But we need to include S, and in this case it's in both positions? But we know S is present so having it twice is okay but might give redundant info.
- FLABS (F-L-A-B-S): S in position 5.
- GOALS (G-O-A-L-S): S in position 5.

Among these, GOALS seems common and straightforward.

PSALM might be less common.

Now, we also have the constraint that in our guess, we must not use S in position 1, which we are avoiding.

Additionally, since S is present and not in 1, we want to test a position for S. But in the words above, for PSALM, S is in position 2; in GOALS, S is in position 5; in GLASS, S in 4 and 5.

But GLASS has duplicate S, which might not be ideal because if both are incorrect positions, we don't learn which one is correct; but actually, the feedback will show if there are multiple S's.

In PSALM, S is in position 2, which we think might be possible.

But note: in GOALS, S is in position 5, which is also possible.

Another option: what we didn't consider S in position 4? Earlier we had GLASS but duplicates.

Is there a word with S in position 4, without duplicates? Pattern: _ _ A S _, and no absent letters, with distinct letters.

For example: 
- PANS: too short? Wait, 5 letters: like TRAMS? T is absent. 
- BE: BEAUS? Not common.
- ME: MEALS? M-E-A-L-S, but E is absent? E is absent (from first guess), so MEALS is invalid because E.

Similarly, LEADS? E and D absent.

So hard: because if S in position 4, the word must have two letters before A and one after, all avoiding absent letters.

Another: QUASH? Q-U-A-S-H -> third A? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes. And Q and U are new, H new. But Q is less common.

Not ideal.

Alternatively, SWASH? S in position 1? But we can't have S in pos1? In SWASH: S(1) W(2) A(3) S(4) H(5) -> S in position 1, which we know is not allowed? Because from feedback, S cannot be in position 1 (it was misplaced). Also, S in position 1 would be invalid because we know it's not there.

So SWASH is not allowed.

Back to the choices: PSALM, GOALS, FLABS.

FLABS: F(1) L(2) A(3) B(4) S(5) -> letters: F,L,B,S. Distinct? Yes. B and F are new.

But GOALS: G,O,L,S — O is a vowel, which we haven't tested much (only A and E are vowels, E is out, we have A, so other vowels could be useful).

PSALM: P,S,L,M — consonants.

Since we know S is present, by putting S in different positions we can pin down its location.

For example, in GOALS, S is in position 5; if S is not in position 5, we get feedback for S: if it moves to another position? No, the feedback will tell us for each letter.

But if in GOALS, we put S in position 5 and get S(✓), then we know S is in correct position 5.

Similarly, if we get S(-x), then S is not in 5, so it must be in 2 or 4? From previous, we only have three positions left: 2,4,5 (but 1 is out).

We can choose to test a position that is likely.

But we don't know, so either is fine.

I think GOALS is a reasonable choice because:
- It includes O, a common vowel.
- All distinct letters: G,O,A,L,S → A is known, but testing G,O,L in new positions.
- Avoids absent letters.

PSALM is also good, but P and M are less common than O and G? O is more common than P.

So, I will go with ""goals"".

Thus, next guess: goals

<guess>goals</guess>Based of previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in the correct position (3rd), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""staid"": A is confirmed correct in the 3rd position, S is present but misplaced (not in position 1), and T, I, D are absent.

Key insights:
- The secret word pattern must be: _ _ A _ _
- S is present but cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.
- Remaining letters should prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., G, O, L, B, F, M, P).

For this guess, I chose ""goals"" because:
- It places A in the required 3rd position.
- It includes S in position 5, testing a possible location for S.
- It tests new common letters: G, O, L (untested vowels/consonants).
- Avoids all absent letters (C,R,N,E,T,I,D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information potential.",Guess 3: goals -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(x) A(✓) L(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,quash,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting fresh with no prior guesses. We need to make a first guess. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters and positions.

A good starting word often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters. Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers vowels and common consonants.

Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I want to maximize information by using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains commonly used letters: C, R, A, N, E.
- It covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants, which helps test a broad range of letters.
- All letters are unique, so each feedback will provide clear information about that specific letter.
- This word eliminates or confirms multiple high-frequency letters in one guess, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since ""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so A is the 3rd letter).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have the pattern _ _ A _ _

Some possibilities:
- SALAD (but has A twice, and we already know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again? Actually, the feedback only told us about the A in the 3rd position. It didn't say anything about other A's. However, since we are avoiding known absent letters, and we don't have information about other A's, we can use A again? But to maximize new information, it's better to use all new letters if possible. However, the word must have A in the third position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (in the correct position). If there were another A, it would have been indicated with a '-' or '✓' in another position? Actually, no. In the first guess, we only had one A. So we don't know if there are additional A's.

However, we are allowed to use A again? But to get more information, we should try to use new letters.

But the constraint is: we must have A in the third position.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible words:
- SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> but has two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, but the 5th is also A. We don't know if that's allowed. The word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are possible.

But to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters we already know (unless necessary). We know A is present, so using A again might not give new information about other letters.

So, ideally, we choose a word with A in the third position and four new letters.

Let me try to find such words.

Common words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E:

- STAFF? But has F twice and we don't know about F. Also, S and T are common. But let's see: S-T-A-F-F -> but it has duplicate F. And we are on the second guess, so we can try.

But we want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Better words:
- STAID: S-T-A-I-D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. All unique and new.
- PLAID: P-L-A-I-D -> but P, L, A, I, D. However, we don't know about P, L, I, D. But note: we have to avoid R, which we are, and also C, N, E.

But we don't have any information about P, L, I, D.

Another one: 
- SHALT? But that's not very common. 
- STAND? But N is not allowed (we got N as absent in the first guess).

We cannot use N because the first feedback said N is absent.

So, STAND is invalid because of N.

Similarly, we cannot use R, so words like TRACK are invalid.

Another word: 
- SQUAD: S-Q-U-A-D -> but Q is not very common and might not be in the word. Also, we are trying to use common letters.

Better to use common letters.

Another: 
- SWAMI: S-W-A-M-I -> W and M and I. W is less common.

But let's consider STAID: S-T-A-I-D. This seems good because S, T, I, D are common.

Another possibility: 
- PLAZA: P-L-A-Z-A -> has two A's and Z is not common. Not ideal.

- MANIA: but M is allowed? But we have A again and also we cannot use N? Wait, MANIA: M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent, so we cannot use N. Also, the pattern requires A in the third position? MANIA is M-A-N-I-A, so the third letter is N, not A. So it doesn't fit.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, let's stick with STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

But is STAID a valid word? Yes, it means reserved or unadventurous.

Another common word: 
- STAKE: but we cannot use E (absent) and K is allowed? But E is absent, so STAKE is invalid.

- STAMP: S-T-A-M-P -> M and P. But we cannot use M? We don't know about M. And P is new. But we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: the first guess said E is absent, so we can't use E. But M and P are new.

But STAMP has no E, so it's okay? But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. All new letters? Yes, and A in the third position.

But we are using A again? In the third position, which we know is correct, so we are not testing A again in a new position. But we are forced to put A in the third. The other positions are new.

But in terms of information, we are testing S, T, M, P in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.

Alternatively, we could use a word without A in the other positions? But we don't have to. The word must have A in the third, but it can have A elsewhere? But if we use A elsewhere, and if that position is correct, we get a ✓, or if it's present but wrong position, we get a '-'. But we already know A is in the word, so we might be wasting a slot.

So, ideally, we avoid using A in other positions to test more new letters.

Therefore, STAID and STAMP both have only one A (in the third position). 

STAID: S, T, A, I, D -> no duplicate A.
STAMP: S, T, A, M, P -> no duplicate A.

Both are valid.

But STAID has I and D, while STAMP has M and P.

Which letters are more common? S and T are common in both. Then I, D vs M, P.

In English, M and P are more common than I and D? Actually, I is a vowel and very common. D is also common.

But let's look at frequency. Without getting too detailed, both are reasonable.

Another word: 
- SLACK: but C is absent, so we cannot use C.

- BLACK: same, C is absent.

- PLAIT: P-L-A-I-T -> T is common. But we have T in the fifth position. And we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So P, L, A, I, T. All new? Yes.

But PLAIT has A in the third, and no duplicate A.

So, options: STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

We can also consider: 
- SNAIL? But N is absent, so no.

- TRAIL? R is absent, so no.

- ALIAS? But A is in the first position, not third. We need A in the third.

So, let's choose among STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.

I think STAID is a good choice because it uses I and D, which are common, and we haven't tested them.

But let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We have A already, but we might need to test other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is absent. So we know E is not in the word. Therefore, the remaining vowels are I, O, U.

In STAID, we are testing I. In PLAIT, we are also testing I. In STAMP, we are testing no vowel (only consonants). So STAID and PLAIT test a vowel (I) which might be important.

Between STAID and PLAIT, which one? 
- STAID: S, T, A, I, D
- PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T

Both have I and T. STAID has S and D, PLAIT has P and L.

S is more common than P? And D vs L? L is more common than D.

But we are testing positions: 
In STAID: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

In PLAIT:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: T

We know the third is A, so we are testing the other four positions.

We don't have any information about which positions might be correct for other letters, so we are just testing presence.

Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but E and N are out, and A we know.

So, from the top: T, O, I, S, H, R, D, L, U. But R is out.

So, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We have tested S and T in the first guess? No, in the first guess we tested C, R, A, N, E. So S, T, O, I, etc. are untested.

In STAID, we are testing S, T, I, D.
In PLAIT, we are testing P, L, I, T.

T is in both. I is in both.

So, STAID tests S and D, PLAIT tests P and L.

S is more common than P, and L is more common than D? 
- S is the 8th most common letter, P is 23rd? 
- L is 4th? Actually, let me recall: 
Common letter frequencies (approximate):
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...

So, S is 7th, H is 8th, R is 9th, D is 10th, L is 11th, U is 12th. P is around 16th.

So, S is more common than L? S is 7th, L is 11th? But we are testing two letters: in STAID: S (7th) and D (10th); in PLAIT: L (11th) and P (16th). So STAID tests higher frequency letters.

Also, we are testing T in both, which is the 2nd most common, but we are testing it in different positions.

But since we don't know the position, testing T is good.

Moreover, we are testing I (vowel) in both.

So, STAID seems better because it tests S and D, which are more common than P and L? Actually, S is more common than P, but L is more common than D? 
- D is 10th, L is 11th? They are close. But S (7th) is much better than P (16th).

So, overall, STAID tests more common letters.

Another word: 
- SHALT? Not common.
- SWAMI: W is less common.

So, I think STAID is a good choice.

But let me confirm: is STAID a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""staid"".

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E. STAID has none of these.

So, the next guess: staid

<guess>staid</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).

The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _, and it must exclude C, R, N, E.

For the next guess:
- Choose a word with A in the 3rd position and new, common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters (C, R, N, E) and prioritize high-frequency unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, D, L, O).
- ""Staid"" fits well: it has A in the 3rd position, uses new common letters (S, T, I, D), and avoids absent letters. It tests S in position 1, T in position 2, I in position 4, and D in position 5.

<guess>staid</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Second guess: ""staid"" -> S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position (since in ""staid"", S is first but got '-', meaning it's misplaced).
- A is correct in the 3rd position (we already knew this).
- T, I, D are absent.

So, summarizing what we know:
- The word must have A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- Letters that are in the word: S (somewhere except 1st position) and A (in 3rd).
- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.

Additionally, from the first guess, we used letters C,R,A,N,E; from the second, S,T,A,I,D. So tested letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,I,D.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.

Present letters: A (position 3), S (somewhere, but not in position 1).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has A in the 3rd position.
- Does not use the absent letters: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.
- Must contain S (since S is present but misplaced), but not in the 1st position.

Also, we should use new letters to gain more information about the remaining positions.

The word pattern: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 3: A.
- Position 1 cannot be S (since S is misplaced when in 1st).

Therefore, the word is: [not S, and not absent] in pos1, [any letter not absent] in pos2, A in pos3, [any letter not absent] in pos4, [any letter not absent] in pos5.

Additionally, S must appear in one of positions 2,4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1).

Now, what letters haven't been tested? We have tested: A,C,D,E,I,N,R,S,T.

So missing letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we want common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common ones: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

We also know that S is present, so we must include S in the guess, but not in position 1.

Therefore, our next guess must include S in positions 2,4, or 5, and A in position 3.

We also avoid: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.

So, let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ _ , with S in 2,4, or 5, and using new letters.

Possible positions for S:
- Option1: S in position 2 -> pattern: _ S A _ _
- Option2: S in position 4 -> pattern: _ _ A S _
- Option3: S in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ A _ S

We should consider each case and find words that use common new letters.

But since we don't know which, we can choose a word that includes S and tests new letters.

Also, we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Let me try to list possible words.

First, if S is in position 4: _ _ A S _

What could it be? For example:
- with common letters: BALSA? B-A-L-S-A? But A in third? BALSA has letters B,A,L,S,A. Pattern: B(1) A(2) L(3) S(4) A(5) -> but we need A in 3rd? In BALSA: position 3 is L, not A. So no.

We need the third letter to be A, so if the word ends with S, it could be:

For S in position 4: _ _ A S _

Words like: 
- BASIS: but we have S twice? And I is absent? I is absent (from second guess), so BASIS uses I, which is invalid. Also, S is in pos4 and pos5? But we must avoid I.

Basis: B-A-S-I-S, but third letter is S? Not A.

Must have A in third.

Another: 
- MASON: M-A-S-O-N, but third letter is S? Not A. And N is absent.

Not working.

What about: CLASS? C is absent and pattern: C-L-A-S-S, third is A. But C is absent and also we need to avoid C.

But CLASS uses C? C in position 1: absent.

Also, it has two S's? But if S is present, we can use it twice? The feedback from ""staid"" only showed one S, but there might be more? We don't know.

However, we can't use CLASS because C is absent.

Similarly, GLASS: G-L-A-S-S -> third is A, and avoids absent letters? Absent are C,R,N,E,T,I,D. G,L,S are new. So GLASS: G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So positions: S is in 4 and 5? But we know S is present and not in position 1, so it could be in 4 or 5? But we have two S's? That's possible.

But GLASS has two S's, which might be inefficient for information, but it's acceptable.

Similarly, other options: BRASS? B-R-A-S-S -> but R is absent, so no.

But let's consider S in other positions.

Alternatively, S in position 2: pattern: _ S A _ _

For example, words like:
- PSA: but need 5 letters? Like PSALM? P-S-A-L-M -> yes, P(1), S(2), A(3), L(4), M(5). Avoids absent letters? Yes.

Similarly, IS: but I is absent.

Another: USUAL? U-S-U-A-L -> third is U? Not A. And U is repeated.

Not A in third.

What about: W: WS: W is not common.

PSALM is a valid word: P-S-A-L-M.

Similarly, S in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ S

For example, words like:
- MANAS: but M-A-N-A-S, third is N? Not A; and N absent.
- GALAS: G-A-L-A-S, third letter L? Not A.
- PAPAS: P-A-P-A-S, third P? Not A.

We need the third letter A.

Another: LO: but? e.g., D: LAMAS? L-A-M-A-S, but third is M? No.

What about BASAL? B-A-S-A-L, third letter S? Not A; and last L.

We need the third letter to be A.

So for S in position 5: the fourth letter can be anything, but we need the word to have A in third and S in fifth.

For example, CHAOS: C-H-A-O-S -> C absent? C is absent. And third is A, fifth is S. But C is absent, so invalid. Also, O is new.

CHAOS uses C? C in position 1: absent, so invalid.

Another: F: FA? FLABS? F-L-A-B-S, third A, fifth S? Yes: F(1), L(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). F, L, B, S are new? Yes, and avoids absent letters.

FLABS is a word? Flab is fat, flabs might be acceptable or plural? But let's check if valid.

Similarly, BLABS: B-L-A-B-S -> third A, fifth S.

But BLABS uses B twice? Not efficient.

GOALS? G-O-A-L-S -> fifth is S? Yes: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). Third is A, position 5 is S. Avoids absent letters? G,O,L,S all new and not absent.

Similarly, COALS? But C absent.

GOALS: G-O-A-L-S.

We could also use something like SH: SH? SHWA: doesn't work.

So, possible words:
- PSALM (P-S-A-L-M): S in position 2.
- GLASS (G-L-A-S-S): S in position 4 and 5? But we need to include S, and in this case it's in both positions? But we know S is present so having it twice is okay but might give redundant info.
- FLABS (F-L-A-B-S): S in position 5.
- GOALS (G-O-A-L-S): S in position 5.

Among these, GOALS seems common and straightforward.

PSALM might be less common.

Now, we also have the constraint that in our guess, we must not use S in position 1, which we are avoiding.

Additionally, since S is present and not in 1, we want to test a position for S. But in the words above, for PSALM, S is in position 2; in GOALS, S is in position 5; in GLASS, S in 4 and 5.

But GLASS has duplicate S, which might not be ideal because if both are incorrect positions, we don't learn which one is correct; but actually, the feedback will show if there are multiple S's.

However, to maximize distinct letters, we should avoid duplicates.

So, GOALS: G,O,A,L,S -> letters: G,O,L,S (and A) all distinct? G,O,A,L,S — A is already known, but we are testing new letters G,O,L.

Similarly, PSALM: P,S,A,L,M — distinct S,P,L,M.

But S is already known. So for information, we want to test new possible letters.

Now, GOALS has O and L, which are common, and G is less common.

PSALM has L, M, P? P is less common? O is a vowel and very common, more than P.

Letter frequencies: O is more common than P, L.

So GOALS might be better? But let's compare:

GOALS: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> we get feedback on G, O, L in positions 1,2,4.

PSALM: P(1), S(2), A(3), L(4), M(5) -> feedback on P in 1, S in 2 (we know S is present but misplaced, so position 2 might be correct or not), L in 4, M in 5.

In PSALM, S is in position 2, which we think might be possible.

But note: in GOALS, S is in position 5, which is also possible.

Another option: what we didn't consider S in position 4? Earlier we had GLASS but duplicates.

Is there a word with S in position 4, without duplicates? Pattern: _ _ A S _, and no absent letters, with distinct letters.

For example: 
- PANS: too short? Wait, 5 letters: like TRAMS? T is absent. 
- BE: BEAUS? Not common.
- ME: MEALS? M-E-A-L-S, but E is absent? E is absent (from first guess), so MEALS is invalid because E.

Similarly, LEADS? E and D absent.

So hard: because if S in position 4, the word must have two letters before A and one after, all avoiding absent letters.

Another: QUASH? Q-U-A-S-H -> third A? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes. And Q and U are new, H new. But Q is less common.

Not ideal.

Alternatively, SWASH? S in position 1? But we can't have S in pos1? In SWASH: S(1) W(2) A(3) S(4) H(5) -> S in position 1, which we know is not allowed? Because from feedback, S cannot be in position 1 (it was misplaced). Also, S in position 1 would be invalid because we know it's not there.

So SWASH is not allowed.

Back to the choices: PSALM, GOALS, FLABS.

FLABS: F(1) L(2) A(3) B(4) S(5) -> letters: F,L,B,S. Distinct? Yes. B and F are new.

But GOALS: G,O,L,S — O is a vowel, which we haven't tested much (only A and E are vowels, E is out, we have A, so other vowels could be useful).

PSALM: P,S,L,M — consonants.

Since we know S is present, by putting S in different positions we can pin down its location.

For example, in GOALS, S is in position 5; if S is not in position 5, we get feedback for S: if it moves to another position? No, the feedback will tell us for each letter.

But if in GOALS, we put S in position 5 and get S(✓), then we know S is in correct position 5.

Similarly, if we get S(-x), then S is not in 5, so it must be in 2 or 4? From previous, we only have three positions left: 2,4,5 (but 1 is out).

We can choose to test a position that is likely.

But we don't know, so either is fine.

I think GOALS is a reasonable choice because:
- It includes O, a common vowel.
- All distinct letters: G,O,A,L,S → A is known, but testing G,O,L in new positions.
- Avoids absent letters.

PSALM is also good, but P and M are less common than O and G? O is more common than P.

So, I will go with ""goals"".

Thus, next guess: goals

<guess>goals</guess>Based of previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in the correct position (3rd), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""staid"": A is confirmed correct in the 3rd position, S is present but misplaced (not in position 1), and T, I, D are absent.

Key insights:
- The secret word pattern must be: _ _ A _ _
- S is present but cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.
- Remaining letters should prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., G, O, L, B, F, M, P).

For this guess, I chose ""goals"" because:
- It places A in the required 3rd position.
- It includes S in position 5, testing a possible location for S.
- It tests new common letters: G, O, L (untested vowels/consonants).
- Avoids all absent letters (C,R,N,E,T,I,D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information potential.

Actually, the feedback only told us about the A in the 3rd position. It didn\'t say anything about other A\'s. However, since we are avoiding known absent letters, and we don\'t have information about other A\'s, we can use A again? But to maximize new information, it\'s better to use all new letters if possible. However, the word must have A in the third position.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (in the correct position). If there were another A, it would have been indicated with a \'-\' or \'✓\' in another position? Actually, no. In the first guess, we only had one A. So we don\'t know if there are additional A\'s.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to use A again? But to get more information, we should try to use new letters.\n\nBut the constraint is: we must have A in the third position.\n\nLet me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> but has two A\'s. We know A is in the 3rd, but the 5th is also A. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. The word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are possible.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters we already know (unless necessary). We know A is present, so using A again might not give new information about other letters.\n\nSo, ideally, we choose a word with A in the third position and four new letters.\n\nLet me try to find such words.\n\nCommon words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E:\n\n- STAFF? But has F twice and we don\'t know about F. Also, S and T are common. But let\'s see: S-T-A-F-F -> but it has duplicate F. And we are on the second guess, so we can try.\n\nBut we want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nBetter words:\n- STAID: S-T-A-I-D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. All unique and new.\n- PLAID: P-L-A-I-D -> but P, L, A, I, D. However, we don\'t know about P, L, I, D. But note: we have to avoid R, which we are, and also C, N, E.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about P, L, I, D.\n\nAnother one: \n- SHALT? But that\'s not very common. \n- STAND? But N is not allowed (we got N as absent in the first guess).\n\nWe cannot use N because the first feedback said N is absent.\n\nSo, STAND is invalid because of N.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use R, so words like TRACK are invalid.\n\nAnother word: \n- SQUAD: S-Q-U-A-D -> but Q is not very common and might not be in the word. Also, we are trying to use common letters.\n\nBetter to use common letters.\n\nAnother: \n- SWAMI: S-W-A-M-I -> W and M and I. W is less common.\n\nBut let\'s consider STAID: S-T-A-I-D. This seems good because S, T, I, D are common.\n\nAnother possibility: \n- PLAZA: P-L-A-Z-A -> has two A\'s and Z is not common. Not ideal.\n\n- MANIA: but M is allowed? But we have A again and also we cannot use N? Wait, MANIA: M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent, so we cannot use N. Also, the pattern requires A in the third position? MANIA is M-A-N-I-A, so the third letter is N, not A. So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with STAID: S-T-A-I-D.\n\nBut is STAID a valid word? Yes, it means reserved or unadventurous.\n\nAnother common word: \n- STAKE: but we cannot use E (absent) and K is allowed? But E is absent, so STAKE is invalid.\n\n- STAMP: S-T-A-M-P -> M and P. But we cannot use M? We don\'t know about M. And P is new. But we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: the first guess said E is absent, so we can\'t use E. But M and P are new.\n\nBut STAMP has no E, so it\'s okay? But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. All new letters? Yes, and A in the third position.\n\nBut we are using A again? In the third position, which we know is correct, so we are not testing A again in a new position. But we are forced to put A in the third. The other positions are new.\n\nBut in terms of information, we are testing S, T, M, P in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word without A in the other positions? But we don\'t have to. The word must have A in the third, but it can have A elsewhere? But if we use A elsewhere, and if that position is correct, we get a ✓, or if it\'s present but wrong position, we get a \'-\'. But we already know A is in the word, so we might be wasting a slot.\n\nSo, ideally, we avoid using A in other positions to test more new letters.\n\nTherefore, STAID and STAMP both have only one A (in the third position). \n\nSTAID: S, T, A, I, D -> no duplicate A.\nSTAMP: S, T, A, M, P -> no duplicate A.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut STAID has I and D, while STAMP has M and P.\n\nWhich letters are more common? S and T are common in both. Then I, D vs M, P.\n\nIn English, M and P are more common than I and D? Actually, I is a vowel and very common. D is also common.\n\nBut let\'s look at frequency. Without getting too detailed, both are reasonable.\n\nAnother word: \n- SLACK: but C is absent, so we cannot use C.\n\n- BLACK: same, C is absent.\n\n- PLAIT: P-L-A-I-T -> T is common. But we have T in the fifth position. And we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So P, L, A, I, T. All new? Yes.\n\nBut PLAIT has A in the third, and no duplicate A.\n\nSo, options: STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.\n\nWe can also consider: \n- SNAIL? But N is absent, so no.\n\n- TRAIL? R is absent, so no.\n\n- ALIAS? But A is in the first position, not third. We need A in the third.\n\nSo, let\'s choose among STAID, STAMP, PLAIT.\n\nI think STAID is a good choice because it uses I and D, which are common, and we haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that uses more vowels? We have A already, but we might need to test other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is absent. So we know E is not in the word. Therefore, the remaining vowels are I, O, U.\n\nIn STAID, we are testing I. In PLAIT, we are also testing I. In STAMP, we are testing no vowel (only consonants). So STAID and PLAIT test a vowel (I) which might be important.\n\nBetween STAID and PLAIT, which one? \n- STAID: S, T, A, I, D\n- PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T\n\nBoth have I and T. STAID has S and D, PLAIT has P and L.\n\nS is more common than P? And D vs L? L is more common than D.\n\nBut we are testing positions: \nIn STAID: \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: D\n\nIn PLAIT:\n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: T\n\nWe know the third is A, so we are testing the other four positions.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about which positions might be correct for other letters, so we are just testing presence.\n\nSince we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but E and N are out, and A we know.\n\nSo, from the top: T, O, I, S, H, R, D, L, U. But R is out.\n\nSo, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\nWe have tested S and T in the first guess? No, in the first guess we tested C, R, A, N, E. So S, T, O, I, etc. are untested.\n\nIn STAID, we are testing S, T, I, D.\nIn PLAIT, we are testing P, L, I, T.\n\nT is in both. I is in both.\n\nSo, STAID tests S and D, PLAIT tests P and L.\n\nS is more common than P, and L is more common than D? \n- S is the 8th most common letter, P is 23rd? \n- L is 4th? Actually, let me recall: \nCommon letter frequencies (approximate):\nE, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...\n\nSo, S is 7th, H is 8th, R is 9th, D is 10th, L is 11th, U is 12th. P is around 16th.\n\nSo, S is more common than L? S is 7th, L is 11th? But we are testing two letters: in STAID: S (7th) and D (10th); in PLAIT: L (11th) and P (16th). So STAID tests higher frequency letters.\n\nAlso, we are testing T in both, which is the 2nd most common, but we are testing it in different positions.\n\nBut since we don\'t know the position, testing T is good.\n\nMoreover, we are testing I (vowel) in both.\n\nSo, STAID seems better because it tests S and D, which are more common than P and L? Actually, S is more common than P, but L is more common than D? \n- D is 10th, L is 11th? They are close. But S (7th) is much better than P (16th).\n\nSo, overall, STAID tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word: \n- SHALT? Not common.\n- SWAMI: W is less common.\n\nSo, I think STAID is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: is STAID a valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""staid"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E. STAID has none of these.\n\nSo, the next guess: staid\n\n<guess>staid</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, and E are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).\n\nThe secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _, and it must exclude C, R, N, E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Choose a word with A in the 3rd position and new, common letters to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating absent letters (C, R, N, E) and prioritize high-frequency unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, D, L, O).\n- ""Staid"" fits well: it has A in the 3rd position, uses new common letters (S, T, I, D), and avoids absent letters. It tests S in position 1, T in position 2, I in position 4, and D in position 5.\n\n<guess>staid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nThis means:\n- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.\n- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.\n\nSecond guess: ""staid"" -> S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)\nThis means:\n- S is in the word but not in the 1st position (since in ""staid"", S is first but got \'-\', meaning it\'s misplaced).\n- A is correct in the 3rd position (we already knew this).\n- T, I, D are absent.\n\nSo, summarizing what we know:\n- The word must have A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _\n- Letters that are in the word: S (somewhere except 1st position) and A (in 3rd).\n- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we used letters C,R,A,N,E; from the second, S,T,A,I,D.

We have tested: A,C,D,E,I,N,R,S,T.\n\nSo missing letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we want common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon ones: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, W, etc.\n\nWe also know that S is present, so we must include S in the guess, but not in position 1.\n\nTherefore, our next guess must include S in positions 2,4, or 5, and A in position 3.\n\nWe also avoid: C,R,N,E,T,I,D.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words that fit: _ _ A _ _ , with S in 2,4, or 5, and using new letters.\n\nPossible positions for S:\n- Option1: S in position 2 -> pattern: _ S A _ _\n- Option2: S in position 4 -> pattern: _ _ A S _\n- Option3: S in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ A _ S\n\nWe should consider each case and find words that use common new letters.\n\nBut since we don\'t know which, we can choose a word that includes S and tests new letters.\n\nAlso, we should avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words.\n\nFirst, if S is in position 4: _ _ A S _\n\nWhat could it be? For example:\n- with common letters: BALSA? B-A-L-S-A? But A in third? BALSA has letters B,A,L,S,A. Pattern: B(1) A(2) L(3) S(4) A(5) -> but we need A in 3rd? In BALSA: position 3 is L, not A. So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A, so if the word ends with S, it could be:\n\nFor S in position 4: _ _ A S _\n\nWords like: \n- BASIS: but we have S twice? And I is absent? I is absent (from second guess), so BASIS uses I, which is invalid. Also, S is in pos4 and pos5? But we must avoid I.\n\nBasis: B-A-S-I-S, but third letter is S? Not A.\n\nMust have A in third.\n\nAnother: \n- MASON: M-A-S-O-N, but third letter is S? Not A. And N is absent.\n\nNot working.\n\nWhat about: CLASS? C is absent and pattern: C-L-A-S-S, third is A. But C is absent and also we need to avoid C.\n\nBut CLASS uses C? C in position 1: absent.\n\nAlso, it has two S\'s? But if S is present, we can use it twice? The feedback from ""staid"" only showed one S, but there might be more? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we can\'t use CLASS because C is absent.\n\nSimilarly, GLASS: G-L-A-S-S -> third is A, and avoids absent letters? Absent are C,R,N,E,T,I,D. G,L,S are new. So GLASS: G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So positions: S is in 4 and 5? But we know S is present and not in position 1, so it could be in 4 or 5? But we have two S\'s? That\'s possible.\n\nBut GLASS has two S\'s, which might be inefficient for information, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, other options: BRASS? B-R-A-S-S -> but R is absent, so no.\n\nBut let\'s consider S in other positions.\n\nAlternatively, S in position 2: pattern: _ S A _ _\n\nFor example, words like:\n- PSA: but need 5 letters? Like PSALM? P-S-A-L-M -> yes, P(1), S(2), A(3), L(4), M(5). Avoids absent letters? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, IS: but I is absent.\n\nAnother: USUAL? U-S-U-A-L -> third is U? Not A. And U is repeated.\n\nNot A in third.\n\nWhat about: W: WS: W is not common.\n\nPSALM is a valid word: P-S-A-L-M.\n\nSimilarly, S in position 5: pattern: _ _ A _ S\n\nFor example, words like:\n- MANAS: but M-A-N-A-S, third is N? Not A; and N absent.\n- GALAS: G-A-L-A-S, third letter L? Not A.\n- PAPAS: P-A-P-A-S, third P? Not A.\n\nWe need the third letter A.\n\nAnother: LO: but? e.g., D: LAMAS? L-A-M-A-S, but third is M? No.\n\nWhat about BASAL? B-A-S-A-L, third letter S? Not A; and last L.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nSo for S in position 5: the fourth letter can be anything, but we need the word to have A in third and S in fifth.\n\nFor example, CHAOS: C-H-A-O-S -> C absent? C is absent. And third is A, fifth is S. But C is absent, so invalid. Also, O is new.\n\nCHAOS uses C? C in position 1: absent, so invalid.\n\nAnother: F: FA? FLABS? F-L-A-B-S, third A, fifth S? Yes: F(1), L(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). F, L, B, S are new? Yes, and avoids absent letters.\n\nFLABS is a word? Flab is fat, flabs might be acceptable or plural? But let\'s check if valid.\n\nSimilarly, BLABS: B-L-A-B-S -> third A, fifth S.\n\nBut BLABS uses B twice? Not efficient.\n\nGOALS? G-O-A-L-S -> fifth is S? Yes: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). Third is A, position 5 is S. Avoids absent letters? G,O,L,S all new and not absent.\n\nSimilarly, COALS? But C absent.\n\nGOALS: G-O-A-L-S.\n\nWe could also use something like SH: SH? SHWA: doesn\'t work.\n\nSo, possible words:\n- PSALM (P-S-A-L-M): S in position 2.\n- GLASS (G-L-A-S-S): S in position 4 and 5? But we need to include S, and in this case it\'s in both positions? But we know S is present so having it twice is okay but might give redundant info.\n- FLABS (F-L-A-B-S): S in position 5.\n- GOALS (G-O-A-L-S): S in position 5.\n\nAmong these, GOALS seems common and straightforward.\n\nPSALM might be less common.\n\nNow, we also have the constraint that in our guess, we must not use S in position 1, which we are avoiding.\n\nAdditionally, since S is present and not in 1, we want to test a position for S. But in the words above, for PSALM, S is in position 2; in GOALS, S is in position 5; in GLASS, S in 4 and 5.\n\nBut GLASS has duplicate S, which might not be ideal because if both are incorrect positions, we don\'t learn which one is correct; but actually, the feedback will show if there are multiple S\'s.\n\nHowever, to maximize distinct letters, we should avoid duplicates.\n\nSo, GOALS: G,O,A,L,S -> letters: G,O,L,S (and A) all distinct? G,O,A,L,S — A is already known, but we are testing new letters G,O,L.\n\nSimilarly, PSALM: P,S,A,L,M — distinct S,P,L,M.\n\nBut S is already known. So for information, we want to test new possible letters.\n\nNow, GOALS has O and L, which are common, and G is less common.\n\nPSALM has L, M, P? P is less common? O is a vowel and very common, more than P.\n\nLetter frequencies: O is more common than P, L.\n\nSo GOALS might be better? But let\'s compare:\n\nGOALS: G(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> we get feedback on G, O, L in positions 1,2,4.\n\nPSALM: P(1), S(2), A(3), L(4), M(5) -> feedback on P in 1, S in 2 (we know S is present but misplaced, so position 2 might be correct or not), L in 4, M in 5.\n\nIn PSALM, S is in position 2, which we think might be possible.\n\nBut note: in GOALS, S is in position 5, which is also possible.\n\nAnother option: what we didn\'t consider S in position 4? Earlier we had GLASS but duplicates.\n\nIs there a word with S in position 4, without duplicates? Pattern: _ _ A S _, and no absent letters, with distinct letters.\n\nFor example: \n- PANS: too short? Wait, 5 letters: like TRAMS? T is absent. \n- BE: BEAUS? Not common.\n- ME: MEALS? M-E-A-L-S, but E is absent? E is absent (from first guess), so MEALS is invalid because E.\n\nSimilarly, LEADS? E and D absent.\n\nSo hard: because if S in position 4, the word must have two letters before A and one after, all avoiding absent letters.\n\nAnother: QUASH? Q-U-A-S-H -> third A? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes. And Q and U are new, H new. But Q is less common.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, SWASH? S in position 1? But we can\'t have S in pos1? In SWASH: S(1) W(2) A(3) S(4) H(5) -> S in position 1, which we know is not allowed? Because from feedback, S cannot be in position 1 (it was misplaced). Also, S in position 1 would be invalid because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo SWASH is not allowed.\n\nBack to the choices: PSALM, GOALS, FLABS.\n\nFLABS: F(1) L(2) A(3) B(4) S(5) -> letters: F,L,B,S. Distinct? Yes. B and F are new.\n\nBut GOALS: G,O,L,S — O is a vowel, which we haven\'t tested much (only A and E are vowels, E is out, we have A, so other vowels could be useful).\n\nPSALM: P,S,L,M — consonants.\n\nSince we know S is present, by putting S in different positions we can pin down its location.\n\nFor example, in GOALS, S is in position 5; if S is not in position 5, we get feedback for S: if it moves to another position? No, the feedback will tell us for each letter.\n\nBut if in GOALS, we put S in position 5 and get S(✓), then we know S is in correct position 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we get S(-x), then S is not in 5, so it must be in 2 or 4? From previous, we only have three positions left: 2,4,5 (but 1 is out).\n\nWe can choose to test a position that is likely.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so either is fine.\n\nI think GOALS is a reasonable choice because:\n- It includes O, a common vowel.\n- All distinct letters: G,O,A,L,S → A is known, but testing G,O,L in new positions.\n- Avoids absent letters.\n\nPSALM is also good, but P and M are less common than O and G? O is more common than P.\n\nSo, I will go with ""goals"".\n\nThus, next guess: goals\n\n<guess>goals</guess>Based of previous feedback:\n\n- From ""crane"": A is in the correct position (3rd), and C, R, N, E are absent.\n- From ""staid"": A is confirmed correct in the 3rd position, S is present but misplaced (not in position 1), and T, I, D are absent.\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word pattern must be: _ _ A _ _\n- S is present but cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D.\n- Remaining letters should prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., G, O, L, B, F, M, P).\n\nFor this guess, I chose ""goals"" because:\n- It places A in the required 3rd position.\n- It includes S in position 5, testing a possible location for S.\n- It tests new common letters: G, O, L (untested vowels/consonants).\n- Avoids all absent letters (C,R,N,E,T,I,D).\n- Uses distinct letters to maximize information potential.\n\n<guess>goals</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: goals -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(x) A(✓) L(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- A is correct and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- C, R, N, E are absent.

Second guess: ""staid"" -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
- A is correct in the 3rd position (already known).
- S is present but not in the 1st position (since it was misplaced in position 1 of ""staid"").
- T, I, D are absent.

Third guess: ""goals"" -> Feedback: G(x) O(x) A(✓) L(x) S(-)
- A is correct in the 3rd position (known).
- G, O, L are absent.
- S is present but not in the 5th position (since it was misplaced in position 5 of ""goals""? Let's see: ""goals"" is G-O-A-L-S, so position 5 is S).

Recap of what we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D, G, O, L (all marked x in guesses).
- Present letters: 
  - A: correct in position 3.
  - S: present but not in position 1 (from ""staid"") and not in position 5 (from ""goals""). So S must be in either position 2 or position 4? Because positions 1 and 5 are ruled out.

In the word pattern (positions 1,2,3,4,5), we have:
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- S cannot be in position 1 (from ""staid"") and cannot be in position 5 (from ""goals""). Therefore, S must be in position 2 or position 4.

Now, what letters are left? We have tested: A, C, D, E, G, I, L, N, O, R, S, T. So missing letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we must include S in the guess (since it's present) and place it in position 2 or 4 (since positions 1 and 5 are invalid for S).

We also need to choose the remaining letters from the untested set.

Since we are on the fourth guess and have limited tries, we should aim to pinpoint the position of S and test common remaining letters.

Options for S placement:
1. S in position 2: pattern: _ S A _ _
2. S in position 4: pattern: _ _ A S _

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

Also, avoid absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D, G, O, L.

Consider possible words:

First, if S in position 2: _ S A _ _

With the remaining positions 1, 4, 5 to fill with new letters.

For example:
- Position 1: some letter like B, F, H, K, M, P, etc.
- Position 4 and 5: two other new letters.

Words like: 
- PSA : but need 5 letters. Like PSA? Not 5 letter. 
- Actual words: SMALL? But L is absent? L is absent (from ""goals""), so no. 
- SHARD? But H, A, R, D? R and D absent? R from first guess absent, D from second absent. 
- So many absent letters.

Need to use only available letters.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid rare letters.

Common ones: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, W.

Now, what words fit _ S A _ _ ?

For example:
- USA: but need 5 letters. Like USAGE? But G and E absent? E absent, G absent. 
- USUAL? U-S-U-A-L -> pattern: U(1), S(2), U?(3) but we need A in third? We have A fixed in third. So it would have to be ... after S is A? For example: U(1) S(2) A(3) but then two letters: what word? USA could be U-S-A-? like USAGE but invalid letters.

A word: U S A B ?  Not common.

Another: B S A K E -> but absent letters E? And K possible? But after S A, then K? BASE? E absent.

Hard.

Perhaps: P S A M Y -> PSAMY? Not a word.

Or M S A M Y? Not valid.

Another: J: but less common.

Perhaps H S A P E? Not E.

Not easy.

Then consider S in position 4: pattern: _ _ A S _

Now, positions 1, 2, 5 to fill.

For example:
- Position 1 and 2: new letters, position 5: new letter.

Words like: 
- BAAS? But we need the fourth to be S? And third A. Like - - A S -.

For example: JUMP: not fitting.

What words: 
- ABASE? But A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5) -> but E absent? E is absent, and also we have A in first? But A might be duplicate? We know A is in third, but it could be elsewhere? However, the feedback hasn't shown extra A yet. But possible.

In ABASE:
- Position 3 is A (correct).
- First letter A is a duplication? But we don't know if A can be elsewhere. However, if we use ABASE, it has E (absent) and also B and S? Let's see: absent letters include E? Yes, E absent. Also, the word has A in position 1 and 3? If we guess ABASE, we test A in position 1? But we know A is only guaranteed in position 3.

Since E is absent, ABASE is invalid.

Similarly, other words:

- CRASS? C and R absent.
- GRASS? G absent? G marked absent in third guess.
- BRASS? B-R-A-S-S -> R absent? R absent.

But we have no R.

What about: KH: KHAKI? K-H-A-K-I -> I absent? I absent.

Not.

PU: PUMAS? P-U-M-A-S -> positions: P(1), U(2), M(3)? But we need A in third? Here M is third? So no, if we have PUMAS, it's P(1)U(2)M(3)A(4)S(5), but we need A in third? So the word must have third letter A.

Must be pattern? For S in position 4: - - A S -, so for example:
- B _ A S ? : like BIAS? But I absent? I absent.

Or BLAS? Not 5 letters.

Another: BE AM? Not.

Perhaps: SHAME? S-H-A-M-E, but S and E: S is in position 1? Not 4; and E absent.

Not.

WA: WAIST? W-A-I-S-T -> positions: W(1), A(2), I(3)? But I(3) then S(4)? So the third letter is I, not A? But we need A in third? In WAIST, position 3 is I? Not A? So if we want A in third and S in fourth, it would be like ??A S?.

For example: BASTA? B-A-S-T-A -> B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). But the third letter is S, not A? So not, we need position 3 A.

Must be: position 3 A, position 4 S.

So words: 
- MA: what? like PI: PIAN? Not.
- Perhaps CHASM: C-H-A-S-M -> C absent? C absent.
- SHAS: not 5 letter.

Another: CH: CHAS? Not enough.

But we have CHASM? C absent? C absent.

So hard.

Perhaps FRAS? No.

Another idea: QUASH? Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! Pattern matches: third A, fourth S.

And letters: Q,U,A,S,H.? Avoids absent letters? Q, U, H are untested; A and S known.

But Q is less common? But it's a valid English word.

Other options?
- WU: WUS: not common.

Or PU: PUPAS? P-U-P-A-S -> positions: P1, U2, P3, A? Third is P, not A? No.

So QUASH is one possibility.

For S in position 2? We had trouble finding common words.

Another word for S in position 2: such as PSALM? But we tried it? In previous guess we didn't use PSALM.

PSALM: P-S-A-L-M -> pattern is position 3 A, position 2 S? Position 1 P, position 2 S? But in ""goals"" feedback, L is absent? Yes, L is absent, so PSALM has L? L is absent, so invalid? L marked absent in third guess.

Similarly, other letters.

So perhaps S in position 4 with QUASH.

But let's list all possible known information:

- We must use S in position 2 or 4.
- From ""goals"", U? We didn't have U.

But QUASH: letters Q,U,A,S,H.

Absent letters listed: C,R,N,E,T,I,D,G,O,L are absent? So Q,U,H not absent? Correct.

But QUASH might be acceptable, though Q is rare.

Another possibility for S in position 4: HUMAS? Not valid.

Or FUMES? E absent.

Perhaps BASED? But S is in position 2? Not 4, and E,D absent? BASED: position? B-A-S-E-D, third S? Not A? Not matching pattern.

We need the third letter A.

So pattern: for S in position 4: letter1-letter2-A-S-letter5.

Some valid English words? 
- ABASK? Not common.
- TR ASS? T absent? T absent.

Another: P K: PKAAS not valid.

So,QUASH seems a valid option.

Perhaps SHWA? No.

Or U: UNAI: U-N-A-I-S? Not enough letters.

UN: UNAUS? Not valid.

So let's accept QUASH for now.

But there might be better.

S in position 2: we can try words like B S A M P -> not a word.

Or M S A M E? Absent E.

HS: H S A P E? E absent.

Not.

Or W S A N F? Not a word.

But w/ S in position 2: perhaps with common letters B, M, P, etc.

For example: 
- BS: BSM: not.
- MS: MSAL: not.

Perhaps with vowel? Like AS: but we have AS in position 1-2? But S in 2.

Words like: PI: but.

Another: H S A L O? S in 2, A in 3, but L and O absent? L and O absent.

Not.

So, I think QUASH is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: S in position 4, and we can use other common letters.

For example: PU A S H? P-U-A-S-H -> positions: P1, U2, A3, S4, H5. Yes! PUASH? Is that a word? No, not English. But PUASI? No.

What about PLASH? P-L-A-S-H, but L is absent? L absent.

Not.

SH: SH A ? Like SHARP? S-H-A-R-P -> H(1), A(2)? But not position 3? Here position 3 is A? But need A in third: if SHARP: S(1) H(2) A(3) R(4) P(5). Yes! Pattern: _ _ A _ _ with S in position 1? But position 1 is S? We know S cannot be in position 1? From ""staid"", S was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in position 1.

Therefore, SHARP is invalid because it puts S in position 1? SHARP would be S in pos1? Yes, but we know S is not in pos1? So the word is invalid for guessing because it places S in a known incorrect position.

The feedback rules: we can guess words that violate previous feedback, but it's inefficient? Actually, you can guess any valid word, but logically, since we know S is not in pos1, we avoid putting S there.

Similarly, not in pos5.

Therefore, for SHARP, if we guessed it, S in pos1 would get x or -? If S is not in pos1, and not present elsewhere? But we know S is present, pos1 no, so other positions.

SHARP: S in pos1, which we know is wrong, so we should not use it.

So words like that are not good.

Another word with A in third and S in fourth: QUASH is valid.

Also, another: UK: UKASE? U-K-A-S-E -> positions: U1, K2, A3, S4, E5. But E is absent? E absent, so invalid.

Similarly, UNA: UNAUS? Not valid.

So QUASH is a valid word: Q1, U2, A3, S4, H5.

And Q, U, H are untested.

So I think we have to use it.

But let's confirm if there are other common words.

Perhaps with S in position 2: we have PSHA?: not.

Or BS: AB: but hard.

Words like: W S A M Y? Not common.

Or CS: no.

Another: M S A J E? Not valid and E absent.

So, I think QUASH is the best we can do.

Then guess ""quash"".

But let's see if we can get more information first.

Another idea: since S must be in position 2 or 4, we can choose a word that has S in one of them and tests the other positions.

For example, if we put S in position 2, we can eliminate some possibilities.

Similarly, position 4.

But with QUASH, we put S in position 4.

If we get feedback for S: if it's ✓, then S is in correct position 4.
If S(-), then it must be in position 2? But if S is in position 2, we get it as S(-) or ✓ if we test a word with S in position 2? But we are not now.

So with QUASH, if S is not in position4, we will get S(-) or something? But in QUASH, S is in position4. If the actual word has S in position2, then when we put S in position4, it might be marked as: if S is present only once, then since it's not in position4, and also not in the correct position2? But position2 is different, so S might be marked as '-' if it's in the other position? Or 'x' if not present? But we know S is present, so if not in position4, it must be that S is in position2? So the feedback will have S(-) meaning it's in the word but not in position4? So then we learn that S is in position2.

So QUASH can help differentiate.

Similarly, if we get S(✓), then position4 is correct.

Therefore, QUASH is informative.

So I'll go with ""quash"".

</think>
### Thought Process:

#### Step 1: Analyze Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
  - Secret word has ""A"" in the 3rd position (_ _ A _ _).  
  - Letters C, R, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: staid → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)**  
  - ""S"" is present but not in position 1.  
  - Letters T, I, D are absent.  
  - Position 3 is ""A"" (confirmed).  
- **Guess 3: goals → G(x) O(x) A(✓) L(x) S(-)**  
  - ""S"" is present but not in position 5.  
  - Letters G, O, L are absent.  
  - Position 3 is ""A"" (reconfirmed).  

#### Step 2: Deduce Constraints
- **Secret word pattern:** _ _ A _ _ (A fixed in position 3).  
- **Confirmed absent letters:** C, R, N, E, T, I, D, G, O, L (10 letters).  
- **Present letters (besides A):**  
  - ""S"" must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 and 5 are ruled out).  
- **Untested letters:** B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  - Prioritize common letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, U.  
- **Guess requirements:**  
  - Must include ""S"" in position 2 or 4.  
  - Avoid all absent letters.  
  - Use untested letters to maximize new information.  

#### Step 3: Brainstorm Possible Words
- **Pattern: S in position 2 (_ S A _ _)**  
  - Few valid words found:  
    - ""Q S A _ _"": Rare or invalid (e.g., ""QSAMY"" not in dictionary).  
    - Other options like ""BSAML"" or ""MSABK"" are invalid or uncommon.  
- **Pattern: S in position 4 (_ _ A S _)**  
  - Valid words:  
    - **QUASH**: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) → Tests common untested letters (Q, U, H) and places S in position 4.  
    - Alternatives like ""UKASE"" or ""CHASM"" were considered, but ""UKASE"" uses E (absent) and ""CHASM"" uses C (absent).  
- ""QUASH"" is valid:  
  - Confirms/resolves S's position (if S(✓), position 4 is correct; if S(-), S must be in position 2).  
  - Tests Q, U, H (untested).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  

#### Step 4: Final Decision
- ""QUASH"" is selected as it:  
  - Adheres to the secret word pattern (_ _ A _ _).  
  - Tests S in position 4 to pinpoint its location.  
  - Uses untested common letters where possible (U and H are moderately common; Q is rarer but unavoidable here).  
  - Provides high information gain regardless of feedback.  

<guess>quash</guess>",quash,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- A is correct and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- C, R, N, E are absent.

Second guess: ""staid"" -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
- A is correct in the 3rd position (already known).
- S is present but not in the 1st position (since it was misplaced in position 1 of ""staid"").
- T, I, D are absent.

Third guess: ""goals"" -> Feedback: G(x) O(x) A(✓) L(x) S(-)
- A is correct in the 3rd position (known).
- G, O, L are absent.
- S is present but not in the 5th position (since it was misplaced in position 5 of ""goals""? Let's see: ""goals"" is G-O-A-L-S, so position 5 is S).

Recap of what we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D, G, O, L (all marked x in guesses).
- Present letters: 
  - A: correct in position 3.
  - S: present but not in position 1 (from ""staid"") and not in position 5 (from ""goals""). So S must be in either position 2 or position 4? Because positions 1 and 5 are ruled out.

In the word pattern (positions 1,2,3,4,5), we have:
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- S cannot be in position 1 (from ""staid"") and cannot be in position 5 (from ""goals""). Therefore, S must be in position 2 or position 4.

Now, what letters are left? We have tested: A, C, D, E, G, I, L, N, O, R, S, T. So missing letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we must include S in the guess (since it's present) and place it in position 2 or 4 (since positions 1 and 5 are invalid for S).

We also need to choose the remaining letters from the untested set.

Since we are on the fourth guess and have limited tries, we should aim to pinpoint the position of S and test common remaining letters.

Options for S placement:
1. S in position 2: pattern: _ S A _ _
2. S in position 4: pattern: _ _ A S _

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

Also, avoid absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, D, G, O, L.

Consider possible words:

First, if S in position 2: _ S A _ _

With the remaining positions 1, 4, 5 to fill with new letters.

For example:
- Position 1: some letter like B, F, H, K, M, P, etc.
- Position 4 and 5: two other new letters.

Words like: 
- PSA : but need 5 letters. Like PSA? Not 5 letter. 
- Actual words: SMALL? But L is absent? L is absent (from ""goals""), so no. 
- SHARD? But H, A, R, D? R and D absent? R from first guess absent, D from second absent. 
- So many absent letters.

Need to use only available letters.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid rare letters.

Common ones: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, W.

Now, what words fit _ S A _ _ ?

For example:
- USA: but need 5 letters. Like USAGE? But G and E absent? E absent, G absent. 
- USUAL? U-S-U-A-L -> pattern: U(1), S(2), U?(3) but we need A in third? We have A fixed in third. So it would have to be ... after S is A? For example: U(1) S(2) A(3) but then two letters: what word? USA could be U-S-A-? like USAGE but invalid letters.

A word: U S A B ?  Not common.

Another: B S A K E -> but absent letters E? And K possible? But after S A, then K? BASE? E absent.

Hard.

Perhaps: P S A M Y -> PSAMY? Not a word.

Or M S A M Y? Not valid.

Another: J: but less common.

Perhaps H S A P E? Not E.

Not easy.

Then consider S in position 4: pattern: _ _ A S _

Now, positions 1, 2, 5 to fill.

For example:
- Position 1 and 2: new letters, position 5: new letter.

Words like: 
- BAAS? But we need the fourth to be S? And third A. Like - - A S -.

For example: JUMP: not fitting.

What words: 
- ABASE? But A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5) -> but E absent? E is absent, and also we have A in first? But A might be duplicate? We know A is in third, but it could be elsewhere? However, the feedback hasn't shown extra A yet. But possible.

In ABASE:
- Position 3 is A (correct).
- First letter A is a duplication? But we don't know if A can be elsewhere. However, if we use ABASE, it has E (absent) and also B and S? Let's see: absent letters include E? Yes, E absent. Also, the word has A in position 1 and 3? If we guess ABASE, we test A in position 1? But we know A is only guaranteed in position 3.

Since E is absent, ABASE is invalid.

Similarly, other words:

- CRASS? C and R absent.
- GRASS? G absent? G marked absent in third guess.
- BRASS? B-R-A-S-S -> R absent? R absent.

But we have no R.

What about: KH: KHAKI? K-H-A-K-I -> I absent? I absent.

Not.

PU: PUMAS? P-U-M-A-S -> positions: P(1), U(2), M(3)? But we need A in third? Here M is third? So no, if we have PUMAS, it's P(1)U(2)M(3)A(4)S(5), but we need A in third? So the word must have third letter A.

Must be pattern? For S in position 4: - - A S -, so for example:
- B _ A S ? : like BIAS? But I absent? I absent.

Or BLAS? Not 5 letters.

Another: BE AM? Not.

Perhaps: SHAME? S-H-A-M-E, but S and E: S is in position 1? Not 4; and E absent.

Not.

WA: WAIST? W-A-I-S-T -> positions: W(1), A(2), I(3)? But I(3) then S(4)? So the third letter is I, not A? But we need A in third? In WAIST, position 3 is I? Not A? So if we want A in third and S in fourth, it would be like ??A S?.

For example: BASTA? B-A-S-T-A -> B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). But the third letter is S, not A? So not, we need position 3 A.

Must be: position 3 A, position 4 S.

So words: 
- MA: what? like PI: PIAN? Not.
- Perhaps CHASM: C-H-A-S-M -> C absent? C absent.
- SHAS: not 5 letter.

Another: CH: CHAS? Not enough.

But we have CHASM? C absent? C absent.

So hard.

Perhaps FRAS? No.

Another idea: QUASH? Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! Pattern matches: third A, fourth S.

And letters: Q,U,A,S,H.? Avoids absent letters? Q, U, H are untested; A and S known.

But Q is less common? But it's a valid English word.

Other options?
- WU: WUS: not common.

Or PU: PUPAS? P-U-P-A-S -> positions: P1, U2, P3, A? Third is P, not A? No.

So QUASH is one possibility.

For S in position 2? We had trouble finding common words.

Another word for S in position 2: such as PSALM? But we tried it? In previous guess we didn't use PSALM.

PSALM: P-S-A-L-M -> pattern is position 3 A, position 2 S? Position 1 P, position 2 S? But in ""goals"" feedback, L is absent? Yes, L is absent, so PSALM has L? L is absent, so invalid? L marked absent in third guess.

Similarly, other letters.

So perhaps S in position 4 with QUASH.

But let's list all possible known information:

- We must use S in position 2 or 4.
- From ""goals"", U? We didn't have U.

But QUASH: letters Q,U,A,S,H.

Absent letters listed: C,R,N,E,T,I,D,G,O,L are absent? So Q,U,H not absent? Correct.

But QUASH might be acceptable, though Q is rare.

Another possibility for S in position 4: HUMAS? Not valid.

Or FUMES? E absent.

Perhaps BASED? But S is in position 2? Not 4, and E,D absent? BASED: position? B-A-S-E-D, third S? Not A? Not matching pattern.

We need the third letter A.

So pattern: for S in position 4: letter1-letter2-A-S-letter5.

Some valid English words? 
- ABASK? Not common.
- TR ASS? T absent? T absent.

Another: P K: PKAAS not valid.

So,QUASH seems a valid option.

Perhaps SHWA? No.

Or U: UNAI: U-N-A-I-S? Not enough letters.

UN: UNAUS? Not valid.

So let's accept QUASH for now.

But there might be better.

S in position 2: we can try words like B S A M P -> not a word.

Or M S A M E? Absent E.

HS: H S A P E? E absent.

Not.

Or W S A N F? Not a word.

But w/ S in position 2: perhaps with common letters B, M, P, etc.

For example: 
- BS: BSM: not.
- MS: MSAL: not.

Perhaps with vowel? Like AS: but we have AS in position 1-2? But S in 2.

Words like: PI: but.

Another: H S A L O? S in 2, A in 3, but L and O absent? L and O absent.

Not.

So, I think QUASH is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: S in position 4, and we can use other common letters.

For example: PU A S H? P-U-A-S-H -> positions: P1, U2, A3, S4, H5. Yes! PUASH? Is that a word? No, not English. But PUASI? No.

What about PLASH? P-L-A-S-H, but L is absent? L absent.

Not.

SH: SH A ? Like SHARP? S-H-A-R-P -> H(1), A(2)? But not position 3? Here position 3 is A? But need A in third: if SHARP: S(1) H(2) A(3) R(4) P(5). Yes! Pattern: _ _ A _ _ with S in position 1? But position 1 is S? We know S cannot be in position 1? From ""staid"", S was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in position 1.

Therefore, SHARP is invalid because it puts S in position 1? SHARP would be S in pos1? Yes, but we know S is not in pos1? So the word is invalid for guessing because it places S in a known incorrect position.

The feedback rules: we can guess words that violate previous feedback, but it's inefficient? Actually, you can guess any valid word, but logically, since we know S is not in pos1, we avoid putting S there.

Similarly, not in pos5.

Therefore, for SHARP, if we guessed it, S in pos1 would get x or -? If S is not in pos1, and not present elsewhere? But we know S is present, pos1 no, so other positions.

SHARP: S in pos1, which we know is wrong, so we should not use it.

So words like that are not good.

Another word with A in third and S in fourth: QUASH is valid.

Also, another: UK: UKASE? U-K-A-S-E -> positions: U1, K2, A3, S4, E5. But E is absent? E absent, so invalid.

Similarly, UNA: UNAUS? Not valid.

So QUASH is a valid word: Q1, U2, A3, S4, H5.

And Q, U, H are untested.

So I think we have to use it.

But let's confirm if there are other common words.

Perhaps with S in position 2: we have PSHA?: not.

Or BS: AB: but hard.

Words like: W S A M Y? Not common.

Or CS: no.

Another: M S A J E? Not valid and E absent.

So, I think QUASH is the best we can do.

Then guess ""quash"".

But let's see if we can get more information first.

Another idea: since S must be in position 2 or 4, we can choose a word that has S in one of them and tests the other positions.

For example, if we put S in position 2, we can eliminate some possibilities.

Similarly, position 4.

But with QUASH, we put S in position 4.

If we get feedback for S: if it's ✓, then S is in correct position 4.
If S(-), then it must be in position 2? But if S is in position 2, we get it as S(-) or ✓ if we test a word with S in position 2? But we are not now.

So with QUASH, if S is not in position4, we will get S(-) or something? But in QUASH, S is in position4. If the actual word has S in position2, then when we put S in position4, it might be marked as: if S is present only once, then since it's not in position4, and also not in the correct position2? But position2 is different, so S might be marked as '-' if it's in the other position? Or 'x' if not present? But we know S is present, so if not in position4, it must be that S is in position2? So the feedback will have S(-) meaning it's in the word but not in position4? So then we learn that S is in position2.

So QUASH can help differentiate.

Similarly, if we get S(✓), then position4 is correct.

Therefore, QUASH is informative.

So I'll go with ""quash"".

<guess>quash</guess>### Thought Process:

#### Step 1: Analyze Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
  - Secret word has ""A"" in the 3rd position (_ _ A _ _).  
  - Letters C, R, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: staid → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)**  
  - ""S"" is present but not in position 1.  
  - Letters T, I, D are absent.  
  - Position 3 is ""A"" (confirmed).  
- **Guess 3: goals → G(x) O(x) A(✓) L(x) S(-)**  
  - ""S"" is present but not in position 5.  
  - Letters G, O, L are absent.  
  - Position 3 is ""A"" (reconfirmed).  

#### Step 2: Deduce Constraints
- **Secret word pattern:** _ _ A _ _ (A fixed in position 3).  
- **Confirmed absent letters:** C, R, N, E, T, I, D, G, O, L (10 letters).  
- **Present letters (besides A):**  
  - ""S"" must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 and 5 are ruled out).  
- **Untested letters:** B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  - Prioritize common letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, U.  
- **Guess requirements:**  
  - Must include ""S"" in position 2 or 4.  
  - Avoid all absent letters.  
  - Use untested letters to maximize new information.  

#### Step 3: Brainstorm Possible Words
- **Pattern: S in position 2 (_ S A _ _)**  
  - Few valid words found:  
    - ""Q S A _ _"": Rare or invalid (e.g., ""QSAMY"" not in dictionary).  
    - Other options like ""BSAML"" or ""MSABK"" are invalid or uncommon.  
- **Pattern: S in position 4 (_ _ A S _)**  
  - Valid words:  
    - **QUASH**: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) → Tests common untested letters (Q, U, H) and places S in position 4.  
    - Alternatives like ""UKASE"" or ""CHASM"" were considered, but ""UKASE"" uses E (absent) and ""CHASM"" uses C (absent).  
- ""QUASH"" is valid:  
  - Confirms/resolves S's position (if S(✓), position 4 is correct; if S(-), S must be in position 2).  
  - Tests Q, U, H (untested).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  

#### Step 4: Final Decision
- ""QUASH"" is selected as it:  
  - Adheres to the secret word pattern (_ _ A _ _).  
  - Tests S in position 4 to pinpoint its location.  
  - Uses untested common letters where possible (U and H are moderately common; Q is rarer but unavoidable here).  
  - Provides high information gain regardless of feedback.",Guess 4: quash -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
