Alright, let's start playing this word game. The goal is to guess a 5-letter word in six tries based on feedback. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior clues to work with, so I need to choose a word that covers common letters and provides maximum information.

Thinking about effective starting words in word games: ARISE is often recommended because it contains common vowels and consonants. Specifically:

- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, I, S) which balance letter types.
- Shares R and S with the example (Brisk).
- Is short, memorable, and respects constraints.

This choice could reveal frequent letters and their positions efficiently. While other words like SLATE or CRANE are valid, ARISE feels like a balanced starting point for uncovering hints.

So, my first guess will be ""ARISE"".
</think>
I need to make my first guess without any prior feedback. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information about the secret word. I recall that in word games, a strong first guess typically includes varied, common letters to reveal their presence (or absence) and positions efficiently.  

I should prioritize:
- Including vowels (like A, E, I) since they appear in most words.
- Using frequently used consonants (like R, S, T).
- Avoiding repeating letters to cover more ground.

Words like ARISE or ROAST fit this strategy well. Between them:
- ARISE has A, E (two vowels) and R, I, S (common consonants), covering five distinct letters with good frequency.
- Compared to SALET or CRANE, ARISE uses similarly high-value letters.

By choosing ARISE, I cover two vowels and three consonants, increasing the chance of revealing correct positions or existences quickly. This sets me up well for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Okay, let's analyze the feedback from my first guess. I guessed ""ARISE"", and the feedback was A(x), R(-), I(-), S(x), E(-). 

Hmm, this tells me several important things. First, A and S are definitely not in the word at all - that's what the ""x"" means. So I can eliminate those letters completely. 

On the brighter side, R, I, and E are all present in the secret word, just not in the positions I guessed them in. R was in first position? Not correct, but it's somewhere else. Similarly, I was in third position but wrong, E was in fifth but wrong position. 

So the secret word contains R, I, and E, but not A or S. Now since I know these three letters are in the word, my next guess should include all of them while avoiding A and S completely. 

I also need to consider possible positions. Since R isn't first, I should try it in other positions. Same with I and E. Thinking of common English words with R, I, E... words like ""CRIME"" or ""PRIDE"" come to mind. 

""PRIDE"" might be good - contains P,R,I,D,E. That covers my known letters R, I, E and introduces two new consonants P and D. P is fourth position, D fifth - neither was tested before so this could give new information. 

Alternatively ""BRINE"" - but that has B and N instead. But since S is out, BRINE avoids S which is good. However PRIDE seems equally valid. Let me decide... PRIDE places R in second position (unlike first in ARISE), I in third (same as before but wrong position last time so maybe try different?), E in fifth (same position feedback was wrong). 

But since we don't know correct positions yet, changing positions makes sense. PRIDE: R in position 2, I in 3, E in 5. Different from ARISE where they were in 2,3,5 respectively. 

Yes, PRIDE seems like a solid second guess that incorporates all present letters while testing new positions and introducing two new letters (P and D). 

If it doesn't hit, the feedback will give even more information about positioning of R,I,E and presence of P and D.
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""ARISE"" → A❌, R➖, I➖, S❌, E➖):  

- **A** and **S** are ABSENT from the secret word → Eliminate them.  
- **R**, **I**, and **E** are PRESENT but in the WRONG positions → Must include them in the next guess, but placed differently.  
- R cannot be position 2, I cannot be position 3, E cannot be position 5.  

### Strategy for Guess 2:  
1. Use **R**, **I**, and **E** in new positions.  
2. Avoid **A** and **S**.  
3. Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, N, D, L) for efficiency.  

Optimal second guess: **PRIDE**  
- **P** (new letter, position 1)  
- **R** (position 2 → *was position 2 in ""ARISE"" but incorrectly placed; so try shifting*)  
- **I** (position 3 → *was position 3 originally; move it elsewhere*)  
- **D** (new letter, position 4)  
- **E** (position 5 → *was position 5 originally; now testing position 5 again despite wrong position earlier*)  

*Why ""PRIDE""?*  
- Tests **R** in a new position (2 → previously tested in 2, but feedback showed wrong position → **must move R**).  
  - Correction: R was in position 2 in ARISE and marked ➖, so in ""PRIDE"", testing the same position isn't ideal. Alternative placements:  
    - R in position 1 (like ""RAINY"" → but A is eliminated).  
    - R in position 4 (like ""OXIDE"" → lacks tested consonants).  
  - Keeping R in position 2 simplifies if we suspect position was wrong but R itself exists. Alternate options: **TRIBE** (R position 2, same placement as before). However:  
    - **PRIDE** uses P/D (untested consonants), positions I in 3 again (avoidable), and E in 5 (avoidable). Better alternative: **RICEY** → invalid word. Instead:  
- **TRIBE** → T(position1), R(position2), I(position3), B(position4), E(position5). Avoids A/S, tests R/I/E in “new” positions? R and I are same positions as ARISE (2 and 3), which were WRONG. So TRIBE repeats positions 2 and 3 → not ideal.  

Revised choice: **BRIDE**  
- **B** (new, position1)  
- **R** (position2 → *same as ARISE*)  
  - But feedback said R was wrong in position2 → avoid position2!  
  - Better: Put R in position1 → but common words?  
    - ""RIPER"" → repeats R and avoids positions? E exists → ""RIPER"" invalid?  

Alternate: **OXIDE**  
- O(position1), X(position2), I(position3), D(position4), E(position5)  
- But ""X"" is rare → inefficient.  

Best fit: **CRIER**  
- But repeats? And E at end → ""CRIER"" 5 letters? → valid: C R I E R → repeats R → bad?  

Optimal word accounting feedback: **PROVE**  
- P(position1), R(position2→ same position?), O(position3), V(position4), E(position5→ same?)  

Tradeoff: **PRIDE** still acceptable:  
- Re-tests R in position2, I position3, E position5 → if R/I/E were misplaced by 1 spot→might fix. But positions same? Original feedback:  
  - ARISE had R/I/E in positions 2,3,5 → ALL wrong→ meaning all positions incorrect→ thus likely R not2, I not3, E not5. Thus PRIDE tests same positions → yields info:  
If R gets ➖ again→ position2 wrong again→ possibly position1/3→ useful still.  

Final decision:  
Ideal word: **PRIDE**  
- Avoids A/S  
- Includes R/I/E  
- Tests new letters P/D (high-frequency)  
- Positions: R(position2→ same as before? Feedback R➖ was position2→ so retesting position2→ yields info: if ➖ again→ R not2, if ✓→ position2 correct→ contradiction?  
Feedback symbol change explained:  
If R is in word but wrong position→ try same position again: if still ➖→ still wrong position→ possible adjacent shift→ valuable info. So it's valid.  

New candidate: **TRIED**  
- T(position1) → new  
- R(position2 → same as ARISE, but likely wrong→)  
- I(position3→ same?➖)  
- E(position4→ new!)  
- D(position5→ new)  

This shifts E to position4→ tested new position→ better?  

**Final choice: TRIED**  
- Includes R,I,E → required.  
- Avoids A,S.  
- R,I same positions (2,3) → retesting may confirm positioning (if ➖→ definitely wrong positions; if change→ info).  
- Tests E in position4 (was position5 before→ now new!)  
- Introduces T (common) and D (common).  

But TRIED positions: R/I in 2 and 3→ same as ARISE → feedback R➖ position2→ retesting same position→ yields new info:  
  - If R➖ again→ position still wrong→ likely position1/3/4 (if word has R).  
  - If ✓→ contradiction? Original➖ for R position2→ now same position✓→ meaning? → Actually possible if R was fixed→ unlikely in game→ perhaps initial feedback implied R exists but position wrong→ so position2 wrong→ should avoid.  
So better shift positions: **CRIME**  
- C(position1)  
- R(position2) (same as before? avoid)  

Best option: **QUERY?** → too rare→ avoid.  

**Practical word: LINER**  
- L(position1)→ new  
- I(position2) → shifts from position3→ tests new position  
- N(position3)→ new  
- E(position4) → new position (was5)  
- R(position5) → new position (was2)  

Perfect: shifts R/I/E completely:  
- I from pos3→2  
- E from pos5→4  
- R from pos2→5 → avoids prior positions!  
Introduces L/N→ common.  
Avoids A/S.  

**GUESS: LINER**  

Alternatively **NICER**→ avoids A/S→ includes R/E→ but misses I?  

Wait: LINER letters: include I? Yes: L I N E R → contains all R,I,E.  

Thus: LINER.  

If LINNER→ not 5 letter→ LINER correct.  

So: LINER

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start playing this word game. The goal is to guess a 5-letter word in six tries based on feedback. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior clues to work with, so I need to choose a word that covers common letters and provides maximum information.

Thinking about effective starting words in word games: ARISE is often recommended because it contains common vowels and consonants. Specifically:

- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, I, S) which balance letter types.
- Shares R and S with the example (Brisk).
- Is short, memorable, and respects constraints.

This choice could reveal frequent letters and their positions efficiently. While other words like SLATE or CRANE are valid, ARISE feels like a balanced starting point for uncovering hints.

So, my first guess will be ""ARISE"".I need to make my first guess without any prior feedback. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information about the secret word. I recall that in word games, a strong first guess typically includes varied, common letters to reveal their presence (or absence) and positions efficiently.  

I should prioritize:
- Including vowels (like A, E, I) since they appear in most words.
- Using frequently used consonants (like R, S, T).
- Avoiding repeating letters to cover more ground.

Words like ARISE or ROAST fit this strategy well. Between them:
- ARISE has A, E (two vowels) and R, I, S (common consonants), covering five distinct letters with good frequency.
- Compared to SALET or CRANE, ARISE uses similarly high-value letters.

By choosing ARISE, I cover two vowels and three consonants, increasing the chance of revealing correct positions or existences quickly. This sets me up well for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

<guess>ARISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let's analyze the feedback from my first guess. I guessed ""ARISE"", and the feedback was A(x), R(-), I(-), S(x), E(-). 

Hmm, this tells me several important things. First, A and S are definitely not in the word at all - that's what the ""x"" means. So I can eliminate those letters completely. 

On the brighter side, R, I, and E are all present in the secret word, just not in the positions I guessed them in. R was in first position? Not correct, but it's somewhere else. Similarly, I was in third position but wrong, E was in fifth but wrong position. 

So the secret word contains R, I, and E, but not A or S. Now since I know these three letters are in the word, my next guess should include all of them while avoiding A and S completely. 

I also need to consider possible positions. Since R isn't first, I should try it in other positions. Same with I and E. Thinking of common English words with R, I, E... words like ""CRIME"" or ""PRIDE"" come to mind. 

""PRIDE"" might be good - contains P,R,I,D,E. That covers my known letters R, I, E and introduces two new consonants P and D. P is fourth position, D fifth - neither was tested before so this could give new information. 

Alternatively ""BRINE"" - but that has B and N instead. But since S is out, BRINE avoids S which is good. However PRIDE seems equally valid. Let me decide... PRIDE places R in second position (unlike first in ARISE), I in third (same as before but wrong position last time so maybe try different?), E in fifth (same position feedback was wrong). 

But since we don't know correct positions yet, changing positions makes sense. PRIDE: R in position 2, I in 3, E in 5. Different from ARISE where they were in 2,3,5 respectively. 

Yes, PRIDE seems like a solid second guess that incorporates all present letters while testing new positions and introducing two new letters (P and D). 

If it doesn't hit, the feedback will give even more information about positioning of R,I,E and presence of P and D.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""ARISE"" → A❌, R➖, I➖, S❌, E➖):  

- **A** and **S** are ABSENT from the secret word → Eliminate them.  
- **R**, **I**, and **E** are PRESENT but in the WRONG positions → Must include them in the next guess, but placed differently.  
- R cannot be position 2, I cannot be position 3, E cannot be position 5.  

### Strategy for Guess 2:  
1. Use **R**, **I**, and **E** in new positions.  
2. Avoid **A** and **S**.  
3. Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, N, D, L) for efficiency.  

Optimal second guess: **PRIDE**  
- **P** (new letter, position 1)  
- **R** (position 2 → *was position 2 in ""ARISE"" but incorrectly placed; so try shifting*)  
- **I** (position 3 → *was position 3 originally; move it elsewhere*)  
- **D** (new letter, position 4)  
- **E** (position 5 → *was position 5 originally; now testing position 5 again despite wrong position earlier*)  

*Why ""PRIDE""?*  
- Tests **R** in a new position (2 → previously tested in 2, but feedback showed wrong position → **must move R**).  
  - Correction: R was in position 2 in ARISE and marked ➖, so in ""PRIDE"", testing the same position isn't ideal. Alternative placements:  
    - R in position 1 (like ""RAINY"" → but A is eliminated).  
    - R in position 4 (like ""OXIDE"" → lacks tested consonants).  
  - Keeping R in position 2 simplifies if we suspect position was wrong but R itself exists. Alternate options: **TRIBE** (R position 2, same placement as before). However:  
    - **PRIDE** uses P/D (untested consonants), positions I in 3 again (avoidable), and E in 5 (avoidable). Better alternative: **RICEY** → invalid word. Instead:  
- **TRIBE** → T(position1), R(position2), I(position3), B(position4), E(position5). Avoids A/S, tests R/I/E in “new” positions? R and I are same positions as ARISE (2 and 3), which were WRONG. So TRIBE repeats positions 2 and 3 → not ideal.  

Revised choice: **BRIDE**  
- **B** (new, position1)  
- **R** (position2 → *same as ARISE*)  
  - But feedback said R was wrong in position2 → avoid position2!  
  - Better: Put R in position1 → but common words?  
    - ""RIPER"" → repeats R and avoids positions? E exists → ""RIPER"" invalid?  

Alternate: **OXIDE**  
- O(position1), X(position2), I(position3), D(position4), E(position5)  
- But ""X"" is rare → inefficient.  

Best fit: **CRIER**  
- But repeats? And E at end → ""CRIER"" 5 letters? → valid: C R I E R → repeats R → bad?  

Optimal word accounting feedback: **PROVE**  
- P(position1), R(position2→ same position?), O(position3), V(position4), E(position5→ same?)  

Tradeoff: **PRIDE** still acceptable:  
- Re-tests R in position2, I position3, E position5 → if R/I/E were misplaced by 1 spot→might fix. But positions same? Original feedback:  
  - ARISE had R/I/E in positions 2,3,5 → ALL wrong→ meaning all positions incorrect→ thus likely R not2, I not3, E not5. Thus PRIDE tests same positions → yields info:  
If R gets ➖ again→ position2 wrong again→ possibly position1/3→ useful still.  

Final decision:  
Ideal word: **PRIDE**  
- Avoids A/S  
- Includes R/I/E  
- Tests new letters P/D (high-frequency)  
- Positions: R(position2→ same as before? Feedback R➖ was position2→ so retesting position2→ yields info: if ➖ again→ R not2, if ✓→ position2 correct→ contradiction?  
Feedback symbol change explained:  
If R is in word but wrong position→ try same position again: if still ➖→ still wrong position→ possible adjacent shift→ valuable info. So it's valid.  

New candidate: **TRIED**  
- T(position1) → new  
- R(position2 → same as ARISE, but likely wrong→)  
- I(position3→ same?➖)  
- E(position4→ new!)  
- D(position5→ new)  

This shifts E to position4→ tested new position→ better?  

**Final choice: TRIED**  
- Includes R,I,E → required.  
- Avoids A,S.  
- R,I same positions (2,3) → retesting may confirm positioning (if ➖→ definitely wrong positions; if change→ info).  
- Tests E in position4 (was position5 before→ now new!)  
- Introduces T (common) and D (common).  

But TRIED positions: R/I in 2 and 3→ same as ARISE → feedback R➖ position2→ retesting same position→ yields new info:  
  - If R➖ again→ position still wrong→ likely position1/3/4 (if word has R).  
  - If ✓→ contradiction? Original➖ for R position2→ now same position✓→ meaning? → Actually possible if R was fixed→ unlikely in game→ perhaps initial feedback implied R exists but position wrong→ so position2 wrong→ should avoid.  
So better shift positions: **CRIME**  
- C(position1)  
- R(position2) (same as before? avoid)  

Best option: **QUERY?** → too rare→ avoid.  

**Practical word: LINER**  
- L(position1)→ new  
- I(position2) → shifts from position3→ tests new position  
- N(position3)→ new  
- E(position4) → new position (was5)  
- R(position5) → new position (was2)  

Perfect: shifts R/I/E completely:  
- I from pos3→2  
- E from pos5→4  
- R from pos2→5 → avoids prior positions!  
Introduces L/N→ common.  
Avoids A/S.  

**GUESS: LINER**  

Alternatively **NICER**→ avoids A/S→ includes R/E→ but misses I?  

Wait: LINER letters: include I? Yes: L I N E R → contains all R,I,E.  

Thus: LINER.  

If LINNER→ not 5 letter→ LINER correct.  

So: LINER

We are given feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ARISE
- A: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- I: present, wrong position (-)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: LINER
- L: absent (x)
- I: correct position (✓) -> so I is in position 2 (since in LINER, I is the second letter)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is in position 4 (since in LINER, E is the fourth letter)
- R: present, wrong position (-)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has 5 letters.
2. Letters that are absent: A, S, L (from Guess1 and Guess2)
3. Letters that are present: R, I, E (from Guess1) and also N (from Guess2) and R is still present (from both, but not in the same position as in either guess).
4. Correct positions:
   - I is in position 2 (because in LINER, I was in position 2 and marked correct).
   - E is in position 4 (because in LINER, E was in position 4 and marked correct).

So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _

5. We also know that R and N are present but not in the positions they were in the previous guesses.

In Guess1 (ARISE):
- R was in position 2 -> but now we know position 2 is I, so R cannot be there. Also, in Guess1, R was marked present but wrong position, so R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Similarly, in Guess1, I was in position 3 and marked present but wrong position. But now we know I is in position 2, so that's consistent (because in the secret word, I is in 2, so in Guess1 it was in 3 which is wrong).

In Guess2 (LINER):
- R was in position 5 and marked present but wrong position. So R is in the word but not in position 5.
- N was in position 3 and marked present but wrong position. So N is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, for the secret word:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word must contain R and N, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? Let's see the constraints for R and N:

Constraints for R:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess1 and now fixed as I)
- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess2, because it was there and marked wrong position)

Constraints for N:
- Cannot be in position 3 (from Guess2)

Also, the word must not contain A, S, L.

So the secret word pattern: _ I _ E _

We have to place R and N in the remaining positions: 1, 3, and 5. But note that position 5 is the last letter, and we know R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1 or 3? But wait, we have three positions (1,3,5) and two letters (R and N) and one more letter that we don't know? Because the word is 5 letters and we have I and E fixed, and we know two more letters (R and N) so that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown.

We know the word has R, I, E, N, and one more letter. We also know the absent letters: A, S, L. So we need to find a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and includes R and N, and the fifth letter is not A, S, L, and not any of the letters we already know? Actually, we don't know the fifth letter.

Let me list the known information:

- Positions:
  - 1: unknown (cannot be R? because R might be there, but we don't know yet)
  - 2: I
  - 3: unknown
  - 4: E
  - 5: unknown

- Known present letters: R, N (and I and E are already placed, so we don't count them again for presence). So we must have R and N in the word, and they must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. But R cannot be in position 5 (from Guess2). So R must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, N cannot be in position 3 (from Guess2). So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, we have one more letter to fill the remaining position. Let me denote the positions:

Position 1: can be R or N? But note: if R is in position 1, then N must be in position 5 (since N cannot be in 3, and position 3 would be the fifth letter). Similarly, if N is in position 1, then R must be in position 3 (because R cannot be in 5, and position 5 would be the fifth letter). But wait, we have three positions and three letters: one of them is R, one is N, and one is a new letter (let's call it X). So we have:

- Position 1: either R, N, or X
- Position 3: either R, N, or X
- Position 5: either R, N, or X

But with constraints:
- R cannot be in position 5.
- N cannot be in position 3.

So:

Case 1: Position 1 is R.
Then R is fixed at 1. Then we have positions 3 and 5 for N and X.
But N cannot be in position 3, so N must be in position 5, and then position 3 must be X.

Case 2: Position 1 is N.
Then N is fixed at 1. Then we have positions 3 and 5 for R and X.
But R cannot be in position 5, so R must be in position 3, and then position 5 must be X.

Case 3: Position 1 is X (the new letter).
Then we have positions 3 and 5 for R and N.
But R cannot be in 5, so R must be in 3. Then N must be in 5? But wait, N cannot be in 3? If R is in 3, then N must be in 5. But N can be in 5? There's no constraint against N in 5. So that's allowed.

So the three possibilities for the word structure:

1. R I X E N   (with X in position 3, and N in 5)
2. N I R E X   (with X in position 5)
3. X I R E N   (with X in position 1, R in 3, N in 5)

But wait, in case 1: R in 1, then N must be in 5, and position 3 is X -> so word: R I X E N
In case 2: N in 1, R in 3, and X in 5 -> word: N I R E X
In case 3: X in 1, R in 3, N in 5 -> word: X I R E N

Now, we also know that in Guess1, when we had ARISE, the letter E was in position 5 and marked present but wrong position. Now we have E fixed in position 4, which is consistent because in ARISE it was in 5 and now we know it's in 4.

Similarly, in Guess1, I was in position 3 and marked wrong, but now we have it in position 2, which is consistent.

Now, we need to think of words that fit these patterns and use common letters. Also, we must avoid A, S, L.

Let's consider the patterns:

Pattern 1: R I _ E N
Pattern 2: N I R E _
Pattern 3: _ I R E N

We can try to form words:

Pattern 1: R I _ E N
What can be the third letter? We need a letter that forms a word. Common letters: R I P E N -> ""RIPEN"" -> but we haven't tested P? Also, check if P is allowed? We don't know if P is in the word or not, but it's not excluded.

Pattern 2: N I R E _
What can be the last letter? N I R E D -> ""NIRED""? Not a word. N I R E S -> but S is excluded. N I R E T -> ""NIRET""? Not a word. N I R E M -> ""NIREM""? Not a word. This pattern might be less likely.

Pattern 3: _ I R E N
First letter: ? I R E N -> we can have B I R E N? Not a word. D I R E N? Not a word. F I R E N? Not a word. H I R E N? Not a word. M I R E N? Not a word. P I R E N? Not a word. T I R E N -> ""TIREN""? Not a word. W I R E N? Not a word. V I R E N? Not a word. This pattern also seems difficult.

But wait, pattern 1: R I _ E N
We have R I ? E N. What words? 
- RIPEN: R I P E N -> P is the third letter.
- RIVEN: R I V E N -> V is the third letter.
- RIZEN? Not a word.

So possible words: RIPEN, RIVEN.

Now, pattern 2: N I R E _
We have N I R E ? 
- N I R E D? Not a word.
- N I R E S? Excluded.
- N I R E T? Not a word.
- N I R E M? Not a word.
- N I R E W? Not a word.

I don't see a common word for pattern 2.

Pattern 3: ? I R E N
- F I R E N? Not a word.
- W I R E N? Not a word.
- T I R E N? Not a word.
- But what about ""SIREN""? But S is excluded. 
- ""DIREN""? Not a word.

Another possibility: what about ""CRIER""? But that doesn't fit the pattern because we need I in position 2 and E in 4.

Wait, we might have missed a pattern. Earlier I considered only three cases, but what if the new letter is in position 3 and also in position 1 or 5? Actually, I think I covered the cases.

But let me double-check: we have to place R, N, and one unknown letter (X) in positions 1,3,5. The constraints are:
- R cannot be in 5.
- N cannot be in 3.

So the assignments:

- Position 1: R -> then position 3: X, position 5: N -> word: R I X E N
- Position 1: N -> then position 3: R (because R must be in 3 since it can't be in 5, and then position 5: X) -> word: N I R E X
- Position 1: X -> then position 3: R (because R must be placed and can't be in 5, so must be in 3), then position 5: N -> word: X I R E N

So the patterns are as above.

Now, for pattern 1: R I X E N, we have two candidates: RIPEN and RIVEN.

For pattern 3: X I R E N, we might have ""WHREN""? Not a word. Or ""SHIREN""? Not a word. Actually, I can't think of any common word for pattern 3.

But what about ""BRIEF""? No, because it ends with F, not N. And we need N at the end? In pattern 3, we have N at the end.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""URINE""? But that doesn't fit because we need I in position 2 and E in 4. URINE is U R I N E -> positions: U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we need I in position 2 and E in 4. So that doesn't match.

So let's focus on pattern 1: R I ? E N.

We have:
- RIPEN: R I P E N
- RIVEN: R I V E N

Now, we need to test one of these. But we have only one guess so far? Actually, we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one of these, but we might also consider that we haven't tested P or V.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests more letters. But we have limited guesses.

We also have the feedback from Guess2: in LINER, N was in position 3 and marked present but wrong position. So in the secret word, N is not in position 3. In our patterns, in pattern 1 (R I X E N), N is in position 5, which is fine. In pattern 2 (N I R E X), N is in position 1, which is also fine. In pattern 3 (X I R E N), N is in position 5, fine.

But in pattern 1, we have two candidates: RIPEN and RIVEN. We don't know which one.

We could make a guess that includes both P and V? But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have to use the information we have. We know the word must have R, I, E, N and one more letter. The positions are constrained.

Another common word that fits pattern 1: R I D E N? But that's not a word. R I P E N is a word.

Wait, what about ""RISEN""? But S is excluded, so no.

So RIPEN and RIVEN are the main candidates.

But let me check if there are other patterns? What if the new letter is in position 5 for pattern 1? No, in pattern 1, position 5 is N.

Perhaps I missed that the fifth letter might be R? But R cannot be in position 5, so no.

Another pattern: what if in case 3, the first letter is a vowel? Like ""O""? O I R E N? Not a word. ""A""? Excluded. ""E""? But E is already in position 4, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in these games, duplicates are not allowed unless specified. We haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far, so let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word has distinct letters? We don't know for sure, but in the feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate. In ARISE and LINER, all letters are distinct. So probably the secret word has distinct letters.

Therefore, we can assume no duplicates.

So in the secret word, letters are distinct: R, I, E, N, and one more.

Now, back to the patterns.

We can try to guess RIPEN or RIVEN. But let's see which one is more likely.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the presence of P and V? But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we might not need to, because if we guess one and it's wrong, we get feedback.

But let's think of a word that fits the pattern and also tests other letters.

We have to include the known present letters: R and N must be in the word, and we know I and E are fixed. So we must include R and N in the guess, and they must be in positions that are allowed.

For the third guess, we can try to confirm the pattern.

But note: in pattern 1, R is in position 1 and N in 5. In pattern 2, R is in 3 and N in 1. In pattern 3, R is in 3 and N in 5.

We can try a word that has R in position 1 and N in position 5? That would be pattern 1. If we guess such a word, and it's not the secret, we get feedback.

Similarly, we can try a word with R in position 3 and N in position 1 (pattern 2) or R in 3 and N in 5 (pattern 3).

But pattern 2 and 3 seem less likely because we couldn't find common words.

So let's try pattern 1: R I ? E N

We have two options: RIPEN and RIVEN.

We can choose one. Let's pick RIPEN because P is a common letter.

But we haven't tested P. Alternatively, we can test a word that includes both possibilities? Not really.

We can also consider that in Guess1, we had no P, so we don't know about P.

But to be safe, we might guess RIPEN.

But let me see if there is a word that can help us distinguish.

Another idea: what about the letter that was in position 1 of Guess1? We had A, which is absent. Position 1 of Guess2 was L, absent. So we don't know about position 1.

We can try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1? But in pattern 1, position 1 is R.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't commit to one pattern but tests multiple.

But we have to include I in 2 and E in 4.

So the guess must be of the form: ? I ? E ?

And we must include R and N (because they are present) and avoid A, S, L.

Also, R cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 3.

So let's think of a word that satisfies:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Contains R and N
- R not in 5, N not in 3
- And the other letter is not A, S, L.

For example, we can try ""PRIDE"" again? But we already tried LINER, and PRIDE was not tried. But in PRIDE: P R I D E -> positions: P1, R2, I3, D4, E5 -> but we need I in position 2 and E in 4. So that doesn't match.

We need I in 2 and E in 4.

So the word: ? I ? E ?

We need to assign:
- Position 1: a letter (not A, S, L, and not I, E because distinct)
- Position 3: a letter (not A, S, L, not I, E, and not N? because N cannot be in 3? Actually, N cannot be in 3, so position 3 cannot be N)
- Position 5: a letter (not A, S, L, not I, E, and not R? because R cannot be in 5)

Also, the word must contain R and N.

So position 1: can be R, or N, or a new letter (but not A,S,L)
Position 3: can be R or a new letter (but not N, because N cannot be in 3, and not R? wait, R can be in 3) -> but R can be in 3, and new letters are allowed.
Position 5: can be N or a new letter (but not R)

And the word must have exactly the letters: position1, I, position3, E, position5, and these must include R and N.

So the set {position1, position3, position5} must contain R and N, and one more letter.

Now, we can try to find a word that fits and tests common letters.

For example, let's try position1 = R, position3 = P, position5 = N -> word: R I P E N -> RIPEN

Or position1 = R, position3 = V, position5 = N -> R I V E N

Or position1 = T, position3 = R, position5 = N -> T I R E N -> ""TIREN"" not a word.

Or position1 = N, position3 = R, position5 = D -> N I R E D -> not a word.

Or position1 = B, position3 = R, position5 = N -> B I R E N -> not a word.

Or position1 = D, position3 = R, position5 = N -> D I R E N -> not a word.

Or position1 = F, position3 = R, position5 = N -> F I R E N -> not a word.

Or position1 = position1 = P, position3 = R, position5 = N -> P I R E N -> ""PIREN"" not a word.

So only common words seem to be RIPEN and RIVEN.

Therefore, I think we should guess one of them.

Let's choose RIPEN because P is more common than V.

So the guess: RIPEN

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's not correct.

If the secret word is RIVEN, then for RIPEN:
- R: correct position (1) -> ✓
- I: correct position (2) -> ✓
- P: not in the word -> x (because RIVEN has V, not P)
- E: correct position (4) -> ✓
- N: correct position (5) -> ✓

So we would get: R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we would know it's RIVEN.

Similarly, if we guess RIVEN and the secret is RIPEN, we get:
- R(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we know it's RIPEN.

So either way, we can get it in the next guess.

But we are on the third guess, so we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests both P and V? But we have to have I in 2 and E in 4, and include R and N.

For example, is there a word like ""RIPEN"" and ""RIVEN"" but we can't have both P and V in one word with the pattern.

We could guess a different word that has P or V and other letters.

But I think it's efficient to guess RIPEN.

So I'll go with that.

<guess>RIPEN</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, I have analyzed the possible secret words. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (ARISE)**: A❌, R➖ (present, wrong position), I➖ (present, wrong position), S❌, E➖ (present, wrong position).
   - **Guess 2 (LINER)**: L❌, I✓ (correct position), N➖ (present, wrong position), E✓ (correct position), R➖ (present, wrong position).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Absent Letters**: A, S, and L are not in the word (from ❌ in both guesses).
   - **Correct Positions**: 
     - I is in position 2 (from I✓ in LINER).
     - E is in position 4 (from E✓ in LINER).
     - So the secret word pattern is: `_ I _ E _`.
   - **Present Letters with Position Constraints**:
     - R is present but cannot be in position 2 (from ARISE feedback) or position 5 (from LINER feedback).
     - N is present but cannot be in position 3 (from LINER feedback).
     - The word must include R and N, plus one unknown letter (X), with all letters distinct (no duplicates inferred from feedback).

3. **Possible Patterns**:
   - Given constraints, the secret word must fit one of these structures:
     - **Pattern 1**: `R I X E N` (R in position 1, X in position 3, N in position 5).
     - **Pattern 2**: `N I R E X` (N in position 1, R in position 3, X in position 5).
     - **Pattern 3**: `X I R E N` (X in position 1, R in position 3, N in position 5).
   - Pattern 2 and 3 were deemed unlikely due to uncommon/rare words (e.g., `NIRED` or `TIREN` are not valid words). Pattern 1 (`R I X E N`) has valid candidates.

4. **Valid Words for Pattern 1**:
   - `RIPEN` (X = P): Common word meaning to become ripe.
   - `RIVEN` (X = V): Less common but valid (past participle of ""rive,"" meaning to split or tear).

5. **Strategy for Guess 3**:
   - `RIPEN` is chosen because:
     - It tests the most probable pattern (`R I X E N`).
     - P is a high-frequency letter, making it a strong test.
     - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject P and N positions, narrowing to `RIVEN` or other options quickly.
   - Avoids absent letters (A, S, L) and respects position constraints (R not in 2 or 5, N not in 3).

6. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If `RIPEN` is correct, we win.
   - If incorrect, feedback will:
     - Confirm R✓ (position 1), I✓ (position 2), E✓ (position 4), N✓ (position 5) if they match.
     - Reveal if P is absent (❌), pointing to `RIVEN` for the next guess.

Given this, **RIPEN** is the optimal third guess.

<guess>RIPEN</guess>",RIPEN,"We are given feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ARISE
- A: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- I: present, wrong position (-)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: LINER
- L: absent (x)
- I: correct position (✓) -> so I is in position 2 (since in LINER, I is the second letter)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is in position 4 (since in LINER, E is the fourth letter)
- R: present, wrong position (-)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has 5 letters.
2. Letters that are absent: A, S, L (from Guess1 and Guess2)
3. Letters that are present: R, I, E (from Guess1) and also N (from Guess2) and R is still present (from both, but not in the same position as in either guess).
4. Correct positions:
   - I is in position 2 (because in LINER, I was in position 2 and marked correct).
   - E is in position 4 (because in LINER, E was in position 4 and marked correct).

So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _

5. We also know that R and N are present but not in the positions they were in the previous guesses.

In Guess1 (ARISE):
- R was in position 2 -> but now we know position 2 is I, so R cannot be there. Also, in Guess1, R was marked present but wrong position, so R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Similarly, in Guess1, I was in position 3 and marked present but wrong position. But now we know I is in position 2, so that's consistent (because in the secret word, I is in 2, so in Guess1 it was in 3 which is wrong).

In Guess2 (LINER):
- R was in position 5 and marked present but wrong position. So R is in the word but not in position 5.
- N was in position 3 and marked present but wrong position. So N is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, for the secret word:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word must contain R and N, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? Let's see the constraints for R and N:

Constraints for R:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess1 and now fixed as I)
- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess2, because it was there and marked wrong position)

Constraints for N:
- Cannot be in position 3 (from Guess2)

Also, the word must not contain A, S, L.

So the secret word pattern: _ I _ E _

We have to place R and N in the remaining positions: 1, 3, and 5. But note that position 5 is the last letter, and we know R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1 or 3? But wait, we have three positions (1,3,5) and two letters (R and N) and one more letter that we don't know? Because the word is 5 letters and we have I and E fixed, and we know two more letters (R and N) so that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown.

We know the word has R, I, E, N, and one more letter. We also know the absent letters: A, S, L. So we need to find a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and includes R and N, and the fifth letter is not A, S, L, and not any of the letters we already know? Actually, we don't know the fifth letter.

Let me list the known information:

- Positions:
  - 1: unknown (cannot be R? because R might be there, but we don't know yet)
  - 2: I
  - 3: unknown
  - 4: E
  - 5: unknown

- Known present letters: R, N (and I and E are already placed, so we don't count them again for presence). So we must have R and N in the word, and they must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. But R cannot be in position 5 (from Guess2). So R must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, N cannot be in position 3 (from Guess2). So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, we have one more letter to fill the remaining position. Let me denote the positions:

Position 1: can be R or N? But note: if R is in position 1, then N must be in position 5 (since N cannot be in 3, and position 3 would be the fifth letter). Similarly, if N is in position 1, then R must be in position 3 (because R cannot be in 5, and position 5 would be the fifth letter). But wait, we have three positions and three letters: one of them is R, one is N, and one is a new letter (let's call it X). So we have:

- Position 1: either R, N, or X
- Position 3: either R, N, or X
- Position 5: either R, N, or X

But with constraints:
- R cannot be in position 5.
- N cannot be in position 3.

So:

Case 1: Position 1 is R.
Then R is fixed at 1. Then we have positions 3 and 5 for N and X.
But N cannot be in position 3, so N must be in position 5, and then position 3 must be X.

Case 2: Position 1 is N.
Then N is fixed at 1. Then we have positions 3 and 5 for R and X.
But R cannot be in position 5, so R must be in position 3, and then position 5 must be X.

Case 3: Position 1 is X (the new letter).
Then we have positions 3 and 5 for R and N.
But R cannot be in 5, so R must be in 3. Then N must be in 5? But wait, N cannot be in 3? If R is in 3, then N must be in 5. But N can be in 5? There's no constraint against N in 5. So that's allowed.

So the three possibilities for the word structure:

1. R I X E N   (with X in position 3, and N in 5)
2. N I R E X   (with X in position 5)
3. X I R E N   (with X in position 1, R in 3, N in 5)

But wait, in case 1: R in 1, then N must be in 5, and position 3 is X -> so word: R I X E N
In case 2: N in 1, R in 3, and X in 5 -> word: N I R E X
In case 3: X in 1, R in 3, N in 5 -> word: X I R E N

Now, we also know that in Guess1, when we had ARISE, the letter E was in position 5 and marked present but wrong position. Now we have E fixed in position 4, which is consistent because in ARISE it was in 5 and now we know it's in 4.

Similarly, in Guess1, I was in position 3 and marked wrong, but now we have it in position 2, which is consistent.

Now, we need to think of words that fit these patterns and use common letters. Also, we must avoid A, S, L.

Let's consider the patterns:

Pattern 1: R I _ E N
Pattern 2: N I R E _
Pattern 3: _ I R E N

We can try to form words:

Pattern 1: R I _ E N
What can be the third letter? We need a letter that forms a word. Common letters: R I P E N -> ""RIPEN"" -> but we haven't tested P? Also, check if P is allowed? We don't know if P is in the word or not, but it's not excluded.

Pattern 2: N I R E _
What can be the last letter? N I R E D -> ""NIRED""? Not a word. N I R E S -> but S is excluded. N I R E T -> ""NIRET""? Not a word. N I R E M -> ""NIREM""? Not a word. This pattern might be less likely.

Pattern 3: _ I R E N
First letter: ? I R E N -> we can have B I R E N? Not a word. D I R E N? Not a word. F I R E N? Not a word. H I R E N? Not a word. M I R E N? Not a word. P I R E N? Not a word. T I R E N -> ""TIREN""? Not a word. W I R E N? Not a word. V I R E N? Not a word. This pattern also seems difficult.

But wait, pattern 1: R I _ E N
We have R I ? E N. What words? 
- RIPEN: R I P E N -> P is the third letter.
- RIVEN: R I V E N -> V is the third letter.
- RIZEN? Not a word.

So possible words: RIPEN, RIVEN.

Now, pattern 2: N I R E _
We have N I R E ? 
- N I R E D? Not a word.
- N I R E S? Excluded.
- N I R E T? Not a word.
- N I R E M? Not a word.
- N I R E W? Not a word.

I don't see a common word for pattern 2.

Pattern 3: ? I R E N
- F I R E N? Not a word.
- W I R E N? Not a word.
- T I R E N? Not a word.
- But what about ""SIREN""? But S is excluded. 
- ""DIREN""? Not a word.

Another possibility: what about ""CRIER""? But that doesn't fit the pattern because we need I in position 2 and E in 4.

Wait, we might have missed a pattern. Earlier I considered only three cases, but what if the new letter is in position 3 and also in position 1 or 5? Actually, I think I covered the cases.

But let me double-check: we have to place R, N, and one unknown letter (X) in positions 1,3,5. The constraints are:
- R cannot be in 5.
- N cannot be in 3.

So the assignments:

- Position 1: R -> then position 3: X, position 5: N -> word: R I X E N
- Position 1: N -> then position 3: R (because R must be in 3 since it can't be in 5, and then position 5: X) -> word: N I R E X
- Position 1: X -> then position 3: R (because R must be placed and can't be in 5, so must be in 3), then position 5: N -> word: X I R E N

So the patterns are as above.

Now, for pattern 1: R I X E N, we have two candidates: RIPEN and RIVEN.

For pattern 3: X I R E N, we might have ""WHREN""? Not a word. Or ""SHIREN""? Not a word. Actually, I can't think of any common word for pattern 3.

But what about ""BRIEF""? No, because it ends with F, not N. And we need N at the end? In pattern 3, we have N at the end.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""URINE""? But that doesn't fit because we need I in position 2 and E in 4. URINE is U R I N E -> positions: U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we need I in position 2 and E in 4. So that doesn't match.

So let's focus on pattern 1: R I ? E N.

We have:
- RIPEN: R I P E N
- RIVEN: R I V E N

Now, we need to test one of these. But we have only one guess so far? Actually, we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one of these, but we might also consider that we haven't tested P or V.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests more letters. But we have limited guesses.

We also have the feedback from Guess2: in LINER, N was in position 3 and marked present but wrong position. So in the secret word, N is not in position 3. In our patterns, in pattern 1 (R I X E N), N is in position 5, which is fine. In pattern 2 (N I R E X), N is in position 1, which is also fine. In pattern 3 (X I R E N), N is in position 5, fine.

But in pattern 1, we have two candidates: RIPEN and RIVEN. We don't know which one.

We could make a guess that includes both P and V? But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have to use the information we have. We know the word must have R, I, E, N and one more letter. The positions are constrained.

Another common word that fits pattern 1: R I D E N? But that's not a word. R I P E N is a word.

Wait, what about ""RISEN""? But S is excluded, so no.

So RIPEN and RIVEN are the main candidates.

But let me check if there are other patterns? What if the new letter is in position 5 for pattern 1? No, in pattern 1, position 5 is N.

Perhaps I missed that the fifth letter might be R? But R cannot be in position 5, so no.

Another pattern: what if in case 3, the first letter is a vowel? Like ""O""? O I R E N? Not a word. ""A""? Excluded. ""E""? But E is already in position 4, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in these games, duplicates are not allowed unless specified. We haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far, so let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word has distinct letters? We don't know for sure, but in the feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate. In ARISE and LINER, all letters are distinct. So probably the secret word has distinct letters.

Therefore, we can assume no duplicates.

So in the secret word, letters are distinct: R, I, E, N, and one more.

Now, back to the patterns.

We can try to guess RIPEN or RIVEN. But let's see which one is more likely.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the presence of P and V? But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we might not need to, because if we guess one and it's wrong, we get feedback.

But let's think of a word that fits the pattern and also tests other letters.

We have to include the known present letters: R and N must be in the word, and we know I and E are fixed. So we must include R and N in the guess, and they must be in positions that are allowed.

For the third guess, we can try to confirm the pattern.

But note: in pattern 1, R is in position 1 and N in 5. In pattern 2, R is in 3 and N in 1. In pattern 3, R is in 3 and N in 5.

We can try a word that has R in position 1 and N in position 5? That would be pattern 1. If we guess such a word, and it's not the secret, we get feedback.

Similarly, we can try a word with R in position 3 and N in position 1 (pattern 2) or R in 3 and N in 5 (pattern 3).

But pattern 2 and 3 seem less likely because we couldn't find common words.

So let's try pattern 1: R I ? E N

We have two options: RIPEN and RIVEN.

We can choose one. Let's pick RIPEN because P is a common letter.

But we haven't tested P. Alternatively, we can test a word that includes both possibilities? Not really.

We can also consider that in Guess1, we had no P, so we don't know about P.

But to be safe, we might guess RIPEN.

But let me see if there is a word that can help us distinguish.

Another idea: what about the letter that was in position 1 of Guess1? We had A, which is absent. Position 1 of Guess2 was L, absent. So we don't know about position 1.

We can try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1? But in pattern 1, position 1 is R.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't commit to one pattern but tests multiple.

But we have to include I in 2 and E in 4.

So the guess must be of the form: ? I ? E ?

And we must include R and N (because they are present) and avoid A, S, L.

Also, R cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 3.

So let's think of a word that satisfies:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Contains R and N
- R not in 5, N not in 3
- And the other letter is not A, S, L.

For example, we can try ""PRIDE"" again? But we already tried LINER, and PRIDE was not tried. But in PRIDE: P R I D E -> positions: P1, R2, I3, D4, E5 -> but we need I in position 2 and E in 4. So that doesn't match.

We need I in 2 and E in 4.

So the word: ? I ? E ?

We need to assign:
- Position 1: a letter (not A, S, L, and not I, E because distinct)
- Position 3: a letter (not A, S, L, not I, E, and not N? because N cannot be in 3? Actually, N cannot be in 3, so position 3 cannot be N)
- Position 5: a letter (not A, S, L, not I, E, and not R? because R cannot be in 5)

Also, the word must contain R and N.

So position 1: can be R, or N, or a new letter (but not A,S,L)
Position 3: can be R or a new letter (but not N, because N cannot be in 3, and not R? wait, R can be in 3) -> but R can be in 3, and new letters are allowed.
Position 5: can be N or a new letter (but not R)

And the word must have exactly the letters: position1, I, position3, E, position5, and these must include R and N.

So the set {position1, position3, position5} must contain R and N, and one more letter.

Now, we can try to find a word that fits and tests common letters.

For example, let's try position1 = R, position3 = P, position5 = N -> word: R I P E N -> RIPEN

Or position1 = R, position3 = V, position5 = N -> R I V E N

Or position1 = T, position3 = R, position5 = N -> T I R E N -> ""TIREN"" not a word.

Or position1 = N, position3 = R, position5 = D -> N I R E D -> not a word.

Or position1 = B, position3 = R, position5 = N -> B I R E N -> not a word.

Or position1 = D, position3 = R, position5 = N -> D I R E N -> not a word.

Or position1 = F, position3 = R, position5 = N -> F I R E N -> not a word.

Or position1 = position1 = P, position3 = R, position5 = N -> P I R E N -> ""PIREN"" not a word.

So only common words seem to be RIPEN and RIVEN.

Therefore, I think we should guess one of them.

Let's choose RIPEN because P is more common than V.

So the guess: RIPEN

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's not correct.

If the secret word is RIVEN, then for RIPEN:
- R: correct position (1) -> ✓
- I: correct position (2) -> ✓
- P: not in the word -> x (because RIVEN has V, not P)
- E: correct position (4) -> ✓
- N: correct position (5) -> ✓

So we would get: R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we would know it's RIVEN.

Similarly, if we guess RIVEN and the secret is RIPEN, we get:
- R(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(✓)

Then we know it's RIPEN.

So either way, we can get it in the next guess.

But we are on the third guess, so we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests both P and V? But we have to have I in 2 and E in 4, and include R and N.

For example, is there a word like ""RIPEN"" and ""RIVEN"" but we can't have both P and V in one word with the pattern.

We could guess a different word that has P or V and other letters.

But I think it's efficient to guess RIPEN.

So I'll go with that.

<guess>RIPEN</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, I have analyzed the possible secret words. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (ARISE)**: A❌, R➖ (present, wrong position), I➖ (present, wrong position), S❌, E➖ (present, wrong position).
   - **Guess 2 (LINER)**: L❌, I✓ (correct position), N➖ (present, wrong position), E✓ (correct position), R➖ (present, wrong position).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Absent Letters**: A, S, and L are not in the word (from ❌ in both guesses).
   - **Correct Positions**: 
     - I is in position 2 (from I✓ in LINER).
     - E is in position 4 (from E✓ in LINER).
     - So the secret word pattern is: `_ I _ E _`.
   - **Present Letters with Position Constraints**:
     - R is present but cannot be in position 2 (from ARISE feedback) or position 5 (from LINER feedback).
     - N is present but cannot be in position 3 (from LINER feedback).
     - The word must include R and N, plus one unknown letter (X), with all letters distinct (no duplicates inferred from feedback).

3. **Possible Patterns**:
   - Given constraints, the secret word must fit one of these structures:
     - **Pattern 1**: `R I X E N` (R in position 1, X in position 3, N in position 5).
     - **Pattern 2**: `N I R E X` (N in position 1, R in position 3, X in position 5).
     - **Pattern 3**: `X I R E N` (X in position 1, R in position 3, N in position 5).
   - Pattern 2 and 3 were deemed unlikely due to uncommon/rare words (e.g., `NIRED` or `TIREN` are not valid words). Pattern 1 (`R I X E N`) has valid candidates.

4. **Valid Words for Pattern 1**:
   - `RIPEN` (X = P): Common word meaning to become ripe.
   - `RIVEN` (X = V): Less common but valid (past participle of ""rive,"" meaning to split or tear).

5. **Strategy for Guess 3**:
   - `RIPEN` is chosen because:
     - It tests the most probable pattern (`R I X E N`).
     - P is a high-frequency letter, making it a strong test.
     - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject P and N positions, narrowing to `RIVEN` or other options quickly.
   - Avoids absent letters (A, S, L) and respects position constraints (R not in 2 or 5, N not in 3).

6. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If `RIPEN` is correct, we win.
   - If incorrect, feedback will:
     - Confirm R✓ (position 1), I✓ (position 2), E✓ (position 4), N✓ (position 5) if they match.
     - Reveal if P is absent (❌), pointing to `RIVEN` for the next guess.

Given this, **RIPEN** is the optimal third guess.",Guess 3: RIPEN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
