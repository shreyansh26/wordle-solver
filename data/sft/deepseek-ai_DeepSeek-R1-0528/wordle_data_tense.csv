We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior feedback, it's best to choose a word with common letters and a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.). A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let's consider ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also good but less common. However, I'll choose ""RAISE"" for this first guess.

Word: RAISE
R, A, I, S, E are all common.

After submitting ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell us which letters are present and where. This will help narrow down the possibilities.

But since this is the first guess, we don't have feedback yet. So we just pick a word we think is good.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Note: The response format requires the thought process and then the guess in the specified tags.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter in ""RAISE"", which corresponds to the 4th position being S).
- E is also in the correct position (fifth letter, so the word ends with E).
- R, A, I are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
1. The fourth letter as S.
2. The fifth letter as E.
3. It does not contain R, A, or I.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

We have to keep in mind that the word does not have R, A, or I. Also, the letters in positions 1, 2, and 3 are unknown and must not be R, A, or I.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Try different letters that are common in 5-letter words, avoiding R, A, I.
- Since S and E are already confirmed in their positions, we don't need to change them. However, note that the feedback told us S and E are correct, so in the next guess we should keep S in the 4th position and E in the 5th position to preserve what we know and test new letters in the first three positions.

Therefore, the next guess should be of the form: ? ? ? S E

We need to choose the first three letters. We have eliminated R, A, I. Let's consider other common letters.

Common consonants and vowels (without A and I, so using E? But we already have E at the end, and we don't know yet if there's another E). We can use vowels O, U and consonants like T, N, L, etc.

We also want to maximize information: test letters that we haven't checked and are frequent.

Remaining vowels we haven't tested: O, U (since A and I are out).
Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good approach is to choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and that are common, while avoiding the rejected ones (R, A, I).

Possible words ending with ""SE"": Many words fit _ _ _ S E, such as:
- HOUSE
- MOUSE
- GOOSE
- LOUSE
- NOISE ... but I is eliminated, so not NOISE.
Words without R, A, I and ending with SE: HOUSE, MOUSE, LOUSE, but LOUSE is obscure? Let's think of more common ones.

Also, we can have words like PURSE, but R is eliminated. Or CAUSE, but A is eliminated. So avoid those.

Other options:
- LOOSE: but has O and we can test O? However, LOOSE has two O's, which might be useful? Also, it has L and O which we haven't tried.
- But note: LOOSE has the pattern: L O O S E -> which would be ? ? ? S E, so the fourth and fifth are S and E. So yes, LOOSE ends with SE? No: L O O S E -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E. Yes.

But the word LOOSE has two O's. We don't know if O is in the word. Similarly, we can try other words.

Another common one: MOUSE -> M O U S E

Let's list words ending in SE that avoid R, A, I:
  HOUSE, MOUSE, LOUSE, GOOSE, POISE (but I is out), etc.
But LOUSE and GOOSE have repeated O? Actually, GOOSE: G O O S E -> ends with SE, and has O.

But since we are only fixing the last two, we can choose any word with any first three letters that are not R, A, I.

Our goal is to test new letters. We have not tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, I, S, E; note S and E are already in the word, but we don't know about other positions).

We know S and E are in the word. But we don't know if there are other S's or E's? The feedback for the first guess told us that R, A, I are absent, and S and E are present and in the correct positions.

In the secret word, there might be duplicate S's or E's? We don't know, but so far we only have one S and one E known.

We should test letters that are common. Let me think of high-frequency letters in English that we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

So a good word would have T, O, or N in the first positions.

We can try words like:
  CLOSE: but has S again and we know S is in position 4. Also, CLOSE ends with SE? C L O S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> perfect pattern.

But note: we already have S in position 4, so we don't need to test S again? Actually, we are keeping S and E fixed. So CLOSE would be testing C, L, O in the first three positions.

However, in CLOSE, we are using S in position 4, which we know is correct, so that's fine. But we are also using O which is new.

Similarly, another word: THOSE -> T H O S E -> ends with SE? T H O S E -> positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> also matches.

But THOSE has E at the end, which we know, and S in the fourth, so we are testing T, H, O.

However, E is at the fifth? Yes.

But let's compare with HOUSE, MOUSE, etc.

What about the word ""MOUSE"": M O U S E -> we test M, O, U.

We must avoid words with R, A, I. CLOSE, THOSE, HOUSE, MOUSE are fine.

Which one is best? Since we want to test as many new letters as possible without repeating (to maximize information), and avoid known absent letters.

Since S and E are already placed, they are confirmed, so including them again doesn't hurt but doesn't test new letters either. But we are forced to include them to maintain the correct positions.

Therefore, for the first three positions, we should focus on using letters we haven't tested: so in CLOSE, we test C, L, O. In THOSE, we test T, H, O. In MOUSE, we test M, O, U.

Each uses three letters: one each.

We haven't tested any of these letters.

But let me check frequency: T, O, L, C, H, M, U are all common.

I think either is fine. Perhaps choose one that has common letters.

Another idea: since we know two letters are at the end, and the word is _ _ _ S E, we can choose a word that uses a vowel in the middle because the first word ""RAISE"" had a vowel in the second and third positions, but they were absent. Now we know we don't have A and I, so we need to test O and U, etc.

To cover a vowel and common consonants.

I'll choose ""CLOSE"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and L and C are common consonants.

But note: ""CLOSE"" might not be the best because C is less common than T? Actually T is more frequent.

According to letter frequency in English, T is the most common consonant. So a word with T would be better.

Therefore, ""THOSE"" might be a good choice: T is a common letter we haven't tested, and H and O are also useful.

Similarly, ""MOUSE"" has M and U, which are less common than T? T is more common.

Therefore, I think ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate.

Possible words: THOSE, CLOSE, MOUSE, HOUSE, etc.

HOUSE: H O U S E -> tests H, O, U.

But U might be less common.

THOSE: T, H, O.

THOSE uses T which is very common.

Alternatively, we can consider ""POISE"", but I is excluded so not allowed.

Another word: ""TOUSE"" ? Not common. So avoid.

What about ""THESE"": but THESE has two E's and ends with E; however, the pattern must be _ _ _ S E, so THESE is T H E S E? That would be positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E -> but the fourth letter is S and fifth is E, so yes? But note, in THESE: the fourth letter is indeed S? Let's spell: T-H-E-S-E -> so position 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E. But we know from the feedback that the secret word must not contain A, I, R? Also, THESE has E in the third position? We don't know if E appears again? That's possible.

But using THESE: we would be testing T, H, E. But E is already known to be in the fifth position, but maybe there's another E? So it's valid, but note that the feedback might tell us about E in position 3.

But since we already have E at the end, it might be redundant? However, if we use THESE, we are putting E in the third position, so after the word is ""T H E S E"", so third letter E.

In terms of information, this might be good because it tests E in a different position.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was correct. Now, in THESE, we have E in the fifth (which is correct) and we also have E in the third. If the secret word has E only in the fifth, then the E in third might be absent or misplaced? That is, if we get feedback:

- For position 3: E would get a feedback symbol.

This gives us information about duplication.

Similarly, in THOSE, there's no extra E.

Both approaches are valid.

But since we are eliminating letters, testing a new letter might be better than reusing E? Because we know E is present (at the end), but we don't know if there's a second E.

So by testing THESE, we can check if E appears again.

Similarly, THOSE tests three new letters T, H, O.

I think either is acceptable. But since we only have 6 tries and we want fast progress, testing new letters avoids waste.

Testing E again might not be efficient because even if we get feedback for E, it only tells us about duplication, which might be lower probability. Whereas testing a new letter gives us more coverage.

Thus, I prefer THOSE to avoid reusing E too early.

Similarly, words like MENSE, but that might not be common.

So I decide to go with ""THOSE""

But let's confirm: THOSE -> T H O S E

Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E

And we know position 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E.

This tests T, H, O in the first three positions.

And THOSE is a common English word.

Also, it avoids R, A, I.

Therefore, for the second guess, I will guess ""THOSE"".

If we get feedback like:

- If T is correct, then we have T in first.
- If H is correct, and so on.

Now, in terms of the pattern: secret word is _ _ _ S E.

After this, we'll get feedback for T, H, O.

We must return the guessed word in the specified format.

So let me summarize thought process:

We have feedback from RAISE: S and E are correctly placed at positions 4 and 5, and R, A, I are absent.

Thus, the secret word has the form _ _ _ S E and does not contain R, A, I.

For the next guess, keep S in 4th and E in 5th, and guess letters for positions 1,2,3 that we haven't tried, such as T, H, O. Hence ""THOSE"".

Therefore, the guessed word is THOSE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  
- R (x), A (x), I (x), S (✓), E (✓)  
This indicates:  
1. The secret word has 'S' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position.  
2. The letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.  
3. The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ S E.  

For the next guess:  
- I must preserve 'S' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position to maintain the known correct placements.  
- I need to test new letters in the first three positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) to gain more information, avoiding letters R, A, and I since they are eliminated.  
- Focus on common, high-frequency English letters not yet tested, such as T, H, O, N, L, etc., to maximize the potential for useful feedback.  

After considering options ending in ""SE"" with valid English words:  
- ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate because it:  
  - Uses T, H, and O—common, untested letters.  
  - Avoids R, A, I entirely.  
  - Provides full coverage of new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3 (T, H, O in positions 1, 2, 3).  
- Alternatives like ""CLOSE"" (C, L, O) or ""MOUSE"" (M, O, U) were less ideal: T is a more frequent consonant than C or M, making ""THOSE"" a higher-value guess for information gain.  

This guess will clarify the presence/position of T, H, and O, helping to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.  

<guess>THOSE</guess>",THOSE,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter in ""RAISE"", which corresponds to the 4th position being S).
- E is also in the correct position (fifth letter, so the word ends with E).
- R, A, I are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
1. The fourth letter as S.
2. The fifth letter as E.
3. It does not contain R, A, or I.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

We have to keep in mind that the word does not have R, A, or I. Also, the letters in positions 1, 2, and 3 are unknown and must not be R, A, or I.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Try different letters that are common in 5-letter words, avoiding R, A, I.
- Since S and E are already confirmed in their positions, we don't need to change them. However, note that the feedback told us S and E are correct, so in the next guess we should keep S in the 4th position and E in the 5th position to preserve what we know and test new letters in the first three positions.

Therefore, the next guess should be of the form: ? ? ? S E

Possible words ending with ""SE"": Many words fit _ _ _ S E, such as:
- HOUSE
- MOUSE
- GOOSE
- LOUSE
- NOISE ... but I is eliminated, so not NOISE.
Words without R, A, I and ending with SE: HOUSE, MOUSE, LOUSE, but LOUSE is obscure? Let's think of more common ones.

Also, we can have words like PURSE, but R is eliminated. Or CAUSE, but A is eliminated. So avoid those.

Other options:
- LOOSE: but has O and we can test O? However, LOOSE has two O's, which might be useful? Also, it has L and O which we haven't tried.
- But note: LOOSE has the pattern: L O O S E -> which would be ? ? ? S E, so the fourth and fifth are S and E. So yes, LOOSE ends with SE? No: L O O S E -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E. Yes.

But the word LOOSE has two O's. We don't know if O is in the word. Similarly, we can try other words.

Another common one: MOUSE -> M O U S E

Let's list words ending in SE that avoid R, A, I:
  HOUSE, MOUSE, LOUSE, GOOSE, POISE (but I is out), etc.
But LOUSE and GOOSE have repeated O? Actually, GOOSE: G O O S E -> ends with SE, and has O.

But since we are only fixing the last two, we can choose any word with any first three letters that are not R, A, I.

Our goal is to test new letters. We have not tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, I, S, E; note S and E are already in the word, but we don't know about other positions).

We know S and E are in the word. But we don't know if there are other S's or E's? The feedback for the first guess told us that R, A, I are absent, and S and E are present and in the correct positions.

In the secret word, there might be duplicate S's or E's? We don't know, but so far we only have one S and one E known.

We should test letters that are common. Let me think of high-frequency letters in English that we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

So a good word would have T, O, or N in the first positions.

We can try words like:
  CLOSE: but has S again and we know S is in position 4. Also, CLOSE ends with SE? C L O S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> perfect pattern.

But note: we already have S in position 4, so we don't need to test S again? Actually, we are keeping S and E fixed. So CLOSE would be testing C, L, O in the first three positions.

However, in CLOSE, we are using S in position 4, which we know is correct, so that's fine. But we are also using O which is new.

Similarly, another word: THOSE -> T H O S E -> ends with SE? T H O S E -> positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> also matches.

But THOSE has E at the end, which we know, and S in the fourth, so we are testing T, H, O.

However, E is at the fifth? Yes.

But let's compare with HOUSE, MOUSE, etc.

What about the word ""MOUSE"": M O U S E -> we test M, O, U.

We must avoid words with R, A, I. CLOSE, THOSE, HOUSE, MOUSE are fine.

Which one is best? Since we want to test as many new letters as possible without repeating (to maximize information), and avoid known absent letters.

Since S and E are already placed, they are confirmed, so including them again doesn't hurt but doesn't test new letters either. But we are forced to include them to maintain the correct positions.

Therefore, for the first three positions, we should focus on using letters we haven't tested: so in CLOSE, we test C, L, O. In THOSE, we test T, H, O. In MOUSE, we test M, O, U.

Each uses three letters: one each.

We haven't tested any of these letters.

But let me check frequency: T, O, L, C, H, M, U are all common.

I think either is fine. Perhaps choose one that has common letters.

Another idea: since we know two letters are at the end, and the word is _ _ _ S E, we can choose a word that uses a vowel in the middle because the first word ""RAISE"" had a vowel in the second and third positions, but they were absent. Now we know we don't have A and I, so we need to test O and U, etc.

To cover a vowel and common consonants.

I'll choose ""CLOSE"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and L and C are common consonants.

But note: ""CLOSE"" might not be the best because C is less common than T? Actually T is more frequent.

According to letter frequency in English, T is the most common consonant. So a word with T would be better.

Therefore, ""THOSE"" might be a good choice: T is a common letter we haven't tested, and H and O are also useful.

Similarly, ""MOUSE"" has M and U, which are less common than T? T is more common.

Therefore, I think ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate.

Possible words: THOSE, CLOSE, MOUSE, HOUSE, etc.

HOUSE: H O U S E -> tests H, O, U.

But U might be less common.

THOSE: T, H, O.

THOSE uses T which is very common.

Alternatively, we can consider ""POISE"", but I is excluded so not allowed.

Another word: ""TOUSE"" ? Not common. So avoid.

What about ""THESE"": but THESE has two E's and ends with E; however, the pattern must be _ _ _ S E, so THESE is T H E S E? That would be positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E -> but the fourth letter is S and fifth is E, so yes? But note, in THESE: the fourth letter is indeed S? Let's spell: T-H-E-S-E -> so position 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E. But we know from the feedback that the secret word must not contain A, I, R? Also, THESE has E in the third position? We don't know if E appears again? That's possible.

But using THESE: we would be testing T, H, E. But E is already known to be in the fifth position, but maybe there's another E? So it's valid, but note that the feedback might tell us about E in position 3.

But since we already have E at the end, it might be redundant? However, if we use THESE, we are putting E in the third position, so after the word is ""T H E S E"", so third letter E.

In terms of information, this might be good because it tests E in a different position.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was correct. Now, in THESE, we have E in the fifth (which is correct) and we also have E in the third. If the secret word has E only in the fifth, then the E in third might be absent or misplaced? That is, if we get feedback:

- For position 3: E would get a feedback symbol.

This gives us information about duplication.

Similarly, in THOSE, there's no extra E.

Both approaches are valid.

But since we are eliminating letters, testing a new letter might be better than reusing E? Because we know E is present (at the end), but we don't know if there's a second E.

So by testing THESE, we can check if E appears again.

Similarly, THOSE tests three new letters T, H, O.

I think either is acceptable. But since we only have 6 tries and we want fast progress, testing new letters avoids waste.

Testing E again might not be efficient because even if we get feedback for E, it only tells us about duplication, which might be lower probability. Whereas testing a new letter gives us more coverage.

Thus, I prefer THOSE to avoid reusing E too early.

Similarly, words like MENSE, but that might not be common.

So I decide to go with ""THOSE""

But let's confirm: THOSE -> T H O S E

Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E

And we know position 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E.

This tests T, H, O in the first three positions.

And THOSE is a common English word.

Also, it avoids R, A, I.

Therefore, for the second guess, I will guess ""THOSE"".

If we get feedback like:

- If T is correct, then we have T in first.
- If H is correct, and so on.

Now, in terms of the pattern: secret word is _ _ _ S E.

After this, we'll get feedback for T, H, O.

We must return the guessed word in the specified format.

So let me summarize thought process:

We have feedback from RAISE: S and E are correctly placed at positions 4 and 5, and R, A, I are absent.

Thus, the secret word has the form _ _ _ S E and does not contain R, A, I.

For the next guess, keep S in 4th and E in 5th, and guess letters for positions 1,2,3 that we haven't tried, such as T, H, O. Hence ""THOSE"".

Therefore, the guessed word is THOSE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  
- R (x), A (x), I (x), S (✓), E (✓)  
This indicates:  
1. The secret word has 'S' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position.  
2. The letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.  
3. The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ S E.  

For the next guess:  
- I must preserve 'S' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position to maintain the known correct placements.  
- I need to test new letters in the first three positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) to gain more information, avoiding letters R, A, and I since they are eliminated.  
- Focus on common, high-frequency English letters not yet tested, such as T, H, O, N, L, etc., to maximize the potential for useful feedback.  

After considering options ending in ""SE"" with valid English words:  
- ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate because it:  
  - Uses T, H, and O—common, untested letters.  
  - Avoids R, A, I entirely.  
  - Provides full coverage of new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3 (T, H, O in positions 1, 2, 3).  
- Alternatives like ""CLOSE"" (C, L, O) or ""MOUSE"" (M, O, U) were less ideal: T is a more frequent consonant than C or M, making ""THOSE"" a higher-value guess for information gain.  

This guess will clarify the presence/position of T, H, and O, helping to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.",Guess 2: THOSE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior feedback, it's best to choose a word with common letters and a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.). A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let's consider ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also good but less common. However, I'll choose ""RAISE"" for this first guess.

Word: RAISE
R, A, I, S, E are all common.

After submitting ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell us which letters are present and where. This will help narrow down the possibilities.

But since this is the first guess, we don't have feedback yet. So we just pick a word we think is good.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Note: The response format requires the thought process and then the guess in the specified tags.I'm making my first guess without any prior feedback. The goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common vowels and consonants. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two frequent consonants (R, S), covering letters that often appear in English words. This will help identify correct, misplaced, or absent letters efficiently, setting up better guesses for subsequent turns.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter in ""RAISE"", which corresponds to the 4th position being S).
- E is also in the correct position (fifth letter, so the word ends with E).
- R, A, I are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
1. The fourth letter as S.
2. The fifth letter as E.
3. It does not contain R, A, or I.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

We have to keep in mind that the word does not have R, A, or I. Also, the letters in positions 1, 2, and 3 are unknown and must not be R, A, or I.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Try different letters that are common in 5-letter words, avoiding R, A, I.
- Since S and E are already confirmed in their positions, we don't need to change them. However, note that the feedback told us S and E are correct, so in the next guess we should keep S in the 4th position and E in the 5th position to preserve what we know and test new letters in the first three positions.

Therefore, the next guess should be of the form: ? ? ? S E

We need to choose the first three letters. We have eliminated R, A, I. Let's consider other common letters.

Common consonants and vowels (without A and I, so using E? But we already have E at the end, and we don't know yet if there's another E). We can use vowels O, U and consonants like T, N, L, etc.

We also want to maximize information: test letters that we haven't checked and are frequent.

Remaining vowels we haven't tested: O, U (since A and I are out).
Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good approach is to choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and that are common, while avoiding the rejected ones (R, A, I).

Possible words ending with ""SE"": Many words fit _ _ _ S E, such as:
- HOUSE
- MOUSE
- GOOSE
- LOUSE
- NOISE ... but I is eliminated, so not NOISE.
Words without R, A, I and ending with SE: HOUSE, MOUSE, LOUSE, but LOUSE is obscure? Let's think of more common ones.

Also, we can have words like PURSE, but R is eliminated. Or CAUSE, but A is eliminated. So avoid those.

Other options:
- LOOSE: but has O and we can test O? However, LOOSE has two O's, which might be useful? Also, it has L and O which we haven't tried.
- But note: LOOSE has the pattern: L O O S E -> which would be ? ? ? S E, so the fourth and fifth are S and E. So yes, LOOSE ends with SE? No: L O O S E -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E. Yes.

But the word LOOSE has two O's. We don't know if O is in the word. Similarly, we can try other words.

Another common one: MOUSE -> M O U S E

Let's list words ending in SE that avoid R, A, I:
  HOUSE, MOUSE, LOUSE, GOOSE, POISE (but I is out), etc.
But LOUSE and GOOSE have repeated O? Actually, GOOSE: G O O S E -> ends with SE, and has O.

But since we are only fixing the last two, we can choose any word with any first three letters that are not R, A, I.

Our goal is to test new letters. We have not tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, I, S, E; note S and E are already in the word, but we don't know about other positions).

We know S and E are in the word. But we don't know if there are other S's or E's? The feedback for the first guess told us that R, A, I are absent, and S and E are present and in the correct positions.

In the secret word, there might be duplicate S's or E's? We don't know, but so far we only have one S and one E known.

We should test letters that are common. Let me think of high-frequency letters in English that we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

So a good word would have T, O, or N in the first positions.

We can try words like:
  CLOSE: but has S again and we know S is in position 4. Also, CLOSE ends with SE? C L O S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> perfect pattern.

But note: we already have S in position 4, so we don't need to test S again? Actually, we are keeping S and E fixed. So CLOSE would be testing C, L, O in the first three positions.

However, in CLOSE, we are using S in position 4, which we know is correct, so that's fine. But we are also using O which is new.

Similarly, another word: THOSE -> T H O S E -> ends with SE? T H O S E -> positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> also matches.

But THOSE has E at the end, which we know, and S in the fourth, so we are testing T, H, O.

However, E is at the fifth? Yes.

But let's compare with HOUSE, MOUSE, etc.

What about the word ""MOUSE"": M O U S E -> we test M, O, U.

We must avoid words with R, A, I. CLOSE, THOSE, HOUSE, MOUSE are fine.

Which one is best? Since we want to test as many new letters as possible without repeating (to maximize information), and avoid known absent letters.

Since S and E are already placed, they are confirmed, so including them again doesn't hurt but doesn't test new letters either. But we are forced to include them to maintain the correct positions.

Therefore, for the first three positions, we should focus on using letters we haven't tested: so in CLOSE, we test C, L, O. In THOSE, we test T, H, O. In MOUSE, we test M, O, U.

Each uses three letters: one each.

We haven't tested any of these letters.

But let me check frequency: T, O, L, C, H, M, U are all common.

I think either is fine. Perhaps choose one that has common letters.

Another idea: since we know two letters are at the end, and the word is _ _ _ S E, we can choose a word that uses a vowel in the middle because the first word ""RAISE"" had a vowel in the second and third positions, but they were absent. Now we know we don't have A and I, so we need to test O and U, etc.

To cover a vowel and common consonants.

I'll choose ""CLOSE"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and L and C are common consonants.

But note: ""CLOSE"" might not be the best because C is less common than T? Actually T is more frequent.

According to letter frequency in English, T is the most common consonant. So a word with T would be better.

Therefore, ""THOSE"" might be a good choice: T is a common letter we haven't tested, and H and O are also useful.

Similarly, ""MOUSE"" has M and U, which are less common than T? T is more common.

Therefore, I think ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate.

Possible words: THOSE, CLOSE, MOUSE, HOUSE, etc.

HOUSE: H O U S E -> tests H, O, U.

But U might be less common.

THOSE: T, H, O.

THOSE uses T which is very common.

Alternatively, we can consider ""POISE"", but I is excluded so not allowed.

Another word: ""TOUSE"" ? Not common. So avoid.

What about ""THESE"": but THESE has two E's and ends with E; however, the pattern must be _ _ _ S E, so THESE is T H E S E? That would be positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E -> but the fourth letter is S and fifth is E, so yes? But note, in THESE: the fourth letter is indeed S? Let's spell: T-H-E-S-E -> so position 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E. But we know from the feedback that the secret word must not contain A, I, R? Also, THESE has E in the third position? We don't know if E appears again? That's possible.

But using THESE: we would be testing T, H, E. But E is already known to be in the fifth position, but maybe there's another E? So it's valid, but note that the feedback might tell us about E in position 3.

But since we already have E at the end, it might be redundant? However, if we use THESE, we are putting E in the third position, so after the word is ""T H E S E"", so third letter E.

Thus, I prefer THOSE to avoid reusing E too early.

Similarly, words like MENSE, but that might not be common.

So I decide to go with ""THOSE""

But let's confirm: THOSE -> T H O S E

Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E

And we know position 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E.

This tests T, H, O in the first three positions.

And THOSE is a common English word.

Also, it avoids R, A, I.

Therefore, for the second guess, I will guess ""THOSE"".

Also, CLOSE ends with SE? C L O S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> perfect pattern.\n\nBut note: we already have S in position 4, so we don\'t need to test S again? Actually, we are keeping S and E fixed. So CLOSE would be testing C, L, O in the first three positions.\n\nHowever, in CLOSE, we are using S in position 4, which we know is correct, so that\'s fine. But we are also using O which is new.\n\nSimilarly, another word: THOSE -> T H O S E -> ends with SE? T H O S E -> positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E -> also matches.\n\nBut THOSE has E at the end, which we know, and S in the fourth, so we are testing T, H, O.\n\nHowever, E is at the fifth? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s compare with HOUSE, MOUSE, etc.\n\nWhat about the word ""MOUSE"": M O U S E -> we test M, O, U.\n\nWe must avoid words with R, A, I. CLOSE, THOSE, HOUSE, MOUSE are fine.\n\nWhich one is best? Since we want to test as many new letters as possible without repeating (to maximize information), and avoid known absent letters.\n\nSince S and E are already placed, they are confirmed, so including them again doesn\'t hurt but doesn\'t test new letters either. But we are forced to include them to maintain the correct positions.\n\nTherefore, for the first three positions, we should focus on using letters we haven\'t tested: so in CLOSE, we test C, L, O. In THOSE, we test T, H, O. In MOUSE, we test M, O, U.\n\nEach uses three letters: one each.\n\nWe haven\'t tested any of these letters.\n\nBut let me check frequency: T, O, L, C, H, M, U are all common.\n\nI think either is fine. Perhaps choose one that has common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know two letters are at the end, and the word is _ _ _ S E, we can choose a word that uses a vowel in the middle because the first word ""RAISE"" had a vowel in the second and third positions, but they were absent. Now we know we don\'t have A and I, so we need to test O and U, etc.\n\nTo cover a vowel and common consonants.\n\nI\'ll choose ""CLOSE"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and L and C are common consonants.\n\nBut note: ""CLOSE"" might not be the best because C is less common than T? Actually T is more frequent.\n\nAccording to letter frequency in English, T is the most common consonant. So a word with T would be better.\n\nTherefore, ""THOSE"" might be a good choice: T is a common letter we haven\'t tested, and H and O are also useful.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOUSE"" has M and U, which are less common than T? T is more common.\n\nTherefore, I think ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate.\n\nPossible words: THOSE, CLOSE, MOUSE, HOUSE, etc.\n\nHOUSE: H O U S E -> tests H, O, U.\n\nBut U might be less common.\n\nTHOSE: T, H, O.\n\nTHOSE uses T which is very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider ""POISE"", but I is excluded so not allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""TOUSE"" ? Not common. So avoid.\n\nWhat about ""THESE"": but THESE has two E\'s and ends with E; however, the pattern must be _ _ _ S E, so THESE is T H E S E? That would be positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E -> but the fourth letter is S and fifth is E, so yes? But note, in THESE: the fourth letter is indeed S? Let\'s spell: T-H-E-S-E -> so position 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:E. But we know from the feedback that the secret word must not contain A, I, R? Also, THESE has E in the third position? We don\'t know if E appears again? That\'s possible.\n\nBut using THESE: we would be testing T, H, E. But E is already known to be in the fifth position, but maybe there\'s another E? So it\'s valid, but note that the feedback might tell us about E in position 3.\n\nBut since we already have E at the end, it might be redundant? However, if we use THESE, we are putting E in the third position, so after the word is ""T H E S E"", so third letter E.\n\nIn terms of information, this might be good because it tests E in a different position.\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was correct. Now, in THESE, we have E in the fifth (which is correct) and we also have E in the third. If the secret word has E only in the fifth, then the E in third might be absent or misplaced? That is, if we get feedback:\n\n- For position 3: E would get a feedback symbol.\n\nThis gives us information about duplication.\n\nSimilarly, in THOSE, there\'s no extra E.\n\nBoth approaches are valid.\n\nBut since we are eliminating letters, testing a new letter might be better than reusing E? Because we know E is present (at the end), but we don\'t know if there\'s a second E.\n\nSo by testing THESE, we can check if E appears again.\n\nSimilarly, THOSE tests three new letters T, H, O.\n\nI think either is acceptable. But since we only have 6 tries and we want fast progress, testing new letters avoids waste.\n\nTesting E again might not be efficient because even if we get feedback for E, it only tells us about duplication, which might be lower probability. Whereas testing a new letter gives us more coverage.\n\nThus, I prefer THOSE to avoid reusing E too early.\n\nSimilarly, words like MENSE, but that might not be common.\n\nSo I decide to go with ""THOSE""\n\nBut let\'s confirm: THOSE -> T H O S E\n\nPositions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E\n\nAnd we know position 4 and 5 are fixed as S and E.\n\nThis tests T, H, O in the first three positions.\n\nAnd THOSE is a common English word.\n\nAlso, it avoids R, A, I.\n\nTherefore, for the second guess, I will guess ""THOSE"".\n\nIf we get feedback like:\n\n- If T is correct, then we have T in first.\n- If H is correct, and so on.\n\nNow, in terms of the pattern: secret word is _ _ _ S E.\n\nAfter this, we\'ll get feedback for T, H, O.\n\nWe must return the guessed word in the specified format.\n\nSo let me summarize thought process:\n\nWe have feedback from RAISE: S and E are correctly placed at positions 4 and 5, and R, A, I are absent.\n\nThus, the secret word has the form _ _ _ S E and does not contain R, A, I.\n\nFor the next guess, keep S in 4th and E in 5th, and guess letters for positions 1,2,3 that we haven\'t tried, such as T, H, O. Hence ""THOSE"".\n\nTherefore, the guessed word is THOSE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  \n- R (x), A (x), I (x), S (✓), E (✓)  \nThis indicates:  \n1. The secret word has \'S\' in the 4th position and \'E\' in the 5th position.  \n2. The letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.  \n3. The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ S E.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- I must preserve \'S\' in the 4th position and \'E\' in the 5th position to maintain the known correct placements.  \n- I need to test new letters in the first three positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) to gain more information, avoiding letters R, A, and I since they are eliminated.  \n- Focus on common, high-frequency English letters not yet tested, such as T, H, O, N, L, etc., to maximize the potential for useful feedback.  \n\nAfter considering options ending in ""SE"" with valid English words:  \n- ""THOSE"" is a strong candidate because it:  \n  - Uses T, H, and O—common, untested letters.  \n  - Avoids R, A, I entirely.  \n  - Provides full coverage of new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3 (T, H, O in positions 1, 2, 3).  \n- Alternatives like ""CLOSE"" (C, L, O) or ""MOUSE"" (M, O, U) were less ideal: T is a more frequent consonant than C or M, making ""THOSE"" a higher-value guess for information gain.  \n\nThis guess will clarify the presence/position of T, H, and O, helping to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>THOSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 2: THOSE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. RAISE: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓) → The secret word has S in position 4, E in position 5, and does not contain R, A, or I.
2. THOSE: T(✓) H(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓) → Now we know:
   - T is correct and in position 1 (since it got a ✓).
   - H is not in the word at all (x).
   - O is not in the word at all (x).
   - S and E are confirmed again in positions 4 and 5.

Therefore, what we know about the secret word:
- It is of the form: T _ _ S E  (since T is in position 1, S in 4, E in 5).
- It does not contain: R, A, I, H, O.
- Positions 2 and 3 are unknown but must be letters not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: R, A, I, H, O.

We need to guess the second and third letters.

The pattern is: T ? ? S E

Now, we need to choose letters for positions 2 and 3 that are common in English, avoiding the excluded ones.

We have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E (from guess 1) and T, H, O, S, E (from guess 2). S and E are repeated, so effectively we have tested: R, A, I, S, E, T, H, O.

Therefore, untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since there are two positions to fill, we need a word of the form T _ _ S E. This pattern must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible words that fit T _ _ S E and avoid excluded letters:

Position 2 and 3 can be various combinations.

Common words:
- TENSE: T E N S E → But E is already used? We know E is at the end, but position 2 E? Possible if there is another E? However, we have E at position 5, and we don't know if E appears elsewhere. But we haven't tested E in another position.
- But note: in TENSE, position 2 is E. This might be a candidate.

But excluded? E is not excluded; we know E is in the word only at position 5? Actually we don't know about duplicate E's. So E could appear multiple times.

Also, we haven't tested E in position 2. Similarly, N is a new letter.

But let's consider the exclusions: do we exclude E? No, because E is in the word, we just haven't tested it elsewhere.

We should avoid including H, O since they are excluded. E is allowed.

But what about: TENSE → letters: T, E, N, S, E. 
- T(known in position 1), S(position 4), E(position 5). So we would be testing E and N in positions 2 and 3.

Similarly, other words:
- TUMSE? Not a word.
- TASSE? Not a word? Actually, tasse is a word, but it has A? A is excluded? Yes, A is excluded.
- TUSSE? Not common.
- TWOSE? Not common.

Another word: PURSE? But we have positions: T required at 1? Pattern is T _ _ S E, so first letter T. PURSE starts with P, not T.

What about:
- TIMES? But I is excluded → I not allowed.
- Therefore, words with A, I, R, H, O are out.

Another common word: ""TENSE"" seems good. Its letters: T, E, N, S, E.

- T: position 1, we know is correct.
- E: new position 2? 
- N: new position 3?
- S: position 4, correct.
- E: position 5, correct.

But we are putting E at position 2 and we know E is at position 5. If the word has only one E, then E at position 2 might not be present? But we don't know.

By guessing TENSE, we test:
- If E is in the word at another position? Specifically, position 2.
- Also, N at position 3.

Alternative: ""TUNES""? But TUNES is T U N E S? Does not fit pattern T _ _ S E; it ends with E S? No: T U N E S → positions:1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S → but we know position 4 must be S, so TUNES has E at 4 and S at 5, which contradicts our requirement because S must be at 4 and E at 5? So TUNES does not match the pattern.

Pattern is fixed: T X Y S E, so the word must end with ""SE"".

Other possibilities: 
- ""TRUCE""? But T R U C E? Pattern doesn't match, since positions 4 and 5 should be S and E, but here U,C,E. Also R is excluded.
- ""TABLE""? No A and pattern not.

Back to TENSE: it fits T _ _ S E? Let's spell: T-E-N-S-E → position 1:T, 2:E, 3:N, 4:S, 5:E → so yes, it matches the pattern T ? ? S E.

Similarly, ""TESTS""? But T E S T S → positions 1:T, 2:E, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S → this does not have S at position 4? Position 4 is T? And ends with S, not E? So not.

Another word: ""TEPID""? Not ending with SE.

So TENSE is acceptable.

Is there a word ""TONES""? But O is excluded and pattern is T O N E S? Which is T at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5 → not matching because we need S at 4 and E at 5. TONES has E at 4 and S at 5? Then it would be T O N E S → positions:1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S → so 4 is E, but we need position 4 to be S? And position 5 E? So mismatch.

No, we need position 4=S and 5=E.

Only words ending with ""SE"", but specifically with T as first letter: so ""T__SE"".

Other than TENSE, what are common words?
- ""TORSE""? But O and R excluded? T O R S E → O and R excluded? R is already eliminated in first guess. And O excluded now. Therefore invalid.
- ""TAISE""? Not a word; also A excluded.
- ""TEASE""? T E A S E → but A is excluded? A is not allowed since first guess had A(x).

TEASE has A → excluded.

- ""TICSE""? Not a word.
- ""TOISE""? Excluded letters? O and I? O excluded, I excluded. Invalid.
- ""TRUCE""? Not pattern.

Therefore, TENSE seems a good candidate.

Other option: ""TULSE""? Not a word.

""TANSE""? Not common, A excluded? Yes.

Perhaps ""TENSE"" is one of the few words fitting.

What about ""TWOSE""? Not common.

""TYRES""? But R excluded? Y and R? T Y R E S → ends with S, but position 4 is E? Not SE at end? Also R excluded.

So TENSE appears solid.

With TENSE, we test E in position 2 and N in position 3.

If E is not in position 2, we will get feedback accordingly: either (x) or (-) if misplaced.

Similarly for N.

But note, E is already known to be in the word (at position 5), so if E at position 2 gets (-), it means E is elsewhere? But we know it's at 5. So ✓ for E at 5? Actually, position 5 E is fixed. But E in position 2 would be separate.

For example, if E is not in position 2 but is in the word, it might show -, but since we know it's at 5, it should be consistent.

Actually, no conflict: a letter can be correct at one position and misplaced elsewhere. But if we put E at position 2, and the secret word has E only at position 5, then E at position 2 is missing? So it should get (x) for position 2? Because E is not at position 2, even though E is in the word at position 5.

The feedback: if the letter is in the word but not at that position, it gets (-). If not in word at all, (x).

But E is in the word (at position 5), so if I put E at position 2, and the secret word does not have E at position 2, but has E elsewhere (like position 5), then position 2 should get (-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.

That's valuable information because it tells us that E is only at position 5 and not elsewhere? No: if we put E at position 2 and get (-), it only confirms E is elsewhere, which we already know.

But if we put E at position 2 and get (x), that means E is not present at position 2, but we know it has to be at position 5. Actually, (x) for position 2 would not occur if E is elsewhere, because (-) indicates it is present elsewhere. Only if E were not in the word at all would it be (x), but we know E is in the word so it should not be (x) for E at any position? More carefully:

- If the letter is present somewhere else, even if not at this position, it is (-).
- (x) only if the letter is not present at all in the word.

Therefore, since E is known to be in the word, any guess placing E at a position where it shouldn't be will get either (✓) if correct, or (-) if misplaced.

Similarly for S: we know S at position 4, but if we guess S elsewhere, it would get (-) if present.

In our case, for TENSE:
- Position 1: T, we know should be ✓
- Position 2: E → if correct, ✓; if incorrect but E is in word, it should be (-); but since we have E at position 5, it will be (-) unless position 2 is also E? But position 2 E is different from position 5 E? For a secret word like TENSE, it has two E's? Or if not, like something else?

Actually, for the secret word: if it has E only at position 5, then putting E at position 2 should give (-) because E is in the word, not at position 2.

Similarly, if the secret word has E at multiple positions, like TENSE, it could be.

But by guessing TENSE, we are testing:
- Position 2: if E is correct? Or not.
- Position 3: N, which may be correct or not, or misplaced.

Alternative: instead of testing E again, we could test two entirely new letters? But what words fit T _ _ S E?

For example, ""TRIMS""? But R and I excluded? Invalid.

""TUNES"" → T U N E S → pattern T U N E S? Position 4 is E, but we need S at 4? Has position 4=E and 5=S, not what we want.

We need position 4=S and 5=E.

So TENSE seems one of few.

Another word: ""TESS""? Too short.

""TYRES""? Not.

""TUFTS""? Not pattern.

Perhaps ""TWSRE""? Not a word.

Therefore, TENSE is a valid and common word.

Another candidate: ""TOUSE"" but O excluded.

Or ""TWOSE""? Not common.

I think TENSE is the best.

But let's consider ""TAWSE""? But A excluded? Also, TAWSE might be obsolete.

So, we proceed with TENSE.

Therefore, third guess: TENSE.

After this, we'll get feedback on positions 2 and 3.

Guessed word: TENSE.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**:  
     - The secret word contains 'S' in position 4 and 'E' in position 5.  
     - The letters R, A, and I are **absent** from the word.  
     - Resulting pattern: `_ _ _ S E`.  
   - **Guess 2: THOSE → T(✓) H(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)**:  
     - 'T' is correct and in position 1.  
     - 'H' and 'O' are **absent** from the word.  
     - 'S' (position 4) and 'E' (position 5) are reconfirmed.  
     - Updated pattern: `T _ _ S E`.  
   - **Cumulative Insights**:  
     - Secret word pattern: `T ? ? S E`.  
     - Excluded letters (not in the word at all): **R, A, I, H, O**.  
     - Confirmed letters: **T (position 1), S (position 4), E (position 5)**.  

2. **Determine Constraints for Next Guess**:  
   - The next guess must be a valid English word fitting `T _ _ S E`.  
   - Positions 2 and 3 need to be filled with new, untested letters (since R, A, I, H, O are eliminated).  
   - Tested letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, T, H, O.  
   - Untested possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Goal: Prioritize high-frequency English letters (e.g., N, L, C, U) to maximize information gain.  

3. **Identify Valid Word Candidates**:  
   - Common words fitting `T ? ? S E`:  
     - **TENSE** (`T E N S E`): Tests 'E' in position 2 (could be misplaced if E only exists in position 5) and 'N' in position 3.  
     - Other options like ""TABLE"" (contains A, excluded) or ""TONES"" (contains O, excluded) are invalid. Less common words (e.g., ""TUESE"") are unfavorable.  
   - Why ""TENSE""?  
     - It fits the pattern `T _ _ S E` with `E` and `N`, both common and untested.  
     - Provides critical feedback:  
       - If 'E' in position 2 is `✓`, we know the word starts with ""TE..SE"".  
       - If 'E' gets `-`, it confirms E is misplaced (though we know it exists in position 5).  
       - If 'N' is `✓`, `-`, or `x`, it reveals much about position 3.  
     - Balances letter frequency and word commonness, accelerating deduction.  

4. **Final Decision**:  
   - **Next Guess: TENSE**.  
   - Letters tested: E (new position), N (new).  

This strategy efficiently narrows possibilities while using untested letters to resolve positions 2 and 3.

<guess>TENSE</guess>",TENSE,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. RAISE: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓) → The secret word has S in position 4, E in position 5, and does not contain R, A, or I.
2. THOSE: T(✓) H(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓) → Now we know:
   - T is correct and in position 1 (since it got a ✓).
   - H is not in the word at all (x).
   - O is not in the word at all (x).
   - S and E are confirmed again in positions 4 and 5.

Therefore, what we know about the secret word:
- It is of the form: T _ _ S E  (since T is in position 1, S in 4, E in 5).
- It does not contain: R, A, I, H, O.
- Positions 2 and 3 are unknown but must be letters not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: R, A, I, H, O.

We need to guess the second and third letters.

The pattern is: T ? ? S E

Now, we need to choose letters for positions 2 and 3 that are common in English, avoiding the excluded ones.

We have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E (from guess 1) and T, H, O, S, E (from guess 2). S and E are repeated, so effectively we have tested: R, A, I, S, E, T, H, O.

Therefore, untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since there are two positions to fill, we need a word of the form T _ _ S E. This pattern must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible words that fit T _ _ S E and avoid excluded letters:

Position 2 and 3 can be various combinations.

Common words:
- TENSE: T E N S E → But E is already used? We know E is at the end, but position 2 E? Possible if there is another E? However, we have E at position 5, and we don't know if E appears elsewhere. But we haven't tested E in another position.
- But note: in TENSE, position 2 is E. This might be a candidate.

But excluded? E is not excluded; we know E is in the word only at position 5? Actually we don't know about duplicate E's. So E could appear multiple times.

Also, we haven't tested E in position 2. Similarly, N is a new letter.

But let's consider the exclusions: do we exclude E? No, because E is in the word, we just haven't tested it elsewhere.

We should avoid including H, O since they are excluded. E is allowed.

But what about: TENSE → letters: T, E, N, S, E. 
- T(known in position 1), S(position 4), E(position 5). So we would be testing E and N in positions 2 and 3.

Similarly, other words:
- TUMSE? Not a word.
- TASSE? Not a word? Actually, tasse is a word, but it has A? A is excluded? Yes, A is excluded.
- TUSSE? Not common.
- TWOSE? Not common.

Another word: PURSE? But we have positions: T required at 1? Pattern is T _ _ S E, so first letter T. PURSE starts with P, not T.

What about:
- TIMES? But I is excluded → I not allowed.
- Therefore, words with A, I, R, H, O are out.

Another common word: ""TENSE"" seems good. Its letters: T, E, N, S, E.

- T: position 1, we know is correct.
- E: new position 2? 
- N: new position 3?
- S: position 4, correct.
- E: position 5, correct.

But we are putting E at position 2 and we know E is at position 5. If the word has only one E, then E at position 2 might not be present? But we don't know.

By guessing TENSE, we test:
- If E is in the word at another position? Specifically, position 2.
- Also, N at position 3.

Alternative: ""TUNES""? But TUNES is T U N E S? Does not fit pattern T _ _ S E; it ends with E S? No: T U N E S → positions:1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S → but we know position 4 must be S, so TUNES has E at 4 and S at 5, which contradicts our requirement because S must be at 4 and E at 5? So TUNES does not match the pattern.

Pattern is fixed: T X Y S E, so the word must end with ""SE"".

Other possibilities: 
- ""TRUCE""? But T R U C E? Pattern doesn't match, since positions 4 and 5 should be S and E, but here U,C,E. Also R is excluded.
- ""TABLE""? No A and pattern not.

Back to TENSE: it fits T _ _ S E? Let's spell: T-E-N-S-E → position 1:T, 2:E, 3:N, 4:S, 5:E → so yes, it matches the pattern T ? ? S E.

Similarly, ""TESTS""? But T E S T S → positions 1:T, 2:E, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S → this does not have S at position 4? Position 4 is T? And ends with S, not E? So not.

Another word: ""TEPID""? Not ending with SE.

So TENSE is acceptable.

Is there a word ""TONES""? But O is excluded and pattern is T O N E S? Which is T at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5 → not matching because we need S at 4 and E at 5. TONES has E at 4 and S at 5? Then it would be T O N E S → positions:1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S → so 4 is E, but we need position 4 to be S? And position 5 E? So mismatch.

No, we need position 4=S and 5=E.

Only words ending with ""SE"", but specifically with T as first letter: so ""T__SE"".

Other than TENSE, what are common words?
- ""TORSE""? But O and R excluded? T O R S E → O and R excluded? R is already eliminated in first guess. And O excluded now. Therefore invalid.
- ""TAISE""? Not a word; also A excluded.
- ""TEASE""? T E A S E → but A is excluded? A is not allowed since first guess had A(x).

TEASE has A → excluded.

- ""TICSE""? Not a word.
- ""TOISE""? Excluded letters? O and I? O excluded, I excluded. Invalid.
- ""TRUCE""? Not pattern.

Therefore, TENSE seems a good candidate.

Other option: ""TULSE""? Not a word.

""TANSE""? Not common, A excluded? Yes.

Perhaps ""TENSE"" is one of the few words fitting.

What about ""TWOSE""? Not common.

""TYRES""? But R excluded? Y and R? T Y R E S → ends with S, but position 4 is E? Not SE at end? Also R excluded.

So TENSE appears solid.

With TENSE, we test E in position 2 and N in position 3.

If E is not in position 2, we will get feedback accordingly: either (x) or (-) if misplaced.

Similarly for N.

But note, E is already known to be in the word (at position 5), so if E at position 2 gets (-), it means E is elsewhere? But we know it's at 5. So ✓ for E at 5? Actually, position 5 E is fixed. But E in position 2 would be separate.

For example, if E is not in position 2 but is in the word, it might show -, but since we know it's at 5, it should be consistent.

Actually, no conflict: a letter can be correct at one position and misplaced elsewhere. But if we put E at position 2, and the secret word has E only at position 5, then E at position 2 is missing? So it should get (x) for position 2? Because E is not at position 2, even though E is in the word at position 5.

The feedback: if the letter is in the word but not at that position, it gets (-). If not in word at all, (x).

But E is in the word (at position 5), so if I put E at position 2, and the secret word does not have E at position 2, but has E elsewhere (like position 5), then position 2 should get (-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.

That's valuable information because it tells us that E is only at position 5 and not elsewhere? No: if we put E at position 2 and get (-), it only confirms E is elsewhere, which we already know.

But if we put E at position 2 and get (x), that means E is not present at position 2, but we know it has to be at position 5. Actually, (x) for position 2 would not occur if E is elsewhere, because (-) indicates it is present elsewhere. Only if E were not in the word at all would it be (x), but we know E is in the word so it should not be (x) for E at any position? More carefully:

- If the letter is present somewhere else, even if not at this position, it is (-).
- (x) only if the letter is not present at all in the word.

Therefore, since E is known to be in the word, any guess placing E at a position where it shouldn't be will get either (✓) if correct, or (-) if misplaced.

Similarly for S: we know S at position 4, but if we guess S elsewhere, it would get (-) if present.

In our case, for TENSE:
- Position 1: T, we know should be ✓
- Position 2: E → if correct, ✓; if incorrect but E is in word, it should be (-); but since we have E at position 5, it will be (-) unless position 2 is also E? But position 2 E is different from position 5 E? For a secret word like TENSE, it has two E's? Or if not, like something else?

Actually, for the secret word: if it has E only at position 5, then putting E at position 2 should give (-) because E is in the word, not at position 2.

Similarly, if the secret word has E at multiple positions, like TENSE, it could be.

But by guessing TENSE, we are testing:
- Position 2: if E is correct? Or not.
- Position 3: N, which may be correct or not, or misplaced.

Alternative: instead of testing E again, we could test two entirely new letters? But what words fit T _ _ S E?

For example, ""TRIMS""? But R and I excluded? Invalid.

""TUNES"" → T U N E S → pattern T U N E S? Position 4 is E, but we need S at 4? Has position 4=E and 5=S, not what we want.

We need position 4=S and 5=E.

So TENSE seems one of few.

Another word: ""TESS""? Too short.

""TYRES""? Not.

""TUFTS""? Not pattern.

Perhaps ""TWSRE""? Not a word.

Therefore, TENSE is a valid and common word.

Another candidate: ""TOUSE"" but O excluded.

Or ""TWOSE""? Not common.

I think TENSE is the best.

But let's consider ""TAWSE""? But A excluded? Also, TAWSE might be obsolete.

So, we proceed with TENSE.

Therefore, third guess: TENSE.

After this, we'll get feedback on positions 2 and 3.

Guessed word: TENSE.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**:  
     - The secret word contains 'S' in position 4 and 'E' in position 5.  
     - The letters R, A, and I are **absent** from the word.  
     - Resulting pattern: `_ _ _ S E`.  
   - **Guess 2: THOSE → T(✓) H(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)**:  
     - 'T' is correct and in position 1.  
     - 'H' and 'O' are **absent** from the word.  
     - 'S' (position 4) and 'E' (position 5) are reconfirmed.  
     - Updated pattern: `T _ _ S E`.  
   - **Cumulative Insights**:  
     - Secret word pattern: `T ? ? S E`.  
     - Excluded letters (not in the word at all): **R, A, I, H, O**.  
     - Confirmed letters: **T (position 1), S (position 4), E (position 5)**.  

2. **Determine Constraints for Next Guess**:  
   - The next guess must be a valid English word fitting `T _ _ S E`.  
   - Positions 2 and 3 need to be filled with new, untested letters (since R, A, I, H, O are eliminated).  
   - Tested letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, T, H, O.  
   - Untested possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Goal: Prioritize high-frequency English letters (e.g., N, L, C, U) to maximize information gain.  

3. **Identify Valid Word Candidates**:  
   - Common words fitting `T ? ? S E`:  
     - **TENSE** (`T E N S E`): Tests 'E' in position 2 (could be misplaced if E only exists in position 5) and 'N' in position 3.  
     - Other options like ""TABLE"" (contains A, excluded) or ""TONES"" (contains O, excluded) are invalid. Less common words (e.g., ""TUESE"") are unfavorable.  
   - Why ""TENSE""?  
     - It fits the pattern `T _ _ S E` with `E` and `N`, both common and untested.  
     - Provides critical feedback:  
       - If 'E' in position 2 is `✓`, we know the word starts with ""TE..SE"".  
       - If 'E' gets `-`, it confirms E is misplaced (though we know it exists in position 5).  
       - If 'N' is `✓`, `-`, or `x`, it reveals much about position 3.  
     - Balances letter frequency and word commonness, accelerating deduction.  

4. **Final Decision**:  
   - **Next Guess: TENSE**.  
   - Letters tested: E (new position), N (new).  

This strategy efficiently narrows possibilities while using untested letters to resolve positions 2 and 3.",Guess 3: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
