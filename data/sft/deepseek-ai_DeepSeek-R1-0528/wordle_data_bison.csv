We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information gained. 
A good starting word should have common letters and a balanced letter distribution. We also want to avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

Common vowels and consonants: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good starter.

But note: The feedback symbols we are using are:
  ✓ : correct letter and position
  - : letter in word but wrong position
  x : letter not in word

For the first guess, any word is acceptable. Let me choose ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word at all (since they got 'x')
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (since it got '-')

So the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the last position (since we placed it at position 4 in ""crane"", which is the 4th letter? Remember, positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E).

Actually, let's clarify the positions:
""c r a n e""
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not in position 4
Position 5: E (x) -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word has the letter N, and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note that position 5 is ruled out? Actually no: position 5 is E which is absent, but N can be in position 5? Wait no, because N is marked as wrong position meaning that if it were in position 5, then when we put N in position 4, it would have shown as present but in wrong position regardless. However, the feedback doesn't tell us what positions it can be, only that it's not in the position we guessed.

Specifically, we know:
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.
- It does contain N, but not at position 4.

So the word has 5 letters, and one of them is N (at position 1,2,3, or 5). But note: if N were at position 5, then in our guess ""crane"" the last letter E is not N, so that could be possible? Actually, the feedback says the letter N is present and that it is not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2,3, or 5.

But we must also note: the word may have repeated letters? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this game, the rules don't specify, but in general, Wordle allows repeated letters. So we have to consider that.

However, in this feedback we have only one N and it's marked as present but wrong position, so if there were two N's then one might be marked correctly, but we don't have that. So for now, assume one N.

Now, we need to choose a second guess that:
- Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent)
- Must include N (but not in the same position as guess 1? Actually, we know N is not at position 4, so if we put N in a different position, that might be good to test).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has N but in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E and now know C,R,A,E are absent; N is present.

So unused common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

We should try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

Possible vowels: O, U, I (since we already tried A and E and they are not in the word). So the remaining vowels are O, I, U? Actually, Y might also be a vowel.

But let's aim for a word that has N in a different position and includes O and I, and other consonants.

Common starting words: maybe ""POINT""? But that has P,O,I,N,T.

Check: P, O, I, N, T. All are new letters? We have not tried any of these.

We know N is in the word, but not at position 4. If we put N at position 5? Then if the word has N at position 5, we might get a '-' or even a '✓' if it's there? Actually, we can test.

But note: we want to place N in one of the positions it might be: position 1,2,3, or 5.

In ""point"", if we put:
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: I
Position 4: N (but wait, in the first guess we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, so now we are putting N at position 4? That might be a bad idea because we already know position 4 is not N? Actually, we know that the word has N but not at position 4, so using N at position 4 again would be inefficient? Because we already know it shouldn't be there.

Better to put N at a position we haven't tried. So avoid position 4? Actually, we can avoid position 4 for N because we know it's wrong.

In ""point"", if we put N at position 4? That is the same as the first guess? Which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

So consider words like:

- N at position 1: ""n_____"" words, e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NAILS"", ""NOTCH"" but avoid C (not allowed) and R,A,E. 

But we don't know if the word has S, L, etc.

Alternatively, put N at position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"", ""KNOCK"" (but K is new? and avoid C? C is absent so we can't use C). So ""SNOUT"" has S,N,O,U,T? But U and O are vowels.

Similarly, position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" but if we use POINT we put N at position 4? Wait, POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> N at position 4. We know N is not at position 4? So that would be a bad choice? Because we already know position 4 is wrong for N.

But wait, in POINT, N is at position 4. Since we know the word's N is not at position 4, then when we guess POINT and put N at position 4, the feedback should show N as '-' (present but wrong position) again? Because the N we put at 4 is the same as before? Actually, it would tell us that we have an N but it's still not in the correct position? That doesn't give new information about the position? Exactly, we already know N isn't at position 4, so guessing a word with N at position 4 will still give '-' for N, but without any new information about its position.

Therefore, it's better to avoid putting N at position 4 again. We should try N at a new position.

So let's choose a word with N at position 1, or 2, or 3, or 5.

Options:

- Position 1: ""N"" words: such as ""NOISE"" (but E is absent? we must avoid E). So ""NOISE"" is invalid because E is absent? Actually, we must use only letters that are possible? We don't know that E is present? Actually, from feedback, E is absent so we cannot use E. Similarly C,R,A,E are out.

So ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E -> E is absent? So we must not use E? Because the rules say we have to guess a valid English word, but we are allowed to use letters that are not in the target if necessary? Actually, yes, but using an absent letter again doesn't give new information? So better not to use absent letters.

Therefore, for our second guess, we should avoid C,R,A,E since we know they are absent.

We must use N and avoid C,R,A,E.

So possible words: with N at position 1: e.g., 

- ""NINNY""? That has repeats? Also uses N multiple times? But we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically we can try, but let's stick without repeats for now.

Better: ""NODES""? But E and S? E we know is absent? So ""NODES"" uses E which is absent? So the feedback would show E as 'x'. Since E is absent, we don't want to waste a letter position? So we should avoid using any of the absent letters (C,R,A,E).

So we must use letters from the untested set: B,D,H,I,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,Y, and so on.

Word with N at position 1 that doesn't use C,R,A,E:

e.g., ""NOULD""? Not a word. ""NOUNS"" -> that has two N's? Also uses U and S.

Better: ""NOISY"" -> N,O,I,S,Y -> no absent letters? Y is a consonant sometimes?. But is ""NOISY"" valid? Yes.

But in ""NOISY"", N is at position 1? Which we don't know if that is right.

Similarly, ""NOSEY""? But E and E is absent? Then we can't use E.

Another: ""POINT"" we avoided because it uses N at position 4? But let's put it aside.

For position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"": S,N,O,W,Y -> avoids C,R,A,E. And N at position 2. W is new.

For position 3: e.g., ""PAINT"": P,A,I,N,T -> but A is absent? A we know is absent? So cannot use A? Because A got 'x' in first guess.

Similarly, position 5: e.g., ""STOWN""? Not a word. ""GROWN""? G is new but R is absent? R we know absent? So ""GROWN"" has R? No.

Another: ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. Yes? And avoids C,R,A,E.

So ""SHOWN"" has N at position 5.

We can choose any of these.

But we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Consider: ""POINT"" is a common word? But if we use it, we put N at position 4? We already know position 4 isn't N? So let's avoid that? So I'll skip ""POINT"".

Alternatively, ""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K -> N at position 4? Again same issue? Position 4 we know isn't N? So we avoid. Therefore, we need the word to have N at a position other than 4.

So words: ""SONIC""? But C is absent? Then we can't use C? So ""SONIC"" uses C? Which is absent? Then avoid.

Let me think of common words:

- ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Positions: M1, I2, N3, T4, S5? So N at position 3? That's a new position? Then we can test.

Also, covers new letters: M, I, T, S? And N at position 3? We already know N is in the word? So we can see if it's at position 3? If we get a ✓ for N at position 3? Or a '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

Similarly, ""LINTS""? Same idea? But L instead? Better to use M?

Another: ""PUNTS"": P,U,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Similar.

But ""PUNTS"" uses U? Which is a vowel? We haven't tested any vowel yet? Except A and E which are absent? So O, I, U are vowels we should try? Because the word must have vowels? And since A and E are absent? Then the vowels must be among O, I, U? Or Y? 

So we should try to include one or two of these.

Let's choose a word that:
1. Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.
2. Includes N (in a position other than 4? Which we have tested as wrong? Actually, we tested position 4? So we can put it at 1,2,3,5).
3. Includes other common letters and vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U, S, T, etc.

Good examples:

- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> no N? Oh, but we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, in Wordle strategy, we are not forced to reuse known present letters? But we have only one known present letter: N. If we don't use N, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include it? To get more feedback? 

But if we don't, we might guess faster if we focus on new entirely? However, we have a present letter? We should try to get its position? 

Therefore, include N.

But in ""MOIST"", no N? So skip.

I think ""POINT"" would be inefficient? Because of position 4? So let's avoid.

Instead, ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N at position 5? And letters: S,H,O,W? All new? And includes vowel O? 

Another: ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y -> N at position 2? U and I are vowels? And Y? 

Then ""UNITY"" seems good: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

We avoid C,R,A,E? Yes.

We can also use ""STING"": S,T,I,N,G -> but N at position 4? Position 4 we know not? So avoid? Then it has N at 4? So skip.

Wait: ""STING"" -> positions: S1, T2, I3, N4, G5? So N at 4? So that's the same as in ""crane"" at position 4? Which we know is wrong? Therefore, don't use words with N at position 4? 

Hence, we must have a word with N at 1,2,3, or 5.

Therefore, let's choose ""UNITY"" or ""SHOWN"" or ""MINTS"".

""MINTS"": M1, I2, N3, T4, S5 -> N at position 3? So that's new? Position 3? 

But also, note: in ""crane"", position 3 was A? Which we know is absent? So the letter at position 3 in the secret word is not A? So when we put I? It might be? 

Similarly, position 4: we had N? Which is present? But not at position 4? So position 4? We don't know? So putting T? etc.

Another thing: the secret word has at least one vowel? Since A and E are absent? Then likely O, I, U, or Y? We haven't tested O,I,U? So in ""MINTS"": I and? M and T?

But ""MINTS"" has I? And no other vowel? Unless Y? But it has I? So it's okay? Or ""MINTY""? Not a word? So we have ""MINTS"".

Similarly, ""POINT"" we avoid? But ""POINT"" has O? And N at position 4? Which we avoid? 

So I think ""MINTS"" is good? because it covers M,I,N,T,S? All common letters? And N in a new position (3)? 

Another candidate: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T -> N at position 2? And U? Vowels I and U.

So ""INPUT"": I at 1, N at 2, P at 3, U at 4, T at 5? Avoids C,R,A,E? Yes? And covers two vowels? I and U? 

Better than ""MINTS"" which has only one vowel? Because ""INPUT"" has two vowels? 

But note: we don't know how many vowels? But having more vowels might be helpful? 

So between ""INPUT"" and ""MINTS"":

""INPUT"": letters I,N,P,U,T -> new letters: I,P,U,T? And we know N? 
""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> new letters M,I,T,S? 

Both have I? Both have T? 

""INPUT"" covers P and U? While ""MINTS"" covers M and S? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Also, ""INPUT"" has N at position 2? ""MINTS"" at position 3? 

We can choose either? 

Perhaps ""INPUT"" might be better? Because P and U might be useful? 

Let me consider a word that puts N at position 1: ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T -> but G and H? And avoids E and A? C,R? G and H are new? 

But we haven't tested G,H? 

""LIONS"": L,I,O,N,S -> N at position 4? Oh, position 4? Avoid? 

So ""LUNGS"": L,U,N,G,S -> N at position 3? Position 3? And letter U? G?

But we don't know about G? 

But we have S? 

Another word: ""POISE"" has E? E absent? So avoid? 

""OUNCE"" has E? Avoid? 

Therefore, let's go with ""INPUT""? 

But note: if the word has U? Then we test that? And P? 

Similarly, we can use ""SHUNT"": S,H,U,N,T -> N at position 4? Again position 4? We avoid? 

So not? 

Therefore, position for N must be new? 

So ""INPUT"": N at position 2? That's good? 

And ""QUINT""? Q is less common? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is valid? 

Let me confirm: feedback is for only the letters? So when we guess ""INPUT"", it will give us feedback for each letter? But since C,R,A,E are absent? They are not? But we won't use them? 

So guess: ""INPUT""

We hope to get information about N's position and coverage on I,U,P,T? 

But note: N at position 2? If that is the right position? Then ✓, else - or x? But since N is in the word, it must be -? Or if it is at position 2? Then ✓? 

Then also for other positions? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is a good second guess? 

Another option: ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y? No T? But has O? 

Then ""NOISY"" has N at position 1? And O? 

But Y might be vowel? 

Similarly, ""JOINS"": J not common? 

Or ""COINS"": C? Absent? So avoid? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""INPUT"". 

So second guess: INPUT
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4.
- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and exclude C, R, A, E.

For the second guess:
- We should choose a word that avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- We must include N to gather more information about its position.
- Since N cannot be in position 4 (based on first feedback), we prioritize placing N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5) to test efficiency.
- We also aim to test new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants to maximize feedback coverage.

A strong candidate is ""input"":
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- It includes N (in position 2, a new untested position).
- It covers new common vowels (I and U).
- It introduces new consonants (P and T), which are frequent in English words.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if N is at position 2 (✓ if correct, - if elsewhere).
- Reveal if I, P, U, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

Alternative considered words like ""mints"" (N at position 3) or ""shown"" (N at position 5) were also evaluated, but ""input"" provides broader vowel coverage and uses equally common letters.

<guess>input</guess>",input,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word at all (since they got 'x')
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (since it got '-')

So the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the last position (since we placed it at position 4 in ""crane"", which is the 4th letter? Remember, positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E).

Actually, let's clarify the positions:
""c r a n e""
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not in position 4
Position 5: E (x) -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word has the letter N, and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note that position 5 is ruled out? Actually no: position 5 is E which is absent, but N can be in position 5? Wait no, because N is marked as wrong position meaning that if it were in position 5, then when we put N in position 4, it would have shown as present but in wrong position regardless. However, the feedback doesn't tell us what positions it can be, only that it's not in the position we guessed.

Specifically, we know:
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.
- It does contain N, but not at position 4.

So the word has 5 letters, and one of them is N (at position 1,2,3, or 5). But note: if N were at position 5, then in our guess ""crane"" the last letter E is not N, so that could be possible? Actually, the feedback says the letter N is present and that it is not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2,3, or 5.

But we must also note: the word may have repeated letters? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this game, the rules don't specify, but in general, Wordle allows repeated letters. So we have to consider that.

However, in this feedback we have only one N and it's marked as present but wrong position, so if there were two N's then one might be marked correctly, but we don't have that. So for now, assume one N.

Now, we need to choose a second guess that:
- Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent)
- Must include N (but not in the same position as guess 1? Actually, we know N is not at position 4, so if we put N in a different position, that might be good to test).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has N but in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E and now know C,R,A,E are absent; N is present.

So unused common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

We should try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

Possible vowels: O, U, I (since we already tried A and E and they are not in the word). So the remaining vowels are O, I, U? Actually, Y might also be a vowel.

But let's aim for a word that has N in a different position and includes O and I, and other consonants.

Common starting words: maybe ""POINT""? But that has P,O,I,N,T.

Check: P, O, I, N, T. All are new letters? We have not tried any of these.

We know N is in the word, but not at position 4. If we put N at position 5? Then if the word has N at position 5, we might get a '-' or even a '✓' if it's there? Actually, we can test.

But note: we want to place N in one of the positions it might be: position 1,2,3, or 5.

In ""point"", if we put:
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: I
Position 4: N (but wait, in the first guess we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, so now we are putting N at position 4? That might be a bad idea because we already know position 4 is not N? Actually, we know that the word has N but not at position 4, so using N at position 4 again would be inefficient? Because we already know it shouldn't be there.

Better to put N at a position we haven't tried. So avoid position 4? Actually, we can avoid position 4 for N because we know it's wrong.

In ""point"", if we put N at position 4? That is the same as the first guess? Which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

So consider words like:

- N at position 1: ""n_____"" words, e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NAILS"", ""NOTCH"" but avoid C (not allowed) and R,A,E. 

But we don't know if the word has S, L, etc.

Alternatively, put N at position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"", ""KNOCK"" (but K is new? and avoid C? C is absent so we can't use C). So ""SNOUT"" has S,N,O,U,T? But U and O are vowels.

Similarly, position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" but if we use POINT we put N at position 4? Wait, POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> N at position 4. We know N is not at position 4? So that would be a bad choice? Because we already know position 4 is wrong for N.

But wait, in POINT, N is at position 4. Since we know the word's N is not at position 4, then when we guess POINT and put N at position 4, the feedback should show N as '-' (present but wrong position) again? Because the N we put at 4 is the same as before? Actually, it would tell us that we have an N but it's still not in the correct position? That doesn't give new information about the position? Exactly, we already know N isn't at position 4, so guessing a word with N at position 4 will still give '-' for N, but without any new information about its position.

Therefore, it's better to avoid putting N at position 4 again. We should try N at a new position.

So let's choose a word with N at position 1, or 2, or 3, or 5.

Options:

- Position 1: ""N"" words: such as ""NOISE"" (but E is absent? we must avoid E). So ""NOISE"" is invalid because E is absent? Actually, we must use only letters that are possible? We don't know that E is present? Actually, from feedback, E is absent so we cannot use E. Similarly C,R,A,E are out.

So ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E -> E is absent? So we must not use E? Because the rules say we have to guess a valid English word, but we are allowed to use letters that are not in the target if necessary? Actually, yes, but using an absent letter again doesn't give new information? So better not to use absent letters.

Therefore, for our second guess, we should avoid C,R,A,E since we know they are absent.

We must use N and avoid C,R,A,E.

So possible words: with N at position 1: e.g., 

- ""NINNY""? That has repeats? Also uses N multiple times? But we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically we can try, but let's stick without repeats for now.

Better: ""NODES""? But E and S? E we know is absent? So ""NODES"" uses E which is absent? So the feedback would show E as 'x'. Since E is absent, we don't want to waste a letter position? So we should avoid using any of the absent letters (C,R,A,E).

So we must use letters from the untested set: B,D,H,I,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,Y, and so on.

Word with N at position 1 that doesn't use C,R,A,E:

e.g., ""NOULD""? Not a word. ""NOUNS"" -> that has two N's? Also uses U and S.

Better: ""NOISY"" -> N,O,I,S,Y -> no absent letters? Y is a consonant sometimes?. But is ""NOISY"" valid? Yes.

But in ""NOISY"", N is at position 1? Which we don't know if that is right.

Similarly, ""NOSEY""? But E and E is absent? Then we can't use E.

Another: ""POINT"" we avoided because it uses N at position 4? But let's put it aside.

For position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"": S,N,O,W,Y -> avoids C,R,A,E. And N at position 2. W is new.

For position 3: e.g., ""PAINT"": P,A,I,N,T -> but A is absent? A we know is absent? So cannot use A? Because A got 'x' in first guess.

Similarly, position 5: e.g., ""STOWN""? Not a word. ""GROWN""? G is new but R is absent? R we know absent? So ""GROWN"" has R? No.

Another: ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. Yes? And avoids C,R,A,E.

So ""SHOWN"" has N at position 5.

We can choose any of these.

But we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Consider: ""POINT"" is a common word? But if we use it, we put N at position 4? We already know position 4 isn't N? So let's avoid that? So I'll skip ""POINT"".

Alternatively, ""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K -> N at position 4? Again same issue? Position 4 we know isn't N? So we avoid. Therefore, we need the word to have N at a position other than 4.

So words: ""SONIC""? But C is absent? Then we can't use C? So ""SONIC"" uses C? Which is absent? Then avoid.

Let me think of common words:

- ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Positions: M1, I2, N3, T4, S5? So N at position 3? That's a new position? Then we can test.

Also, covers new letters: M, I, T, S? And N at position 3? We already know N is in the word? So we can see if it's at position 3? If we get a ✓ for N at position 3? Or a '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

Similarly, ""LINTS""? Same idea? But L instead? Better to use M?

Another: ""PUNTS"": P,U,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Similar.

But ""PUNTS"" uses U? Which is a vowel? We haven't tested any vowel yet? Except A and E which are absent? So O, I, U are vowels we should try? Because the word must have vowels? And since A and E are absent? Then the vowels must be among O, I, U? Or Y? 

So we should try to include one or two of these.

Let's choose a word that:
1. Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.
2. Includes N (in a position other than 4? Which we have tested as wrong? Actually, we tested position 4? So we can put it at 1,2,3,5).
3. Includes other common letters and vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U, S, T, etc.

Good examples:

- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> no N? Oh, but we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, in Wordle strategy, we are not forced to reuse known present letters? But we have only one known present letter: N. If we don't use N, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include it? To get more feedback? 

But if we don't, we might guess faster if we focus on new entirely? However, we have a present letter? We should try to get its position? 

Therefore, include N.

But in ""MOIST"", no N? So skip.

I think ""POINT"" would be inefficient? Because of position 4? So let's avoid.

Instead, ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N at position 5? And letters: S,H,O,W? All new? And includes vowel O? 

Another: ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y -> N at position 2? U and I are vowels? And Y? 

Then ""UNITY"" seems good: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

We avoid C,R,A,E? Yes.

We can also use ""STING"": S,T,I,N,G -> but N at position 4? Position 4 we know not? So avoid? Then it has N at 4? So skip.

Wait: ""STING"" -> positions: S1, T2, I3, N4, G5? So N at 4? So that's the same as in ""crane"" at position 4? Which we know is wrong? Therefore, don't use words with N at position 4? 

Hence, we must have a word with N at 1,2,3, or 5.

Therefore, let's choose ""UNITY"" or ""SHOWN"" or ""MINTS"".

""MINTS"": M1, I2, N3, T4, S5 -> N at position 3? So that's new? Position 3? 

But also, note: in ""crane"", position 3 was A? Which we know is absent? So the letter at position 3 in the secret word is not A? So when we put I? It might be? 

Similarly, position 4: we had N? Which is present? But not at position 4? So position 4? We don't know? So putting T? etc.

Another thing: the secret word has at least one vowel? Since A and E are absent? Then likely O, I, U, or Y? We haven't tested O,I,U? So in ""MINTS"": I and? M and T?

But ""MINTS"" has I? And no other vowel? Unless Y? But it has I? So it's okay? Or ""MINTY""? Not a word? So we have ""MINTS"".

Similarly, ""POINT"" we avoid? But ""POINT"" has O? And N at position 4? Which we avoid? 

So I think ""MINTS"" is good? because it covers M,I,N,T,S? All common letters? And N in a new position (3)? 

Another candidate: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T -> N at position 2? And U? Vowels I and U.

So ""INPUT"": I at 1, N at 2, P at 3, U at 4, T at 5? Avoids C,R,A,E? Yes? And covers two vowels? I and U? 

Better than ""MINTS"" which has only one vowel? Because ""INPUT"" has two vowels? 

But note: we don't know how many vowels? But having more vowels might be helpful? 

So between ""INPUT"" and ""MINTS"":

""INPUT"": letters I,N,P,U,T -> new letters: I,P,U,T? And we know N? 
""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> new letters M,I,T,S? 

Both have I? Both have T? 

""INPUT"" covers P and U? While ""MINTS"" covers M and S? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Also, ""INPUT"" has N at position 2? ""MINTS"" at position 3? 

We can choose either? 

Perhaps ""INPUT"" might be better? Because P and U might be useful? 

Let me consider a word that puts N at position 1: ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T -> but G and H? And avoids E and A? C,R? G and H are new? 

But we haven't tested G,H? 

""LIONS"": L,I,O,N,S -> N at position 4? Oh, position 4? Avoid? 

So ""LUNGS"": L,U,N,G,S -> N at position 3? Position 3? And letter U? G?

But we don't know about G? 

But we have S? 

Another word: ""POISE"" has E? E absent? So avoid? 

""OUNCE"" has E? Avoid? 

Therefore, let's go with ""INPUT""? 

But note: if the word has U? Then we test that? And P? 

Similarly, we can use ""SHUNT"": S,H,U,N,T -> N at position 4? Again position 4? We avoid? 

So not? 

Therefore, position for N must be new? 

So ""INPUT"": N at position 2? That's good? 

And ""QUINT""? Q is less common? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is valid? 

Let me confirm: feedback is for only the letters? So when we guess ""INPUT"", it will give us feedback for each letter? But since C,R,A,E are absent? They are not? But we won't use them? 

So guess: ""INPUT""

We hope to get information about N's position and coverage on I,U,P,T? 

But note: N at position 2? If that is the right position? Then ✓, else - or x? But since N is in the word, it must be -? Or if it is at position 2? Then ✓? 

Then also for other positions? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is a good second guess? 

Another option: ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y? No T? But has O? 

Then ""NOISY"" has N at position 1? And O? 

But Y might be vowel? 

Similarly, ""JOINS"": J not common? 

Or ""COINS"": C? Absent? So avoid? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""INPUT"". 

So second guess: INPUTBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4.
- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and exclude C, R, A, E.

For the second guess:
- We should choose a word that avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- We must include N to gather more information about its position.
- Since N cannot be in position 4 (based on first feedback), we prioritize placing N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5) to test efficiency.
- We also aim to test new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants to maximize feedback coverage.

A strong candidate is ""input"":
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- It includes N (in position 2, a new untested position).
- It covers new common vowels (I and U).
- It introduces new consonants (P and T), which are frequent in English words.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if N is at position 2 (✓ if correct, - if elsewhere).
- Reveal if I, P, U, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

Alternative considered words like ""mints"" (N at position 3) or ""shown"" (N at position 5) were also evaluated, but ""input"" provides broader vowel coverage and uses equally common letters.",Guess 2: input -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,bison,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information gained. 
A good starting word should have common letters and a balanced letter distribution. We also want to avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

Common vowels and consonants: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good starter.

But note: The feedback symbols we are using are:
  ✓ : correct letter and position
  - : letter in word but wrong position
  x : letter not in word

For the first guess, any word is acceptable. Let me choose ""CRANE"".

Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word at all (since they got 'x')
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (since it got '-')

So the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the last position (since we placed it at position 4 in ""crane"", which is the 4th letter? Remember, positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E).

Actually, let's clarify the positions:
""c r a n e""
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not in position 4
Position 5: E (x) -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word has the letter N, and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note that position 5 is ruled out? Actually no: position 5 is E which is absent, but N can be in position 5? Wait no, because N is marked as wrong position meaning that if it were in position 5, then when we put N in position 4, it would have shown as present but in wrong position regardless. However, the feedback doesn't tell us what positions it can be, only that it's not in the position we guessed.

Specifically, we know:
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.
- It does contain N, but not at position 4.

So the word has 5 letters, and one of them is N (at position 1,2,3, or 5). But note: if N were at position 5, then in our guess ""crane"" the last letter E is not N, so that could be possible? Actually, the feedback says the letter N is present and that it is not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2,3, or 5.

But we must also note: the word may have repeated letters? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this game, the rules don't specify, but in general, Wordle allows repeated letters. So we have to consider that.

However, in this feedback we have only one N and it's marked as present but wrong position, so if there were two N's then one might be marked correctly, but we don't have that. So for now, assume one N.

Now, we need to choose a second guess that:
- Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent)
- Must include N (but not in the same position as guess 1? Actually, we know N is not at position 4, so if we put N in a different position, that might be good to test).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has N but in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E and now know C,R,A,E are absent; N is present.

So unused common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

We should try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

Possible vowels: O, U, I (since we already tried A and E and they are not in the word). So the remaining vowels are O, I, U? Actually, Y might also be a vowel.

But let's aim for a word that has N in a different position and includes O and I, and other consonants.

Common starting words: maybe ""POINT""? But that has P,O,I,N,T.

Check: P, O, I, N, T. All are new letters? We have not tried any of these.

We know N is in the word, but not at position 4. If we put N at position 5? Then if the word has N at position 5, we might get a '-' or even a '✓' if it's there? Actually, we can test.

But note: we want to place N in one of the positions it might be: position 1,2,3, or 5.

In ""point"", if we put:
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: I
Position 4: N (but wait, in the first guess we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, so now we are putting N at position 4? That might be a bad idea because we already know position 4 is not N? Actually, we know that the word has N but not at position 4, so using N at position 4 again would be inefficient? Because we already know it shouldn't be there.

Better to put N at a position we haven't tried. So avoid position 4? Actually, we can avoid position 4 for N because we know it's wrong.

In ""point"", if we put N at position 4? That is the same as the first guess? Which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

So consider words like:

- N at position 1: ""n_____"" words, e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NAILS"", ""NOTCH"" but avoid C (not allowed) and R,A,E. 

But we don't know if the word has S, L, etc.

Alternatively, put N at position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"", ""KNOCK"" (but K is new? and avoid C? C is absent so we can't use C). So ""SNOUT"" has S,N,O,U,T? But U and O are vowels.

Similarly, position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" but if we use POINT we put N at position 4? Wait, POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> N at position 4. We know N is not at position 4? So that would be a bad choice? Because we already know position 4 is wrong for N.

But wait, in POINT, N is at position 4. Since we know the word's N is not at position 4, then when we guess POINT and put N at position 4, the feedback should show N as '-' (present but wrong position) again? Because the N we put at 4 is the same as before? Actually, it would tell us that we have an N but it's still not in the correct position? That doesn't give new information about the position? Exactly, we already know N isn't at position 4, so guessing a word with N at position 4 will still give '-' for N, but without any new information about its position.

Therefore, it's better to avoid putting N at position 4 again. We should try N at a new position.

So let's choose a word with N at position 1, or 2, or 3, or 5.

Options:

- Position 1: ""N"" words: such as ""NOISE"" (but E is absent? we must avoid E). So ""NOISE"" is invalid because E is absent? Actually, we must use only letters that are possible? We don't know that E is present? Actually, from feedback, E is absent so we cannot use E. Similarly C,R,A,E are out.

So ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E -> E is absent? So we must not use E? Because the rules say we have to guess a valid English word, but we are allowed to use letters that are not in the target if necessary? Actually, yes, but using an absent letter again doesn't give new information? So better not to use absent letters.

Therefore, for our second guess, we should avoid C,R,A,E since we know they are absent.

We must use N and avoid C,R,A,E.

So possible words: with N at position 1: e.g., 

- ""NINNY""? That has repeats? Also uses N multiple times? But we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically we can try, but let's stick without repeats for now.

Better: ""NODES""? But E and S? E we know is absent? So ""NODES"" uses E which is absent? So the feedback would show E as 'x'. Since E is absent, we don't want to waste a letter position? So we should avoid using any of the absent letters (C,R,A,E).

So we must use letters from the untested set: B,D,H,I,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,Y, and so on.

Word with N at position 1 that doesn't use C,R,A,E:

e.g., ""NOULD""? Not a word. ""NOUNS"" -> that has two N's? Also uses U and S.

Better: ""NOISY"" -> N,O,I,S,Y -> no absent letters? Y is a consonant sometimes?. But is ""NOISY"" valid? Yes.

But in ""NOISY"", N is at position 1? Which we don't know if that is right.

Similarly, ""NOSEY""? But E and E is absent? Then we can't use E.

Another: ""POINT"" we avoided because it uses N at position 4? But let's put it aside.

For position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"": S,N,O,W,Y -> avoids C,R,A,E. And N at position 2. W is new.

For position 3: e.g., ""PAINT"": P,A,I,N,T -> but A is absent? A we know is absent? So cannot use A? Because A got 'x' in first guess.

Similarly, position 5: e.g., ""STOWN""? Not a word. ""GROWN""? G is new but R is absent? R we know absent? So ""GROWN"" has R? No.

Another: ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. Yes? And avoids C,R,A,E.

So ""SHOWN"" has N at position 5.

We can choose any of these.

But we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Consider: ""POINT"" is a common word? But if we use it, we put N at position 4? We already know position 4 isn't N? So let's avoid that? So I'll skip ""POINT"".

Alternatively, ""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K -> N at position 4? Again same issue? Position 4 we know isn't N? So we avoid. Therefore, we need the word to have N at a position other than 4.

So words: ""SONIC""? But C is absent? Then we can't use C? So ""SONIC"" uses C? Which is absent? Then avoid.

Let me think of common words:

- ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Positions: M1, I2, N3, T4, S5? So N at position 3? That's a new position? Then we can test.

Also, covers new letters: M, I, T, S? And N at position 3? We already know N is in the word? So we can see if it's at position 3? If we get a ✓ for N at position 3? Or a '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

Similarly, ""LINTS""? Same idea? But L instead? Better to use M?

Another: ""PUNTS"": P,U,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Similar.

But ""PUNTS"" uses U? Which is a vowel? We haven't tested any vowel yet? Except A and E which are absent? So O, I, U are vowels we should try? Because the word must have vowels? And since A and E are absent? Then the vowels must be among O, I, U? Or Y? 

So we should try to include one or two of these.

Let's choose a word that:
1. Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.
2. Includes N (in a position other than 4? Which we have tested as wrong? Actually, we tested position 4? So we can put it at 1,2,3,5).
3. Includes other common letters and vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U, S, T, etc.

Good examples:

- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> no N? Oh, but we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, in Wordle strategy, we are not forced to reuse known present letters? But we have only one known present letter: N. If we don't use N, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include it? To get more feedback? 

But if we don't, we might guess faster if we focus on new entirely? However, we have a present letter? We should try to get its position? 

Therefore, include N.

But in ""MOIST"", no N? So skip.

I think ""POINT"" would be inefficient? Because of position 4? So let's avoid.

Instead, ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N at position 5? And letters: S,H,O,W? All new? And includes vowel O? 

Another: ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y -> N at position 2? U and I are vowels? And Y? 

Then ""UNITY"" seems good: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

We avoid C,R,A,E? Yes.

We can also use ""STING"": S,T,I,N,G -> but N at position 4? Position 4 we know not? So avoid? Then it has N at 4? So skip.

Wait: ""STING"" -> positions: S1, T2, I3, N4, G5? So N at 4? So that's the same as in ""crane"" at position 4? Which we know is wrong? Therefore, don't use words with N at position 4? 

Hence, we must have a word with N at 1,2,3, or 5.

Therefore, let's choose ""UNITY"" or ""SHOWN"" or ""MINTS"".

""MINTS"": M1, I2, N3, T4, S5 -> N at position 3? So that's new? Position 3? 

But also, note: in ""crane"", position 3 was A? Which we know is absent? So the letter at position 3 in the secret word is not A? So when we put I? It might be? 

Similarly, position 4: we had N? Which is present? But not at position 4? So position 4? We don't know? So putting T? etc.

Another thing: the secret word has at least one vowel? Since A and E are absent? Then likely O, I, U, or Y? We haven't tested O,I,U? So in ""MINTS"": I and? M and T?

But ""MINTS"" has I? And no other vowel? Unless Y? But it has I? So it's okay? Or ""MINTY""? Not a word? So we have ""MINTS"".

Similarly, ""POINT"" we avoid? But ""POINT"" has O? And N at position 4? Which we avoid? 

So I think ""MINTS"" is good? because it covers M,I,N,T,S? All common letters? And N in a new position (3)? 

Another candidate: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T -> N at position 2? And U? Vowels I and U.

So ""INPUT"": I at 1, N at 2, P at 3, U at 4, T at 5? Avoids C,R,A,E? Yes? And covers two vowels? I and U? 

Better than ""MINTS"" which has only one vowel? Because ""INPUT"" has two vowels? 

But note: we don't know how many vowels? But having more vowels might be helpful? 

So between ""INPUT"" and ""MINTS"":

""INPUT"": letters I,N,P,U,T -> new letters: I,P,U,T? And we know N? 
""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> new letters M,I,T,S? 

Both have I? Both have T? 

""INPUT"" covers P and U? While ""MINTS"" covers M and S? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Also, ""INPUT"" has N at position 2? ""MINTS"" at position 3? 

We can choose either? 

Perhaps ""INPUT"" might be better? Because P and U might be useful? 

Let me consider a word that puts N at position 1: ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T -> but G and H? And avoids E and A? C,R? G and H are new? 

But we haven't tested G,H? 

""LIONS"": L,I,O,N,S -> N at position 4? Oh, position 4? Avoid? 

So ""LUNGS"": L,U,N,G,S -> N at position 3? Position 3? And letter U? G?

But we don't know about G? 

But we have S? 

Another word: ""POISE"" has E? E absent? So avoid? 

""OUNCE"" has E? Avoid? 

Therefore, let's go with ""INPUT""? 

But note: if the word has U? Then we test that? And P? 

Similarly, we can use ""SHUNT"": S,H,U,N,T -> N at position 4? Again position 4? We avoid? 

So not? 

Therefore, position for N must be new? 

So ""INPUT"": N at position 2? That's good? 

And ""QUINT""? Q is less common? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is valid? 

Let me confirm: feedback is for only the letters? So when we guess ""INPUT"", it will give us feedback for each letter? But since C,R,A,E are absent? They are not? But we won't use them? 

So guess: ""INPUT""

We hope to get information about N's position and coverage on I,U,P,T? 

But note: N at position 2? If that is the right position? Then ✓, else - or x? But since N is in the word, it must be -? Or if it is at position 2? Then ✓? 

Then also for other positions? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is a good second guess? 

Another option: ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y? No T? But has O? 

Then ""NOISY"" has N at position 1? And O? 

But Y might be vowel? 

Similarly, ""JOINS"": J not common? 

Or ""COINS"": C? Absent? So avoid? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""INPUT"". 

So second guess: INPUTBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4.
- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and exclude C, R, A, E.

For the second guess:
- We should choose a word that avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- We must include N to gather more information about its position.
- Since N cannot be in position 4 (based on first feedback), we prioritize placing N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5) to test efficiency.
- We also aim to test new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants to maximize feedback coverage.

A strong candidate is ""input"":
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- It includes N (in position 2, a new untested position).
- It covers new common vowels (I and U).
- It introduces new consonants (P and T), which are frequent in English words.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if N is at position 2 (✓ if correct, - if elsewhere).
- Reveal if I, P, U, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

Alternative considered words like ""mints"" (N at position 3) or ""shown"" (N at position 5) were also evaluated, but ""input"" provides broader vowel coverage and uses equally common letters.

Remember, positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E).\n\nActually, let\'s clarify the positions:\n""c r a n e""\nPosition 1: C (x) -> not in word\nPosition 2: R (x) -> not in word\nPosition 3: A (x) -> not in word\nPosition 4: N (-) -> in word, but not in position 4\nPosition 5: E (x) -> not in word\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the letter N, and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note that position 5 is ruled out? Actually no: position 5 is E which is absent, but N can be in position 5? Wait no, because N is marked as wrong position meaning that if it were in position 5, then when we put N in position 4, it would have shown as present but in wrong position regardless. However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us what positions it can be, only that it\'s not in the position we guessed.\n\nSpecifically, we know:\n- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.\n- It does contain N, but not at position 4.\n\nSo the word has 5 letters, and one of them is N (at position 1,2,3, or 5). But note: if N were at position 5, then in our guess ""crane"" the last letter E is not N, so that could be possible? Actually, the feedback says the letter N is present and that it is not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nBut we must also note: the word may have repeated letters? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this game, the rules don\'t specify, but in general, Wordle allows repeated letters. So we have to consider that.\n\nHowever, in this feedback we have only one N and it\'s marked as present but wrong position, so if there were two N\'s then one might be marked correctly, but we don\'t have that. So for now, assume one N.\n\nNow, we need to choose a second guess that:\n- Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent)\n- Must include N (but not in the same position as guess 1? Actually, we know N is not at position 4, so if we put N in a different position, that might be good to test).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has N but in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have tested: C, R, A, N, E and now know C,R,A,E are absent; N is present.\n\nSo unused common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover more vowels and common consonants.\n\nPossible vowels: O, U, I (since we already tried A and E and they are not in the word). So the remaining vowels are O, I, U? Actually, Y might also be a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s aim for a word that has N in a different position and includes O and I, and other consonants.\n\nCommon starting words: maybe ""POINT""? But that has P,O,I,N,T.\n\nCheck: P, O, I, N, T. All are new letters? We have not tried any of these.\n\nWe know N is in the word, but not at position 4. If we put N at position 5? Then if the word has N at position 5, we might get a \'-\' or even a \'✓\' if it\'s there? Actually, we can test.\n\nBut note: we want to place N in one of the positions it might be: position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nIn ""point"", if we put:\nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: O\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: N (but wait, in the first guess we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, so now we are putting N at position 4? That might be a bad idea because we already know position 4 is not N? Actually, we know that the word has N but not at position 4, so using N at position 4 again would be inefficient? Because we already know it shouldn\'t be there.\n\nBetter to put N at a position we haven\'t tried. So avoid position 4? Actually, we can avoid position 4 for N because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nIn ""point"", if we put N at position 4? That is the same as the first guess? Which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nWe need a word that has N in position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nSo consider words like:\n\n- N at position 1: ""n_____"" words, e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NAILS"", ""NOTCH"" but avoid C (not allowed) and R,A,E. \n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, L, etc.\n\nAlternatively, put N at position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"", ""KNOCK"" (but K is new? and avoid C? C is absent so we can\'t use C). So ""SNOUT"" has S,N,O,U,T? But U and O are vowels.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" but if we use POINT we put N at position 4? Wait, POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> N at position 4. We know N is not at position 4? So that would be a bad choice? Because we already know position 4 is wrong for N.\n\nBut wait, in POINT, N is at position 4. Since we know the word\'s N is not at position 4, then when we guess POINT and put N at position 4, the feedback should show N as \'-\' (present but wrong position) again? Because the N we put at 4 is the same as before? Actually, it would tell us that we have an N but it\'s still not in the correct position? That doesn\'t give new information about the position? Exactly, we already know N isn\'t at position 4, so guessing a word with N at position 4 will still give \'-\' for N, but without any new information about its position.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to avoid putting N at position 4 again. We should try N at a new position.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with N at position 1, or 2, or 3, or 5.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Position 1: ""N"" words: such as ""NOISE"" (but E is absent? we must avoid E). So ""NOISE"" is invalid because E is absent? Actually, we must use only letters that are possible? We don\'t know that E is present? Actually, from feedback, E is absent so we cannot use E. Similarly C,R,A,E are out.\n\nSo ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E -> E is absent? So we must not use E? Because the rules say we have to guess a valid English word, but we are allowed to use letters that are not in the target if necessary? Actually, yes, but using an absent letter again doesn\'t give new information? So better not to use absent letters.\n\nTherefore, for our second guess, we should avoid C,R,A,E since we know they are absent.\n\nWe must use N and avoid C,R,A,E.\n\nSo possible words: with N at position 1: e.g., \n\n- ""NINNY""? That has repeats? Also uses N multiple times? But we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically we can try, but let\'s stick without repeats for now.\n\nBetter: ""NODES""? But E and S? E we know is absent? So ""NODES"" uses E which is absent? So the feedback would show E as \'x\'. Since E is absent, we don\'t want to waste a letter position? So we should avoid using any of the absent letters (C,R,A,E).\n\nSo we must use letters from the untested set: B,D,H,I,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,Y, and so on.\n\nWord with N at position 1 that doesn\'t use C,R,A,E:\n\ne.g., ""NOULD""? Not a word. ""NOUNS"" -> that has two N\'s? Also uses U and S.\n\nBetter: ""NOISY"" -> N,O,I,S,Y -> no absent letters? Y is a consonant sometimes?. But is ""NOISY"" valid? Yes.\n\nBut in ""NOISY"", N is at position 1? Which we don\'t know if that is right.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOSEY""? But E and E is absent? Then we can\'t use E.\n\nAnother: ""POINT"" we avoided because it uses N at position 4? But let\'s put it aside.\n\nFor position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"": S,N,O,W,Y -> avoids C,R,A,E. And N at position 2. W is new.\n\nFor position 3: e.g., ""PAINT"": P,A,I,N,T -> but A is absent? A we know is absent? So cannot use A? Because A got \'x\' in first guess.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: e.g., ""STOWN""? Not a word. ""GROWN""? G is new but R is absent? R we know absent? So ""GROWN"" has R? No.\n\nAnother: ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. Yes? And avoids C,R,A,E.\n\nSo ""SHOWN"" has N at position 5.\n\nWe can choose any of these.\n\nBut we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nConsider: ""POINT"" is a common word? But if we use it, we put N at position 4? We already know position 4 isn\'t N? So let\'s avoid that? So I\'ll skip ""POINT"".\n\nAlternatively, ""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K -> N at position 4? Again same issue? Position 4 we know isn\'t N? So we avoid. Therefore, we need the word to have N at a position other than 4.\n\nSo words: ""SONIC""? But C is absent? Then we can\'t use C? So ""SONIC"" uses C? Which is absent? Then avoid.\n\nLet me think of common words:\n\n- ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Positions: M1, I2, N3, T4, S5? So N at position 3? That\'s a new position? Then we can test.\n\nAlso, covers new letters: M, I, T, S? And N at position 3? We already know N is in the word? So we can see if it\'s at position 3? If we get a ✓ for N at position 3? Or a \'-\' meaning it\'s elsewhere? \n\nSimilarly, ""LINTS""? Same idea? But L instead? Better to use M?\n\nAnother: ""PUNTS"": P,U,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Similar.\n\nBut ""PUNTS"" uses U? Which is a vowel? We haven\'t tested any vowel yet? Except A and E which are absent? So O, I, U are vowels we should try? Because the word must have vowels? And since A and E are absent? Then the vowels must be among O, I, U? Or Y? \n\nSo we should try to include one or two of these.\n\nLet\'s choose a word that:\n1. Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.\n2. Includes N (in a position other than 4? Which we have tested as wrong? Actually, we tested position 4? So we can put it at 1,2,3,5).\n3. Includes other common letters and vowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U, S, T, etc.\n\nGood examples:\n\n- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> no N? Oh, but we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, in Wordle strategy, we are not forced to reuse known present letters? But we have only one known present letter: N. If we don\'t use N, we won\'t get information about its position? So it\'s better to include it? To get more feedback? \n\nBut if we don\'t, we might guess faster if we focus on new entirely? However, we have a present letter? We should try to get its position? \n\nTherefore, include N.\n\nBut in ""MOIST"", no N? So skip.\n\nI think ""POINT"" would be inefficient? Because of position 4? So let\'s avoid.\n\nInstead, ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N at position 5? And letters: S,H,O,W? All new? And includes vowel O? \n\nAnother: ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y -> N at position 2? U and I are vowels? And Y? \n\nThen ""UNITY"" seems good: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\nWe avoid C,R,A,E? Yes.\n\nWe can also use ""STING"": S,T,I,N,G -> but N at position 4? Position 4 we know not? So avoid? Then it has N at 4? So skip.\n\nWait: ""STING"" -> positions: S1, T2, I3, N4, G5? So N at 4? So that\'s the same as in ""crane"" at position 4? Which we know is wrong? Therefore, don\'t use words with N at position 4? \n\nHence, we must have a word with N at 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose ""UNITY"" or ""SHOWN"" or ""MINTS"".\n\n""MINTS"": M1, I2, N3, T4, S5 -> N at position 3? So that\'s new? Position 3? \n\nBut also, note: in ""crane"", position 3 was A? Which we know is absent? So the letter at position 3 in the secret word is not A? So when we put I? It might be? \n\nSimilarly, position 4: we had N? Which is present? But not at position 4? So position 4? We don\'t know? So putting T? etc.\n\nAnother thing: the secret word has at least one vowel? Since A and E are absent? Then likely O, I, U, or Y? We haven\'t tested O,I,U? So in ""MINTS"": I and? M and T?\n\nBut ""MINTS"" has I? And no other vowel? Unless Y? But it has I? So it\'s okay? Or ""MINTY""? Not a word? So we have ""MINTS"".\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"" we avoid? But ""POINT"" has O? And N at position 4? Which we avoid? \n\nSo I think ""MINTS"" is good? because it covers M,I,N,T,S? All common letters? And N in a new position (3)? \n\nAnother candidate: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T -> N at position 2? And U? Vowels I and U.\n\nSo ""INPUT"": I at 1, N at 2, P at 3, U at 4, T at 5? Avoids C,R,A,E? Yes? And covers two vowels? I and U? \n\nBetter than ""MINTS"" which has only one vowel? Because ""INPUT"" has two vowels? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know how many vowels? But having more vowels might be helpful? \n\nSo between ""INPUT"" and ""MINTS"":\n\n""INPUT"": letters I,N,P,U,T -> new letters: I,P,U,T?

Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""input"" -> I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
- I is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1).
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2).
- P, U, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, U, T
- Present letters: N and I (both must be in the word, but not at the positions we've tried)

Specifically:
- N is present but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). So N cannot be at position 2 or 4. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- I is present but not at position 1 (from guess 2). So I must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have limited positions.

Also, we have only two known present letters: N and I. The word must contain both.

Now, we need to think about the positions:

- Position 1: Cannot be I (from guess 2 feedback: I at pos1 is wrong). Also, we don't know what can be there, but it could be N? Or another letter.
- Position 2: Cannot be N (from guess 2: N at pos2 is wrong). Also, it could be I? Or another letter.
- Position 3: Could be N or I? Or something else? But we don't have constraints yet.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (from guess 1: N at pos4 is wrong). But it could be I? Or another letter.
- Position 5: Could be N or I? Or another letter.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them: N and I. So there are three more letters to find, which are not among the absent ones.

Absent letters so far: C, R, A, E, P, U, T. So we must avoid these.

We have used the following letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,U,T. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet minus these.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but standard English).

Common letters to try: S, L, O, D, M, etc.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Contains both N and I (since they are present)
- N is at position 1, 3, or 5 (because not 2 or 4)
- I is not at position 1 (so at 2,3,4,5)
- Avoids C,R,A,E,P,U,T

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Possible positions for N and I:

Case 1: N at position 1
Then I can be at 2,3,4,5? But we have to form a word.

Case 2: N at position 3
Then I at 2,4,5? (not 1, and not 3 if N is there? But I could be at 3? No, because if N is at 3, then I cannot be at 3? Unless repeated letters? But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In Wordle, repetition is allowed? But in this case, we haven't seen any indication of repetition? So we should consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can assume no repetition for now? Because if there is repetition, we might get multiple feedback? But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a repeated letter? So let's assume no repetition? Then each letter is unique? So if N is at position 3, then I cannot be at 3? Similarly for other positions.

Therefore, assuming no repeated letters (since we haven't encountered any evidence of repetition), then:

- If N is at 1, I can be at 2,3,4,5
- If N is at 3, I can be at 2,4,5 (not 1 or 3)
- If N is at 5, I can be at 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5)

Now, we need to cover other positions with new letters.

We should try to choose a word that tests N in one of the possible positions and I in a possible position, and also tests other common letters.

For example, if we put N at position 1, then we can have a word like ""N_ _ _ _"", and include I somewhere.

But we also need to avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- ""NOISY"": But O is available? But we have I and S? But ""NOISY"" has S and Y? But in ""NOISY"": N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we know I is present? So that could be? But we haven't tested O, S, Y? 

But check: from guess 2, we have I at position 1 was wrong? But in ""NOISY"", I is at position 3? That might be okay? 

However, we must avoid absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? ""NOISY"" has N,O,I,S,Y? None of the absent? So it's okay? 

But we also have to consider: if we guess ""NOISY"", then:

- If N is at position 1? Then we might get ✓ for N? 
- I at position 3? If that is correct? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? 

But we are also testing O, S, Y? 

But we don't know if O, S, Y are in the word? 

Another word: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is absent? So avoid? 

""NAILS""? But A is absent? Avoid? 

""NEEDS""? E and D? E absent? Avoid? 

So ""NOISY"" seems possible? 

But we have I at position 3? And we know I is present? 

But what about the position of I? We don't know? 

Another idea: we can try to put I at a position we haven't tested? For example, in guess 2, I was at position 1? So we know it's not 1? But we haven't tested position 2,3,4,5 for I? 

Similarly for N, we haven't tested position 1,3,5? 

So in ""NOISY"", we test N at 1 and I at 3? 

But we also test O at 2, S at 4, Y at 5? 

But we don't know if O, S, Y are present? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N at position 5? For example, ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D? But N at position 4? Wait, ""BLIND"": B1, L2, I3, N4, D5? But position 4? We know N is not at position 4? From guess 1? So we cannot put N at position 4? 

So ""BLIND"" has N at 4? Avoid? 

""ALIGN"": A? Absent? Avoid? 

""OWING"": O,W,I,N,G? N at position 4? Again position 4? Avoid? 

""DOING"": D,O,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put N at position 5? Because many words have N at the end? 

For example, ""TRAIN"": T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? 

""CHAIN"": C and A absent? Avoid? 

So let's list words with N at position 1 or 3 or 5? 

Position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NUDGE""? U absent? Avoid? ""NYLON""? O and L? But has two O? But we don't know? 

""NOISY"" is one. 

Position 3: e.g., ""POINT""? But P absent? Avoid? ""JOINT""? J? And P? No, ""JOINT"" has J,O,I,N,T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? 

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? 

""MINDS"": M,I,N,D,S? N at position 3? And avoids absent? M,I,N,D,S? C,R,A,E,P,U,T are absent? So D is available? 

""MINDS"": M1, I2, N3, D4, S5? 

But we have I at position 2? And N at position 3? 

We know I is present? So it could be at 2? 

Similarly, N at 3? 

But we also test M, D, S? 

But T is absent? But we don't use T? 

So ""MINDS"" is a candidate? 

But we have to check if the letters are available: M, I, N, D, S? All not in absent list? 

Absent: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? So M, I, N, D, S are okay? 

But I and N are known present? 

Now, position 5: e.g., ""HOIST""? H,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? 

""JOINS"": J,O,I,N,S? N at position 4? Avoid? 

""COINS"": C absent? Avoid? 

""RAINS"": R and A absent? Avoid? 

So position 5 for N is difficult? 

Another word: ""SONIC""? C absent? Avoid? 

""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

So perhaps position 1 or 3 are easier? 

We have ""NOISY"" and ""MINDS"" as candidates? 

""MINDS"" has I at position 2? And N at position 3? 

In ""MINDS"", if we guess:
- M at 1: could be anything?
- I at 2: we know I is present? So if it's at position 2? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? 
- N at 3: similarly? 
- D at 4: new letter? 
- S at 5: new letter? 

But we also have to consider that the word might have I at a different position? 

But we are testing I at 2 and N at 3? 

Similarly, in ""NOISY"": N at 1, I at 3? 

But we have more vowels in ""NOISY"" (O and I) vs ""MINDS"" has I and? 

But ""MINDS"" has no other vowel? But I is a vowel? And the word might have only one vowel? Or Y? 

But ""MINDS"" is a valid word? 

Another candidate: ""WINDY"": W,I,N,D,Y? N at position 3? And avoids absent? W,I,N,D,Y? 

""WINDY"": W1, I2, N3, D4, Y5? 

Similar to ""MINDS"" but with W and Y instead of M and S? 

But we don't know which is better? 

We can also consider ""SINCE""? But C and E absent? Avoid? 

Or ""LINGO"": L,I,N,G,O? N at position 3? And O? 

""LINGO"": L1, I2, N3, G4, O5? 

Then we test L, I, N, G, O? 

I at 2, N at 3? 

And avoids absent? 

So ""LINGO"" is a candidate? 

But we have multiple options: ""NOISY"", ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", etc. 

We need to choose one that maximizes new letter coverage? 

We have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,S,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

Common letters: S, L, O, D, M, G, etc. 

""NOISY"" covers O, S, Y? 
""MINDS"" covers M, D, S? 
""WINDY"" covers W, D, Y? 
""LINGO"" covers L, G, O? 

All are good? 

But we also have to consider the position of I? 

In guess 2, we had I at position 1 and it was wrong? So if we put I at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if it's correct, we get a ✓? Or if not, we know it's not at 2? 

Similarly for N at position 3? 

In ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? 

In ""NOISY"", we test I at 3? 

But we haven't tested position 2 for I? 

So testing position 2 for I might be valuable? 

Therefore, ""MINDS"" or ""WINDY"" or ""LINGO"" test I at position 2? 

""NOISY"" tests I at position 3? 

Since we have more positions to test for I (2,3,4,5), testing position 2 might be efficient? 

Similarly, for N, testing position 3? 

So let's choose ""MINDS""? 

But we have to make sure the word is valid? 

""MINDS"" is a valid word? Yes, plural of mind? 

Similarly, ""WINDY"" is valid? 

But ""WINDY"" has Y? Which might be a vowel? 

But both are fine? 

I think ""MINDS"" is good? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has I at a different position? For example, position 4? 

But we don't have a candidate? 

For instance, ""BLIMP""? But M and P? P is absent? Avoid? 

""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K? C absent? Avoid? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""MINDS"". 

But in ""MINDS"", we have D and S? 

Another common word: ""BONDS""? B,O,N,D,S? N at position 3? And O? 

""BONDS"": B1, O2, N3, D4, S5? 

Then we test B, O, N, D, S? 

And I is not included? But we know I is present? So we must include I? Because if we don't include I, we might not get information about it? And we know it's in the word? 

Important: we must include all known present letters? Otherwise, we might waste a guess? 

For example, if we guess ""BONDS"", which has no I, then we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about I? But we already know I is present? So we don't need to confirm that? But we need to find its position? 

If we don't include I, we won't get any feedback on I's position? So we should include I? 

Similarly for N? 

Therefore, we must include both N and I in the guess? 

So ""BONDS"" is invalid because it doesn't have I? 

Similarly, ""NOISY"" has I? ""MINDS"" has I? ""WINDY"" has I? ""LINGO"" has I? 

So all our candidates have I and N? 

Now, among ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", ""NOISY"", which one to choose? 

""NOISY"" has I at position 3? 
""MINDS"" has I at position 2? 
""WINDY"" has I at position 2? 
""LINGO"" has I at position 2? 

Since we haven't tested position 2 for I, it might be good to test it? 

Also, position 3 for N? 

In ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? 

In ""WINDY"", same? 

But ""MINDS"" has S? Which is common? 

""LINGO"" has O? 

I think ""MINDS"" is fine? 

But let's choose ""MINDS"". 

So guess: MINDS

But we must output in the format. 

Another thought: in ""MINDS"", if the word has S at position 5? Or D at 4? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider ""DINGS""? D,I,N,G,S? N at position 3? G and S? 

""DINGS"": D1, I2, N3, G4, S5? 

Similar? 

But ""DINGS"" is a word? Yes? 

But not as common? 

I think ""MINDS"" is better? 

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
  - Letters **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the word.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""input"" → I(-), N(-), P(x), U(x), T(x)**  
  - **I** is **present** but **not in position 1**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 2**.  
  - **P, U, T** are **absent** from the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, U, T (cannot be in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**: **N** and **I** (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).  
   - **N** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback), so it must be in position **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - **I** cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so it must be in position **2, 3, 4, or 5**.  
3. **Word constraints**:  
   - The word must contain **exactly one N and one I** (no evidence of repeated letters so far).  
   - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, U, T).  
   - Uses only untested letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing positions for N and I**:  
  - Test **N in position 3** (a new position not yet ruled out).  
  - Test **I in position 2** (a new position not yet tested).  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Include common untested consonants (e.g., M, D, S) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Do not reuse known-absent letters or retest invalid positions (e.g., N in position 2 or 4).  

### Chosen Guess: ""MINDS""
- **Breakdown**: M (position 1), I (position 2), N (position 3), D (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **N at position 3** (possible location).  
  - Tests **I at position 2** (possible location).  
  - Introduces **new common letters**: M, D, S (all untested and frequent in English).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and adheres to position constraints.  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If **I** is in position 2, it will show ✓.  
  - If **N** is in position 3, it will show ✓.  
  - Feedback on M, D, S will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for N and I while expanding coverage of untested letters.

<guess>minds</guess>",minds,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""input"" -> I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
- I is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1).
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2).
- P, U, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, U, T
- Present letters: N and I (both must be in the word, but not at the positions we've tried)

Specifically:
- N is present but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). So N cannot be at position 2 or 4. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- I is present but not at position 1 (from guess 2). So I must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have limited positions.

Also, we have only two known present letters: N and I. The word must contain both.

Now, we need to think about the positions:

- Position 1: Cannot be I (from guess 2 feedback: I at pos1 is wrong). Also, we don't know what can be there, but it could be N? Or another letter.
- Position 2: Cannot be N (from guess 2: N at pos2 is wrong). Also, it could be I? Or another letter.
- Position 3: Could be N or I? Or something else? But we don't have constraints yet.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (from guess 1: N at pos4 is wrong). But it could be I? Or another letter.
- Position 5: Could be N or I? Or another letter.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them: N and I. So there are three more letters to find, which are not among the absent ones.

Absent letters so far: C, R, A, E, P, U, T. So we must avoid these.

We have used the following letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,U,T. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet minus these.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but standard English).

Common letters to try: S, L, O, D, M, etc.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Contains both N and I (since they are present)
- N is at position 1, 3, or 5 (because not 2 or 4)
- I is not at position 1 (so at 2,3,4,5)
- Avoids C,R,A,E,P,U,T

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Possible positions for N and I:

Case 1: N at position 1
Then I can be at 2,3,4,5? But we have to form a word.

Case 2: N at position 3
Then I at 2,4,5? (not 1, and not 3 if N is there? But I could be at 3? No, because if N is at 3, then I cannot be at 3? Unless repeated letters? But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In Wordle, repetition is allowed? But in this case, we haven't seen any indication of repetition? So we should consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can assume no repetition for now? Because if there is repetition, we might get multiple feedback? But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a repeated letter? So let's assume no repetition? Then each letter is unique? So if N is at position 3, then I cannot be at 3? Similarly for other positions.

Therefore, assuming no repeated letters (since we haven't encountered any evidence of repetition), then:

- If N is at 1, I can be at 2,3,4,5
- If N is at 3, I can be at 2,4,5 (not 1 or 3)
- If N is at 5, I can be at 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5)

Now, we need to cover other positions with new letters.

We should try to choose a word that tests N in one of the possible positions and I in a possible position, and also tests other common letters.

For example, if we put N at position 1, then we can have a word like ""N_ _ _ _"", and include I somewhere.

But we also need to avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- ""NOISY"": But O is available? But we have I and S? But ""NOISY"" has S and Y? But in ""NOISY"": N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we know I is present? So that could be? But we haven't tested O, S, Y? 

But check: from guess 2, we have I at position 1 was wrong? But in ""NOISY"", I is at position 3? That might be okay? 

However, we must avoid absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? ""NOISY"" has N,O,I,S,Y? None of the absent? So it's okay? 

But we also have to consider: if we guess ""NOISY"", then:

- If N is at position 1? Then we might get ✓ for N? 
- I at position 3? If that is correct? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? 

But we are also testing O, S, Y? 

But we don't know if O, S, Y are in the word? 

Another word: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is absent? So avoid? 

""NAILS""? But A is absent? Avoid? 

""NEEDS""? E and D? E absent? Avoid? 

So ""NOISY"" seems possible? 

But we have I at position 3? And we know I is present? 

But what about the position of I? We don't know? 

Another idea: we can try to put I at a position we haven't tested? For example, in guess 2, I was at position 1? So we know it's not 1? But we haven't tested position 2,3,4,5 for I? 

Similarly for N, we haven't tested position 1,3,5? 

So in ""NOISY"", we test N at 1 and I at 3? 

But we also test O at 2, S at 4, Y at 5? 

But we don't know if O, S, Y are present? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N at position 5? For example, ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D? But N at position 4? Wait, ""BLIND"": B1, L2, I3, N4, D5? But position 4? We know N is not at position 4? From guess 1? So we cannot put N at position 4? 

So ""BLIND"" has N at 4? Avoid? 

""ALIGN"": A? Absent? Avoid? 

""OWING"": O,W,I,N,G? N at position 4? Again position 4? Avoid? 

""DOING"": D,O,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put N at position 5? Because many words have N at the end? 

For example, ""TRAIN"": T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? 

""CHAIN"": C and A absent? Avoid? 

So let's list words with N at position 1 or 3 or 5? 

Position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NUDGE""? U absent? Avoid? ""NYLON""? O and L? But has two O? But we don't know? 

""NOISY"" is one. 

Position 3: e.g., ""POINT""? But P absent? Avoid? ""JOINT""? J? And P? No, ""JOINT"" has J,O,I,N,T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? 

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? 

""MINDS"": M,I,N,D,S? N at position 3? And avoids absent? M,I,N,D,S? C,R,A,E,P,U,T are absent? So D is available? 

""MINDS"": M1, I2, N3, D4, S5? 

But we have I at position 2? And N at position 3? 

We know I is present? So it could be at 2? 

Similarly, N at 3? 

But we also test M, D, S? 

But T is absent? But we don't use T? 

So ""MINDS"" is a candidate? 

But we have to check if the letters are available: M, I, N, D, S? All not in absent list? 

Absent: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? So M, I, N, D, S are okay? 

But I and N are known present? 

Now, position 5: e.g., ""HOIST""? H,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? 

""JOINS"": J,O,I,N,S? N at position 4? Avoid? 

""COINS"": C absent? Avoid? 

""RAINS"": R and A absent? Avoid? 

So position 5 for N is difficult? 

Another word: ""SONIC""? C absent? Avoid? 

""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

So perhaps position 1 or 3 are easier? 

We have ""NOISY"" and ""MINDS"" as candidates? 

""MINDS"" has I at position 2? And N at position 3? 

In ""MINDS"", if we guess:
- M at 1: could be anything?
- I at 2: we know I is present? So if it's at position 2? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? 
- N at 3: similarly? 
- D at 4: new letter? 
- S at 5: new letter? 

But we also have to consider that the word might have I at a different position? 

But we are testing I at 2 and N at 3? 

Similarly, in ""NOISY"": N at 1, I at 3? 

But we have more vowels in ""NOISY"" (O and I) vs ""MINDS"" has I and? 

But ""MINDS"" has no other vowel? But I is a vowel? And the word might have only one vowel? Or Y? 

But ""MINDS"" is a valid word? 

Another candidate: ""WINDY"": W,I,N,D,Y? N at position 3? And avoids absent? W,I,N,D,Y? 

""WINDY"": W1, I2, N3, D4, Y5? 

Similar to ""MINDS"" but with W and Y instead of M and S? 

But we don't know which is better? 

We can also consider ""SINCE""? But C and E absent? Avoid? 

Or ""LINGO"": L,I,N,G,O? N at position 3? And O? 

""LINGO"": L1, I2, N3, G4, O5? 

Then we test L, I, N, G, O? 

I at 2, N at 3? 

And avoids absent? 

So ""LINGO"" is a candidate? 

But we have multiple options: ""NOISY"", ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", etc. 

We need to choose one that maximizes new letter coverage? 

We have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,S,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

Common letters: S, L, O, D, M, G, etc. 

""NOISY"" covers O, S, Y? 
""MINDS"" covers M, D, S? 
""WINDY"" covers W, D, Y? 
""LINGO"" covers L, G, O? 

All are good? 

But we also have to consider the position of I? 

In guess 2, we had I at position 1 and it was wrong? So if we put I at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if it's correct, we get a ✓? Or if not, we know it's not at 2? 

Similarly for N at position 3? 

In ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? 

In ""NOISY"", we test I at 3? 

But we haven't tested position 2 for I? 

So testing position 2 for I might be valuable? 

Therefore, ""MINDS"" or ""WINDY"" or ""LINGO"" test I at position 2? 

""NOISY"" tests I at position 3? 

Since we have more positions to test for I (2,3,4,5), testing position 2 might be efficient? 

Similarly, for N, testing position 3? 

So let's choose ""MINDS""? 

But we have to make sure the word is valid? 

""MINDS"" is a valid word? Yes, plural of mind? 

Similarly, ""WINDY"" is valid? 

But ""WINDY"" has Y? Which might be a vowel? 

But both are fine? 

I think ""MINDS"" is good? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has I at a different position? For example, position 4? 

But we don't have a candidate? 

For instance, ""BLIMP""? But M and P? P is absent? Avoid? 

""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K? C absent? Avoid? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""MINDS"". 

But in ""MINDS"", we have D and S? 

Another common word: ""BONDS""? B,O,N,D,S? N at position 3? And O? 

""BONDS"": B1, O2, N3, D4, S5? 

Then we test B, O, N, D, S? 

And I is not included? But we know I is present? So we must include I? Because if we don't include I, we might not get information about it? And we know it's in the word? 

Important: we must include all known present letters? Otherwise, we might waste a guess? 

For example, if we guess ""BONDS"", which has no I, then we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about I? But we already know I is present? So we don't need to confirm that? But we need to find its position? 

If we don't include I, we won't get any feedback on I's position? So we should include I? 

Similarly for N? 

Therefore, we must include both N and I in the guess? 

So ""BONDS"" is invalid because it doesn't have I? 

Similarly, ""NOISY"" has I? ""MINDS"" has I? ""WINDY"" has I? ""LINGO"" has I? 

So all our candidates have I and N? 

Now, among ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", ""NOISY"", which one to choose? 

""NOISY"" has I at position 3? 
""MINDS"" has I at position 2? 
""WINDY"" has I at position 2? 
""LINGO"" has I at position 2? 

Since we haven't tested position 2 for I, it might be good to test it? 

Also, position 3 for N? 

In ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? 

In ""WINDY"", same? 

But ""MINDS"" has S? Which is common? 

""LINGO"" has O? 

I think ""MINDS"" is fine? 

But let's choose ""MINDS"". 

So guess: MINDS

But we must output in the format. 

Another thought: in ""MINDS"", if the word has S at position 5? Or D at 4? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider ""DINGS""? D,I,N,G,S? N at position 3? G and S? 

""DINGS"": D1, I2, N3, G4, S5? 

Similar? 

But ""DINGS"" is a word? Yes? 

But not as common? 

I think ""MINDS"" is better? 

So I'll go with that. 

<guess>minds</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
  - Letters **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the word.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""input"" → I(-), N(-), P(x), U(x), T(x)**  
  - **I** is **present** but **not in position 1**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 2**.  
  - **P, U, T** are **absent** from the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, U, T (cannot be in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**: **N** and **I** (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).  
   - **N** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback), so it must be in position **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - **I** cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so it must be in position **2, 3, 4, or 5**.  
3. **Word constraints**:  
   - The word must contain **exactly one N and one I** (no evidence of repeated letters so far).  
   - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, U, T).  
   - Uses only untested letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing positions for N and I**:  
  - Test **N in position 3** (a new position not yet ruled out).  
  - Test **I in position 2** (a new position not yet tested).  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Include common untested consonants (e.g., M, D, S) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Do not reuse known-absent letters or retest invalid positions (e.g., N in position 2 or 4).  

### Chosen Guess: ""MINDS""
- **Breakdown**: M (position 1), I (position 2), N (position 3), D (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **N at position 3** (possible location).  
  - Tests **I at position 2** (possible location).  
  - Introduces **new common letters**: M, D, S (all untested and frequent in English).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and adheres to position constraints.  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If **I** is in position 2, it will show ✓.  
  - If **N** is in position 3, it will show ✓.  
  - Feedback on M, D, S will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for N and I while expanding coverage of untested letters.",Guess 3: minds -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,bison,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information gained. 
A good starting word should have common letters and a balanced letter distribution. We also want to avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

Common vowels and consonants: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good starter.

But note: The feedback symbols we are using are:
  ✓ : correct letter and position
  - : letter in word but wrong position
  x : letter not in word

For the first guess, any word is acceptable. Let me choose ""CRANE"".

Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word at all (since they got 'x')
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (since it got '-')

So the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the last position (since we placed it at position 4 in ""crane"", which is the 4th letter? Remember, positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E).

Actually, let's clarify the positions:
""c r a n e""
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not in position 4
Position 5: E (x) -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word has the letter N, and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note that position 5 is ruled out? Actually no: position 5 is E which is absent, but N can be in position 5? Wait no, because N is marked as wrong position meaning that if it were in position 5, then when we put N in position 4, it would have shown as present but in wrong position regardless. However, the feedback doesn't tell us what positions it can be, only that it's not in the position we guessed.

Specifically, we know:
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.
- It does contain N, but not at position 4.

So the word has 5 letters, and one of them is N (at position 1,2,3, or 5). But note: if N were at position 5, then in our guess ""crane"" the last letter E is not N, so that could be possible? Actually, the feedback says the letter N is present and that it is not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2,3, or 5.

But we must also note: the word may have repeated letters? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this game, the rules don't specify, but in general, Wordle allows repeated letters. So we have to consider that.

However, in this feedback we have only one N and it's marked as present but wrong position, so if there were two N's then one might be marked correctly, but we don't have that. So for now, assume one N.

Now, we need to choose a second guess that:
- Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent)
- Must include N (but not in the same position as guess 1? Actually, we know N is not at position 4, so if we put N in a different position, that might be good to test).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has N but in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E and now know C,R,A,E are absent; N is present.

So unused common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

We should try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

Possible vowels: O, U, I (since we already tried A and E and they are not in the word). So the remaining vowels are O, I, U? Actually, Y might also be a vowel.

But let's aim for a word that has N in a different position and includes O and I, and other consonants.

Common starting words: maybe ""POINT""? But that has P,O,I,N,T.

Check: P, O, I, N, T. All are new letters? We have not tried any of these.

We know N is in the word, but not at position 4. If we put N at position 5? Then if the word has N at position 5, we might get a '-' or even a '✓' if it's there? Actually, we can test.

But note: we want to place N in one of the positions it might be: position 1,2,3, or 5.

In ""point"", if we put:
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: I
Position 4: N (but wait, in the first guess we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, so now we are putting N at position 4? That might be a bad idea because we already know position 4 is not N? Actually, we know that the word has N but not at position 4, so using N at position 4 again would be inefficient? Because we already know it shouldn't be there.

Better to put N at a position we haven't tried. So avoid position 4? Actually, we can avoid position 4 for N because we know it's wrong.

In ""point"", if we put N at position 4? That is the same as the first guess? Which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

So consider words like:

- N at position 1: ""n_____"" words, e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NAILS"", ""NOTCH"" but avoid C (not allowed) and R,A,E. 

But we don't know if the word has S, L, etc.

Alternatively, put N at position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"", ""KNOCK"" (but K is new? and avoid C? C is absent so we can't use C). So ""SNOUT"" has S,N,O,U,T? But U and O are vowels.

Similarly, position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" but if we use POINT we put N at position 4? Wait, POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> N at position 4. We know N is not at position 4? So that would be a bad choice? Because we already know position 4 is wrong for N.

But wait, in POINT, N is at position 4. Since we know the word's N is not at position 4, then when we guess POINT and put N at position 4, the feedback should show N as '-' (present but wrong position) again? Because the N we put at 4 is the same as before? Actually, it would tell us that we have an N but it's still not in the correct position? That doesn't give new information about the position? Exactly, we already know N isn't at position 4, so guessing a word with N at position 4 will still give '-' for N, but without any new information about its position.

Therefore, it's better to avoid putting N at position 4 again. We should try N at a new position.

So let's choose a word with N at position 1, or 2, or 3, or 5.

Options:

- Position 1: ""N"" words: such as ""NOISE"" (but E is absent? we must avoid E). So ""NOISE"" is invalid because E is absent? Actually, we must use only letters that are possible? We don't know that E is present? Actually, from feedback, E is absent so we cannot use E. Similarly C,R,A,E are out.

So ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E -> E is absent? So we must not use E? Because the rules say we have to guess a valid English word, but we are allowed to use letters that are not in the target if necessary? Actually, yes, but using an absent letter again doesn't give new information? So better not to use absent letters.

Therefore, for our second guess, we should avoid C,R,A,E since we know they are absent.

We must use N and avoid C,R,A,E.

So possible words: with N at position 1: e.g., 

- ""NINNY""? That has repeats? Also uses N multiple times? But we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically we can try, but let's stick without repeats for now.

Better: ""NODES""? But E and S? E we know is absent? So ""NODES"" uses E which is absent? So the feedback would show E as 'x'. Since E is absent, we don't want to waste a letter position? So we should avoid using any of the absent letters (C,R,A,E).

So we must use letters from the untested set: B,D,H,I,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,Y, and so on.

Word with N at position 1 that doesn't use C,R,A,E:

e.g., ""NOULD""? Not a word. ""NOUNS"" -> that has two N's? Also uses U and S.

Better: ""NOISY"" -> N,O,I,S,Y -> no absent letters? Y is a consonant sometimes?. But is ""NOISY"" valid? Yes.

But in ""NOISY"", N is at position 1? Which we don't know if that is right.

Similarly, ""NOSEY""? But E and E is absent? Then we can't use E.

Another: ""POINT"" we avoided because it uses N at position 4? But let's put it aside.

For position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"": S,N,O,W,Y -> avoids C,R,A,E. And N at position 2. W is new.

For position 3: e.g., ""PAINT"": P,A,I,N,T -> but A is absent? A we know is absent? So cannot use A? Because A got 'x' in first guess.

Similarly, position 5: e.g., ""STOWN""? Not a word. ""GROWN""? G is new but R is absent? R we know absent? So ""GROWN"" has R? No.

Another: ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. Yes? And avoids C,R,A,E.

So ""SHOWN"" has N at position 5.

We can choose any of these.

But we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Consider: ""POINT"" is a common word? But if we use it, we put N at position 4? We already know position 4 isn't N? So let's avoid that? So I'll skip ""POINT"".

Alternatively, ""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K -> N at position 4? Again same issue? Position 4 we know isn't N? So we avoid. Therefore, we need the word to have N at a position other than 4.

So words: ""SONIC""? But C is absent? Then we can't use C? So ""SONIC"" uses C? Which is absent? Then avoid.

Let me think of common words:

- ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Positions: M1, I2, N3, T4, S5? So N at position 3? That's a new position? Then we can test.

Also, covers new letters: M, I, T, S? And N at position 3? We already know N is in the word? So we can see if it's at position 3? If we get a ✓ for N at position 3? Or a '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

Similarly, ""LINTS""? Same idea? But L instead? Better to use M?

Another: ""PUNTS"": P,U,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Similar.

But ""PUNTS"" uses U? Which is a vowel? We haven't tested any vowel yet? Except A and E which are absent? So O, I, U are vowels we should try? Because the word must have vowels? And since A and E are absent? Then the vowels must be among O, I, U? Or Y? 

So we should try to include one or two of these.

Let's choose a word that:
1. Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.
2. Includes N (in a position other than 4? Which we have tested as wrong? Actually, we tested position 4? So we can put it at 1,2,3,5).
3. Includes other common letters and vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U, S, T, etc.

Good examples:

- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> no N? Oh, but we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, in Wordle strategy, we are not forced to reuse known present letters? But we have only one known present letter: N. If we don't use N, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include it? To get more feedback? 

But if we don't, we might guess faster if we focus on new entirely? However, we have a present letter? We should try to get its position? 

Therefore, include N.

But in ""MOIST"", no N? So skip.

I think ""POINT"" would be inefficient? Because of position 4? So let's avoid.

Instead, ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N at position 5? And letters: S,H,O,W? All new? And includes vowel O? 

Another: ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y -> N at position 2? U and I are vowels? And Y? 

Then ""UNITY"" seems good: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

We avoid C,R,A,E? Yes.

We can also use ""STING"": S,T,I,N,G -> but N at position 4? Position 4 we know not? So avoid? Then it has N at 4? So skip.

Wait: ""STING"" -> positions: S1, T2, I3, N4, G5? So N at 4? So that's the same as in ""crane"" at position 4? Which we know is wrong? Therefore, don't use words with N at position 4? 

Hence, we must have a word with N at 1,2,3, or 5.

Therefore, let's choose ""UNITY"" or ""SHOWN"" or ""MINTS"".

""MINTS"": M1, I2, N3, T4, S5 -> N at position 3? So that's new? Position 3? 

But also, note: in ""crane"", position 3 was A? Which we know is absent? So the letter at position 3 in the secret word is not A? So when we put I? It might be? 

Similarly, position 4: we had N? Which is present? But not at position 4? So position 4? We don't know? So putting T? etc.

Another thing: the secret word has at least one vowel? Since A and E are absent? Then likely O, I, U, or Y? We haven't tested O,I,U? So in ""MINTS"": I and? M and T?

But ""MINTS"" has I? And no other vowel? Unless Y? But it has I? So it's okay? Or ""MINTY""? Not a word? So we have ""MINTS"".

Similarly, ""POINT"" we avoid? But ""POINT"" has O? And N at position 4? Which we avoid? 

So I think ""MINTS"" is good? because it covers M,I,N,T,S? All common letters? And N in a new position (3)? 

Another candidate: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T -> N at position 2? And U? Vowels I and U.

So ""INPUT"": I at 1, N at 2, P at 3, U at 4, T at 5? Avoids C,R,A,E? Yes? And covers two vowels? I and U? 

Better than ""MINTS"" which has only one vowel? Because ""INPUT"" has two vowels? 

But note: we don't know how many vowels? But having more vowels might be helpful? 

So between ""INPUT"" and ""MINTS"":

""INPUT"": letters I,N,P,U,T -> new letters: I,P,U,T? And we know N? 
""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> new letters M,I,T,S? 

Both have I? Both have T? 

""INPUT"" covers P and U? While ""MINTS"" covers M and S? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Also, ""INPUT"" has N at position 2? ""MINTS"" at position 3? 

We can choose either? 

Perhaps ""INPUT"" might be better? Because P and U might be useful? 

Let me consider a word that puts N at position 1: ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T -> but G and H? And avoids E and A? C,R? G and H are new? 

But we haven't tested G,H? 

""LIONS"": L,I,O,N,S -> N at position 4? Oh, position 4? Avoid? 

So ""LUNGS"": L,U,N,G,S -> N at position 3? Position 3? And letter U? G?

But we don't know about G? 

But we have S? 

Another word: ""POISE"" has E? E absent? So avoid? 

""OUNCE"" has E? Avoid? 

Therefore, let's go with ""INPUT""? 

But note: if the word has U? Then we test that? And P? 

Similarly, we can use ""SHUNT"": S,H,U,N,T -> N at position 4? Again position 4? We avoid? 

So not? 

Therefore, position for N must be new? 

So ""INPUT"": N at position 2? That's good? 

And ""QUINT""? Q is less common? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is valid? 

Let me confirm: feedback is for only the letters? So when we guess ""INPUT"", it will give us feedback for each letter? But since C,R,A,E are absent? They are not? But we won't use them? 

So guess: ""INPUT""

We hope to get information about N's position and coverage on I,U,P,T? 

But note: N at position 2? If that is the right position? Then ✓, else - or x? But since N is in the word, it must be -? Or if it is at position 2? Then ✓? 

Then also for other positions? 

So I think ""INPUT"" is a good second guess? 

Another option: ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y? No T? But has O? 

Then ""NOISY"" has N at position 1? And O? 

But Y might be vowel? 

Similarly, ""JOINS"": J not common? 

Or ""COINS"": C? Absent? So avoid? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""INPUT"". 

So second guess: INPUTBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4.
- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and exclude C, R, A, E.

For the second guess:
- We should choose a word that avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- We must include N to gather more information about its position.
- Since N cannot be in position 4 (based on first feedback), we prioritize placing N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5) to test efficiency.
- We also aim to test new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants to maximize feedback coverage.

A strong candidate is ""input"":
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- It includes N (in position 2, a new untested position).
- It covers new common vowels (I and U).
- It introduces new consonants (P and T), which are frequent in English words.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if N is at position 2 (✓ if correct, - if elsewhere).
- Reveal if I, P, U, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

Alternative considered words like ""mints"" (N at position 3) or ""shown"" (N at position 5) were also evaluated, but ""input"" provides broader vowel coverage and uses equally common letters.

- P, U, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, U, T
- Present letters: N and I (both must be in the word, but not at the positions we've tried)

Specifically:
- N is present but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). So N cannot be at position 2 or 4. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- I is present but not at position 1 (from guess 2). So I must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have limited positions.

Also, we have only two known present letters: N and I. The word must contain both.

Now, we need to think about the positions:

- Position 1: Cannot be I (from guess 2 feedback: I at pos1 is wrong). Also, we don't know what can be there, but it could be N? Or another letter.
- Position 2: Cannot be N (from guess 2: N at pos2 is wrong). Also, it could be I? Or another letter.
- Position 3: Could be N or I? Or something else? But we don't have constraints yet.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (from guess 1: N at pos4 is wrong). But it could be I? Or another letter.
- Position 5: Could be N or I? Or another letter.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them: N and I. So there are three more letters to find, which are not among the absent ones.

Absent letters so far: C, R, A, E, P, U, T. So we must avoid these.

We have used the following letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,U,T. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet minus these.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but standard English).

Common letters to try: S, L, O, D, M, etc.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Contains both N and I (since they are present)
- N is at position 1, 3, or 5 (because not 2 or 4)
- I is not at position 1 (so at 2,3,4,5)
- Avoids C,R,A,E,P,U,T

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Possible positions for N and I:

Case 1: N at position 1
Then I can be at 2,3,4,5? But we have to form a word.

Case 2: N at position 3
Then I at 2,4,5? (not 1, and not 3 if N is there? But I could be at 3? No, because if N is at 3, then I cannot be at 3? Unless repeated letters? But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In Wordle, repetition is allowed? But in this case, we haven't seen any indication of repetition? So we should consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can assume no repetition for now? Because if there is repetition, we might get multiple feedback? But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a repeated letter? So let's assume no repetition? Then each letter is unique? So if N is at position 3, then I cannot be at 3? Similarly for other positions.

Therefore, assuming no repeated letters (since we haven't encountered any evidence of repetition), then:

- If N is at 1, I can be at 2,3,4,5
- If N is at 3, I can be at 2,4,5 (not 1 or 3)
- If N is at 5, I can be at 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5)

Now, we need to cover other positions with new letters.

We should try to choose a word that tests N in one of the possible positions and I in a possible position, and also tests other common letters.

For example, if we put N at position 1, then we can have a word like ""N_ _ _ _"", and include I somewhere.

But we also need to avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- ""NOISY"": But O is available? But we have I and S? But ""NOISY"" has S and Y? But in ""NOISY"": N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we know I is present? So that could be? But we haven't tested O, S, Y? 

But check: from guess 2, we have I at position 1 was wrong? But in ""NOISY"", I is at position 3? That might be okay? 

However, we must avoid absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? ""NOISY"" has N,O,I,S,Y? None of the absent? So it's okay? 

But we also have to consider: if we guess ""NOISY"", then:

- If N is at position 1? Then we might get ✓ for N? 
- I at position 3? If that is correct? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? 

But we are also testing O, S, Y? 

But we don't know if O, S, Y are in the word? 

Another word: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is absent? So avoid? 

""NAILS""? But A is absent? Avoid? 

""NEEDS""? E and D? E absent? Avoid? 

So ""NOISY"" seems possible? 

But we have I at position 3? And we know I is present? 

But what about the position of I? We don't know? 

Another idea: we can try to put I at a position we haven't tested? For example, in guess 2, I was at position 1? So we know it's not 1? But we haven't tested position 2,3,4,5 for I? 

Similarly for N, we haven't tested position 1,3,5? 

So in ""NOISY"", we test N at 1 and I at 3? 

But we also test O at 2, S at 4, Y at 5? 

But we don't know if O, S, Y are present? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N at position 5? For example, ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D? But N at position 4? Wait, ""BLIND"": B1, L2, I3, N4, D5? But position 4? We know N is not at position 4? From guess 1? So we cannot put N at position 4? 

So ""BLIND"" has N at 4? Avoid? 

""ALIGN"": A? Absent? Avoid? 

""OWING"": O,W,I,N,G? N at position 4? Again position 4? Avoid? 

""DOING"": D,O,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put N at position 5? Because many words have N at the end? 

For example, ""TRAIN"": T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? 

""CHAIN"": C and A absent? Avoid? 

So let's list words with N at position 1 or 3 or 5? 

Position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NUDGE""? U absent? Avoid? ""NYLON""? O and L? But has two O? But we don't know? 

""NOISY"" is one. 

Position 3: e.g., ""POINT""? But P absent? Avoid? ""JOINT""? J? And P? No, ""JOINT"" has J,O,I,N,T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? 

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? 

""MINDS"": M,I,N,D,S? N at position 3? And avoids absent? M,I,N,D,S? C,R,A,E,P,U,T are absent? So D is available? 

""MINDS"": M1, I2, N3, D4, S5? 

But we have I at position 2? And N at position 3? 

We know I is present? So it could be at 2? 

Similarly, N at 3? 

But we also test M, D, S? 

But T is absent? But we don't use T? 

So ""MINDS"" is a candidate? 

But we have to check if the letters are available: M, I, N, D, S? All not in absent list? 

Absent: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? So M, I, N, D, S are okay? 

But I and N are known present? 

Now, position 5: e.g., ""HOIST""? H,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? 

""JOINS"": J,O,I,N,S? N at position 4? Avoid? 

""COINS"": C absent? Avoid? 

""RAINS"": R and A absent? Avoid? 

So position 5 for N is difficult? 

Another word: ""SONIC""? C absent? Avoid? 

""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? 

So perhaps position 1 or 3 are easier? 

We have ""NOISY"" and ""MINDS"" as candidates? 

""MINDS"" has I at position 2? And N at position 3? 

In ""MINDS"", if we guess:
- M at 1: could be anything?
- I at 2: we know I is present? So if it's at position 2? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? 
- N at 3: similarly? 
- D at 4: new letter? 
- S at 5: new letter? 

But we also have to consider that the word might have I at a different position? 

But we are testing I at 2 and N at 3? 

Similarly, in ""NOISY"": N at 1, I at 3? 

But we have more vowels in ""NOISY"" (O and I) vs ""MINDS"" has I and? 

But ""MINDS"" has no other vowel? But I is a vowel? And the word might have only one vowel? Or Y? 

But ""MINDS"" is a valid word? 

Another candidate: ""WINDY"": W,I,N,D,Y? N at position 3? And avoids absent? W,I,N,D,Y? 

""WINDY"": W1, I2, N3, D4, Y5? 

Similar to ""MINDS"" but with W and Y instead of M and S? 

But we don't know which is better? 

We can also consider ""SINCE""? But C and E absent? Avoid? 

Or ""LINGO"": L,I,N,G,O? N at position 3? And O? 

""LINGO"": L1, I2, N3, G4, O5? 

Then we test L, I, N, G, O? 

I at 2, N at 3? 

And avoids absent? 

So ""LINGO"" is a candidate? 

But we have multiple options: ""NOISY"", ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", etc. 

We need to choose one that maximizes new letter coverage? 

We have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,S,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

Common letters: S, L, O, D, M, G, etc. 

""NOISY"" covers O, S, Y? 
""MINDS"" covers M, D, S? 
""WINDY"" covers W, D, Y? 
""LINGO"" covers L, G, O? 

All are good? 

But we also have to consider the position of I? 

In guess 2, we had I at position 1 and it was wrong? So if we put I at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if it's correct, we get a ✓? Or if not, we know it's not at 2? 

Similarly for N at position 3? 

In ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? 

In ""NOISY"", we test I at 3? 

But we haven't tested position 2 for I? 

So testing position 2 for I might be valuable? 

Therefore, ""MINDS"" or ""WINDY"" or ""LINGO"" test I at position 2? 

""NOISY"" tests I at position 3? 

Since we have more positions to test for I (2,3,4,5), testing position 2 might be efficient? 

Similarly, for N, testing position 3? 

So let's choose ""MINDS""? 

But we have to make sure the word is valid? 

""MINDS"" is a valid word? Yes, plural of mind? 

Similarly, ""WINDY"" is valid? 

But ""WINDY"" has Y? Which might be a vowel? 

But both are fine? 

I think ""MINDS"" is good? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has I at a different position? For example, position 4? 

But we don't have a candidate? 

For instance, ""BLIMP""? But M and P? P is absent? Avoid? 

""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K? C absent? Avoid? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""MINDS"". 

But in ""MINDS"", we have D and S? 

Another common word: ""BONDS""? B,O,N,D,S? N at position 3? And O? 

""BONDS"": B1, O2, N3, D4, S5? 

Then we test B, O, N, D, S? 

And I is not included? But we know I is present? So we must include I? Because if we don't include I, we might not get information about it? And we know it's in the word? 

Important: we must include all known present letters? Otherwise, we might waste a guess? 

For example, if we guess ""BONDS"", which has no I, then we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about I? But we already know I is present? So we don't need to confirm that? But we need to find its position? 

If we don't include I, we won't get any feedback on I's position? So we should include I? 

Similarly for N? 

Therefore, we must include both N and I in the guess? 

So ""BONDS"" is invalid because it doesn't have I? 

Similarly, ""NOISY"" has I? ""MINDS"" has I? ""WINDY"" has I? ""LINGO"" has I? 

So all our candidates have I and N? 

Now, among ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", ""NOISY"", which one to choose? 

""NOISY"" has I at position 3? 
""MINDS"" has I at position 2? 
""WINDY"" has I at position 2? 
""LINGO"" has I at position 2? 

Since we haven't tested position 2 for I, it might be good to test it? 

Also, position 3 for N? 

In ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? 

In ""WINDY"", same? 

But ""MINDS"" has S? Which is common? 

""LINGO"" has O? 

I think ""MINDS"" is fine? 

But let's choose ""MINDS"". 

So guess: MINDS

But we must output in the format. 

Another thought: in ""MINDS"", if the word has S at position 5? Or D at 4? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider ""DINGS""? D,I,N,G,S? N at position 3? G and S? 

""DINGS"": D1, I2, N3, G4, S5? 

Similar? 

But ""DINGS"" is a word? Yes? 

But not as common? 

I think ""MINDS"" is better? 

So I'll go with that. 

<guess>minds</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
  - Letters **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the word.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""input"" → I(-), N(-), P(x), U(x), T(x)**  
  - **I** is **present** but **not in position 1**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 2**.  
  - **P, U, T** are **absent** from the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, U, T (cannot be in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**: **N** and **I** (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).  
   - **N** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback), so it must be in position **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - **I** cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so it must be in position **2, 3, 4, or 5**.  
3. **Word constraints**:  
   - The word must contain **exactly one N and one I** (no evidence of repeated letters so far).  
   - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, U, T).  
   - Uses only untested letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing positions for N and I**:  
  - Test **N in position 3** (a new position not yet ruled out).  
  - Test **I in position 2** (a new position not yet tested).  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Include common untested consonants (e.g., M, D, S) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Do not reuse known-absent letters or retest invalid positions (e.g., N in position 2 or 4).  

### Chosen Guess: ""MINDS""
- **Breakdown**: M (position 1), I (position 2), N (position 3), D (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **N at position 3** (possible location).  
  - Tests **I at position 2** (possible location).  
  - Introduces **new common letters**: M, D, S (all untested and frequent in English).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and adheres to position constraints.  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If **I** is in position 2, it will show ✓.  
  - If **N** is in position 3, it will show ✓.  
  - Feedback on M, D, S will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for N and I while expanding coverage of untested letters.

Remember, positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E).\n\nActually, let\'s clarify the positions:\n""c r a n e""\nPosition 1: C (x) -> not in word\nPosition 2: R (x) -> not in word\nPosition 3: A (x) -> not in word\nPosition 4: N (-) -> in word, but not in position 4\nPosition 5: E (x) -> not in word\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the letter N, and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note that position 5 is ruled out? Actually no: position 5 is E which is absent, but N can be in position 5? Wait no, because N is marked as wrong position meaning that if it were in position 5, then when we put N in position 4, it would have shown as present but in wrong position regardless. However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us what positions it can be, only that it\'s not in the position we guessed.\n\nSpecifically, we know:\n- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.\n- It does contain N, but not at position 4.\n\nSo the word has 5 letters, and one of them is N (at position 1,2,3, or 5). But note: if N were at position 5, then in our guess ""crane"" the last letter E is not N, so that could be possible? Actually, the feedback says the letter N is present and that it is not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nBut we must also note: the word may have repeated letters? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this game, the rules don\'t specify, but in general, Wordle allows repeated letters. So we have to consider that.\n\nHowever, in this feedback we have only one N and it\'s marked as present but wrong position, so if there were two N\'s then one might be marked correctly, but we don\'t have that. So for now, assume one N.\n\nNow, we need to choose a second guess that:\n- Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent)\n- Must include N (but not in the same position as guess 1? Actually, we know N is not at position 4, so if we put N in a different position, that might be good to test).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has N but in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have tested: C, R, A, N, E and now know C,R,A,E are absent; N is present.\n\nSo unused common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover more vowels and common consonants.\n\nPossible vowels: O, U, I (since we already tried A and E and they are not in the word). So the remaining vowels are O, I, U? Actually, Y might also be a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s aim for a word that has N in a different position and includes O and I, and other consonants.\n\nCommon starting words: maybe ""POINT""? But that has P,O,I,N,T.\n\nCheck: P, O, I, N, T. All are new letters? We have not tried any of these.\n\nWe know N is in the word, but not at position 4. If we put N at position 5? Then if the word has N at position 5, we might get a \'-\' or even a \'✓\' if it\'s there? Actually, we can test.\n\nBut note: we want to place N in one of the positions it might be: position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nIn ""point"", if we put:\nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: O\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: N (but wait, in the first guess we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, so now we are putting N at position 4? That might be a bad idea because we already know position 4 is not N? Actually, we know that the word has N but not at position 4, so using N at position 4 again would be inefficient? Because we already know it shouldn\'t be there.\n\nBetter to put N at a position we haven\'t tried. So avoid position 4? Actually, we can avoid position 4 for N because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nIn ""point"", if we put N at position 4? That is the same as the first guess? Which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nWe need a word that has N in position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nSo consider words like:\n\n- N at position 1: ""n_____"" words, e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NAILS"", ""NOTCH"" but avoid C (not allowed) and R,A,E. \n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, L, etc.\n\nAlternatively, put N at position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"", ""KNOCK"" (but K is new? and avoid C? C is absent so we can\'t use C). So ""SNOUT"" has S,N,O,U,T? But U and O are vowels.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" but if we use POINT we put N at position 4? Wait, POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> N at position 4. We know N is not at position 4? So that would be a bad choice? Because we already know position 4 is wrong for N.\n\nBut wait, in POINT, N is at position 4. Since we know the word\'s N is not at position 4, then when we guess POINT and put N at position 4, the feedback should show N as \'-\' (present but wrong position) again? Because the N we put at 4 is the same as before? Actually, it would tell us that we have an N but it\'s still not in the correct position? That doesn\'t give new information about the position? Exactly, we already know N isn\'t at position 4, so guessing a word with N at position 4 will still give \'-\' for N, but without any new information about its position.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to avoid putting N at position 4 again. We should try N at a new position.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with N at position 1, or 2, or 3, or 5.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Position 1: ""N"" words: such as ""NOISE"" (but E is absent? we must avoid E). So ""NOISE"" is invalid because E is absent? Actually, we must use only letters that are possible? We don\'t know that E is present? Actually, from feedback, E is absent so we cannot use E. Similarly C,R,A,E are out.\n\nSo ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E -> E is absent? So we must not use E? Because the rules say we have to guess a valid English word, but we are allowed to use letters that are not in the target if necessary? Actually, yes, but using an absent letter again doesn\'t give new information? So better not to use absent letters.\n\nTherefore, for our second guess, we should avoid C,R,A,E since we know they are absent.\n\nWe must use N and avoid C,R,A,E.\n\nSo possible words: with N at position 1: e.g., \n\n- ""NINNY""? That has repeats? Also uses N multiple times? But we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically we can try, but let\'s stick without repeats for now.\n\nBetter: ""NODES""? But E and S? E we know is absent? So ""NODES"" uses E which is absent? So the feedback would show E as \'x\'. Since E is absent, we don\'t want to waste a letter position? So we should avoid using any of the absent letters (C,R,A,E).\n\nSo we must use letters from the untested set: B,D,H,I,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,Y, and so on.\n\nWord with N at position 1 that doesn\'t use C,R,A,E:\n\ne.g., ""NOULD""? Not a word. ""NOUNS"" -> that has two N\'s? Also uses U and S.\n\nBetter: ""NOISY"" -> N,O,I,S,Y -> no absent letters? Y is a consonant sometimes?. But is ""NOISY"" valid? Yes.\n\nBut in ""NOISY"", N is at position 1? Which we don\'t know if that is right.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOSEY""? But E and E is absent? Then we can\'t use E.\n\nAnother: ""POINT"" we avoided because it uses N at position 4? But let\'s put it aside.\n\nFor position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"": S,N,O,W,Y -> avoids C,R,A,E. And N at position 2. W is new.\n\nFor position 3: e.g., ""PAINT"": P,A,I,N,T -> but A is absent? A we know is absent? So cannot use A? Because A got \'x\' in first guess.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: e.g., ""STOWN""? Not a word. ""GROWN""? G is new but R is absent? R we know absent? So ""GROWN"" has R? No.\n\nAnother: ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. Yes? And avoids C,R,A,E.\n\nSo ""SHOWN"" has N at position 5.\n\nWe can choose any of these.\n\nBut we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nConsider: ""POINT"" is a common word? But if we use it, we put N at position 4? We already know position 4 isn\'t N? So let\'s avoid that? So I\'ll skip ""POINT"".\n\nAlternatively, ""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K -> N at position 4? Again same issue? Position 4 we know isn\'t N? So we avoid. Therefore, we need the word to have N at a position other than 4.\n\nSo words: ""SONIC""? But C is absent? Then we can\'t use C? So ""SONIC"" uses C? Which is absent? Then avoid.\n\nLet me think of common words:\n\n- ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Positions: M1, I2, N3, T4, S5? So N at position 3? That\'s a new position? Then we can test.\n\nAlso, covers new letters: M, I, T, S? And N at position 3? We already know N is in the word? So we can see if it\'s at position 3? If we get a ✓ for N at position 3? Or a \'-\' meaning it\'s elsewhere? \n\nSimilarly, ""LINTS""? Same idea? But L instead? Better to use M?\n\nAnother: ""PUNTS"": P,U,N,T,S -> N at position 3? Similar.\n\nBut ""PUNTS"" uses U? Which is a vowel? We haven\'t tested any vowel yet? Except A and E which are absent? So O, I, U are vowels we should try? Because the word must have vowels? And since A and E are absent? Then the vowels must be among O, I, U? Or Y? \n\nSo we should try to include one or two of these.\n\nLet\'s choose a word that:\n1. Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.\n2. Includes N (in a position other than 4? Which we have tested as wrong? Actually, we tested position 4? So we can put it at 1,2,3,5).\n3. Includes other common letters and vowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U, S, T, etc.\n\nGood examples:\n\n- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> no N? Oh, but we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, in Wordle strategy, we are not forced to reuse known present letters? But we have only one known present letter: N. If we don\'t use N, we won\'t get information about its position? So it\'s better to include it? To get more feedback? \n\nBut if we don\'t, we might guess faster if we focus on new entirely? However, we have a present letter? We should try to get its position? \n\nTherefore, include N.\n\nBut in ""MOIST"", no N? So skip.\n\nI think ""POINT"" would be inefficient? Because of position 4? So let\'s avoid.\n\nInstead, ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N at position 5? And letters: S,H,O,W? All new? And includes vowel O? \n\nAnother: ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y -> N at position 2? U and I are vowels? And Y? \n\nThen ""UNITY"" seems good: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\nWe avoid C,R,A,E? Yes.\n\nWe can also use ""STING"": S,T,I,N,G -> but N at position 4? Position 4 we know not? So avoid? Then it has N at 4? So skip.\n\nWait: ""STING"" -> positions: S1, T2, I3, N4, G5? So N at 4? So that\'s the same as in ""crane"" at position 4? Which we know is wrong? Therefore, don\'t use words with N at position 4? \n\nHence, we must have a word with N at 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose ""UNITY"" or ""SHOWN"" or ""MINTS"".\n\n""MINTS"": M1, I2, N3, T4, S5 -> N at position 3? So that\'s new? Position 3? \n\nBut also, note: in ""crane"", position 3 was A? Which we know is absent? So the letter at position 3 in the secret word is not A? So when we put I? It might be? \n\nSimilarly, position 4: we had N? Which is present? But not at position 4? So position 4? We don\'t know? So putting T? etc.\n\nAnother thing: the secret word has at least one vowel? Since A and E are absent? Then likely O, I, U, or Y? We haven\'t tested O,I,U? So in ""MINTS"": I and? M and T?\n\nBut ""MINTS"" has I? And no other vowel? Unless Y? But it has I? So it\'s okay? Or ""MINTY""? Not a word? So we have ""MINTS"".\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"" we avoid? But ""POINT"" has O? And N at position 4? Which we avoid? \n\nSo I think ""MINTS"" is good? because it covers M,I,N,T,S? All common letters? And N in a new position (3)? \n\nAnother candidate: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T -> N at position 2? And U? Vowels I and U.\n\nSo ""INPUT"": I at 1, N at 2, P at 3, U at 4, T at 5? Avoids C,R,A,E? Yes? And covers two vowels? I and U? \n\nBetter than ""MINTS"" which has only one vowel? Because ""INPUT"" has two vowels? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know how many vowels? But having more vowels might be helpful? \n\nSo between ""INPUT"" and ""MINTS"":\n\n""INPUT"": letters I,N,P,U,T -> new letters: I,P,U,T? And we know N? \n""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> new letters M,I,T,S? \n\nBoth have I? Both have T? \n\n""INPUT"" covers P and U? While ""MINTS"" covers M and S? \n\nBut we don\'t know which are more common? \n\nAlso, ""INPUT"" has N at position 2? ""MINTS"" at position 3? \n\nWe can choose either? \n\nPerhaps ""INPUT"" might be better? Because P and U might be useful? \n\nLet me consider a word that puts N at position 1: ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T -> but G and H? And avoids E and A? C,R? G and H are new? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested G,H? \n\n""LIONS"": L,I,O,N,S -> N at position 4? Oh, position 4? Avoid? \n\nSo ""LUNGS"": L,U,N,G,S -> N at position 3? Position 3? And letter U? G?\n\nBut we don\'t know about G? \n\nBut we have S? \n\nAnother word: ""POISE"" has E? E absent? So avoid? \n\n""OUNCE"" has E? Avoid? \n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""INPUT""? \n\nBut note: if the word has U? Then we test that? And P? \n\nSimilarly, we can use ""SHUNT"": S,H,U,N,T -> N at position 4? Again position 4? We avoid? \n\nSo not? \n\nTherefore, position for N must be new? \n\nSo ""INPUT"": N at position 2? That\'s good? \n\nAnd ""QUINT""? Q is less common? \n\nSo I think ""INPUT"" is valid? \n\nLet me confirm: feedback is for only the letters? So when we guess ""INPUT"", it will give us feedback for each letter? But since C,R,A,E are absent? They are not? But we won\'t use them? \n\nSo guess: ""INPUT""\n\nWe hope to get information about N\'s position and coverage on I,U,P,T? \n\nBut note: N at position 2? If that is the right position? Then ✓, else - or x? But since N is in the word, it must be -? Or if it is at position 2? Then ✓? \n\nThen also for other positions? \n\nSo I think ""INPUT"" is a good second guess? \n\nAnother option: ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y? No T? But has O? \n\nThen ""NOISY"" has N at position 1? And O? \n\nBut Y might be vowel? \n\nSimilarly, ""JOINS"": J not common? \n\nOr ""COINS"": C? Absent? So avoid? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""INPUT"". \n\nSo second guess: INPUTBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)), we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4.\n- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.\n- Therefore, the secret word must include N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and exclude C, R, A, E.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- We should choose a word that avoids C, R, A, E entirely.\n- We must include N to gather more information about its position.\n- Since N cannot be in position 4 (based on first feedback), we prioritize placing N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5) to test efficiency.\n- We also aim to test new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants to maximize feedback coverage.\n\nA strong candidate is ""input"":\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n- It includes N (in position 2, a new untested position).\n- It covers new common vowels (I and U).\n- It introduces new consonants (P and T), which are frequent in English words.\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if N is at position 2 (✓ if correct, - if elsewhere).\n- Reveal if I, P, U, or T are in the word and their potential positions.\n\nAlternative considered words like ""mints"" (N at position 3) or ""shown"" (N at position 5) were also evaluated, but ""input"" provides broader vowel coverage and uses equally common letters.\n\n<guess>input</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: input -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""input"" -> I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)\nMeaning:\n- I is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1).\n- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2).\n- P, U, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, U, T\n- Present letters: N and I (both must be in the word, but not at the positions we\'ve tried)\n\nSpecifically:\n- N is present but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). So N cannot be at position 2 or 4. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.\n- I is present but not at position 1 (from guess 2). So I must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have limited positions.\n\nAlso, we have only two known present letters: N and I. The word must contain both.\n\nNow, we need to think about the positions:\n\n- Position 1: Cannot be I (from guess 2 feedback: I at pos1 is wrong). Also, we don\'t know what can be there, but it could be N? Or another letter.\n- Position 2: Cannot be N (from guess 2: N at pos2 is wrong). Also, it could be I? Or another letter.\n- Position 3: Could be N or I? Or something else? But we don\'t have constraints yet.\n- Position 4: Cannot be N (from guess 1: N at pos4 is wrong). But it could be I? Or another letter.\n- Position 5: Could be N or I? Or another letter.\n\nBut note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them: N and I. So there are three more letters to find, which are not among the absent ones.\n\nAbsent letters so far: C, R, A, E, P, U, T. So we must avoid these.\n\nWe have used the following letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,U,T. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet minus these.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but standard English).\n\nCommon letters to try: S, L, O, D, M, etc.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that:\n- Contains both N and I (since they are present)\n- N is at position 1, 3, or 5 (because not 2 or 4)\n- I is not at position 1 (so at 2,3,4,5)\n- Avoids C,R,A,E,P,U,T\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.\n\nPossible positions for N and I:\n\nCase 1: N at position 1\nThen I can be at 2,3,4,5? But we have to form a word.\n\nCase 2: N at position 3\nThen I at 2,4,5? (not 1, and not 3 if N is there? But I could be at 3? No, because if N is at 3, then I cannot be at 3? Unless repeated letters? But we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? In Wordle, repetition is allowed? But in this case, we haven\'t seen any indication of repetition? So we should consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can assume no repetition for now? Because if there is repetition, we might get multiple feedback? But in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen a repeated letter? So let\'s assume no repetition? Then each letter is unique? So if N is at position 3, then I cannot be at 3? Similarly for other positions.\n\nTherefore, assuming no repeated letters (since we haven\'t encountered any evidence of repetition), then:\n\n- If N is at 1, I can be at 2,3,4,5\n- If N is at 3, I can be at 2,4,5 (not 1 or 3)\n- If N is at 5, I can be at 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5)\n\nNow, we need to cover other positions with new letters.\n\nWe should try to choose a word that tests N in one of the possible positions and I in a possible position, and also tests other common letters.\n\nFor example, if we put N at position 1, then we can have a word like ""N_ _ _ _"", and include I somewhere.\n\nBut we also need to avoid the absent letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""NOISY"": But O is available? But we have I and S? But ""NOISY"" has S and Y? But in ""NOISY"": N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we know I is present? So that could be? But we haven\'t tested O, S, Y? \n\nBut check: from guess 2, we have I at position 1 was wrong? But in ""NOISY"", I is at position 3? That might be okay? \n\nHowever, we must avoid absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? ""NOISY"" has N,O,I,S,Y? None of the absent? So it\'s okay? \n\nBut we also have to consider: if we guess ""NOISY"", then:\n\n- If N is at position 1? Then we might get ✓ for N? \n- I at position 3? If that is correct? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? \n\nBut we are also testing O, S, Y? \n\nBut we don\'t know if O, S, Y are in the word? \n\nAnother word: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is absent? So avoid? \n\n""NAILS""? But A is absent? Avoid? \n\n""NEEDS""? E and D? E absent? Avoid? \n\nSo ""NOISY"" seems possible? \n\nBut we have I at position 3? And we know I is present? \n\nBut what about the position of I? We don\'t know? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to put I at a position we haven\'t tested? For example, in guess 2, I was at position 1? So we know it\'s not 1? But we haven\'t tested position 2,3,4,5 for I? \n\nSimilarly for N, we haven\'t tested position 1,3,5? \n\nSo in ""NOISY"", we test N at 1 and I at 3? \n\nBut we also test O at 2, S at 4, Y at 5? \n\nBut we don\'t know if O, S, Y are present? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N at position 5? For example, ""BLIND"": B,L,I,N,D? But N at position 4? Wait, ""BLIND"": B1, L2, I3, N4, D5? But position 4? We know N is not at position 4? From guess 1? So we cannot put N at position 4? \n\nSo ""BLIND"" has N at 4? Avoid? \n\n""ALIGN"": A? Absent? Avoid? \n\n""OWING"": O,W,I,N,G? N at position 4? Again position 4? Avoid? \n\n""DOING"": D,O,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? \n\nSo it\'s hard to put N at position 5? Because many words have N at the end? \n\nFor example, ""TRAIN"": T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? \n\n""CHAIN"": C and A absent? Avoid? \n\nSo let\'s list words with N at position 1 or 3 or 5? \n\nPosition 1: e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NUDGE""? U absent? Avoid? ""NYLON""? O and L? But has two O? But we don\'t know? \n\n""NOISY"" is one. \n\nPosition 3: e.g., ""POINT""? But P absent? Avoid? ""JOINT""? J? And P? No, ""JOINT"" has J,O,I,N,T? But T is absent? From guess 2? T is absent? So avoid? \n\n""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? \n\n""MINDS"": M,I,N,D,S? N at position 3? And avoids absent? M,I,N,D,S? C,R,A,E,P,U,T are absent? So D is available? \n\n""MINDS"": M1, I2, N3, D4, S5? \n\nBut we have I at position 2? And N at position 3? \n\nWe know I is present? So it could be at 2? \n\nSimilarly, N at 3? \n\nBut we also test M, D, S? \n\nBut T is absent? But we don\'t use T? \n\nSo ""MINDS"" is a candidate? \n\nBut we have to check if the letters are available: M, I, N, D, S? All not in absent list? \n\nAbsent: C,R,A,E,P,U,T? So M, I, N, D, S are okay? \n\nBut I and N are known present? \n\nNow, position 5: e.g., ""HOIST""? H,O,I,S,T? But T absent? Avoid? \n\n""JOINS"": J,O,I,N,S? N at position 4? Avoid? \n\n""COINS"": C absent? Avoid? \n\n""RAINS"": R and A absent? Avoid? \n\nSo position 5 for N is difficult? \n\nAnother word: ""SONIC""? C absent? Avoid? \n\n""LYING"": L,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? \n\n""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G? N at position 4? Avoid? \n\nSo perhaps position 1 or 3 are easier? \n\nWe have ""NOISY"" and ""MINDS"" as candidates? \n\n""MINDS"" has I at position 2? And N at position 3? \n\nIn ""MINDS"", if we guess:\n- M at 1: could be anything?\n- I at 2: we know I is present? So if it\'s at position 2? Then ✓? Or if not, then -? \n- N at 3: similarly? \n- D at 4: new letter? \n- S at 5: new letter? \n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have I at a different position? \n\nBut we are testing I at 2 and N at 3? \n\nSimilarly, in ""NOISY"": N at 1, I at 3? \n\nBut we have more vowels in ""NOISY"" (O and I) vs ""MINDS"" has I and? \n\nBut ""MINDS"" has no other vowel? But I is a vowel? And the word might have only one vowel? Or Y? \n\nBut ""MINDS"" is a valid word? \n\nAnother candidate: ""WINDY"": W,I,N,D,Y? N at position 3? And avoids absent? W,I,N,D,Y? \n\n""WINDY"": W1, I2, N3, D4, Y5? \n\nSimilar to ""MINDS"" but with W and Y instead of M and S? \n\nBut we don\'t know which is better? \n\nWe can also consider ""SINCE""? But C and E absent? Avoid? \n\nOr ""LINGO"": L,I,N,G,O? N at position 3? And O? \n\n""LINGO"": L1, I2, N3, G4, O5? \n\nThen we test L, I, N, G, O? \n\nI at 2, N at 3? \n\nAnd avoids absent? \n\nSo ""LINGO"" is a candidate? \n\nBut we have multiple options: ""NOISY"", ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", etc. \n\nWe need to choose one that maximizes new letter coverage? \n\nWe have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,S,V,W,X,Y,Z? \n\nCommon letters: S, L, O, D, M, G, etc. \n\n""NOISY"" covers O, S, Y? \n""MINDS"" covers M, D, S? \n""WINDY"" covers W, D, Y? \n""LINGO"" covers L, G, O? \n\nAll are good? \n\nBut we also have to consider the position of I? \n\nIn guess 2, we had I at position 1 and it was wrong? So if we put I at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if it\'s correct, we get a ✓? Or if not, we know it\'s not at 2? \n\nSimilarly for N at position 3? \n\nIn ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? \n\nIn ""NOISY"", we test I at 3? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position 2 for I? \n\nSo testing position 2 for I might be valuable? \n\nTherefore, ""MINDS"" or ""WINDY"" or ""LINGO"" test I at position 2? \n\n""NOISY"" tests I at position 3? \n\nSince we have more positions to test for I (2,3,4,5), testing position 2 might be efficient? \n\nSimilarly, for N, testing position 3? \n\nSo let\'s choose ""MINDS""? \n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid? \n\n""MINDS"" is a valid word? Yes, plural of mind? \n\nSimilarly, ""WINDY"" is valid? \n\nBut ""WINDY"" has Y? Which might be a vowel? \n\nBut both are fine? \n\nI think ""MINDS"" is good? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has I at a different position? For example, position 4? \n\nBut we don\'t have a candidate? \n\nFor instance, ""BLIMP""? But M and P? P is absent? Avoid? \n\n""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K? C absent? Avoid? \n\nSo it\'s hard? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""MINDS"". \n\nBut in ""MINDS"", we have D and S? \n\nAnother common word: ""BONDS""? B,O,N,D,S? N at position 3? And O? \n\n""BONDS"": B1, O2, N3, D4, S5? \n\nThen we test B, O, N, D, S? \n\nAnd I is not included? But we know I is present? So we must include I? Because if we don\'t include I, we might not get information about it? And we know it\'s in the word? \n\nImportant: we must include all known present letters? Otherwise, we might waste a guess? \n\nFor example, if we guess ""BONDS"", which has no I, then we might get feedback that doesn\'t tell us about I? But we already know I is present? So we don\'t need to confirm that? But we need to find its position? \n\nIf we don\'t include I, we won\'t get any feedback on I\'s position? So we should include I? \n\nSimilarly for N? \n\nTherefore, we must include both N and I in the guess? \n\nSo ""BONDS"" is invalid because it doesn\'t have I? \n\nSimilarly, ""NOISY"" has I? ""MINDS"" has I? ""WINDY"" has I? ""LINGO"" has I? \n\nSo all our candidates have I and N? \n\nNow, among ""MINDS"", ""WINDY"", ""LINGO"", ""NOISY"", which one to choose? \n\n""NOISY"" has I at position 3? \n""MINDS"" has I at position 2? \n""WINDY"" has I at position 2? \n""LINGO"" has I at position 2? \n\nSince we haven\'t tested position 2 for I, it might be good to test it? \n\nAlso, position 3 for N? \n\nIn ""MINDS"", we test I at 2 and N at 3? \n\nIn ""WINDY"", same? \n\nBut ""MINDS"" has S?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are absent.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""input"" -> I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
- I is present but not in position 1.
- N is present but not in position 2.
- P, U, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""minds"" -> M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) S(-)
Meaning:
- M and D are absent.
- I is correct at position 2 (so the second letter is I).
- N is present but not in position 3 (since we guessed it at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
- S is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D. (from all feedback)
   - So absent: C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D.

2. Present letters:
   - I: confirmed at position 2 (from guess 3: I(✓)). So the second letter is I.
   - N: present, but not in position 2 (from guess 2), not in position 4 (from guess 1), and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Since the word is 5 letters, the only positions left are 1 and 5. So N must be at position 1 or 5.
   - S: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3: S(-) at position 5). So S is in the word but not at position 5. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4? But note: position 2 is I, so S cannot be at 2. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

3. The word structure so far:
   - Position 2: I (fixed)
   - Position 1: Could be N or S or another letter? But we know N might be at 1 or 5, and S at 1,3,4.
   - Position 3: Could be S or another letter? But not N (since N not at 3).
   - Position 4: Could be S or another letter? But not N (since N not at 4).
   - Position 5: Could be N or S? But S is not at 5, so position 5 could be N or another letter? But we know N must be at 1 or 5.

Also, we have only two confirmed present letters besides I: N and S. But there might be more letters? The word has 5 letters, and we have I at 2, and N and S must be placed, and two more letters to find? But we have absent letters, so we need to use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,U,T,M,D (from guesses) and S is present? But S is in the word? So the available letters are from the alphabet minus absent: absent are C,R,A,E,P,U,T,M,D. So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know S and N are in the word? But we are going to use them in the guess? 

But note: we must include N and S in the next guess? Because they are present? But we know I is fixed at position 2? So the word has I at 2, and must have N and S somewhere? 

So the word has at least three known letters: I (at 2), N, and S? But N and S are not yet placed? 

Now, positions for N: only 1 or 5.
Positions for S: 1, 3, or 4? But if N is at 1, then S cannot be at 1? So if N at 1, then S at 3 or 4? If N at 5, then S at 1,3, or 4? 

But also, we need to fill the other positions with available letters? 

We are missing one more letter? The word has 5 positions: 
- Pos1: either N or S or a new letter? But if N is at 1, then pos1 is N? If not, then it could be S or a new letter? Similarly for pos5.

But we know that N must be at 1 or 5? So let's consider cases:

Case 1: N at position 1
Then:
- Pos1: N
- Pos2: I (fixed)
- Then S must be at position 3 or 4? 
- Pos5: must be a new letter? 

Case 2: N at position 5
Then:
- Pos1: could be S or a new letter?
- Pos2: I
- S must be at position 1, 3, or 4? But if S is at 1, then pos1 is S? Or if at 3 or 4?
- Pos5: N

In both cases, we have two positions to fill? For example, in case 1: if N at 1, I at 2, then pos3,4,5: one of them is S? And the other two are new letters? But we have only two positions? Actually, pos3,4,5: three positions? But one is S? So two new letters? 

Similarly in case 2.

But we have only one guess? We are on guess 4? We have 6 guesses? So we can test.

But we need to choose a word that fits the constraints.

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and we must include N and S? But N and S are already known? So we can use them? 

But in the guess, we need to place them? 

Now, we also know that S is not at position 5? So in the guess, we should not put S at position 5? 

Similarly, N not at 2,3,4? So only 1 or 5? 

So for the next guess, we can try to set N at position 1? Or at position 5? 

But we don't know which? So we need to test one of the cases? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N at position 1 and S at position 3? For example? 

But we need to fill the other positions? 

Let's list possible words.

First, since I is fixed at position 2, the word is _ I _ _ _

Now, N must be at 1 or 5? 

If N at 1: then word is N I _ _ _

Then S must be at 3 or 4? 

If S at 3: N I S _ _
Then we need two more letters? Positions 4 and 5? With available letters? 

Possible words: e.g., ""NISUS""? But S repeated? And U is absent? Avoid? 

""DISKS""? But D absent? 

""GISMO""? G,I,S,M,O? But M absent? 

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

So for N I S _ _ : possible words? 

""WISPY""? But P absent? 

""FISHY""? F,I,S,H,Y? But we have N at 1? No, if N at 1, it's N I S _ _? 

""KISSY""? K,I,S,S,Y? But S repeated? And K? 

But we need the first letter N? So ""NISSY""? Not a word? 

""JISMS""? Not common? 

Perhaps not many words with ""NIS"" at start? 

If S at position 4: N I _ S _

Then word: N I _ S _

Possible words: ""NIFTS""? F,T? T absent? 

""NICKS""? C absent? 

""NIFFS""? F? 

""NIFFS"" is a word? Meaning? But F is available? 

But let's see: N,I,F,F,S? But F repeated? And S at position 5? But we know S is not at position 5? From guess 3? S(-) at position 5? So S cannot be at 5? 

In this case, if we put S at position 4? Then position 5 is F? But S is at 4? 

But the word ""NIFFS"" has S at position 5? Because N1, I2, F3, F4, S5? So S at 5? But we know S cannot be at 5? So ""NIFFS"" would have S at 5? Which is invalid? 

Similarly, ""NICKS"": N1,I2,C3,K4,S5? S at 5? Invalid? 

So no? 

Therefore, if N at 1, and S at 4? Then the word is N I _ S ? 

But position 5 must be filled? And S is at 4? So position 5 is another letter? 

But we need a word ending with S? But we know S cannot be at 5? But if S is at 4, then position 5 is not S? So it can be? 

For example, ""NIXES""? But X and E? E absent? 

""NOILS""? O,I,L,S? But S at 5? Then S at 5? But we know S is not at 5? So avoid? 

""NOILS"" is N1,O2,I3,L4,S5? But position 2 is I? So we have I at 2? But in ""NOILS"", position 2 is O? Not I? So not? 

We need position 2 to be I? 

So the word must be N I ? ? ? 

With S at 3 or 4? 

If S at 3: N I S ? ? 

Then position 4 and 5: two letters? 

Possible words: ""NISUS"" not valid? ""NISSE"" E absent? ""NISKY"" K? ""NISSE"" not word? 

""WISPY"" not starting with N? 

Perhaps there are no common words with ""NIS"" prefix? 

So maybe N at position 1 is not possible? 

Then N must be at position 5? 

Case 2: N at position 5? 

Then word: _ I _ _ N

And S must be at position 1, 3, or 4? 

Also, position 1,3,4: one of them is S? And the others are new letters? 

Now, S not at 5? So that's good? 

If S at position 1: then word: S I _ _ N

Then positions 3 and 4: two letters? 

Possible words: ""SI _ _ N"" 

Common words: ""SILON""? Not common? ""SIREN""? R and E absent? ""SIDON""? D absent? ""SIVAN""? V? 

""SHOWN""? O? But W? ""SHOWN"" is S1,H2,O3,W4,N5? But position 2 is H? Not I? 

We need position 2 to be I? 

So ""S I ? ? N"" 

Examples: ""SILKN""? Not a word? ""SIZEN""? Z? Meaning? ""SIZEN"" is a word? 

""SKIIN""? Not? 

""SPAIN""? P and A absent? 

""SWING"": S1,W2,I3,N4,G5? But position 2 is W? Not I? 

We need the second letter to be I? So ""S I ? ? N"" 

Possible: ""SICKN"" not word? ""SILKN"" not? 

""SIMON"": S1,I2,M3,O4,N5? But M is absent? 

""SIMON"" has M? Absent? 

""SHINY"": S1,H2,I3,N4,Y5? But position 2 is H? Not I? 

We need the word to have I at position 2? 

So ""S I ? ? N"" 

What about ""SIXTH""? X,T? T absent? 

""BISON"": B1,I2,S3,O4,N5? But S is at position 3? 

""BISON"" is B,I,S,O,N? So S at position 3? 

And avoids absent? B,I,S,O,N? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,U,T,M,D? So B,O are available? 

So ""BISON"" is a possible word? 

Similarly, ""VISON""? V,I,S,O,N? V is available? 

""VISON"" is a word? Meaning a mink? 

But let's see: ""BISON"" has S at position 3? 

Similarly, ""WISPY"" not? 

""GIPON""? G,I,P,O,N? P absent? 

""LIGAN""? L,I,G,A,N? A absent? 

So ""BISON"" seems good? 

If S at position 3: then word: ? I S ? N

With S at 3? 

""BISON"" is one: B I S O N

S at position 3? 

We also have S at position 3? 

But we don't know if S is at 3? 

Another possibility: S at position 4? 

Then word: ? I ? S N

For example, ""BIKSN"" not word? ""FICHS"" not? 

""FICHU""? F,I,C,H,U? C and U absent? 

""DISCO""? D,I,S,C,O? D and C absent? 

""GISMO""? G,I,S,M,O? M absent? 

""LISPS""? L,I,S,P,S? P absent and S repeated? 

Not many? 

""OILSM"" not? 

So perhaps S at position 1 or 3 is more likely? 

With ""BISON"", we have:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: I (correct)
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: N

But we know N must be at position 1 or 5? Here it is at 5? So that's good? 

And S at position 3? Which is possible? 

Also, we test B and O? 

But is there a conflict? 

We know from guess 3 that S is not at position 5? Here S is at 3? So okay? 

N is at 5? Which is allowed? 

So ""BISON"" seems a valid candidate? 

Another word: ""VISON""? V,I,S,O,N? Same structure? 

But V is less common? 

""BISON"" is better? 

What about ""SHINE""? But H and E? E absent? 

""THING""? T absent? 

""FLING""? F,L,I,N,G? But N at position 4? But we have N at 5? 

In ""FLING"", N is at 4? But we need N at 5? 

So not? 

Therefore, ""BISON"" is a good choice? 

But we must confirm: in ""BISON"", we have I at 2 (correct), S at 3 (to test), O at 4, N at 5 (to test if N is at 5). 

Also, B at 1? 

Now, feedback will tell us:
- If B is present? 
- I is correct? 
- S at 3? If correct? 
- O at 4? 
- N at 5? If correct? 

But we know I is fixed? 

If N is at 5, we get ✓ for N? 

Similarly, if S is at 3, we get ✓ for S? 

But we don't know? 

Another candidate: if S is at position 1? 

Then word: S I ? ? N

For example, ""SILON"" not? ""SIZEN"" not common? 

""SKINS""? K? But position 2 is K? Not I? 

We need position 2 I? 

""SPINS""? P absent? 

""SWING"" not? 

So ""BISON"" seems the best? 

But we have another option: ""OINKS""? O at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But N cannot be at 3? From guess 3? 

N not at 3? So ""OINKS"" has N at 3? Avoid? 

Similarly, ""JOINS""? J? And N at 4? But N not at 4? 

So not? 

Therefore, I think ""BISON"" is a good guess? 

But let's see if there is a word with S at position 4? 

For example, ""HIS N"" not? 

""FIST N"" not? 

So I'll go with ""BISON"". 

But we must include all known present letters? We have I, N, S? ""BISON"" has I, S, N? Yes? 

And avoids absent? 

So guess: BISON

But in the feedback, we have S not at 5? And in ""BISON"", S is at 3? So that's fine? 

Also, N at 5? 

If the word is not ""BISON"", we get feedback to narrow down? 

Another word: ""WISPY"" not? 

""LYSIS""? L,Y,S,I,S? But position 2 is Y? Not I? 

So no? 

Therefore, <guess>bison</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
  - **C, R, A, E** are **absent**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""input"" → I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)**  
  - **I** is **present** but **not in position 1**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 2**.  
  - **P, U, T** are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: ""minds"" → M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) S(-)**  
  - **M, D** are **absent**.  
  - **I** is **correct at position 2** (so the second letter is **I**).  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 3**.  
  - **S** is **present** but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D (cannot be in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters and positions**:  
   - **I** is fixed at **position 2**.  
   - **N** must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).  
   - **S** must be in **position 1, 3, or 4** (cannot be in position 5, and position 2 is occupied by I).  
3. **Word structure**: The word is `_ I _ _ _`, with:  
   - Position 1: Could be N, S, or a new letter.  
   - Position 3: Could be S or a new letter.  
   - Position 4: Could be S or a new letter.  
   - Position 5: Could be N or a new letter (but N must be at 1 or 5).  
4. **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D are absent).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test critical constraints for N and S**:  
  - Place **N at position 5** (one of its only possible positions).  
  - Place **S at position 3** (a plausible location).  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Use common untested letters like **B** and **O** to gather more information.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Ensure the guess includes all known present letters (I, N, S) and avoids absent letters.  

### Chosen Guess: ""BISON""
- **Breakdown**: B (position 1), I (position 2, fixed), S (position 3), O (position 4), N (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **N at position 5** (if correct, it will show ✓; if not, N must be at position 1).  
  - Tests **S at position 3** (if correct, it will show ✓; if not, S must be at position 1 or 4).  
  - Introduces **new common letters**: B and O (both untested).  
  - Adheres to all constraints:  
    - I is at position 2 (fixed).  
    - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If **N is at position 5**, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - If **S is at position 3**, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - Feedback on B and O will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for N and S while testing new letters to accelerate solving the word.

<guess>bison</guess>",bison,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are absent.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""input"" -> I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
- I is present but not in position 1.
- N is present but not in position 2.
- P, U, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""minds"" -> M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) S(-)
Meaning:
- M and D are absent.
- I is correct at position 2 (so the second letter is I).
- N is present but not in position 3 (since we guessed it at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
- S is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D. (from all feedback)
   - So absent: C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D.

2. Present letters:
   - I: confirmed at position 2 (from guess 3: I(✓)). So the second letter is I.
   - N: present, but not in position 2 (from guess 2), not in position 4 (from guess 1), and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Since the word is 5 letters, the only positions left are 1 and 5. So N must be at position 1 or 5.
   - S: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3: S(-) at position 5). So S is in the word but not at position 5. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4? But note: position 2 is I, so S cannot be at 2. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

3. The word structure so far:
   - Position 2: I (fixed)
   - Position 1: Could be N or S or another letter? But we know N might be at 1 or 5, and S at 1,3,4.
   - Position 3: Could be S or another letter? But not N (since N not at 3).
   - Position 4: Could be S or another letter? But not N (since N not at 4).
   - Position 5: Could be N or S? But S is not at 5, so position 5 could be N or another letter? But we know N must be at 1 or 5.

Also, we have only two confirmed present letters besides I: N and S. But there might be more letters? The word has 5 letters, and we have I at 2, and N and S must be placed, and two more letters to find? But we have absent letters, so we need to use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,U,T,M,D (from guesses) and S is present? But S is in the word? So the available letters are from the alphabet minus absent: absent are C,R,A,E,P,U,T,M,D. So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know S and N are in the word? But we are going to use them in the guess? 

But note: we must include N and S in the next guess? Because they are present? But we know I is fixed at position 2? So the word has I at 2, and must have N and S somewhere? 

So the word has at least three known letters: I (at 2), N, and S? But N and S are not yet placed? 

Now, positions for N: only 1 or 5.
Positions for S: 1, 3, or 4? But if N is at 1, then S cannot be at 1? So if N at 1, then S at 3 or 4? If N at 5, then S at 1,3, or 4? 

But also, we need to fill the other positions with available letters? 

We are missing one more letter? The word has 5 positions: 
- Pos1: either N or S or a new letter? But if N is at 1, then pos1 is N? If not, then it could be S or a new letter? Similarly for pos5.

But we know that N must be at 1 or 5? So let's consider cases:

Case 1: N at position 1
Then:
- Pos1: N
- Pos2: I (fixed)
- Then S must be at position 3 or 4? 
- Pos5: must be a new letter? 

Case 2: N at position 5
Then:
- Pos1: could be S or a new letter?
- Pos2: I
- S must be at position 1, 3, or 4? But if S is at 1, then pos1 is S? Or if at 3 or 4?
- Pos5: N

In both cases, we have two positions to fill? For example, in case 1: if N at 1, I at 2, then pos3,4,5: one of them is S? And the other two are new letters? But we have only two positions? Actually, pos3,4,5: three positions? But one is S? So two new letters? 

Similarly in case 2.

But we have only one guess? We are on guess 4? We have 6 guesses? So we can test.

But we need to choose a word that fits the constraints.

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and we must include N and S? But N and S are already known? So we can use them? 

But in the guess, we need to place them? 

Now, we also know that S is not at position 5? So in the guess, we should not put S at position 5? 

Similarly, N not at 2,3,4? So only 1 or 5? 

So for the next guess, we can try to set N at position 1? Or at position 5? 

But we don't know which? So we need to test one of the cases? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N at position 1 and S at position 3? For example? 

But we need to fill the other positions? 

Let's list possible words.

First, since I is fixed at position 2, the word is _ I _ _ _

Now, N must be at 1 or 5? 

If N at 1: then word is N I _ _ _

Then S must be at 3 or 4? 

If S at 3: N I S _ _
Then we need two more letters? Positions 4 and 5? With available letters? 

Possible words: e.g., ""NISUS""? But S repeated? And U is absent? Avoid? 

""DISKS""? But D absent? 

""GISMO""? G,I,S,M,O? But M absent? 

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

So for N I S _ _ : possible words? 

""WISPY""? But P absent? 

""FISHY""? F,I,S,H,Y? But we have N at 1? No, if N at 1, it's N I S _ _? 

""KISSY""? K,I,S,S,Y? But S repeated? And K? 

But we need the first letter N? So ""NISSY""? Not a word? 

""JISMS""? Not common? 

Perhaps not many words with ""NIS"" at start? 

If S at position 4: N I _ S _

Then word: N I _ S _

Possible words: ""NIFTS""? F,T? T absent? 

""NICKS""? C absent? 

""NIFFS""? F? 

""NIFFS"" is a word? Meaning? But F is available? 

But let's see: N,I,F,F,S? But F repeated? And S at position 5? But we know S is not at position 5? From guess 3? S(-) at position 5? So S cannot be at 5? 

In this case, if we put S at position 4? Then position 5 is F? But S is at 4? 

But the word ""NIFFS"" has S at position 5? Because N1, I2, F3, F4, S5? So S at 5? But we know S cannot be at 5? So ""NIFFS"" would have S at 5? Which is invalid? 

Similarly, ""NICKS"": N1,I2,C3,K4,S5? S at 5? Invalid? 

So no? 

Therefore, if N at 1, and S at 4? Then the word is N I _ S ? 

But position 5 must be filled? And S is at 4? So position 5 is another letter? 

But we need a word ending with S? But we know S cannot be at 5? But if S is at 4, then position 5 is not S? So it can be? 

For example, ""NIXES""? But X and E? E absent? 

""NOILS""? O,I,L,S? But S at 5? Then S at 5? But we know S is not at 5? So avoid? 

""NOILS"" is N1,O2,I3,L4,S5? But position 2 is I? So we have I at 2? But in ""NOILS"", position 2 is O? Not I? So not? 

We need position 2 to be I? 

So the word must be N I ? ? ? 

With S at 3 or 4? 

If S at 3: N I S ? ? 

Then position 4 and 5: two letters? 

Possible words: ""NISUS"" not valid? ""NISSE"" E absent? ""NISKY"" K? ""NISSE"" not word? 

""WISPY"" not starting with N? 

Perhaps there are no common words with ""NIS"" prefix? 

So maybe N at position 1 is not possible? 

Then N must be at position 5? 

Case 2: N at position 5? 

Then word: _ I _ _ N

And S must be at position 1, 3, or 4? 

Also, position 1,3,4: one of them is S? And the others are new letters? 

Now, S not at 5? So that's good? 

If S at position 1: then word: S I _ _ N

Then positions 3 and 4: two letters? 

Possible words: ""SI _ _ N"" 

Common words: ""SILON""? Not common? ""SIREN""? R and E absent? ""SIDON""? D absent? ""SIVAN""? V? 

""SHOWN""? O? But W? ""SHOWN"" is S1,H2,O3,W4,N5? But position 2 is H? Not I? 

We need position 2 to be I? 

So ""S I ? ? N"" 

Examples: ""SILKN""? Not a word? ""SIZEN""? Z? Meaning? ""SIZEN"" is a word? 

""SKIIN""? Not? 

""SPAIN""? P and A absent? 

""SWING"": S1,W2,I3,N4,G5? But position 2 is W? Not I? 

We need the second letter to be I? So ""S I ? ? N"" 

Possible: ""SICKN"" not word? ""SILKN"" not? 

""SIMON"": S1,I2,M3,O4,N5? But M is absent? 

""SIMON"" has M? Absent? 

""SHINY"": S1,H2,I3,N4,Y5? But position 2 is H? Not I? 

We need the word to have I at position 2? 

So ""S I ? ? N"" 

What about ""SIXTH""? X,T? T absent? 

""BISON"": B1,I2,S3,O4,N5? But S is at position 3? 

""BISON"" is B,I,S,O,N? So S at position 3? 

And avoids absent? B,I,S,O,N? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,U,T,M,D? So B,O are available? 

So ""BISON"" is a possible word? 

Similarly, ""VISON""? V,I,S,O,N? V is available? 

""VISON"" is a word? Meaning a mink? 

But let's see: ""BISON"" has S at position 3? 

Similarly, ""WISPY"" not? 

""GIPON""? G,I,P,O,N? P absent? 

""LIGAN""? L,I,G,A,N? A absent? 

So ""BISON"" seems good? 

If S at position 3: then word: ? I S ? N

With S at 3? 

""BISON"" is one: B I S O N

S at position 3? 

We also have S at position 3? 

But we don't know if S is at 3? 

Another possibility: S at position 4? 

Then word: ? I ? S N

For example, ""BIKSN"" not word? ""FICHS"" not? 

""FICHU""? F,I,C,H,U? C and U absent? 

""DISCO""? D,I,S,C,O? D and C absent? 

""GISMO""? G,I,S,M,O? M absent? 

""LISPS""? L,I,S,P,S? P absent and S repeated? 

Not many? 

""OILSM"" not? 

So perhaps S at position 1 or 3 is more likely? 

With ""BISON"", we have:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: I (correct)
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: N

But we know N must be at position 1 or 5? Here it is at 5? So that's good? 

And S at position 3? Which is possible? 

Also, we test B and O? 

But is there a conflict? 

We know from guess 3 that S is not at position 5? Here S is at 3? So okay? 

N is at 5? Which is allowed? 

So ""BISON"" seems a valid candidate? 

Another word: ""VISON""? V,I,S,O,N? Same structure? 

But V is less common? 

""BISON"" is better? 

What about ""SHINE""? But H and E? E absent? 

""THING""? T absent? 

""FLING""? F,L,I,N,G? But N at position 4? But we have N at 5? 

In ""FLING"", N is at 4? But we need N at 5? 

So not? 

Therefore, ""BISON"" is a good choice? 

But we must confirm: in ""BISON"", we have I at 2 (correct), S at 3 (to test), O at 4, N at 5 (to test if N is at 5). 

Also, B at 1? 

Now, feedback will tell us:
- If B is present? 
- I is correct? 
- S at 3? If correct? 
- O at 4? 
- N at 5? If correct? 

But we know I is fixed? 

If N is at 5, we get ✓ for N? 

Similarly, if S is at 3, we get ✓ for S? 

But we don't know? 

Another candidate: if S is at position 1? 

Then word: S I ? ? N

For example, ""SILON"" not? ""SIZEN"" not common? 

""SKINS""? K? But position 2 is K? Not I? 

We need position 2 I? 

""SPINS""? P absent? 

""SWING"" not? 

So ""BISON"" seems the best? 

But we have another option: ""OINKS""? O at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But N cannot be at 3? From guess 3? 

N not at 3? So ""OINKS"" has N at 3? Avoid? 

Similarly, ""JOINS""? J? And N at 4? But N not at 4? 

So not? 

Therefore, I think ""BISON"" is a good guess? 

But let's see if there is a word with S at position 4? 

For example, ""HIS N"" not? 

""FIST N"" not? 

So I'll go with ""BISON"". 

But we must include all known present letters? We have I, N, S? ""BISON"" has I, S, N? Yes? 

And avoids absent? 

So guess: BISON

But in the feedback, we have S not at 5? And in ""BISON"", S is at 3? So that's fine? 

Also, N at 5? 

If the word is not ""BISON"", we get feedback to narrow down? 

Another word: ""WISPY"" not? 

""LYSIS""? L,Y,S,I,S? But position 2 is Y? Not I? 

So no? 

Therefore, <guess>bison</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
  - **C, R, A, E** are **absent**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""input"" → I(-) N(-) P(x) U(x) T(x)**  
  - **I** is **present** but **not in position 1**.  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 2**.  
  - **P, U, T** are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: ""minds"" → M(x) I(✓) N(-) D(x) S(-)**  
  - **M, D** are **absent**.  
  - **I** is **correct at position 2** (so the second letter is **I**).  
  - **N** is **present** but **not in position 3**.  
  - **S** is **present** but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D (cannot be in the word).  
2. **Confirmed present letters and positions**:  
   - **I** is fixed at **position 2**.  
   - **N** must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).  
   - **S** must be in **position 1, 3, or 4** (cannot be in position 5, and position 2 is occupied by I).  
3. **Word structure**: The word is `_ I _ _ _`, with:  
   - Position 1: Could be N, S, or a new letter.  
   - Position 3: Could be S or a new letter.  
   - Position 4: Could be S or a new letter.  
   - Position 5: Could be N or a new letter (but N must be at 1 or 5).  
4. **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D are absent).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test critical constraints for N and S**:  
  - Place **N at position 5** (one of its only possible positions).  
  - Place **S at position 3** (a plausible location).  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Use common untested letters like **B** and **O** to gather more information.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Ensure the guess includes all known present letters (I, N, S) and avoids absent letters.  

### Chosen Guess: ""BISON""
- **Breakdown**: B (position 1), I (position 2, fixed), S (position 3), O (position 4), N (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **N at position 5** (if correct, it will show ✓; if not, N must be at position 1).  
  - Tests **S at position 3** (if correct, it will show ✓; if not, S must be at position 1 or 4).  
  - Introduces **new common letters**: B and O (both untested).  
  - Adheres to all constraints:  
    - I is at position 2 (fixed).  
    - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, U, T, M, D).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If **N is at position 5**, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - If **S is at position 3**, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - Feedback on B and O will reveal if they are present/absent and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for N and S while testing new letters to accelerate solving the word.",Guess 4: bison -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) S(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
