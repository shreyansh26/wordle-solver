We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often contains common vowels and consonants. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are popular.
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it avoids repeated letters.
 But note: We are allowed any valid English word. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good starter because it has more vowels and common letters.

 However, to cover more common letters, I choose ""RAISE"" because it has A, E, I (three vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 But the problem requires 5-letter word. Let me confirm ""RAISE"" is valid -> yes.

 Let me go with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

 After this guess, we will receive feedback that tells us:
   For each letter: 
        if it's in the correct position (✓)
        if it's in the word but wrong position (-)
        if not in the word (x)

 Then we can use that to narrow down the word list.

 So, my first guess: RAISE
</think>
I am starting with ""RAISE"" because it's a strategic first guess in Wordle. It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing letter coverage. This helps identify which letters are present and their potential positions early. Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with—my goal is simply to gather initial clues efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end). Also, the word does not contain R, A, I, or S.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1,2,3,4 of our guess? Actually, we only know it's not at the position we guessed, which was position 5. It could be at any other position in the word, but we don't know which one yet).

 Also, we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S.

 Since E is in the word, we should try to include E in our next guess, but not at the end (position 5). We can try placing E in different positions.

 Moreover, we need to choose a word that uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes E and some of these new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 However, note that we have no information about the other letters, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be a word that has E in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we have eliminated A and I, so the vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

 But wait: the feedback for E is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5, so it must be in one of the positions 1-4.

 Let's try to choose a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and includes other common letters.

 Some possibilities:

 Position 1: E _ _ _ _ 
   Example: ETHER (but has E at the end too, which we don't want to repeat? Actually, we can repeat letters but the secret word might have only one E? We don't know. But the feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for E was only one minus, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, we don't have evidence for two, so we might avoid repeating E for now to test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the middle.

 Let me think of words without R, A, I, S and with E in a position other than 5.

 Common words: 
   with E at position 1: EGRET (but has R and E at the end) -> avoid R.
   with E at position 1: ECLAT (but has A) -> avoid A.

 We must avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's try E at position 1: 
   Words: ENOUGH -> but has O, U, G, H. However, we don't know if these are in the word. But note: we are allowed to guess any valid word.

 But ENOUGH is 6 letters? No, 6 letters: E-N-O-U-G-H -> 6. So not valid.

 5-letter words: 
   E at position 1: 
      EPOCH -> E, P, O, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S. Valid.
   E at position 2:
      LEVER -> has E again and R -> avoid R.
      METAL -> has A -> avoid A.
      BENCH -> B, E, N, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S.

   E at position 3:
      OCEAN -> has A -> avoid A.
      UPPER -> has R -> avoid R.
      BUTTE -> has T repeated? and ends with E -> but we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? However, in BUTTE, the last letter is E, which we know is not the case. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

   Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E. So for position 3: 
      WORD: BELOW -> has L, O, W. But E is at position 2? Actually, BELOW: B(position1), E(position2), L(position3), O(position4), W(position5). So E is at position 2.

   Let me list by position:

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H)
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> but note: we don't know if the word has B, L, O, W. And we are testing E at position 2.

   Position 3: We need a word with E at position 3 and without R,A,I,S. Example: 
        CEDED -> has E at 2 and 4? and D. But we want to test E at 3? 
        Actually, let's find: 
        PENNE -> has E at the end? and also has N. But PENNE: P, E (position2), N (position3), N (position4), E (position5) -> we don't want E at the end.

   We can try: 
        DELVE -> D, E (position2), L, V, E (position5) -> avoid because E at the end.

   How about: 
        MELEE -> has E at the end and multiple E's? and M, L. But again, E at the end.

   We need to avoid E at position 5. So for position 3: 
        Example: BEGET -> E at position 2 and 4? and ends with T? Actually, BEGET: B, E, G, E, T -> E at 2 and 4, and T at 5. But we don't have E at 5? So that's okay? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

   However, we are only required to have E in the word, and we are trying to test other letters. We can use a word with E only once? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E only in one position (that is not 5) and avoid repeating.

   Let me think of a word with E at position 3: 
        TENET -> has E at 2 and 4? and T repeated. Also, ends with T, not E. But TENET: T, E, N, E, T -> E at 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's.

   Another: 
        DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.

   Another: 
        BERTH -> has R -> avoid.

   Another: 
        JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4? and ends with L. But we have E at 2 and 4. And avoids R,A,I,S.

   But we don't know if the word has two E's. We can use it? But we are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

   However, we have limited tries. We might avoid repeating letters in the second guess to maximize information.

   So, let's go back to the words without repeated letters and without E at the end.

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H) -> no repeat, and E at 1.
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> no repeat, E at 2.
   Position 3: We can try: 
        MEDIC -> but has I -> avoid I.
        PEDAL -> has A -> avoid A.
        FECAL -> has A -> avoid A.

   How about: 
        NEWLY -> N, E, W, L, Y -> E at position 2? Actually, NEWLY: N(position1), E(position2), W(position3), L(position4), Y(position5). So E at 2. But we already have BELOW for position 2.

   Actually, we can choose any. Let me choose between EPOCH and BELOW.

   Both are good. Let me pick BELOW because it has more common letters? Or EPOCH has less common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes T, N, which are very common.

   How about: 
        Position 3: 
          CENTO -> C, E, N, T, O -> E at position 2? CENTO: C(position1), E(position2), N(position3), T(position4), O(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

   We want E at position 3: 
          HONEY -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4? and ends with Y. So not at 3.

          TEMPO -> T, E, M, P, O -> E at position 2.

   It's hard to find a word with E at position 3 without the forbidden letters and without E at the end.

   Let me try: 
          BLEEP -> has E at 3 and 4? and ends with P? B, L, E, E, P -> E at 3 and 4 -> repeated and we don't know.

          CREPT -> has R -> avoid.

          DEPTH -> D, E, P, T, H -> E at position 2.

   How about: 
          LEECH -> has E at 1 and 2? and ends with H -> L, E, E, C, H -> E at 2 and 3? Actually, positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> E at 2 and 3 -> repeated.

   Another: 
          FETCH -> F, E, T, C, H -> E at 2.

   So, it seems difficult. Maybe we can try E at position 4? But we have to avoid position 5.

   Position 4: 
        Example: OUNCE -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? position 5 -> avoid.

        We must avoid E at position 5. So position 4 is allowed? But the word must have E at position 4 and not at 5? Then the last letter must not be E.

        Example: 
          BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          DANCE -> D, A, N, C, E -> has A and E at the end -> avoid.

          CONE -> only 4 letters? 5-letter: 
          OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          HORDE -> has R -> avoid.

          LUNGE -> L, U, N, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

        It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 that doesn't end with E? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is something else.

        Example: 
          OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> E at position 4, and ends with D. This is valid. And avoids R,A,I,S.

        So OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> E at 4.

   Now, we have three candidate words for the second guess:
      Option 1: EPOCH (E at 1, and letters P,O,C,H)
      Option 2: BELOW (E at 2, and letters B,E,L,O,W) -> note: E is repeated? No, BELOW has one E at position 2.
      Option 3: OGLED (E at 4, and letters O,G,L,E,D) -> has E at 4 and also at? OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> only one E at position 4.

   But note: we are allowed to use a word that has E only once? Yes.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. 

   We have already eliminated R, A, I, S. We are about to test a set of new letters.

   Option 1: EPOCH -> tests E, P, O, C, H -> 5 new letters (if we haven't tried any of these, which we haven't).
   Option 2: BELOW -> tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters (E we already know is present, but we are testing its position).
   Option 3: OGLED -> tests O, G, L, E, D -> 5 new letters.

   But note: in BELOW, we are testing E at position 2. In EPOCH, we are testing E at position 1. In OGLED, we are testing E at position 4.

   Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, testing E at a new position (1,2, or 4) is good.

   How to choose? We can pick the one that uses the most common letters. 

   Common consonants: T, N, S (but S is eliminated), R (eliminated), so next are: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

   Option 1: EPOCH has P, C, H (and O is a vowel). 
   Option 2: BELOW has B, L, W (and O). 
   Option 3: OGLED has G, L, D (and O).

   The letter L is common, so both BELOW and OGLED have L. But we don't know if L is in the word.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes T and N, which are very common. None of these have T or N.

   So, maybe we should form a word that includes T and N and E at a new position.

   For example, with E at position 2: 
        TENTH -> has T and N, but also has T repeated and ends with H? And E at position 2? T, E, N, T, H -> E at 2. But we have T at 1 and 4? and H at 5. Also, we don't know about T and N.

   But TENTH has repeated T? We can avoid repeats to test more letters.

   How about: 
        BENTO -> B, E, N, T, O -> E at 2. Avoids R,A,I,S. And tests B, E, N, T, O.

   This is a good candidate: BENTO.

   Now, we have a fourth candidate: BENTO (E at 2, and letters B, E, N, T, O).

   This tests the common letters: B, E, N, T, O.

   We know E is present, so we are testing B, N, T, O.

   This seems better because it includes T and N, which are very common.

   So, I choose BENTO.

   But wait: we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S. BENTO does not contain these.

   Therefore, our second guess: BENTO.

   We'll get feedback on each letter: 
        B: if in the word and at position 1? 
        E: if at position 2? (if it is, then we get a check; if not, then we get a minus or cross? but we know E is in the word, so it will be either check (if at position 2) or minus (if in the word but not at 2))
        N: at position 3?
        T: at position 4?
        O: at position 5?

   This will give us good information.

   So, let's go with BENTO.

<guess>BENTO</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but it must be in positions 1–4.
2. The word **excludes R, A, I, S**.
3. New guess should prioritize:
   - Including E in a position other than 5 (testing positions 1–4).
   - Introducing common untested letters (e.g., B, N, T, O).
   - Avoiding forbidden letters (R, A, I, S).

Optimal second guess: **BENTO**  
- Tests E in position 2 (new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants (B, N, T) and vowel (O).
- Maximizes new letter coverage: B, N, T, O are all untested.
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.

<guess>BENTO</guess>",BENTO,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end). Also, the word does not contain R, A, I, or S.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1,2,3,4 of our guess? Actually, we only know it's not at the position we guessed, which was position 5. It could be at any other position in the word, but we don't know which one yet).

 Also, we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S.

 Since E is in the word, we should try to include E in our next guess, but not at the end (position 5). We can try placing E in different positions.

 Moreover, we need to choose a word that uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes E and some of these new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 However, note that we have no information about the other letters, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be a word that has E in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we have eliminated A and I, so the vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

 But wait: the feedback for E is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5, so it must be in one of the positions 1-4.

 Let's try to choose a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and includes other common letters.

 Some possibilities:

 Position 1: E _ _ _ _ 
   Example: ETHER (but has E at the end too, which we don't want to repeat? Actually, we can repeat letters but the secret word might have only one E? We don't know. But the feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for E was only one minus, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, we don't have evidence for two, so we might avoid repeating E for now to test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the middle.

 Let me think of words without R, A, I, S and with E in a position other than 5.

 Common words: 
   with E at position 1: EGRET (but has R and E at the end) -> avoid R.
   with E at position 1: ECLAT (but has A) -> avoid A.

 We must avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's try E at position 1: 
   Words: ENOUGH -> but has O, U, G, H. However, we don't know if these are in the word. But note: we are allowed to guess any valid word.

 But ENOUGH is 6 letters? No, 6 letters: E-N-O-U-G-H -> 6. So not valid.

 5-letter words: 
   E at position 1: 
      EPOCH -> E, P, O, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S. Valid.
   E at position 2:
      LEVER -> has E again and R -> avoid R.
      METAL -> has A -> avoid A.
      BENCH -> B, E, N, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S.

   E at position 3:
      OCEAN -> has A -> avoid A.
      UPPER -> has R -> avoid R.
      BUTTE -> has T repeated? and ends with E -> but we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? However, in BUTTE, the last letter is E, which we know is not the case. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

   Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E. So for position 3: 
      WORD: BELOW -> has L, O, W. But E is at position 2? Actually, BELOW: B(position1), E(position2), L(position3), O(position4), W(position5). So E is at position 2.

   Let me list by position:

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H)
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> but note: we don't know if the word has B, L, O, W. And we are testing E at position 2.

   Position 3: We need a word with E at position 3 and without R,A,I,S. Example: 
        CEDED -> has E at 2 and 4? and D. But we want to test E at 3? 
        Actually, let's find: 
        PENNE -> has E at the end? and also has N. But PENNE: P, E (position2), N (position3), N (position4), E (position5) -> we don't want E at the end.

   We can try: 
        DELVE -> D, E (position2), L, V, E (position5) -> avoid because E at the end.

   How about: 
        MELEE -> has E at the end and multiple E's? and M, L. But again, E at the end.

   We need to avoid E at position 5. So for position 3: 
        Example: BEGET -> E at position 2 and 4? and ends with T? Actually, BEGET: B, E, G, E, T -> E at 2 and 4, and T at 5. But we don't have E at 5? So that's okay? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

   However, we are only required to have E in the word, and we are trying to test other letters. We can use a word with E only once? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E only in one position (that is not 5) and avoid repeating.

   Let me think of a word with E at position 3: 
        TENET -> has E at 2 and 4? and T repeated. Also, ends with T, not E. But TENET: T, E, N, E, T -> E at 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's.

   Another: 
        DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.

   Another: 
        BERTH -> has R -> avoid.

   Another: 
        JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4? and ends with L. But we have E at 2 and 4. And avoids R,A,I,S.

   But we don't know if the word has two E's. We can use it? But we are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

   However, we have limited tries. We might avoid repeating letters in the second guess to maximize information.

   So, let's go back to the words without repeated letters and without E at the end.

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H) -> no repeat, and E at 1.
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> no repeat, E at 2.
   Position 3: We can try: 
        MEDIC -> but has I -> avoid I.
        PEDAL -> has A -> avoid A.
        FECAL -> has A -> avoid A.

   How about: 
        NEWLY -> N, E, W, L, Y -> E at position 2? Actually, NEWLY: N(position1), E(position2), W(position3), L(position4), Y(position5). So E at 2. But we already have BELOW for position 2.

   Actually, we can choose any. Let me choose between EPOCH and BELOW.

   Both are good. Let me pick BELOW because it has more common letters? Or EPOCH has less common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes T, N, which are very common.

   How about: 
        Position 3: 
          CENTO -> C, E, N, T, O -> E at position 2? CENTO: C(position1), E(position2), N(position3), T(position4), O(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

   We want E at position 3: 
          HONEY -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4? and ends with Y. So not at 3.

          TEMPO -> T, E, M, P, O -> E at position 2.

   It's hard to find a word with E at position 3 without the forbidden letters and without E at the end.

   Let me try: 
          BLEEP -> has E at 3 and 4? and ends with P? B, L, E, E, P -> E at 3 and 4 -> repeated and we don't know.

          CREPT -> has R -> avoid.

          DEPTH -> D, E, P, T, H -> E at position 2.

   How about: 
          LEECH -> has E at 1 and 2? and ends with H -> L, E, E, C, H -> E at 2 and 3? Actually, positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> E at 2 and 3 -> repeated.

   Another: 
          FETCH -> F, E, T, C, H -> E at 2.

   So, it seems difficult. Maybe we can try E at position 4? But we have to avoid position 5.

   Position 4: 
        Example: OUNCE -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? position 5 -> avoid.

        We must avoid E at position 5. So position 4 is allowed? But the word must have E at position 4 and not at 5? Then the last letter must not be E.

        Example: 
          BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          DANCE -> D, A, N, C, E -> has A and E at the end -> avoid.

          CONE -> only 4 letters? 5-letter: 
          OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          HORDE -> has R -> avoid.

          LUNGE -> L, U, N, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

        It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 that doesn't end with E? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is something else.

        Example: 
          OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> E at position 4, and ends with D. This is valid. And avoids R,A,I,S.

        So OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> E at 4.

   Now, we have three candidate words for the second guess:
      Option 1: EPOCH (E at 1, and letters P,O,C,H)
      Option 2: BELOW (E at 2, and letters B,E,L,O,W) -> note: E is repeated? No, BELOW has one E at position 2.
      Option 3: OGLED (E at 4, and letters O,G,L,E,D) -> has E at 4 and also at? OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> only one E at position 4.

   But note: we are allowed to use a word that has E only once? Yes.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. 

   We have already eliminated R, A, I, S. We are about to test a set of new letters.

   Option 1: EPOCH -> tests E, P, O, C, H -> 5 new letters (if we haven't tried any of these, which we haven't).
   Option 2: BELOW -> tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters (E we already know is present, but we are testing its position).
   Option 3: OGLED -> tests O, G, L, E, D -> 5 new letters.

   But note: in BELOW, we are testing E at position 2. In EPOCH, we are testing E at position 1. In OGLED, we are testing E at position 4.

   Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, testing E at a new position (1,2, or 4) is good.

   How to choose? We can pick the one that uses the most common letters. 

   Common consonants: T, N, S (but S is eliminated), R (eliminated), so next are: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

   Option 1: EPOCH has P, C, H (and O is a vowel). 
   Option 2: BELOW has B, L, W (and O). 
   Option 3: OGLED has G, L, D (and O).

   The letter L is common, so both BELOW and OGLED have L. But we don't know if L is in the word.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes T and N, which are very common. None of these have T or N.

   So, maybe we should form a word that includes T and N and E at a new position.

   For example, with E at position 2: 
        TENTH -> has T and N, but also has T repeated and ends with H? And E at position 2? T, E, N, T, H -> E at 2. But we have T at 1 and 4? and H at 5. Also, we don't know about T and N.

   But TENTH has repeated T? We can avoid repeats to test more letters.

   How about: 
        BENTO -> B, E, N, T, O -> E at 2. Avoids R,A,I,S. And tests B, E, N, T, O.

   This is a good candidate: BENTO.

   Now, we have a fourth candidate: BENTO (E at 2, and letters B, E, N, T, O).

   This tests the common letters: B, E, N, T, O.

   We know E is present, so we are testing B, N, T, O.

   This seems better because it includes T and N, which are very common.

   So, I choose BENTO.

   But wait: we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S. BENTO does not contain these.

   Therefore, our second guess: BENTO.

   We'll get feedback on each letter: 
        B: if in the word and at position 1? 
        E: if at position 2? (if it is, then we get a check; if not, then we get a minus or cross? but we know E is in the word, so it will be either check (if at position 2) or minus (if in the word but not at 2))
        N: at position 3?
        T: at position 4?
        O: at position 5?

   This will give us good information.

   So, let's go with BENTO.

<guess>BENTO</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but it must be in positions 1–4.
2. The word **excludes R, A, I, S**.
3. New guess should prioritize:
   - Including E in a position other than 5 (testing positions 1–4).
   - Introducing common untested letters (e.g., B, N, T, O).
   - Avoiding forbidden letters (R, A, I, S).

Optimal second guess: **BENTO**  
- Tests E in position 2 (new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants (B, N, T) and vowel (O).
- Maximizes new letter coverage: B, N, T, O are all untested.
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.",Guess 2: BENTO -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,cheek,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often contains common vowels and consonants. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are popular.
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it avoids repeated letters.
 But note: We are allowed any valid English word. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good starter because it has more vowels and common letters.

 However, to cover more common letters, I choose ""RAISE"" because it has A, E, I (three vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 But the problem requires 5-letter word. Let me confirm ""RAISE"" is valid -> yes.

 Let me go with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

 After this guess, we will receive feedback that tells us:
   For each letter: 
        if it's in the correct position (✓)
        if it's in the word but wrong position (-)
        if not in the word (x)

 Then we can use that to narrow down the word list.

 So, my first guess: RAISEI am starting with ""RAISE"" because it's a strategic first guess in Wordle. It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing letter coverage. This helps identify which letters are present and their potential positions early. Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with—my goal is simply to gather initial clues efficiently.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end). Also, the word does not contain R, A, I, or S.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1,2,3,4 of our guess? Actually, we only know it's not at the position we guessed, which was position 5. It could be at any other position in the word, but we don't know which one yet).

 Also, we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S.

 Since E is in the word, we should try to include E in our next guess, but not at the end (position 5). We can try placing E in different positions.

 Moreover, we need to choose a word that uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes E and some of these new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 However, note that we have no information about the other letters, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be a word that has E in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we have eliminated A and I, so the vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

 But wait: the feedback for E is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5, so it must be in one of the positions 1-4.

 Let's try to choose a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and includes other common letters.

 Some possibilities:

 Position 1: E _ _ _ _ 
   Example: ETHER (but has E at the end too, which we don't want to repeat? Actually, we can repeat letters but the secret word might have only one E? We don't know. But the feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for E was only one minus, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, we don't have evidence for two, so we might avoid repeating E for now to test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the middle.

 Let me think of words without R, A, I, S and with E in a position other than 5.

 Common words: 
   with E at position 1: EGRET (but has R and E at the end) -> avoid R.
   with E at position 1: ECLAT (but has A) -> avoid A.

 We must avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's try E at position 1: 
   Words: ENOUGH -> but has O, U, G, H. However, we don't know if these are in the word. But note: we are allowed to guess any valid word.

 But ENOUGH is 6 letters? No, 6 letters: E-N-O-U-G-H -> 6. So not valid.

 5-letter words: 
   E at position 1: 
      EPOCH -> E, P, O, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S. Valid.
   E at position 2:
      LEVER -> has E again and R -> avoid R.
      METAL -> has A -> avoid A.
      BENCH -> B, E, N, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S.

   E at position 3:
      OCEAN -> has A -> avoid A.
      UPPER -> has R -> avoid R.
      BUTTE -> has T repeated? and ends with E -> but we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? However, in BUTTE, the last letter is E, which we know is not the case. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

   Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E. So for position 3: 
      WORD: BELOW -> has L, O, W. But E is at position 2? Actually, BELOW: B(position1), E(position2), L(position3), O(position4), W(position5). So E is at position 2.

   Let me list by position:

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H)
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> but note: we don't know if the word has B, L, O, W. And we are testing E at position 2.

   Position 3: We need a word with E at position 3 and without R,A,I,S. Example: 
        CEDED -> has E at 2 and 4? and D. But we want to test E at 3? 
        Actually, let's find: 
        PENNE -> has E at the end? and also has N. But PENNE: P, E (position2), N (position3), N (position4), E (position5) -> we don't want E at the end.

   We can try: 
        DELVE -> D, E (position2), L, V, E (position5) -> avoid because E at the end.

   How about: 
        MELEE -> has E at the end and multiple E's? and M, L. But again, E at the end.

   We need to avoid E at position 5. So for position 3: 
        Example: BEGET -> E at position 2 and 4? and ends with T? Actually, BEGET: B, E, G, E, T -> E at 2 and 4, and T at 5. But we don't have E at 5? So that's okay? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

   However, we are only required to have E in the word, and we are trying to test other letters. We can use a word with E only once? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E only in one position (that is not 5) and avoid repeating.

   Let me think of a word with E at position 3: 
        TENET -> has E at 2 and 4? and T repeated. Also, ends with T, not E. But TENET: T, E, N, E, T -> E at 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's.

   Another: 
        DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.

   Another: 
        BERTH -> has R -> avoid.

   Another: 
        JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4? and ends with L. But we have E at 2 and 4. And avoids R,A,I,S.

   But we don't know if the word has two E's. We can use it? But we are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

   However, we have limited tries. We might avoid repeating letters in the second guess to maximize information.

   So, let's go back to the words without repeated letters and without E at the end.

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H) -> no repeat, and E at 1.
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> no repeat, E at 2.
   Position 3: We can try: 
        MEDIC -> but has I -> avoid I.
        PEDAL -> has A -> avoid A.
        FECAL -> has A -> avoid A.

   How about: 
        NEWLY -> N, E, W, L, Y -> E at position 2? Actually, NEWLY: N(position1), E(position2), W(position3), L(position4), Y(position5). So E at 2. But we already have BELOW for position 2.

   Actually, we can choose any. Let me choose between EPOCH and BELOW.

   Both are good. Let me pick BELOW because it has more common letters? Or EPOCH has less common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes T, N, which are very common.

   How about: 
        Position 3: 
          CENTO -> C, E, N, T, O -> E at position 2? CENTO: C(position1), E(position2), N(position3), T(position4), O(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

   We want E at position 3: 
          HONEY -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4? and ends with Y. So not at 3.

          TEMPO -> T, E, M, P, O -> E at position 2.

   It's hard to find a word with E at position 3 without the forbidden letters and without E at the end.

   Let me try: 
          BLEEP -> has E at 3 and 4? and ends with P? B, L, E, E, P -> E at 3 and 4 -> repeated and we don't know.

          CREPT -> has R -> avoid.

          DEPTH -> D, E, P, T, H -> E at position 2.

   How about: 
          LEECH -> has E at 1 and 2? and ends with H -> L, E, E, C, H -> E at 2 and 3? Actually, positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> E at 2 and 3 -> repeated.

   Another: 
          FETCH -> F, E, T, C, H -> E at 2.

   So, it seems difficult. Maybe we can try E at position 4? But we have to avoid position 5.

   Position 4: 
        Example: OUNCE -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? position 5 -> avoid.

        We must avoid E at position 5. So position 4 is allowed? But the word must have E at position 4 and not at 5? Then the last letter must not be E.

        Example: 
          BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          DANCE -> D, A, N, C, E -> has A and E at the end -> avoid.

          CONE -> only 4 letters? 5-letter: 
          OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          HORDE -> has R -> avoid.

          LUNGE -> L, U, N, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

        It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 that doesn't end with E? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is something else.

        Example: 
          OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> E at position 4, and ends with D. This is valid. And avoids R,A,I,S.

        So OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> E at 4.

   Now, we have three candidate words for the second guess:
      Option 1: EPOCH (E at 1, and letters P,O,C,H)
      Option 2: BELOW (E at 2, and letters B,E,L,O,W) -> note: E is repeated? No, BELOW has one E at position 2.
      Option 3: OGLED (E at 4, and letters O,G,L,E,D) -> has E at 4 and also at? OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> only one E at position 4.

   But note: we are allowed to use a word that has E only once? Yes.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. 

   We have already eliminated R, A, I, S. We are about to test a set of new letters.

   Option 1: EPOCH -> tests E, P, O, C, H -> 5 new letters (if we haven't tried any of these, which we haven't).
   Option 2: BELOW -> tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters (E we already know is present, but we are testing its position).
   Option 3: OGLED -> tests O, G, L, E, D -> 5 new letters.

   But note: in BELOW, we are testing E at position 2. In EPOCH, we are testing E at position 1. In OGLED, we are testing E at position 4.

   Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, testing E at a new position (1,2, or 4) is good.

   How to choose? We can pick the one that uses the most common letters. 

   Common consonants: T, N, S (but S is eliminated), R (eliminated), so next are: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

   Option 1: EPOCH has P, C, H (and O is a vowel). 
   Option 2: BELOW has B, L, W (and O). 
   Option 3: OGLED has G, L, D (and O).

   The letter L is common, so both BELOW and OGLED have L. But we don't know if L is in the word.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes T and N, which are very common. None of these have T or N.

   So, maybe we should form a word that includes T and N and E at a new position.

   For example, with E at position 2: 
        TENTH -> has T and N, but also has T repeated and ends with H? And E at position 2? T, E, N, T, H -> E at 2. But we have T at 1 and 4? and H at 5. Also, we don't know about T and N.

   But TENTH has repeated T? We can avoid repeats to test more letters.

   How about: 
        BENTO -> B, E, N, T, O -> E at 2. Avoids R,A,I,S. And tests B, E, N, T, O.

   This is a good candidate: BENTO.

   Now, we have a fourth candidate: BENTO (E at 2, and letters B, E, N, T, O).

   This tests the common letters: B, E, N, T, O.

   We know E is present, so we are testing B, N, T, O.

   This seems better because it includes T and N, which are very common.

   So, I choose BENTO.

   But wait: we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S. BENTO does not contain these.

   Therefore, our second guess: BENTO.

   We'll get feedback on each letter: 
        B: if in the word and at position 1? 
        E: if at position 2? (if it is, then we get a check; if not, then we get a minus or cross? but we know E is in the word, so it will be either check (if at position 2) or minus (if in the word but not at 2))
        N: at position 3?
        T: at position 4?
        O: at position 5?

   This will give us good information.

   So, let's go with BENTO.

<guess>BENTO</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but it must be in positions 1–4.
2. The word **excludes R, A, I, S**.
3. New guess should prioritize:
   - Including E in a position other than 5 (testing positions 1–4).
   - Introducing common untested letters (e.g., B, N, T, O).
   - Avoiding forbidden letters (R, A, I, S).

Optimal second guess: **BENTO**  
- Tests E in position 2 (new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants (B, N, T) and vowel (O).
- Maximizes new letter coverage: B, N, T, O are all untested.
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.

Actually, we can repeat letters but the secret word might have only one E? We don\'t know. But the feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for E was only one minus, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be two. However, we don\'t have evidence for two, so we might avoid repeating E for now to test more letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the middle.\n\n Let me think of words without R, A, I, S and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Common words: \n   with E at position 1: EGRET (but has R and E at the end) -> avoid R.\n   with E at position 1: ECLAT (but has A) -> avoid A.\n\n We must avoid R, A, I, S.\n\n So, let\'s try E at position 1: \n   Words: ENOUGH -> but has O, U, G, H. However, we don\'t know if these are in the word. But note: we are allowed to guess any valid word.\n\n But ENOUGH is 6 letters? No, 6 letters: E-N-O-U-G-H -> 6.

Valid.\n   E at position 2:\n      LEVER -> has E again and R -> avoid R.\n      METAL -> has A -> avoid A.\n      BENCH -> B, E, N, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n   E at position 3:\n      OCEAN -> has A -> avoid A.\n      UPPER -> has R -> avoid R.\n      BUTTE -> has T repeated? and ends with E -> but we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? However, in BUTTE, the last letter is E, which we know is not the case. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n   Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E. So for position 3: \n      WORD: BELOW -> has L, O, W. But E is at position 2? Actually, BELOW: B(position1), E(position2), L(position3), O(position4), W(position5). So E is at position 2.\n\n   Let me list by position:\n\n   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H)\n   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> but note: we don\'t know if the word has B, L, O, W.

But we want to test E at 3? \n        Actually, let\'s find: \n        PENNE -> has E at the end? and also has N. But PENNE: P, E (position2), N (position3), N (position4), E (position5) -> we don\'t want E at the end.\n\n   We can try: \n        DELVE -> D, E (position2), L, V, E (position5) -> avoid because E at the end.\n\n   How about: \n        MELEE -> has E at the end and multiple E\'s? and M, L. But again, E at the end.\n\n   We need to avoid E at position 5. So for position 3: \n        Example: BEGET -> E at position 2 and 4? and ends with T? Actually, BEGET: B, E, G, E, T -> E at 2 and 4, and T at 5. But we don\'t have E at 5? So that\'s okay? But we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n   However, we are only required to have E in the word, and we are trying to test other letters. We can use a word with E only once? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E only in one position (that is not 5) and avoid repeating.\n\n   Let me think of a word with E at position 3: \n        TENET -> has E at 2 and 4? and T repeated. Also, ends with T, not E. But TENET: T, E, N, E, T -> E at 2 and 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n   Another: \n        DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.\n\n   Another: \n        BERTH -> has R -> avoid.\n\n   Another: \n        JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4? and ends with L. But we have E at 2 and 4. And avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. We can use it? But we are trying to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n   However, we have limited tries. We might avoid repeating letters in the second guess to maximize information.\n\n   So, let\'s go back to the words without repeated letters and without E at the end.\n\n   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H) -> no repeat, and E at 1.\n   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> no repeat, E at 2.\n   Position 3: We can try: \n        MEDIC -> but has I -> avoid I.\n        PEDAL -> has A -> avoid A.\n        FECAL -> has A -> avoid A.\n\n   How about: \n        NEWLY -> N, E, W, L, Y -> E at position 2? Actually, NEWLY: N(position1), E(position2), W(position3), L(position4), Y(position5). So E at 2. But we already have BELOW for position 2.\n\n   Actually, we can choose any. Let me choose between EPOCH and BELOW.\n\n   Both are good. Let me pick BELOW because it has more common letters? Or EPOCH has less common letters? \n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes T, N, which are very common.\n\n   How about: \n        Position 3: \n          CENTO -> C, E, N, T, O -> E at position 2? CENTO: C(position1), E(position2), N(position3), T(position4), O(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.\n\n   We want E at position 3: \n          HONEY -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4? and ends with Y. So not at 3.\n\n          TEMPO -> T, E, M, P, O -> E at position 2.\n\n   It\'s hard to find a word with E at position 3 without the forbidden letters and without E at the end.\n\n   Let me try: \n          BLEEP -> has E at 3 and 4? and ends with P? B, L, E, E, P -> E at 3 and 4 -> repeated and we don\'t know.\n\n          CREPT -> has R -> avoid.\n\n          DEPTH -> D, E, P, T, H -> E at position 2.\n\n   How about: \n          LEECH -> has E at 1 and 2? and ends with H -> L, E, E, C, H -> E at 2 and 3? Actually, positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> E at 2 and 3 -> repeated.\n\n   Another: \n          FETCH -> F, E, T, C, H -> E at 2.\n\n   So, it seems difficult. Maybe we can try E at position 4? But we have to avoid position 5.\n\n   Position 4: \n        Example: OUNCE -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? position 5 -> avoid.\n\n        We must avoid E at position 5. So position 4 is allowed? But the word must have E at position 4 and not at 5? Then the last letter must not be E.\n\n        Example: \n          BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n          DANCE -> D, A, N, C, E -> has A and E at the end -> avoid.\n\n          CONE -> only 4 letters? 5-letter: \n          OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n          HORDE -> has R -> avoid.\n\n          LUNGE -> L, U, N, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n        It\'s hard to find a word with E at position 4 that doesn\'t end with E? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is something else.\n\n        Example: \n          OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> E at position 4, and ends with D. This is valid. And avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n        So OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> E at 4.\n\n   Now, we have three candidate words for the second guess:\n      Option 1: EPOCH (E at 1, and letters P,O,C,H)\n      Option 2: BELOW (E at 2, and letters B,E,L,O,W) -> note: E is repeated? No, BELOW has one E at position 2.\n      Option 3: OGLED (E at 4, and letters O,G,L,E,D) -> has E at 4 and also at? OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> only one E at position 4.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use a word that has E only once? Yes.\n\n   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. \n\n   We have already eliminated R, A, I, S. We are about to test a set of new letters.\n\n   Option 1: EPOCH -> tests E, P, O, C, H -> 5 new letters (if we haven\'t tried any of these, which we haven\'t).\n   Option 2: BELOW -> tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters (E we already know is present, but we are testing its position).\n   Option 3: OGLED -> tests O, G, L, E, D -> 5 new letters.\n\n   But note: in BELOW, we are testing E at position 2. In EPOCH, we are testing E at position 1. In OGLED, we are testing E at position 4.\n\n   Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, testing E at a new position (1,2, or 4) is good.\n\n   How to choose? We can pick the one that uses the most common letters. \n\n   Common consonants: T, N, S (but S is eliminated), R (eliminated), so next are: L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\n   Option 1: EPOCH has P, C, H (and O is a vowel). \n   Option 2: BELOW has B, L, W (and O). \n   Option 3: OGLED has G, L, D (and O).\n\n   The letter L is common, so both BELOW and OGLED have L. But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes T and N, which are very common. None of these have T or N.\n\n   So, maybe we should form a word that includes T and N and E at a new position.\n\n   For example, with E at position 2: \n        TENTH -> has T and N, but also has T repeated and ends with H? And E at position 2? T, E, N, T, H -> E at 2. But we have T at 1 and 4? and H at 5. Also, we don\'t know about T and N.\n\n   But TENTH has repeated T? We can avoid repeats to test more letters.\n\n   How about: \n        BENTO -> B, E, N, T, O -> E at 2. Avoids R,A,I,S. And tests B, E, N, T, O.\n\n   This is a good candidate: BENTO.\n\n   Now, we have a fourth candidate: BENTO (E at 2, and letters B, E, N, T, O).\n\n   This tests the common letters: B, E, N, T, O.\n\n   We know E is present, so we are testing B, N, T, O.\n\n   This seems better because it includes T and N, which are very common.\n\n   So, I choose BENTO.\n\n   But wait: we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S. BENTO does not contain these.\n\n   Therefore, our second guess: BENTO.\n\n   We\'ll get feedback on each letter: \n        B: if in the word and at position 1? \n        E: if at position 2?

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  R, A, I, S are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: BENTO -> B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)
Meaning:
  B, N, T, O are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not at position 2 (since we placed E at position 2 and got a minus).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at position 2 (from BENTO) and not at position 5 (from RAISE). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

- The following letters are not in the word: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.

We have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, B, N, T, O.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Contains the letter E (exactly one? we don't know, but at least one) at position 1, 3, or 4.
  - Does not contain: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: L, C, D, M, P, U, G, H, etc.

We can try to form words with E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's consider:

Option 1: E at position 1.
  Then the word starts with E. The remaining positions 2,3,4,5 must be filled with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the forbidden ones.

  Example words:
    ECHOS -> but has O and S -> forbidden.
    EDGES -> has S -> forbidden.
    EGGED -> has G and D, but also E at the end? and repeated G and E? We don't know about duplicates. But we are avoiding S, etc.

  We need to avoid S, R, A, I, B, N, T, O.

  Possible: 
    ECLAT -> has A -> forbidden.
    EPOXY -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but O is forbidden.

  Since O is forbidden, we avoid O.

  How about:
    EPHOR -> has O and R -> forbidden.

  Another:
    EMCEE -> has M, C, E, E -> but E is repeated. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, positions: E at 1 and 4? and 5? EMCEE: E, M, C, E, E -> but we have E at 1,4,5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so this is invalid? Actually, we are not allowed to put E at 5 because we know it's not there. So EMCEE is invalid for position 5.

  We must avoid E at position 5.

  So, for position 1: 
    We need a word: E _ _ _ _ 
    Without the forbidden letters and without E at 5.

    Example: 
      ELEGY -> E, L, E, G, Y -> has E at 1 and 3? and ends with Y. But we have E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing E at 1. Also, we are testing L, G, Y. However, we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

    But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. So we can try a word with two E's? But we want to test other letters.

    Alternatively, we can try to use a word with E only at position 1 and no other E.

    Example: 
      EPOCH -> but has O -> forbidden.
      ECLIP -> not a word? 
      EDUCT -> E, D, U, C, T -> but T is forbidden (from BENTO feedback: T(x)).

    T is forbidden? Yes, from BENTO: T(x). So we cannot use T.

    Similarly, N, O, B are forbidden.

    So, what about:
      EDGED -> E, D, G, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D repeated. Avoid E at 5? It ends with D, so E is not at 5. But we have E at 1 and 4. We don't know about duplicates.

    Another: 
      EGGER -> has G and E, but also R -> forbidden.

    Another: 
      EKING -> E, K, I, N, G -> has I and N -> forbidden.

    It's getting difficult. Maybe avoid position 1 for now.

Option 2: E at position 3.
  The word has the pattern: _ _ E _ _
  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5.

  Example words:
    AGENT -> has A, N -> forbidden.
    UPPER -> has R -> forbidden.
    BEVEL -> has B -> forbidden.
    LEVEL -> has L, E, V, E, L -> but BENTO said B is not in the word, but L is new. However, we have E at 3 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5. So LEVEL is invalid because of E at 5.

    We need to avoid E at 5.

    How about:
      CEDED -> C, E, D, E, D -> E at 2 and 4? not at 3? We want E at 3.

    We need E at position 3.

    Example: 
      DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.
      JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not at 3.
      PEDAL -> has A -> forbidden.

    How about:
      HELIX -> H, E, L, I, X -> has I -> forbidden.

    Another:
      FELON -> has O and N -> forbidden.

    Another:
      MELON -> same, has O and N.

    Another:
      WELCH -> W, E, L, C, H -> E at position 2? W(position1), E(position2), L(position3), C(position4), H(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

    We need E at position 3: 
        _ , _ , E , _ , _

    Example: 
      CREPT -> has R -> forbidden.
      GREET -> has R and E at 5 -> avoid.
      SHEET -> has S and E at 5 -> avoid.

    How about: 
      PLECK -> not a word.
      FLECK -> F, L, E, C, K -> E at position 3? F(1), L(2), E(3), C(4), K(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. And E is at 3.

    So FLECK is a candidate.

Option 3: E at position 4.
  Pattern: _ _ _ E _
  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5 (which is already satisfied because E is at 4, and 5 is a different position).

  Example words:
    OUNCE -> has O and E at 5? O, U, N, C, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
    BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
    OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> has O -> forbidden.

    We need to avoid O, and E must not be at 5.

    How about:
      CYCLE -> C, Y, C, L, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
      MAPLE -> has A -> forbidden.
      APPLE -> has A and P, but A forbidden.

    How about:
      CABLE -> has A and B -> forbidden.
      FABLE -> same.

    How about:
      EAGLE -> has A -> forbidden.

    How about:
      PIXEL -> has I and X -> I is forbidden.

    How about:
      JOULE -> has O and U -> O forbidden.

    How about:
      MULEY -> M, U, L, E, Y -> E at position 4? M(1), U(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So MULEY is a candidate? But is it a word? MULEY is an adjective meaning having mules, or a breed of cattle. It might be accepted.

    Another: 
      DUVET -> D, U, V, E, T -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      HOMED -> has O -> forbidden.

    Another:
      WIFED -> not a word? WIFE is a word, but WIFED? Not common.

    Another:
      GULET -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      CULET -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      PUKED -> P, U, K, E, D -> E at position 4? P(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). Avoids forbidden letters? Let's check: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So PUKED is a candidate.

    But PUKED is a valid word (past tense of puke).

So we have two candidates so far:
  FLECK (E at position 3) and PUKED (E at position 4).

We can also consider other positions? But we have to have E at 1,3, or 4. We haven't found a good candidate for position 1.

Another candidate for position 1? 
  With the remaining letters, let's try: 
    ECHED -> E, C, H, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D at 5. Avoids forbidden? ECHED: E(1), C(2), H(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at 1 and 4. We don't know about duplicates. And it tests C, H, D. But we have two E's? We are testing E at 1 and 4, but we already know E is in the word. So it might be acceptable.

  But is ECHED a word? It is the past tense of etch, but usually spelled ""etched"". ECHED might not be standard. Let's avoid.

  How about: 
    EMMEW -> not a word.
    EPHOD -> E, P, H, O, D -> has O -> forbidden.

  How about: 
    EXCEL -> E, X, C, E, L -> E at 1 and 4? and L at 5. Avoids forbidden? X, C, L are allowed. But we have two E's? And we are testing E at 1 and 4. But we know E is in the word, so having two E's might be okay if the word has two, but we don't know. Also, we are testing X, C, L.

  EXCEL is a valid word.

  So now we have three candidates: FLECK, PUKED, EXCEL.

But note: in EXCEL, we have E at position 1 and 4. We are trying to determine the position of E. If we guess EXCEL and we get:
  If the secret word has E at position 1, then we get a check for E at 1 and a minus for E at 4? But if the word has only one E, then the E at 4 might be marked as not present? But we know the word has at least one E. Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one E, then only the E in the correct position (if any) would be marked, and the other E would be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's, then both might be marked appropriately.

But the rules: 
  - If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
  - If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position: -
  - If the letter is not in the word: x

But if the word has only one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) would be ✓, and the other would be x? Or if both are in the word but one is in the wrong position? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess, but the secret word might have fewer occurrences.

Standard Wordle rules: 
  For example, if the secret word has one E, and we guess a word with two E's:
      - If one of them is in the correct position, that one gets ✓, and the other gets x (because the secret has only one E).
      - If neither is in the correct position, but the secret has one E, then one of the E's (the first one?) gets a minus, and the other gets x? Actually, the feedback is independent per position? 

  But the actual rule: 
      The feedback is given by:
        First, mark all correct positions (green).
        Then, for the remaining letters in the guess, mark those that are in the word but not in the correct position (yellow), but only as many as there are remaining in the secret.

  So if the secret has one E, and we have two E's in the guess:
      - If one is in the correct position, it gets green. The other E gets gray (x) because there are no more E's in the secret.
      - If neither is in the correct position, then one of the E's (the first one in the guess? or any?) gets yellow, and the other gets gray.

  But in our case, we don't know how many E's the secret word has.

Given the complexity, we might avoid words with repeated E's to reduce ambiguity.

So, let's avoid EXCEL for now because it has two E's.

We are left with FLECK and PUKED.

FLECK: E at position 3, and letters F, L, C, K.
PUKED: E at position 4, and letters P, U, K, E, D -> but note: E is at 4, and we are not repeating E? PUKED has one E.

Both are valid and avoid forbidden letters.

Which one to choose? We can choose the one that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, C, D, P, U, etc.

FLECK: F, L, E, C, K -> tests F, L, C, K (and E at 3).
PUKED: P, U, K, E, D -> tests P, U, K, D (and E at 4).

Both test 4 new letters.

But note: we have already used E, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

Common consonants: L, C, P, D, U (vowel).

FLECK has L and C, which are more common than U and D? 

We can also consider that we are testing E at a new position: either 3 or 4.

We know E is not at 2 or 5, so both 3 and 4 are possible.

We can choose FLECK because it has L and C, which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose PUKED to test U and D.

But let's see: if we choose FLECK and we get feedback, it might help us narrow down.

We'll go with FLECK.

So, third guess: FLECK.

But wait, let's confirm the word: FLECK is a valid English word (a small particle or a streak).

Therefore, we guess FLECK.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R, A, I, S are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **BENTO**: B, N, T, O are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-) and **not at position 2**.

### Key Deductions:
1. **E is in the word** but **not at positions 2 or 5**. It must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
2. **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O (cannot be used).
3. **Untested letters**: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Include E** in position 1, 3, or 4 to test its correct location.
- **Maximize new letter coverage** with common consonants (e.g., L, C, P, D) and vowels (e.g., U).
- Avoid excluded letters and positions where E is invalid (positions 2 and 5).

Optimal guess: **FLECK**  
- Tests E in **position 3** (a new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants: F, L, C, K (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to all constraints.

<guess>FLECK</guess>",FLECK,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  R, A, I, S are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: BENTO -> B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)
Meaning:
  B, N, T, O are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not at position 2 (since we placed E at position 2 and got a minus).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at position 2 (from BENTO) and not at position 5 (from RAISE). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

- The following letters are not in the word: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.

We have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, B, N, T, O.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Contains the letter E (exactly one? we don't know, but at least one) at position 1, 3, or 4.
  - Does not contain: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: L, C, D, M, P, U, G, H, etc.

We can try to form words with E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's consider:

Option 1: E at position 1.
  Then the word starts with E. The remaining positions 2,3,4,5 must be filled with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the forbidden ones.

  Example words:
    ECHOS -> but has O and S -> forbidden.
    EDGES -> has S -> forbidden.
    EGGED -> has G and D, but also E at the end? and repeated G and E? We don't know about duplicates. But we are avoiding S, etc.

  We need to avoid S, R, A, I, B, N, T, O.

  Possible: 
    ECLAT -> has A -> forbidden.
    EPOXY -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but O is forbidden.

  Since O is forbidden, we avoid O.

  How about:
    EPHOR -> has O and R -> forbidden.

  Another:
    EMCEE -> has M, C, E, E -> but E is repeated. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, positions: E at 1 and 4? and 5? EMCEE: E, M, C, E, E -> but we have E at 1,4,5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so this is invalid? Actually, we are not allowed to put E at 5 because we know it's not there. So EMCEE is invalid for position 5.

  We must avoid E at position 5.

  So, for position 1: 
    We need a word: E _ _ _ _ 
    Without the forbidden letters and without E at 5.

    Example: 
      ELEGY -> E, L, E, G, Y -> has E at 1 and 3? and ends with Y. But we have E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing E at 1. Also, we are testing L, G, Y. However, we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

    But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. So we can try a word with two E's? But we want to test other letters.

    Alternatively, we can try to use a word with E only at position 1 and no other E.

    Example: 
      EPOCH -> but has O -> forbidden.
      ECLIP -> not a word? 
      EDUCT -> E, D, U, C, T -> but T is forbidden (from BENTO feedback: T(x)).

    T is forbidden? Yes, from BENTO: T(x). So we cannot use T.

    Similarly, N, O, B are forbidden.

    So, what about:
      EDGED -> E, D, G, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D repeated. Avoid E at 5? It ends with D, so E is not at 5. But we have E at 1 and 4. We don't know about duplicates.

    Another: 
      EGGER -> has G and E, but also R -> forbidden.

    Another: 
      EKING -> E, K, I, N, G -> has I and N -> forbidden.

    It's getting difficult. Maybe avoid position 1 for now.

Option 2: E at position 3.
  The word has the pattern: _ _ E _ _
  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5.

  Example words:
    AGENT -> has A, N -> forbidden.
    UPPER -> has R -> forbidden.
    BEVEL -> has B -> forbidden.
    LEVEL -> has L, E, V, E, L -> but BENTO said B is not in the word, but L is new. However, we have E at 3 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5. So LEVEL is invalid because of E at 5.

    We need to avoid E at 5.

    How about:
      CEDED -> C, E, D, E, D -> E at 2 and 4? not at 3? We want E at 3.

    We need E at position 3.

    Example: 
      DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.
      JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not at 3.
      PEDAL -> has A -> forbidden.

    How about:
      HELIX -> H, E, L, I, X -> has I -> forbidden.

    Another:
      FELON -> has O and N -> forbidden.

    Another:
      MELON -> same, has O and N.

    Another:
      WELCH -> W, E, L, C, H -> E at position 2? W(position1), E(position2), L(position3), C(position4), H(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

    We need E at position 3: 
        _ , _ , E , _ , _

    Example: 
      CREPT -> has R -> forbidden.
      GREET -> has R and E at 5 -> avoid.
      SHEET -> has S and E at 5 -> avoid.

    How about: 
      PLECK -> not a word.
      FLECK -> F, L, E, C, K -> E at position 3? F(1), L(2), E(3), C(4), K(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. And E is at 3.

    So FLECK is a candidate.

Option 3: E at position 4.
  Pattern: _ _ _ E _
  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5 (which is already satisfied because E is at 4, and 5 is a different position).

  Example words:
    OUNCE -> has O and E at 5? O, U, N, C, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
    BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
    OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> has O -> forbidden.

    We need to avoid O, and E must not be at 5.

    How about:
      CYCLE -> C, Y, C, L, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
      MAPLE -> has A -> forbidden.
      APPLE -> has A and P, but A forbidden.

    How about:
      CABLE -> has A and B -> forbidden.
      FABLE -> same.

    How about:
      EAGLE -> has A -> forbidden.

    How about:
      PIXEL -> has I and X -> I is forbidden.

    How about:
      JOULE -> has O and U -> O forbidden.

    How about:
      MULEY -> M, U, L, E, Y -> E at position 4? M(1), U(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So MULEY is a candidate? But is it a word? MULEY is an adjective meaning having mules, or a breed of cattle. It might be accepted.

    Another: 
      DUVET -> D, U, V, E, T -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      HOMED -> has O -> forbidden.

    Another:
      WIFED -> not a word? WIFE is a word, but WIFED? Not common.

    Another:
      GULET -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      CULET -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      PUKED -> P, U, K, E, D -> E at position 4? P(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). Avoids forbidden letters? Let's check: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So PUKED is a candidate.

    But PUKED is a valid word (past tense of puke).

So we have two candidates so far:
  FLECK (E at position 3) and PUKED (E at position 4).

We can also consider other positions? But we have to have E at 1,3, or 4. We haven't found a good candidate for position 1.

Another candidate for position 1? 
  With the remaining letters, let's try: 
    ECHED -> E, C, H, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D at 5. Avoids forbidden? ECHED: E(1), C(2), H(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at 1 and 4. We don't know about duplicates. And it tests C, H, D. But we have two E's? We are testing E at 1 and 4, but we already know E is in the word. So it might be acceptable.

  But is ECHED a word? It is the past tense of etch, but usually spelled ""etched"". ECHED might not be standard. Let's avoid.

  How about: 
    EMMEW -> not a word.
    EPHOD -> E, P, H, O, D -> has O -> forbidden.

  How about: 
    EXCEL -> E, X, C, E, L -> E at 1 and 4? and L at 5. Avoids forbidden? X, C, L are allowed. But we have two E's? And we are testing E at 1 and 4. But we know E is in the word, so having two E's might be okay if the word has two, but we don't know. Also, we are testing X, C, L.

  EXCEL is a valid word.

  So now we have three candidates: FLECK, PUKED, EXCEL.

But note: in EXCEL, we have E at position 1 and 4. We are trying to determine the position of E. If we guess EXCEL and we get:
  If the secret word has E at position 1, then we get a check for E at 1 and a minus for E at 4? But if the word has only one E, then the E at 4 might be marked as not present? But we know the word has at least one E. Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one E, then only the E in the correct position (if any) would be marked, and the other E would be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's, then both might be marked appropriately.

But the rules: 
  - If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
  - If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position: -
  - If the letter is not in the word: x

But if the word has only one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) would be ✓, and the other would be x? Or if both are in the word but one is in the wrong position? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess, but the secret word might have fewer occurrences.

Standard Wordle rules: 
  For example, if the secret word has one E, and we guess a word with two E's:
      - If one of them is in the correct position, that one gets ✓, and the other gets x (because the secret has only one E).
      - If neither is in the correct position, but the secret has one E, then one of the E's (the first one?) gets a minus, and the other gets x? Actually, the feedback is independent per position? 

  But the actual rule: 
      The feedback is given by:
        First, mark all correct positions (green).
        Then, for the remaining letters in the guess, mark those that are in the word but not in the correct position (yellow), but only as many as there are remaining in the secret.

  So if the secret has one E, and we have two E's in the guess:
      - If one is in the correct position, it gets green. The other E gets gray (x) because there are no more E's in the secret.
      - If neither is in the correct position, then one of the E's (the first one in the guess? or any?) gets yellow, and the other gets gray.

  But in our case, we don't know how many E's the secret word has.

Given the complexity, we might avoid words with repeated E's to reduce ambiguity.

So, let's avoid EXCEL for now because it has two E's.

We are left with FLECK and PUKED.

FLECK: E at position 3, and letters F, L, C, K.
PUKED: E at position 4, and letters P, U, K, E, D -> but note: E is at 4, and we are not repeating E? PUKED has one E.

Both are valid and avoid forbidden letters.

Which one to choose? We can choose the one that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, C, D, P, U, etc.

FLECK: F, L, E, C, K -> tests F, L, C, K (and E at 3).
PUKED: P, U, K, E, D -> tests P, U, K, D (and E at 4).

Both test 4 new letters.

But note: we have already used E, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

Common consonants: L, C, P, D, U (vowel).

FLECK has L and C, which are more common than U and D? 

We can also consider that we are testing E at a new position: either 3 or 4.

We know E is not at 2 or 5, so both 3 and 4 are possible.

We can choose FLECK because it has L and C, which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose PUKED to test U and D.

But let's see: if we choose FLECK and we get feedback, it might help us narrow down.

We'll go with FLECK.

So, third guess: FLECK.

But wait, let's confirm the word: FLECK is a valid English word (a small particle or a streak).

Therefore, we guess FLECK.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R, A, I, S are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **BENTO**: B, N, T, O are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-) and **not at position 2**.

### Key Deductions:
1. **E is in the word** but **not at positions 2 or 5**. It must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
2. **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O (cannot be used).
3. **Untested letters**: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Include E** in position 1, 3, or 4 to test its correct location.
- **Maximize new letter coverage** with common consonants (e.g., L, C, P, D) and vowels (e.g., U).
- Avoid excluded letters and positions where E is invalid (positions 2 and 5).

Optimal guess: **FLECK**  
- Tests E in **position 3** (a new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants: F, L, C, K (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to all constraints.",Guess 3: FLECK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) E(✓) C(-) K(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,cheek,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often contains common vowels and consonants. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are popular.
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it avoids repeated letters.
 But note: We are allowed any valid English word. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good starter because it has more vowels and common letters.

 However, to cover more common letters, I choose ""RAISE"" because it has A, E, I (three vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 But the problem requires 5-letter word. Let me confirm ""RAISE"" is valid -> yes.

 Let me go with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

 After this guess, we will receive feedback that tells us:
   For each letter: 
        if it's in the correct position (✓)
        if it's in the word but wrong position (-)
        if not in the word (x)

 Then we can use that to narrow down the word list.

 So, my first guess: RAISEI am starting with ""RAISE"" because it's a strategic first guess in Wordle. It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing letter coverage. This helps identify which letters are present and their potential positions early. Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with—my goal is simply to gather initial clues efficiently.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end). Also, the word does not contain R, A, I, or S.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1,2,3,4 of our guess? Actually, we only know it's not at the position we guessed, which was position 5. It could be at any other position in the word, but we don't know which one yet).

 Also, we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S.

 Since E is in the word, we should try to include E in our next guess, but not at the end (position 5). We can try placing E in different positions.

 Moreover, we need to choose a word that uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes E and some of these new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 However, note that we have no information about the other letters, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be a word that has E in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we have eliminated A and I, so the vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

 But wait: the feedback for E is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not at the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5, so it must be in one of the positions 1-4.

 Let's try to choose a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and includes other common letters.

 Some possibilities:

 Position 1: E _ _ _ _ 
   Example: ETHER (but has E at the end too, which we don't want to repeat? Actually, we can repeat letters but the secret word might have only one E? We don't know. But the feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for E was only one minus, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, we don't have evidence for two, so we might avoid repeating E for now to test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the middle.

 Let me think of words without R, A, I, S and with E in a position other than 5.

 Common words: 
   with E at position 1: EGRET (but has R and E at the end) -> avoid R.
   with E at position 1: ECLAT (but has A) -> avoid A.

 We must avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's try E at position 1: 
   Words: ENOUGH -> but has O, U, G, H. However, we don't know if these are in the word. But note: we are allowed to guess any valid word.

 But ENOUGH is 6 letters? No, 6 letters: E-N-O-U-G-H -> 6. So not valid.

 5-letter words: 
   E at position 1: 
      EPOCH -> E, P, O, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S. Valid.
   E at position 2:
      LEVER -> has E again and R -> avoid R.
      METAL -> has A -> avoid A.
      BENCH -> B, E, N, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S.

   E at position 3:
      OCEAN -> has A -> avoid A.
      UPPER -> has R -> avoid R.
      BUTTE -> has T repeated? and ends with E -> but we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? However, in BUTTE, the last letter is E, which we know is not the case. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

   Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E. So for position 3: 
      WORD: BELOW -> has L, O, W. But E is at position 2? Actually, BELOW: B(position1), E(position2), L(position3), O(position4), W(position5). So E is at position 2.

   Let me list by position:

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H)
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> but note: we don't know if the word has B, L, O, W. And we are testing E at position 2.

   Position 3: We need a word with E at position 3 and without R,A,I,S. Example: 
        CEDED -> has E at 2 and 4? and D. But we want to test E at 3? 
        Actually, let's find: 
        PENNE -> has E at the end? and also has N. But PENNE: P, E (position2), N (position3), N (position4), E (position5) -> we don't want E at the end.

   We can try: 
        DELVE -> D, E (position2), L, V, E (position5) -> avoid because E at the end.

   How about: 
        MELEE -> has E at the end and multiple E's? and M, L. But again, E at the end.

   We need to avoid E at position 5. So for position 3: 
        Example: BEGET -> E at position 2 and 4? and ends with T? Actually, BEGET: B, E, G, E, T -> E at 2 and 4, and T at 5. But we don't have E at 5? So that's okay? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

   However, we are only required to have E in the word, and we are trying to test other letters. We can use a word with E only once? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E only in one position (that is not 5) and avoid repeating.

   Let me think of a word with E at position 3: 
        TENET -> has E at 2 and 4? and T repeated. Also, ends with T, not E. But TENET: T, E, N, E, T -> E at 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's.

   Another: 
        DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.

   Another: 
        BERTH -> has R -> avoid.

   Another: 
        JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4? and ends with L. But we have E at 2 and 4. And avoids R,A,I,S.

   But we don't know if the word has two E's. We can use it? But we are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

   However, we have limited tries. We might avoid repeating letters in the second guess to maximize information.

   So, let's go back to the words without repeated letters and without E at the end.

   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H) -> no repeat, and E at 1.
   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> no repeat, E at 2.
   Position 3: We can try: 
        MEDIC -> but has I -> avoid I.
        PEDAL -> has A -> avoid A.
        FECAL -> has A -> avoid A.

   How about: 
        NEWLY -> N, E, W, L, Y -> E at position 2? Actually, NEWLY: N(position1), E(position2), W(position3), L(position4), Y(position5). So E at 2. But we already have BELOW for position 2.

   Actually, we can choose any. Let me choose between EPOCH and BELOW.

   Both are good. Let me pick BELOW because it has more common letters? Or EPOCH has less common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes T, N, which are very common.

   How about: 
        Position 3: 
          CENTO -> C, E, N, T, O -> E at position 2? CENTO: C(position1), E(position2), N(position3), T(position4), O(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

   We want E at position 3: 
          HONEY -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4? and ends with Y. So not at 3.

          TEMPO -> T, E, M, P, O -> E at position 2.

   It's hard to find a word with E at position 3 without the forbidden letters and without E at the end.

   Let me try: 
          BLEEP -> has E at 3 and 4? and ends with P? B, L, E, E, P -> E at 3 and 4 -> repeated and we don't know.

          CREPT -> has R -> avoid.

          DEPTH -> D, E, P, T, H -> E at position 2.

   How about: 
          LEECH -> has E at 1 and 2? and ends with H -> L, E, E, C, H -> E at 2 and 3? Actually, positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> E at 2 and 3 -> repeated.

   Another: 
          FETCH -> F, E, T, C, H -> E at 2.

   So, it seems difficult. Maybe we can try E at position 4? But we have to avoid position 5.

   Position 4: 
        Example: OUNCE -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? position 5 -> avoid.

        We must avoid E at position 5. So position 4 is allowed? But the word must have E at position 4 and not at 5? Then the last letter must not be E.

        Example: 
          BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          DANCE -> D, A, N, C, E -> has A and E at the end -> avoid.

          CONE -> only 4 letters? 5-letter: 
          OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

          HORDE -> has R -> avoid.

          LUNGE -> L, U, N, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.

        It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 that doesn't end with E? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is something else.

        Example: 
          OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> E at position 4, and ends with D. This is valid. And avoids R,A,I,S.

        So OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> E at 4.

   Now, we have three candidate words for the second guess:
      Option 1: EPOCH (E at 1, and letters P,O,C,H)
      Option 2: BELOW (E at 2, and letters B,E,L,O,W) -> note: E is repeated? No, BELOW has one E at position 2.
      Option 3: OGLED (E at 4, and letters O,G,L,E,D) -> has E at 4 and also at? OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> only one E at position 4.

   But note: we are allowed to use a word that has E only once? Yes.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. 

   We have already eliminated R, A, I, S. We are about to test a set of new letters.

   Option 1: EPOCH -> tests E, P, O, C, H -> 5 new letters (if we haven't tried any of these, which we haven't).
   Option 2: BELOW -> tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters (E we already know is present, but we are testing its position).
   Option 3: OGLED -> tests O, G, L, E, D -> 5 new letters.

   But note: in BELOW, we are testing E at position 2. In EPOCH, we are testing E at position 1. In OGLED, we are testing E at position 4.

   Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, testing E at a new position (1,2, or 4) is good.

   How to choose? We can pick the one that uses the most common letters. 

   Common consonants: T, N, S (but S is eliminated), R (eliminated), so next are: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

   Option 1: EPOCH has P, C, H (and O is a vowel). 
   Option 2: BELOW has B, L, W (and O). 
   Option 3: OGLED has G, L, D (and O).

   The letter L is common, so both BELOW and OGLED have L. But we don't know if L is in the word.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes T and N, which are very common. None of these have T or N.

   So, maybe we should form a word that includes T and N and E at a new position.

   For example, with E at position 2: 
        TENTH -> has T and N, but also has T repeated and ends with H? And E at position 2? T, E, N, T, H -> E at 2. But we have T at 1 and 4? and H at 5. Also, we don't know about T and N.

   But TENTH has repeated T? We can avoid repeats to test more letters.

   How about: 
        BENTO -> B, E, N, T, O -> E at 2. Avoids R,A,I,S. And tests B, E, N, T, O.

   This is a good candidate: BENTO.

   Now, we have a fourth candidate: BENTO (E at 2, and letters B, E, N, T, O).

   This tests the common letters: B, E, N, T, O.

   We know E is present, so we are testing B, N, T, O.

   This seems better because it includes T and N, which are very common.

   So, I choose BENTO.

   But wait: we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S. BENTO does not contain these.

   Therefore, our second guess: BENTO.

   We'll get feedback on each letter: 
        B: if in the word and at position 1? 
        E: if at position 2? (if it is, then we get a check; if not, then we get a minus or cross? but we know E is in the word, so it will be either check (if at position 2) or minus (if in the word but not at 2))
        N: at position 3?
        T: at position 4?
        O: at position 5?

   This will give us good information.

   So, let's go with BENTO.

<guess>BENTO</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but it must be in positions 1–4.
2. The word **excludes R, A, I, S**.
3. New guess should prioritize:
   - Including E in a position other than 5 (testing positions 1–4).
   - Introducing common untested letters (e.g., B, N, T, O).
   - Avoiding forbidden letters (R, A, I, S).

Optimal second guess: **BENTO**  
- Tests E in position 2 (new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants (B, N, T) and vowel (O).
- Maximizes new letter coverage: B, N, T, O are all untested.
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.

<guess>BENTO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BENTO -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  R, A, I, S are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: BENTO -> B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)
Meaning:
  B, N, T, O are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not at position 2 (since we placed E at position 2 and got a minus).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at position 2 (from BENTO) and not at position 5 (from RAISE). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

- The following letters are not in the word: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.

We have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, B, N, T, O.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Contains the letter E (exactly one? we don't know, but at least one) at position 1, 3, or 4.
  - Does not contain: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: L, C, D, M, P, U, G, H, etc.

We can try to form words with E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's consider:

Option 1: E at position 1.
  Then the word starts with E. The remaining positions 2,3,4,5 must be filled with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the forbidden ones.

  Example words:
    ECHOS -> but has O and S -> forbidden.
    EDGES -> has S -> forbidden.
    EGGED -> has G and D, but also E at the end? and repeated G and E? We don't know about duplicates. But we are avoiding S, etc.

  We need to avoid S, R, A, I, B, N, T, O.

  Possible: 
    ECLAT -> has A -> forbidden.
    EPOXY -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but O is forbidden.

  Since O is forbidden, we avoid O.

  How about:
    EPHOR -> has O and R -> forbidden.

  Another:
    EMCEE -> has M, C, E, E -> but E is repeated. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, positions: E at 1 and 4? and 5? EMCEE: E, M, C, E, E -> but we have E at 1,4,5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so this is invalid? Actually, we are not allowed to put E at 5 because we know it's not there. So EMCEE is invalid for position 5.

  We must avoid E at position 5.

  So, for position 1: 
    We need a word: E _ _ _ _ 
    Without the forbidden letters and without E at 5.

    Example: 
      ELEGY -> E, L, E, G, Y -> has E at 1 and 3? and ends with Y. But we have E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing E at 1. Also, we are testing L, G, Y. However, we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

    But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. So we can try a word with two E's? But we want to test other letters.

    Alternatively, we can try to use a word with E only at position 1 and no other E.

    Example: 
      EPOCH -> but has O -> forbidden.
      ECLIP -> not a word? 
      EDUCT -> E, D, U, C, T -> but T is forbidden (from BENTO feedback: T(x)).

    T is forbidden? Yes, from BENTO: T(x). So we cannot use T.

    Similarly, N, O, B are forbidden.

    So, what about:
      EDGED -> E, D, G, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D repeated. Avoid E at 5? It ends with D, so E is not at 5. But we have E at 1 and 4. We don't know about duplicates.

    Another: 
      EGGER -> has G and E, but also R -> forbidden.

    Another: 
      EKING -> E, K, I, N, G -> has I and N -> forbidden.

    It's getting difficult. Maybe avoid position 1 for now.

Option 2: E at position 3.
  The word has the pattern: _ _ E _ _
  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5.

  Example words:
    AGENT -> has A, N -> forbidden.
    UPPER -> has R -> forbidden.
    BEVEL -> has B -> forbidden.
    LEVEL -> has L, E, V, E, L -> but BENTO said B is not in the word, but L is new. However, we have E at 3 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5. So LEVEL is invalid because of E at 5.

    We need to avoid E at 5.

    How about:
      CEDED -> C, E, D, E, D -> E at 2 and 4? not at 3? We want E at 3.

    We need E at position 3.

    Example: 
      DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.
      JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not at 3.
      PEDAL -> has A -> forbidden.

    How about:
      HELIX -> H, E, L, I, X -> has I -> forbidden.

    Another:
      FELON -> has O and N -> forbidden.

    Another:
      MELON -> same, has O and N.

    Another:
      WELCH -> W, E, L, C, H -> E at position 2? W(position1), E(position2), L(position3), C(position4), H(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.

    We need E at position 3: 
        _ , _ , E , _ , _

    Example: 
      CREPT -> has R -> forbidden.
      GREET -> has R and E at 5 -> avoid.
      SHEET -> has S and E at 5 -> avoid.

    How about: 
      PLECK -> not a word.
      FLECK -> F, L, E, C, K -> E at position 3? F(1), L(2), E(3), C(4), K(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. And E is at 3.

    So FLECK is a candidate.

Option 3: E at position 4.
  Pattern: _ _ _ E _
  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5 (which is already satisfied because E is at 4, and 5 is a different position).

  Example words:
    OUNCE -> has O and E at 5? O, U, N, C, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
    BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
    OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> has O -> forbidden.

    We need to avoid O, and E must not be at 5.

    How about:
      CYCLE -> C, Y, C, L, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.
      MAPLE -> has A -> forbidden.
      APPLE -> has A and P, but A forbidden.

    How about:
      CABLE -> has A and B -> forbidden.
      FABLE -> same.

    How about:
      EAGLE -> has A -> forbidden.

    How about:
      PIXEL -> has I and X -> I is forbidden.

    How about:
      JOULE -> has O and U -> O forbidden.

    How about:
      MULEY -> M, U, L, E, Y -> E at position 4? M(1), U(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So MULEY is a candidate? But is it a word? MULEY is an adjective meaning having mules, or a breed of cattle. It might be accepted.

    Another: 
      DUVET -> D, U, V, E, T -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      HOMED -> has O -> forbidden.

    Another:
      WIFED -> not a word? WIFE is a word, but WIFED? Not common.

    Another:
      GULET -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      CULET -> has T -> forbidden.

    Another:
      PUKED -> P, U, K, E, D -> E at position 4? P(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). Avoids forbidden letters? Let's check: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So PUKED is a candidate.

    But PUKED is a valid word (past tense of puke).

So we have two candidates so far:
  FLECK (E at position 3) and PUKED (E at position 4).

We can also consider other positions? But we have to have E at 1,3, or 4. We haven't found a good candidate for position 1.

Another candidate for position 1? 
  With the remaining letters, let's try: 
    ECHED -> E, C, H, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D at 5. Avoids forbidden? ECHED: E(1), C(2), H(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at 1 and 4. We don't know about duplicates. And it tests C, H, D. But we have two E's? We are testing E at 1 and 4, but we already know E is in the word. So it might be acceptable.

  But is ECHED a word? It is the past tense of etch, but usually spelled ""etched"". ECHED might not be standard. Let's avoid.

  How about: 
    EMMEW -> not a word.
    EPHOD -> E, P, H, O, D -> has O -> forbidden.

  How about: 
    EXCEL -> E, X, C, E, L -> E at 1 and 4? and L at 5. Avoids forbidden? X, C, L are allowed. But we have two E's? And we are testing E at 1 and 4. But we know E is in the word, so having two E's might be okay if the word has two, but we don't know. Also, we are testing X, C, L.

  EXCEL is a valid word.

  So now we have three candidates: FLECK, PUKED, EXCEL.

But note: in EXCEL, we have E at position 1 and 4. We are trying to determine the position of E. If we guess EXCEL and we get:
  If the secret word has E at position 1, then we get a check for E at 1 and a minus for E at 4? But if the word has only one E, then the E at 4 might be marked as not present? But we know the word has at least one E. Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one E, then only the E in the correct position (if any) would be marked, and the other E would be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's, then both might be marked appropriately.

But the rules: 
  - If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
  - If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position: -
  - If the letter is not in the word: x

But if the word has only one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) would be ✓, and the other would be x? Or if both are in the word but one is in the wrong position? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess, but the secret word might have fewer occurrences.

Standard Wordle rules: 
  For example, if the secret word has one E, and we guess a word with two E's:
      - If one of them is in the correct position, that one gets ✓, and the other gets x (because the secret has only one E).
      - If neither is in the correct position, but the secret has one E, then one of the E's (the first one?) gets a minus, and the other gets x? Actually, the feedback is independent per position? 

  But the actual rule: 
      The feedback is given by:
        First, mark all correct positions (green).
        Then, for the remaining letters in the guess, mark those that are in the word but not in the correct position (yellow), but only as many as there are remaining in the secret.

  So if the secret has one E, and we have two E's in the guess:
      - If one is in the correct position, it gets green. The other E gets gray (x) because there are no more E's in the secret.
      - If neither is in the correct position, then one of the E's (the first one in the guess? or any?) gets yellow, and the other gets gray.

  But in our case, we don't know how many E's the secret word has.

Given the complexity, we might avoid words with repeated E's to reduce ambiguity.

So, let's avoid EXCEL for now because it has two E's.

We are left with FLECK and PUKED.

FLECK: E at position 3, and letters F, L, C, K.
PUKED: E at position 4, and letters P, U, K, E, D -> but note: E is at 4, and we are not repeating E? PUKED has one E.

Both are valid and avoid forbidden letters.

Which one to choose? We can choose the one that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, C, D, P, U, etc.

FLECK: F, L, E, C, K -> tests F, L, C, K (and E at 3).
PUKED: P, U, K, E, D -> tests P, U, K, D (and E at 4).

Both test 4 new letters.

But note: we have already used E, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

Common consonants: L, C, P, D, U (vowel).

FLECK has L and C, which are more common than U and D? 

We can also consider that we are testing E at a new position: either 3 or 4.

We know E is not at 2 or 5, so both 3 and 4 are possible.

We can choose FLECK because it has L and C, which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose PUKED to test U and D.

But let's see: if we choose FLECK and we get feedback, it might help us narrow down.

We'll go with FLECK.

So, third guess: FLECK.

But wait, let's confirm the word: FLECK is a valid English word (a small particle or a streak).

Therefore, we guess FLECK.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R, A, I, S are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **BENTO**: B, N, T, O are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-) and **not at position 2**.

### Key Deductions:
1. **E is in the word** but **not at positions 2 or 5**. It must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
2. **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O (cannot be used).
3. **Untested letters**: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Include E** in position 1, 3, or 4 to test its correct location.
- **Maximize new letter coverage** with common consonants (e.g., L, C, P, D) and vowels (e.g., U).
- Avoid excluded letters and positions where E is invalid (positions 2 and 5).

Optimal guess: **FLECK**  
- Tests E in **position 3** (a new position to check).
- Introduces high-frequency consonants: F, L, C, K (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to all constraints.

Also, the word does not contain R, A, I, or S.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n   The secret word has the letter E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1,2,3,4 of our guess?

Actually, we can repeat letters but the secret word might have only one E? We don\'t know. But the feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for E was only one minus, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be two. However, we don\'t have evidence for two, so we might avoid repeating E for now to test more letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the middle.\n\n Let me think of words without R, A, I, S and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Common words: \n   with E at position 1: EGRET (but has R and E at the end) -> avoid R.\n   with E at position 1: ECLAT (but has A) -> avoid A.\n\n We must avoid R, A, I, S.\n\n So, let\'s try E at position 1: \n   Words: ENOUGH -> but has O, U, G, H. However, we don\'t know if these are in the word. But note: we are allowed to guess any valid word.\n\n But ENOUGH is 6 letters? No, 6 letters: E-N-O-U-G-H -> 6.

Valid.\n   E at position 2:\n      LEVER -> has E again and R -> avoid R.\n      METAL -> has A -> avoid A.\n      BENCH -> B, E, N, C, H -> avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n   E at position 3:\n      OCEAN -> has A -> avoid A.\n      UPPER -> has R -> avoid R.\n      BUTTE -> has T repeated? and ends with E -> but we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? However, in BUTTE, the last letter is E, which we know is not the case. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n   Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E. So for position 3: \n      WORD: BELOW -> has L, O, W. But E is at position 2? Actually, BELOW: B(position1), E(position2), L(position3), O(position4), W(position5). So E is at position 2.\n\n   Let me list by position:\n\n   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H)\n   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> but note: we don\'t know if the word has B, L, O, W. And we are testing E at position 2.\n\n   Position 3: We need a word with E at position 3 and without R,A,I,S. Example: \n        CEDED -> has E at 2 and 4? and D. But we want to test E at 3? \n        Actually, let\'s find: \n        PENNE -> has E at the end? and also has N. But PENNE: P, E (position2), N (position3), N (position4), E (position5) -> we don\'t want E at the end.\n\n   We can try: \n        DELVE -> D, E (position2), L, V, E (position5) -> avoid because E at the end.\n\n   How about: \n        MELEE -> has E at the end and multiple E\'s? and M, L. But again, E at the end.\n\n   We need to avoid E at position 5. So for position 3: \n        Example: BEGET -> E at position 2 and 4? and ends with T? Actually, BEGET: B, E, G, E, T -> E at 2 and 4, and T at 5. But we don\'t have E at 5? So that\'s okay? But we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n   However, we are only required to have E in the word, and we are trying to test other letters. We can use a word with E only once? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E only in one position (that is not 5) and avoid repeating.\n\n   Let me think of a word with E at position 3: \n        TENET -> has E at 2 and 4? and T repeated. Also, ends with T, not E. But TENET: T, E, N, E, T -> E at 2 and 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n   Another: \n        DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.\n\n   Another: \n        BERTH -> has R -> avoid.\n\n   Another: \n        JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4? and ends with L. But we have E at 2 and 4. And avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. We can use it? But we are trying to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n   However, we have limited tries. We might avoid repeating letters in the second guess to maximize information.\n\n   So, let\'s go back to the words without repeated letters and without E at the end.\n\n   Position 1: EPOCH (E, P, O, C, H) -> no repeat, and E at 1.\n   Position 2: BELOW (B, E, L, O, W) -> no repeat, E at 2.\n   Position 3: We can try: \n        MEDIC -> but has I -> avoid I.\n        PEDAL -> has A -> avoid A.\n        FECAL -> has A -> avoid A.\n\n   How about: \n        NEWLY -> N, E, W, L, Y -> E at position 2? Actually, NEWLY: N(position1), E(position2), W(position3), L(position4), Y(position5). So E at 2. But we already have BELOW for position 2.\n\n   Actually, we can choose any. Let me choose between EPOCH and BELOW.\n\n   Both are good. Let me pick BELOW because it has more common letters? Or EPOCH has less common letters? \n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes T, N, which are very common.\n\n   How about: \n        Position 3: \n          CENTO -> C, E, N, T, O -> E at position 2? CENTO: C(position1), E(position2), N(position3), T(position4), O(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.\n\n   We want E at position 3: \n          HONEY -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4? and ends with Y. So not at 3.\n\n          TEMPO -> T, E, M, P, O -> E at position 2.\n\n   It\'s hard to find a word with E at position 3 without the forbidden letters and without E at the end.\n\n   Let me try: \n          BLEEP -> has E at 3 and 4? and ends with P? B, L, E, E, P -> E at 3 and 4 -> repeated and we don\'t know.\n\n          CREPT -> has R -> avoid.\n\n          DEPTH -> D, E, P, T, H -> E at position 2.\n\n   How about: \n          LEECH -> has E at 1 and 2? and ends with H -> L, E, E, C, H -> E at 2 and 3? Actually, positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> E at 2 and 3 -> repeated.\n\n   Another: \n          FETCH -> F, E, T, C, H -> E at 2.\n\n   So, it seems difficult. Maybe we can try E at position 4? But we have to avoid position 5.\n\n   Position 4: \n        Example: OUNCE -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? position 5 -> avoid.\n\n        We must avoid E at position 5. So position 4 is allowed? But the word must have E at position 4 and not at 5? Then the last letter must not be E.\n\n        Example: \n          BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n          DANCE -> D, A, N, C, E -> has A and E at the end -> avoid.\n\n          CONE -> only 4 letters? 5-letter: \n          OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n          HORDE -> has R -> avoid.\n\n          LUNGE -> L, U, N, G, E -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n        It\'s hard to find a word with E at position 4 that doesn\'t end with E? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is something else.\n\n        Example: \n          OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> E at position 4, and ends with D. This is valid. And avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n        So OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> E at 4.\n\n   Now, we have three candidate words for the second guess:\n      Option 1: EPOCH (E at 1, and letters P,O,C,H)\n      Option 2: BELOW (E at 2, and letters B,E,L,O,W) -> note: E is repeated? No, BELOW has one E at position 2.\n      Option 3: OGLED (E at 4, and letters O,G,L,E,D) -> has E at 4 and also at? OGLED: O, G, L, E, D -> only one E at position 4.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use a word that has E only once? Yes.\n\n   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. \n\n   We have already eliminated R, A, I, S. We are about to test a set of new letters.\n\n   Option 1: EPOCH -> tests E, P, O, C, H -> 5 new letters (if we haven\'t tried any of these, which we haven\'t).\n   Option 2: BELOW -> tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters (E we already know is present, but we are testing its position).\n   Option 3: OGLED -> tests O, G, L, E, D -> 5 new letters.\n\n   But note: in BELOW, we are testing E at position 2. In EPOCH, we are testing E at position 1. In OGLED, we are testing E at position 4.\n\n   Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, testing E at a new position (1,2, or 4) is good.\n\n   How to choose? We can pick the one that uses the most common letters. \n\n   Common consonants: T, N, S (but S is eliminated), R (eliminated), so next are: L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\n   Option 1: EPOCH has P, C, H (and O is a vowel). \n   Option 2: BELOW has B, L, W (and O). \n   Option 3: OGLED has G, L, D (and O).\n\n   The letter L is common, so both BELOW and OGLED have L. But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes T and N, which are very common. None of these have T or N.\n\n   So, maybe we should form a word that includes T and N and E at a new position.\n\n   For example, with E at position 2: \n        TENTH -> has T and N, but also has T repeated and ends with H? And E at position 2? T, E, N, T, H -> E at 2. But we have T at 1 and 4? and H at 5. Also, we don\'t know about T and N.\n\n   But TENTH has repeated T? We can avoid repeats to test more letters.\n\n   How about: \n        BENTO -> B, E, N, T, O -> E at 2. Avoids R,A,I,S. And tests B, E, N, T, O.\n\n   This is a good candidate: BENTO.\n\n   Now, we have a fourth candidate: BENTO (E at 2, and letters B, E, N, T, O).\n\n   This tests the common letters: B, E, N, T, O.\n\n   We know E is present, so we are testing B, N, T, O.\n\n   This seems better because it includes T and N, which are very common.\n\n   So, I choose BENTO.\n\n   But wait: we must avoid the letters R, A, I, S. BENTO does not contain these.\n\n   Therefore, our second guess: BENTO.\n\n   We\'ll get feedback on each letter: \n        B: if in the word and at position 1? \n        E: if at position 2? (if it is, then we get a check; if not, then we get a minus or cross? but we know E is in the word, so it will be either check (if at position 2) or minus (if in the word but not at 2))\n        N: at position 3?\n        T: at position 4?\n        O: at position 5?\n\n   This will give us good information.\n\n   So, let\'s go with BENTO.\n\n<guess>BENTO</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\nKey deductions:\n1. The secret word **contains E**, but it must be in positions 1–4.\n2. The word **excludes R, A, I, S**.\n3. New guess should prioritize:\n   - Including E in a position other than 5 (testing positions 1–4).\n   - Introducing common untested letters (e.g., B, N, T, O).\n   - Avoiding forbidden letters (R, A, I, S).\n\nOptimal second guess: **BENTO**  \n- Tests E in position 2 (new position to check).\n- Introduces high-frequency consonants (B, N, T) and vowel (O).\n- Maximizes new letter coverage: B, N, T, O are all untested.\n- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.\n\n<guess>BENTO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BENTO -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nMeaning: \n  R, A, I, S are not in the word.\n  E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: BENTO -> B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)\nMeaning:\n  B, N, T, O are not in the word.\n  E is in the word but not at position 2 (since we placed E at position 2 and got a minus).\n\nSo, combining the feedback:\n\n- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at position 2 (from BENTO) and not at position 5 (from RAISE). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n- The following letters are not in the word: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.\n\nWe have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E, B, N, T, O.\n\nRemaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Contains the letter E (exactly one? we don\'t know, but at least one) at position 1, 3, or 4.\n  - Does not contain: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: L, C, D, M, P, U, G, H, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words with E in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\'s consider:\n\nOption 1: E at position 1.\n  Then the word starts with E. The remaining positions 2,3,4,5 must be filled with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the forbidden ones.\n\n  Example words:\n    ECHOS -> but has O and S -> forbidden.\n    EDGES -> has S -> forbidden.\n    EGGED -> has G and D, but also E at the end? and repeated G and E? We don\'t know about duplicates. But we are avoiding S, etc.\n\n  We need to avoid S, R, A, I, B, N, T, O.\n\n  Possible: \n    ECLAT -> has A -> forbidden.\n    EPOXY -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but O is forbidden.\n\n  Since O is forbidden, we avoid O.\n\n  How about:\n    EPHOR -> has O and R -> forbidden.\n\n  Another:\n    EMCEE -> has M, C, E, E -> but E is repeated. And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, positions: E at 1 and 4? and 5? EMCEE: E, M, C, E, E -> but we have E at 1,4,5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so this is invalid? Actually, we are not allowed to put E at 5 because we know it\'s not there. So EMCEE is invalid for position 5.\n\n  We must avoid E at position 5.\n\n  So, for position 1: \n    We need a word: E _ _ _ _ \n    Without the forbidden letters and without E at 5.\n\n    Example: \n      ELEGY -> E, L, E, G, Y -> has E at 1 and 3? and ends with Y. But we have E at 3? That\'s allowed. But we are testing E at 1. Also, we are testing L, G, Y. However, we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n    But note: we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. So we can try a word with two E\'s? But we want to test other letters.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try to use a word with E only at position 1 and no other E.\n\n    Example: \n      EPOCH -> but has O -> forbidden.\n      ECLIP -> not a word? \n      EDUCT -> E, D, U, C, T -> but T is forbidden (from BENTO feedback: T(x)).\n\n    T is forbidden? Yes, from BENTO: T(x). So we cannot use T.\n\n    Similarly, N, O, B are forbidden.\n\n    So, what about:\n      EDGED -> E, D, G, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D repeated. Avoid E at 5? It ends with D, so E is not at 5. But we have E at 1 and 4. We don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n    Another: \n      EGGER -> has G and E, but also R -> forbidden.\n\n    Another: \n      EKING -> E, K, I, N, G -> has I and N -> forbidden.\n\n    It\'s getting difficult. Maybe avoid position 1 for now.\n\nOption 2: E at position 3.\n  The word has the pattern: _ _ E _ _\n  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5.\n\n  Example words:\n    AGENT -> has A, N -> forbidden.\n    UPPER -> has R -> forbidden.\n    BEVEL -> has B -> forbidden.\n    LEVEL -> has L, E, V, E, L -> but BENTO said B is not in the word, but L is new. However, we have E at 3 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5. So LEVEL is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n    We need to avoid E at 5.\n\n    How about:\n      CEDED -> C, E, D, E, D -> E at 2 and 4? not at 3? We want E at 3.\n\n    We need E at position 3.\n\n    Example: \n      DEUCE -> D, E, U, C, E -> E at 2 and 5 -> avoid because E at 5.\n      JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not at 3.\n      PEDAL -> has A -> forbidden.\n\n    How about:\n      HELIX -> H, E, L, I, X -> has I -> forbidden.\n\n    Another:\n      FELON -> has O and N -> forbidden.\n\n    Another:\n      MELON -> same, has O and N.\n\n    Another:\n      WELCH -> W, E, L, C, H -> E at position 2? W(position1), E(position2), L(position3), C(position4), H(position5). So E is at 2, not 3.\n\n    We need E at position 3: \n        _ , _ , E , _ , _\n\n    Example: \n      CREPT -> has R -> forbidden.\n      GREET -> has R and E at 5 -> avoid.\n      SHEET -> has S and E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n    How about: \n      PLECK -> not a word.\n      FLECK -> F, L, E, C, K -> E at position 3? F(1), L(2), E(3), C(4), K(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. And E is at 3.\n\n    So FLECK is a candidate.\n\nOption 3: E at position 4.\n  Pattern: _ _ _ E _\n  Without forbidden letters and without E at 5 (which is already satisfied because E is at 4, and 5 is a different position).\n\n  Example words:\n    OUNCE -> has O and E at 5? O, U, N, C, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n    BULGE -> B, U, L, G, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n    OGLED -> O, G, L, E, D -> has O -> forbidden.\n\n    We need to avoid O, and E must not be at 5.\n\n    How about:\n      CYCLE -> C, Y, C, L, E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n      MAPLE -> has A -> forbidden.\n      APPLE -> has A and P, but A forbidden.\n\n    How about:\n      CABLE -> has A and B -> forbidden.\n      FABLE -> same.\n\n    How about:\n      EAGLE -> has A -> forbidden.\n\n    How about:\n      PIXEL -> has I and X -> I is forbidden.\n\n    How about:\n      JOULE -> has O and U -> O forbidden.\n\n    How about:\n      MULEY -> M, U, L, E, Y -> E at position 4? M(1), U(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). This avoids forbidden letters: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So MULEY is a candidate? But is it a word? MULEY is an adjective meaning having mules, or a breed of cattle. It might be accepted.\n\n    Another: \n      DUVET -> D, U, V, E, T -> has T -> forbidden.\n\n    Another:\n      HOMED -> has O -> forbidden.\n\n    Another:\n      WIFED -> not a word? WIFE is a word, but WIFED? Not common.\n\n    Another:\n      GULET -> has T -> forbidden.\n\n    Another:\n      CULET -> has T -> forbidden.\n\n    Another:\n      PUKED -> P, U, K, E, D -> E at position 4? P(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). Avoids forbidden letters? Let\'s check: no R,A,I,S,B,N,T,O. So PUKED is a candidate.\n\n    But PUKED is a valid word (past tense of puke).\n\nSo we have two candidates so far:\n  FLECK (E at position 3) and PUKED (E at position 4).\n\nWe can also consider other positions? But we have to have E at 1,3, or 4. We haven\'t found a good candidate for position 1.\n\nAnother candidate for position 1? \n  With the remaining letters, let\'s try: \n    ECHED -> E, C, H, E, D -> E at 1 and 4? and D at 5. Avoids forbidden? ECHED: E(1), C(2), H(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at 1 and 4. We don\'t know about duplicates. And it tests C, H, D. But we have two E\'s? We are testing E at 1 and 4, but we already know E is in the word. So it might be acceptable.\n\n  But is ECHED a word? It is the past tense of etch, but usually spelled ""etched"". ECHED might not be standard. Let\'s avoid.\n\n  How about: \n    EMMEW -> not a word.\n    EPHOD -> E, P, H, O, D -> has O -> forbidden.\n\n  How about: \n    EXCEL -> E, X, C, E, L -> E at 1 and 4? and L at 5. Avoids forbidden? X, C, L are allowed. But we have two E\'s? And we are testing E at 1 and 4. But we know E is in the word, so having two E\'s might be okay if the word has two, but we don\'t know. Also, we are testing X, C, L.\n\n  EXCEL is a valid word.\n\n  So now we have three candidates: FLECK, PUKED, EXCEL.\n\nBut note: in EXCEL, we have E at position 1 and 4. We are trying to determine the position of E. If we guess EXCEL and we get:\n  If the secret word has E at position 1, then we get a check for E at 1 and a minus for E at 4? But if the word has only one E, then the E at 4 might be marked as not present? But we know the word has at least one E. Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one E, then only the E in the correct position (if any) would be marked, and the other E would be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E\'s, then both might be marked appropriately.\n\nBut the rules: \n  - If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n  - If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position: -\n  - If the letter is not in the word: x\n\nBut if the word has only one E, and we have two E\'s in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) would be ✓, and the other would be x? Or if both are in the word but one is in the wrong position? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess, but the secret word might have fewer occurrences.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: \n  For example, if the secret word has one E, and we guess a word with two E\'s:\n      - If one of them is in the correct position, that one gets ✓, and the other gets x (because the secret has only one E).\n      - If neither is in the correct position, but the secret has one E, then one of the E\'s (the first one?) gets a minus, and the other gets x? Actually, the feedback is independent per position? \n\n  But the actual rule: \n      The feedback is given by:\n        First, mark all correct positions (green).\n        Then, for the remaining letters in the guess, mark those that are in the word but not in the correct position (yellow), but only as many as there are remaining in the secret.\n\n  So if the secret has one E, and we have two E\'s in the guess:\n      - If one is in the correct position, it gets green. The other E gets gray (x) because there are no more E\'s in the secret.\n      - If neither is in the correct position, then one of the E\'s (the first one in the guess? or any?) gets yellow, and the other gets gray.\n\n  But in our case, we don\'t know how many E\'s the secret word has.\n\nGiven the complexity, we might avoid words with repeated E\'s to reduce ambiguity.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid EXCEL for now because it has two E\'s.\n\nWe are left with FLECK and PUKED.\n\nFLECK: E at position 3, and letters F, L, C, K.\nPUKED: E at position 4, and letters P, U, K, E, D -> but note: E is at 4, and we are not repeating E? PUKED has one E.\n\nBoth are valid and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nWhich one to choose? We can choose the one that tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: L, C, D, P, U, etc.\n\nFLECK: F, L, E, C, K -> tests F, L, C, K (and E at 3).\nPUKED: P, U, K, E, D -> tests P, U, K, D (and E at 4).\n\nBoth test 4 new letters.\n\nBut note: we have already used E, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.\n\nCommon consonants: L, C, P, D, U (vowel).\n\nFLECK has L and C, which are more common than U and D? \n\nWe can also consider that we are testing E at a new position: either 3 or 4.\n\nWe know E is not at 2 or 5, so both 3 and 4 are possible.\n\nWe can choose FLECK because it has L and C, which are very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose PUKED to test U and D.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we choose FLECK and we get feedback, it might help us narrow down.\n\nWe\'ll go with FLECK.\n\nSo, third guess: FLECK.\n\nBut wait, let\'s confirm the word: FLECK is a valid English word (a small particle or a streak).\n\nTherefore, we guess FLECK.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **RAISE**: R, A, I, S are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-).  \n- **BENTO**: B, N, T, O are absent (x), E is present but misplaced (-) and **not at position 2**.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **E is in the word** but **not at positions 2 or 5**. It must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n2. **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O (cannot be used).\n3. **Untested letters**: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- **Include E** in position 1, 3, or 4 to test its correct location.\n- **Maximize new letter coverage** with common consonants (e.g., L, C, P, D) and vowels (e.g., U).\n- Avoid excluded letters and positions where E is invalid (positions 2 and 5).\n\nOptimal guess: **FLECK**  \n- Tests E in **position 3** (a new position to check).\n- Introduces high-frequency consonants: F, L, C, K (all untested).\n- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to all constraints.\n\n<guess>FLECK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BENTO -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: FLECK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) E(✓) C(-) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
  Meaning: E is in the secret word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: BENTO -> Feedback: B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)
  Meaning: E is in the secret word but not at position 2.

Guess 3: FLECK -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) E(✓) C(-) K(✓)
  Meaning:
    F is not in the word (x).
    L is not in the word (x).
    E is in the word and at position 3 (since we placed E at position 3 and got ✓).
    C is in the word but not at position 4 (since we placed C at position 4 and got -).
    K is in the word and at position 5 (✓).

So, from guess 3:
  - E is at position 3 (confirmed with ✓).
  - K is at position 5 (confirmed with ✓).
  - C is present in the word but not at position 4 (since we had it at position 4 and got -).
  - F and L are absent (so the word does not contain F or L).

Additionally, from previous guesses:
  - The secret word contains E (and we now know it is at position 3) and also contains C and K.
  - We know from guess 1 that E is present (and now confirmed at position 3) and that R, A, I, S are absent.
  - From guess 2: B, N, T, O are absent, and E is confirmed at position 3 (so the earlier minus was because we had it at position 2, which was wrong).

Thus, we have:
  Correct positions:
    Position 3: E
    Position 5: K

  Present but wrong position: 
    C (somewhere, but not at position 4)

  Absent letters (from all guesses): R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O, F, L

The secret word pattern is: _ _ E _ K

And the word must contain C (but not at position 4).

Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess), B, N, T, O, F, L, C, K (from subsequent guesses).

Remaining letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (We'll also note that C is present but in a different position.)

Now, the word must have the letter C somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 we know C isn't there. So C must be at position 1 or 2.

Pattern: 
  Position 1: either C or one of the other remaining letters.
  Position 2: the other (or C if not at 1).
  Position 3: E
  Position 4: a letter that is not C (since C is not at position 4), but must be a letter that isn't absent. This letter must also be from the remaining set. Moreover, we don't know if the word has other letters besides E, C, K. Since C is at one of positions 1 or 2, position 4 must be a new letter that hasn't been tested? Or it could be one we don't know.

We know the word has at least the letters: E, C, K. And at positions 3 and 5: E and K. Position 1, 2, and 4 need to be filled.

Position 4 can be any letter except the absent ones and except C? But C is already at position 1 or 2. So position 4 must be a letter from the remaining set.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

So the pattern is: [C or other]_ [C or other_] E [not C, and must be a letter not absent] K

Specifically, since the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3 (E, C, K), but C and K are at specific positions only for part.

We have two possibilities for C:
  Option A: C at position 1 -> then the word is C _ E _ K
  Option B: C at position 2 -> then the word is _ C E _ K

We must fill the blanks with letters from the remaining, and ensure the word has C (already included) and no other constraints?

But note: the word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but since we haven't seen any duplicates, we assume we can avoid them for now.

List of absent letters: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O, F, L.

Remaining letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form words that fit one of the patterns and include C either at 1 or 2.

First, let's try words with C at position 1: C _ E _ K

The second letter must be one of the remaining, and the fourth letter must be one of the remaining (and not C).

Possible English words:
  CHINK -> but H and I? I is absent (from guess 1: I(x)), so invalid.
  CHECK -> C, H, E, C, K? CHECK has C at 1 and 4? But we are considering C at 1, so position 4 would be C? Then we would have two C's? Also, the word CHECK: C(1), H(2), E(3), C(4), K(5) -> but we know from feedback that C is not at position 4 (from FLECK: C(-) meaning that if there is a C at position 4 in the secret, we would have gotten a ✓? Or if there is only one C, then we got - for C at position 4 because the C is at a different position). But if we try to put C at position 4, we know it's wrong because we have a minus for C at position 4. So the word cannot have C at position 4. Therefore, CHECK is invalid because it requires a C at position 4? Actually no: if the secret word were CHECK, then in our guess:
      E is at 3: ✓
      K is at 5: ✓
      But C in our guess FLECK was at position 4, and in the secret CHECK, position 4 is C, so we would have gotten a ✓ for C, not a minus. But we got minus for C. So CHECK is not the word.

  Alternatively, we need a word with C at 1 and not at 4.

  Possible words: 
    CREEK -> C, R, E, E, K -> but R is absent -> invalid.
    CHEEK -> C, H, E, E, K -> has E repeated? And H. But R and A etc. are absent? Check: R absent? Yes. But E at position 3: correct. However, position 1: C, position 2: H, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: K. Then if we had guessed FLECK, we had C at position 4? In the secret, position 4 is E, so we would have gotten a minus for C? Because C is in the word (at position 1) but not at position 4? So in FLECK:
        F: not in word -> x
        L: not in word -> x
        E: at position 3: ✓
        C: in the word but not at position 4? -> minus -> which matches. Also, K: ✓. So CHEEK is a candidate? But the word CHEEK has E at position 4? Then at position 4, we have E? But E is already known to be at position 3? So the word would have two E's: one at 3 and one at 4.

    Let's check the feedback: we know E is at position 3 (we have a ✓). If CHEEK is the word, then E is at position 3 and at position 4? That means we have two E's.

    How about: 
        CHALK -> C, H, A, L, K -> but A is absent (guess1: A(x)), and L is absent (guess3: L(x)).

    Another: 
        CAMEK? not a word.
        CUTEK? not a word.

    How about: 
        CROOK -> has O and R -> absent.

    We can try words with no vowels besides E? The second position needs a vowel? We have H, M, P, etc.

    How about: 
        CHIMK? not a word.
        CHECK is not valid because we don't have a C at 4? Actually, CHECK is C,H,E,C,K -> but we know C is not at position 4? So we cannot have C at position 4. Therefore, CHECK is invalid because it has two C's? And one of them is at position 4? Or if the secret word has two C's, then our guess FLECK had one C at position 4? How would it be marked?:

        In FLECK: positions: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.
        Secret CHECK: C1, H2, E3, C4, K5.
        Then at position 1: F vs C -> F not in word -> x.
        Position 2: L vs H -> L not in word -> x.
        Position 3: E vs E -> ✓.
        Position 4: C vs C -> so it matches -> should be ✓? But we got minus (-) for C, meaning present but wrong position? That doesn't match because if it's in the correct position, it should be ✓.

        But we got: for C: minus. That means in FLECK, for C at position 4, we didn't get a ✓, so position 4 is not C. But in CHECK, position 4 is C, which would have given a ✓. Therefore, CHECK is not the word.

    Therefore, we cannot have C at position 4.

    So for candidate CHEEK: 
        Secret: C1, H2, E3, E4, K5.
        Guess FLECK: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.
        Feedback: 
            F1 x
            L2 x
            E3 ✓
            C4 -> Is C in the secret? At position 1? Then it is in the secret but not at position 4, so yellow minus? So that matches. 
            K5 ✓

        So CHEEK is still a candidate? But we have E at position 4, and we already know E at position 3. We need to check if E can be repeated? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

    How about CHEEK? It is a valid word.

    Also, other candidate: 
        CHEWK? Not a word.

    Another: 
        CEPEK? Not a word.

    Another: 
        CEDED? Has D and E repeated? But E at position 3 is set? And C at 1? C1, E2, D3? But position 3 must be E? So cannot.

    Another: 
        COREK? Not a word.

    But wait: our known pattern: position 3 is E, position 5 is K. So only positions 1,2,4 to fill.

    CHEEK: C1, H2, E3, E4, K5 -> pattern matches.

    But H? We haven't tested H. And from absent letters: H is not in the absent list? It's possible.

Now, let's consider Option B: C at position 2 -> pattern: _ C E _ K

Possible words:
  ACKEE? A is absent.
  DECK is only 4 letters.
  5-letter words: 
      DECK: 4 letters. 
      ECK? not.

  Possible: 
      SCREK? not a word.
      MCGEE? M, C, G, E, E -> but position 3 is E? So MCGEE: M(position1), C(position2), G(position3) -> but position 3 should be E? So no.

  We need: _ C E _ K

  So: 
      Position 1: one letter, position 2: C, position 3: E, position 4: one letter, position 5: K.

  Examples:
      DICEK? not a word.
      PICKED -> P, I, C, K, E, D? 6 letters.

  How about: 
      HACKED -> H, A, C, K, E, D? 6 letters.

  Another: 
      CHECKED -> too long.

  5-letter options:
      ACKED? not a word.
      ECKED? not.

      ICKER? I is absent.

  Another: 
      OCHER? has O and R? absent.

  How about: 
      UCHER? Uncommon.
      UCHES? has S -> absent.

  How about: 
      YECCH? Y, E, C, C, H -> but that has E at position 2? We need position 3 set to E? So word: letter1 at pos1, C at pos2, E at pos3, then whatever at pos4, K at pos5.

  Possible words:
      DECK? --> but only 4 letters? We need 5.

      5-letter with pattern: ?C E ? K

      DECOK? not a word.
      DECRY? D, E, C, R, Y -> E at position 2? but we need E at position 3? And R is absent.

  Another: 
      DICEY? D, I, C, E, Y -> but I is absent, and the pattern: positions: D1, I2, C3, E4, Y5 -> but we need position 3 to be E? So doesn't have E at 3.

  Actually, we must have E at position 3? So it's fixed.

  How about: 
      MECUM? M, E, C, U, M -> E at position 2? doesn't fit.

      PECAN? P, E, C, A, N -> E at position 2? and A and N absent.

  We need: [letter1] C E [letter4] K

  Possible: 
      ACEDK? not.
      DECK is 4 letters.

  How about: 
      YECCK? not a word.

  Another idea: 
      CHUSEK? too long.

  English words that fit: 
      DUCKY: D, U, C, K, Y -> but pattern: D1, U2, C3, K4, Y5 -> then position 3 is C? But we need position 3 to be E? That doesn't fit.

      There are words like ""CHECK"", ""CHOCK"", but they don't have E? 

  Actually, we need position 3 to be E.

  Looking for valid words: 
      The pattern: ?C E ? K

      D words: 
          DICEK: not a word.
      M words: 
          MICEK: not.

      P words: 
          PECAK? not.

      U words: 
          UCE K? not.

      Y words: 
          YCE K? not.

  It seems very few common words. 

  How about: 
      CHERK? not a word.

  After research, I recall: 
      RECK? but no E at position 3? 
      We need: _ C E _ K

  Example: 
      ICED K? not.
      A word: ""COMET"" doesn't have K.

  How about: 
      CUMEC? not.

  Maybe there are no common words with pattern _C E _ K?

So, perhaps Option A (C at 1) is more likely.

For C at 1: 
  Pattern: C _ E _ K

  We considered CHEEK: C1, H2, E3, E4, K5. Valid.

  Other options? 
      CREWK? has R -> absent.
      CHECK: but we have C twice? And position 4 must not be C? So invalid because that would require C at 4? But we cannot have C at 4.

  How about: 
      CHEWK? Not a valid word? 
      CHEVY? Not ending with K.

  How about: 
      CHESK? Not a word.
      CHUCK? C, H, U, C, K -> C at 1 and 4? But we cannot have C at 4 -> conflicts with feedback.

  How about: 
      CWEK? not.

  Another candidate: 
      CHEEK remains a strong candidate.

  But are there others? 
      For example: CREDK? Not a word.

      With other letters: 
        C H E M K -> CHEM K? Not a word.
        C D E V K -> not a word.
        C G E M K -> CGEMK? not.

  Another possibility: 
      CEDEK? Not a word.

      CHETK? Not.

  However, CHEEK is valid.

But let's consider: CHEEK has two E's. Is that a problem? Not necessarily.

We have already guessed FLECK, which had one C? But CHEEK doesn't have C? 

CHEEK: C, H, E, E, K. So there is a C at position 1?

In our FLECK guess: we had C at position 4? In the secret CHEEK: 
  Position 1: C -> present? So we would have gotten a minus for C in FLECK at position 4? But the secret has no C at position 4? Position 4 is E. And indeed, the C in FLECK (at position 4) is not present at that position? Because the secret has E at position 4? But the secret has a C at position 1? So yes, the C is in the word but not at position 4? So minus is correct? Also, the secret has E at position 3? We have E at position 3? So ✓. And K at position 5? ✓.

Therefore, CHEEK matches the feedback.

But is there another word? What about CHEVK? Not a word.

Or CHAMK? Not and A absent.

So CHEEK seems to be a candidate.

But note: we haven't tested H? And H is not in the absent list. It might be.

However, consider if the word is CHEEK? Then we have letters: C, H, E, E, K.

But from our previous guesses: we have not guessed H? So it is possible.

But are there other words? 

What if we try to avoid duplicate E's? We assumed CHEEK but perhaps there are other words.

Another candidate for C at position 1: 
  C H E _ K

But the only valid word I can think of with E at position 3 and K at position 5? And position 4 not being C? And without absent letters? CHEEK seems the only common one.

But let's try: 
  CUE K? But we need 5 letters: C, U, E, ?, K? Pattern: C1, U2, E3, ?4, K5.

For example, CUBEK? Not a word.

CUSK: C, U, S, K -> but only 4 letters? And S is absent.

CUNK? Not.

But again, ?4 must be filled.

CHEEK is so far the only candidate.

But wait, what about: CHEKK? Not a word.

Or, CHEEK is the only one.

Therefore, we should guess CHEEK? But note: CHEEK has E at position 4? Which we don't know? But it might be.

But let's see the pattern: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:E, 5:K.

Now, we also have C at position 1? In our guess FLECK: we didn't guess H, so we have no information on H. Also, we didn't test the second E.

But since CHEEK fits the feedback, we can guess CHEEK.

Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? We have 3 tries left, but we might just guess CHEEK.

But let's consider: are there other possibilities?

What if the word has C at position 2? We thought there is no common word? But perhaps we missed one.

For pattern: _ C E _ K

Words: 
  ECK: not 5 letters.

  5-letter: 
    DUCKS -> D, U, C, K, S -> S absent? And pattern: D1, U2, C3? But we need E at position 3? Not matching.

    ICERS -> I absent.

    MCKEE: M, C, K, E, E -> pattern: M1, C2, K3? But we need E at position 3? This has position 3: K, but we need K at position 5? So invalid.

  How about: 
      DECK is too short.

      ACEOK: A absent.

  Another: 
      PCE or something.

  It seems we cannot find a word.

Therefore, the most plausible is CHEECK? CHEEKK? No, CHEEK.

So we guess CHEEK.

But let's confirm the word: CHEEK is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, fourth guess: CHEEK.

But note: we are not 100% sure, but it fits all feedback.

Perhaps there is a word with C at position 1 and another letter? Let's think:

  C H E _ K -> we have to fill the 4th position. CHEEK has E at 4? That's one choice.

  What else? 
      CHEDK? not.
      CHEM K? not.

  So, CHEEK is the only common word.

Therefore, we go with CHEEK.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all three guesses:

- **RAISE (1st guess)**: E is present but not at position 5.
- **BENTO (2nd guess)**: E is present but not at position 2.
- **FLECK (3rd guess)**:  
  - E is at position 3 (✓).  
  - K is at position 5 (✓).  
  - C is present but not at position 4 (-).  
  - F and L are absent (x).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**: Position 3 = **E**, Position 5 = **K**.  
2. **Confirmed present**: **C** must be in positions 1 or 2 (since it's not at 4).  
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O, F, L.  
4. **Secret word pattern**: `[C or new letter] [C or new letter] E [new letter] K`.  
5. **C must be at position 1 or 2**: So the valid patterns are **C ? E ? K** or **? C E ? K**.

### Analysis:
- From pattern constraints and excluded letters, **CHEEK** (`C _ E _ K`) is a strong candidate:  
  - Fits `C H E E K` (positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=K).  
  - **C at position 1**: Matches the requirement that C is present but not at 4.  
  - **E at position 4**: Consistent with previous feedback (not at position 2 or 5, and position 3 is confirmed).  
  - Uses **H** and a second **E** (both untested and valid given constraints).  

### Validation against Feedback:
- **FLECK vs. CHEEK**:
  - F: Absent → **x** (matches feedback).  
  - L: Absent → **x** (matches feedback).  
  - E: Correct position 3 → **✓** (matches feedback).  
  - C: Present at position 1, not position 4 → **-** (matches feedback).  
  - K: Correct position 5 → **✓** (matches feedback).

**Conclusion**: **CHEEK** fits all constraints and feedback, making it the most probable next guess.  

<guess>CHEEK</guess>",CHEEK,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
  Meaning: E is in the secret word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: BENTO -> Feedback: B(x) E(-) N(x) T(x) O(x)
  Meaning: E is in the secret word but not at position 2.

Guess 3: FLECK -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) E(✓) C(-) K(✓)
  Meaning:
    F is not in the word (x).
    L is not in the word (x).
    E is in the word and at position 3 (since we placed E at position 3 and got ✓).
    C is in the word but not at position 4 (since we placed C at position 4 and got -).
    K is in the word and at position 5 (✓).

So, from guess 3:
  - E is at position 3 (confirmed with ✓).
  - K is at position 5 (confirmed with ✓).
  - C is present in the word but not at position 4 (since we had it at position 4 and got -).
  - F and L are absent (so the word does not contain F or L).

Additionally, from previous guesses:
  - The secret word contains E (and we now know it is at position 3) and also contains C and K.
  - We know from guess 1 that E is present (and now confirmed at position 3) and that R, A, I, S are absent.
  - From guess 2: B, N, T, O are absent, and E is confirmed at position 3 (so the earlier minus was because we had it at position 2, which was wrong).

Thus, we have:
  Correct positions:
    Position 3: E
    Position 5: K

  Present but wrong position: 
    C (somewhere, but not at position 4)

  Absent letters (from all guesses): R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O, F, L

The secret word pattern is: _ _ E _ K

And the word must contain C (but not at position 4).

Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess), B, N, T, O, F, L, C, K (from subsequent guesses).

Remaining letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (We'll also note that C is present but in a different position.)

Now, the word must have the letter C somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 we know C isn't there. So C must be at position 1 or 2.

Pattern: 
  Position 1: either C or one of the other remaining letters.
  Position 2: the other (or C if not at 1).
  Position 3: E
  Position 4: a letter that is not C (since C is not at position 4), but must be a letter that isn't absent. This letter must also be from the remaining set. Moreover, we don't know if the word has other letters besides E, C, K. Since C is at one of positions 1 or 2, position 4 must be a new letter that hasn't been tested? Or it could be one we don't know.

We know the word has at least the letters: E, C, K. And at positions 3 and 5: E and K. Position 1, 2, and 4 need to be filled.

Position 4 can be any letter except the absent ones and except C? But C is already at position 1 or 2. So position 4 must be a letter from the remaining set.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

So the pattern is: [C or other]_ [C or other_] E [not C, and must be a letter not absent] K

Specifically, since the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3 (E, C, K), but C and K are at specific positions only for part.

We have two possibilities for C:
  Option A: C at position 1 -> then the word is C _ E _ K
  Option B: C at position 2 -> then the word is _ C E _ K

We must fill the blanks with letters from the remaining, and ensure the word has C (already included) and no other constraints?

But note: the word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but since we haven't seen any duplicates, we assume we can avoid them for now.

List of absent letters: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O, F, L.

Remaining letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form words that fit one of the patterns and include C either at 1 or 2.

First, let's try words with C at position 1: C _ E _ K

The second letter must be one of the remaining, and the fourth letter must be one of the remaining (and not C).

Possible English words:
  CHINK -> but H and I? I is absent (from guess 1: I(x)), so invalid.
  CHECK -> C, H, E, C, K? CHECK has C at 1 and 4? But we are considering C at 1, so position 4 would be C? Then we would have two C's? Also, the word CHECK: C(1), H(2), E(3), C(4), K(5) -> but we know from feedback that C is not at position 4 (from FLECK: C(-) meaning that if there is a C at position 4 in the secret, we would have gotten a ✓? Or if there is only one C, then we got - for C at position 4 because the C is at a different position). But if we try to put C at position 4, we know it's wrong because we have a minus for C at position 4. So the word cannot have C at position 4. Therefore, CHECK is invalid because it requires a C at position 4? Actually no: if the secret word were CHECK, then in our guess:
      E is at 3: ✓
      K is at 5: ✓
      But C in our guess FLECK was at position 4, and in the secret CHECK, position 4 is C, so we would have gotten a ✓ for C, not a minus. But we got minus for C. So CHECK is not the word.

  Alternatively, we need a word with C at 1 and not at 4.

  Possible words: 
    CREEK -> C, R, E, E, K -> but R is absent -> invalid.
    CHEEK -> C, H, E, E, K -> has E repeated? And H. But R and A etc. are absent? Check: R absent? Yes. But E at position 3: correct. However, position 1: C, position 2: H, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: K. Then if we had guessed FLECK, we had C at position 4? In the secret, position 4 is E, so we would have gotten a minus for C? Because C is in the word (at position 1) but not at position 4? So in FLECK:
        F: not in word -> x
        L: not in word -> x
        E: at position 3: ✓
        C: in the word but not at position 4? -> minus -> which matches. Also, K: ✓. So CHEEK is a candidate? But the word CHEEK has E at position 4? Then at position 4, we have E? But E is already known to be at position 3? So the word would have two E's: one at 3 and one at 4.

    Let's check the feedback: we know E is at position 3 (we have a ✓). If CHEEK is the word, then E is at position 3 and at position 4? That means we have two E's.

    How about: 
        CHALK -> C, H, A, L, K -> but A is absent (guess1: A(x)), and L is absent (guess3: L(x)).

    Another: 
        CAMEK? not a word.
        CUTEK? not a word.

    How about: 
        CROOK -> has O and R -> absent.

    We can try words with no vowels besides E? The second position needs a vowel? We have H, M, P, etc.

    How about: 
        CHIMK? not a word.
        CHECK is not valid because we don't have a C at 4? Actually, CHECK is C,H,E,C,K -> but we know C is not at position 4? So we cannot have C at position 4. Therefore, CHECK is invalid because it has two C's? And one of them is at position 4? Or if the secret word has two C's, then our guess FLECK had one C at position 4? How would it be marked?:

        In FLECK: positions: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.
        Secret CHECK: C1, H2, E3, C4, K5.
        Then at position 1: F vs C -> F not in word -> x.
        Position 2: L vs H -> L not in word -> x.
        Position 3: E vs E -> ✓.
        Position 4: C vs C -> so it matches -> should be ✓? But we got minus (-) for C, meaning present but wrong position? That doesn't match because if it's in the correct position, it should be ✓.

        But we got: for C: minus. That means in FLECK, for C at position 4, we didn't get a ✓, so position 4 is not C. But in CHECK, position 4 is C, which would have given a ✓. Therefore, CHECK is not the word.

    Therefore, we cannot have C at position 4.

    So for candidate CHEEK: 
        Secret: C1, H2, E3, E4, K5.
        Guess FLECK: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.
        Feedback: 
            F1 x
            L2 x
            E3 ✓
            C4 -> Is C in the secret? At position 1? Then it is in the secret but not at position 4, so yellow minus? So that matches. 
            K5 ✓

        So CHEEK is still a candidate? But we have E at position 4, and we already know E at position 3. We need to check if E can be repeated? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

    How about CHEEK? It is a valid word.

    Also, other candidate: 
        CHEWK? Not a word.

    Another: 
        CEPEK? Not a word.

    Another: 
        CEDED? Has D and E repeated? But E at position 3 is set? And C at 1? C1, E2, D3? But position 3 must be E? So cannot.

    Another: 
        COREK? Not a word.

    But wait: our known pattern: position 3 is E, position 5 is K. So only positions 1,2,4 to fill.

    CHEEK: C1, H2, E3, E4, K5 -> pattern matches.

    But H? We haven't tested H. And from absent letters: H is not in the absent list? It's possible.

Now, let's consider Option B: C at position 2 -> pattern: _ C E _ K

Possible words:
  ACKEE? A is absent.
  DECK is only 4 letters.
  5-letter words: 
      DECK: 4 letters. 
      ECK? not.

  Possible: 
      SCREK? not a word.
      MCGEE? M, C, G, E, E -> but position 3 is E? So MCGEE: M(position1), C(position2), G(position3) -> but position 3 should be E? So no.

  We need: _ C E _ K

  So: 
      Position 1: one letter, position 2: C, position 3: E, position 4: one letter, position 5: K.

  Examples:
      DICEK? not a word.
      PICKED -> P, I, C, K, E, D? 6 letters.

  How about: 
      HACKED -> H, A, C, K, E, D? 6 letters.

  Another: 
      CHECKED -> too long.

  5-letter options:
      ACKED? not a word.
      ECKED? not.

      ICKER? I is absent.

  Another: 
      OCHER? has O and R? absent.

  How about: 
      UCHER? Uncommon.
      UCHES? has S -> absent.

  How about: 
      YECCH? Y, E, C, C, H -> but that has E at position 2? We need position 3 set to E? So word: letter1 at pos1, C at pos2, E at pos3, then whatever at pos4, K at pos5.

  Possible words:
      DECK? --> but only 4 letters? We need 5.

      5-letter with pattern: ?C E ? K

      DECOK? not a word.
      DECRY? D, E, C, R, Y -> E at position 2? but we need E at position 3? And R is absent.

  Another: 
      DICEY? D, I, C, E, Y -> but I is absent, and the pattern: positions: D1, I2, C3, E4, Y5 -> but we need position 3 to be E? So doesn't have E at 3.

  Actually, we must have E at position 3? So it's fixed.

  How about: 
      MECUM? M, E, C, U, M -> E at position 2? doesn't fit.

      PECAN? P, E, C, A, N -> E at position 2? and A and N absent.

  We need: [letter1] C E [letter4] K

  Possible: 
      ACEDK? not.
      DECK is 4 letters.

  How about: 
      YECCK? not a word.

  Another idea: 
      CHUSEK? too long.

  English words that fit: 
      DUCKY: D, U, C, K, Y -> but pattern: D1, U2, C3, K4, Y5 -> then position 3 is C? But we need position 3 to be E? That doesn't fit.

      There are words like ""CHECK"", ""CHOCK"", but they don't have E? 

  Actually, we need position 3 to be E.

  Looking for valid words: 
      The pattern: ?C E ? K

      D words: 
          DICEK: not a word.
      M words: 
          MICEK: not.

      P words: 
          PECAK? not.

      U words: 
          UCE K? not.

      Y words: 
          YCE K? not.

  It seems very few common words. 

  How about: 
      CHERK? not a word.

  After research, I recall: 
      RECK? but no E at position 3? 
      We need: _ C E _ K

  Example: 
      ICED K? not.
      A word: ""COMET"" doesn't have K.

  How about: 
      CUMEC? not.

  Maybe there are no common words with pattern _C E _ K?

So, perhaps Option A (C at 1) is more likely.

For C at 1: 
  Pattern: C _ E _ K

  We considered CHEEK: C1, H2, E3, E4, K5. Valid.

  Other options? 
      CREWK? has R -> absent.
      CHECK: but we have C twice? And position 4 must not be C? So invalid because that would require C at 4? But we cannot have C at 4.

  How about: 
      CHEWK? Not a valid word? 
      CHEVY? Not ending with K.

  How about: 
      CHESK? Not a word.
      CHUCK? C, H, U, C, K -> C at 1 and 4? But we cannot have C at 4 -> conflicts with feedback.

  How about: 
      CWEK? not.

  Another candidate: 
      CHEEK remains a strong candidate.

  But are there others? 
      For example: CREDK? Not a word.

      With other letters: 
        C H E M K -> CHEM K? Not a word.
        C D E V K -> not a word.
        C G E M K -> CGEMK? not.

  Another possibility: 
      CEDEK? Not a word.

      CHETK? Not.

  However, CHEEK is valid.

But let's consider: CHEEK has two E's. Is that a problem? Not necessarily.

We have already guessed FLECK, which had one C? But CHEEK doesn't have C? 

CHEEK: C, H, E, E, K. So there is a C at position 1?

In our FLECK guess: we had C at position 4? In the secret CHEEK: 
  Position 1: C -> present? So we would have gotten a minus for C in FLECK at position 4? But the secret has no C at position 4? Position 4 is E. And indeed, the C in FLECK (at position 4) is not present at that position? Because the secret has E at position 4? But the secret has a C at position 1? So yes, the C is in the word but not at position 4? So minus is correct? Also, the secret has E at position 3? We have E at position 3? So ✓. And K at position 5? ✓.

Therefore, CHEEK matches the feedback.

But is there another word? What about CHEVK? Not a word.

Or CHAMK? Not and A absent.

So CHEEK seems to be a candidate.

But note: we haven't tested H? And H is not in the absent list. It might be.

However, consider if the word is CHEEK? Then we have letters: C, H, E, E, K.

But from our previous guesses: we have not guessed H? So it is possible.

But are there other words? 

What if we try to avoid duplicate E's? We assumed CHEEK but perhaps there are other words.

Another candidate for C at position 1: 
  C H E _ K

But the only valid word I can think of with E at position 3 and K at position 5? And position 4 not being C? And without absent letters? CHEEK seems the only common one.

But let's try: 
  CUE K? But we need 5 letters: C, U, E, ?, K? Pattern: C1, U2, E3, ?4, K5.

For example, CUBEK? Not a word.

CUSK: C, U, S, K -> but only 4 letters? And S is absent.

CUNK? Not.

But again, ?4 must be filled.

CHEEK is so far the only candidate.

But wait, what about: CHEKK? Not a word.

Or, CHEEK is the only one.

Therefore, we should guess CHEEK? But note: CHEEK has E at position 4? Which we don't know? But it might be.

But let's see the pattern: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:E, 5:K.

Now, we also have C at position 1? In our guess FLECK: we didn't guess H, so we have no information on H. Also, we didn't test the second E.

But since CHEEK fits the feedback, we can guess CHEEK.

Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? We have 3 tries left, but we might just guess CHEEK.

But let's consider: are there other possibilities?

What if the word has C at position 2? We thought there is no common word? But perhaps we missed one.

For pattern: _ C E _ K

Words: 
  ECK: not 5 letters.

  5-letter: 
    DUCKS -> D, U, C, K, S -> S absent? And pattern: D1, U2, C3? But we need E at position 3? Not matching.

    ICERS -> I absent.

    MCKEE: M, C, K, E, E -> pattern: M1, C2, K3? But we need E at position 3? This has position 3: K, but we need K at position 5? So invalid.

  How about: 
      DECK is too short.

      ACEOK: A absent.

  Another: 
      PCE or something.

  It seems we cannot find a word.

Therefore, the most plausible is CHEECK? CHEEKK? No, CHEEK.

So we guess CHEEK.

But let's confirm the word: CHEEK is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, fourth guess: CHEEK.

But note: we are not 100% sure, but it fits all feedback.

Perhaps there is a word with C at position 1 and another letter? Let's think:

  C H E _ K -> we have to fill the 4th position. CHEEK has E at 4? That's one choice.

  What else? 
      CHEDK? not.
      CHEM K? not.

  So, CHEEK is the only common word.

Therefore, we go with CHEEK.Based on the feedback from all three guesses:

- **RAISE (1st guess)**: E is present but not at position 5.
- **BENTO (2nd guess)**: E is present but not at position 2.
- **FLECK (3rd guess)**:  
  - E is at position 3 (✓).  
  - K is at position 5 (✓).  
  - C is present but not at position 4 (-).  
  - F and L are absent (x).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**: Position 3 = **E**, Position 5 = **K**.  
2. **Confirmed present**: **C** must be in positions 1 or 2 (since it's not at 4).  
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, B, N, T, O, F, L.  
4. **Secret word pattern**: `[C or new letter] [C or new letter] E [new letter] K`.  
5. **C must be at position 1 or 2**: So the valid patterns are **C ? E ? K** or **? C E ? K**.

### Analysis:
- From pattern constraints and excluded letters, **CHEEK** (`C _ E _ K`) is a strong candidate:  
  - Fits `C H E E K` (positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=K).  
  - **C at position 1**: Matches the requirement that C is present but not at 4.  
  - **E at position 4**: Consistent with previous feedback (not at position 2 or 5, and position 3 is confirmed).  
  - Uses **H** and a second **E** (both untested and valid given constraints).  

### Validation against Feedback:
- **FLECK vs. CHEEK**:
  - F: Absent → **x** (matches feedback).  
  - L: Absent → **x** (matches feedback).  
  - E: Correct position 3 → **✓** (matches feedback).  
  - C: Present at position 1, not position 4 → **-** (matches feedback).  
  - K: Correct position 5 → **✓** (matches feedback).

**Conclusion**: **CHEEK** fits all constraints and feedback, making it the most probable next guess.",Guess 4: CHEEK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) E(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
