We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) - C is not in the word.
R(x) - R is not in the word.
A(✓) - A is in the correct position (position 3? because in 'crane', A is the 3rd letter? Let's remember: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E). So A is confirmed at position 3.
N(x) - N is not in the word.
E(✓) - E is in the correct position. In 'crane', E is the 5th letter, so E is at position 5.

Therefore, we know:
- The word has A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- The word does not contain C, R, or N.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 2, and 4.

We must form a valid 5-letter word that satisfies:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- Letters to avoid: C, R, N (and also we know from the feedback that the word does not contain them).

We also note that the word likely contains other letters. We want to guess a word that maximizes information, so it should include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Common consonants (excluding C, R, N) include: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels: We already have A and E, but there might be another vowel? The word structure: _ _ A _ E

Possible words of the form: ? ? A ? E

Let me brainstorm some words:
- space: S P A C E -> but we know C is not in the word, so invalid for guess? But wait, we can't use C because it's eliminated. So we cannot use letters that are eliminated unless we have to. Actually, we must not use eliminated letters because they are confirmed not in the word. So we avoid C, R, N.

So valid letters for positions 1, 2, 4 should be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, N.

Let me try to think of words ending with 'A' in the third and 'E' at the end? Actually, the pattern is: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, E.

Some common words:
- plate: P L A T E
- slate: S L A T E -> but S, L, T are new letters.
- state: S T A T E -> has two T's? but okay.

We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Also note: in our feedback, we have two correct letters: A and E in the right positions, so the word might have more of the letters we already know? But we don't have any others confirmed.

We also have eliminated C, R, N.

So for the next guess, let's try:
- Use a word that has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
- Avoid C, R, N
- Include new common letters: perhaps S, T, L, etc.

One good candidate is ""SLATE"":
S L A T E
- Positions: S at 1, L at 2, A at 3 (locked), T at 4, E at 5 (locked).

This tests S, L, T in the new positions. If any of them are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Another candidate: ""PLATE"" (P L A T E) tests P, L, T.

But ""SLATE"" is very common.

Alternatively, ""SHADE"" (S H A D E) tests S, H, D.

Since we are early in the game, any of these could work. Let's choose ""SLATE"".

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""SLATE"" has all distinct.

Another thing: we don't know if the word has the letters we are about to test, so we are trying to cover a lot.

Wait, what about ""STAGE""? S T A G E -> but that's also a possibility.

But ""SLATE"" is a solid choice.

Alternatively, to cover more vowels? But we already have two vowels, and consonants are more varied. We can avoid vowels for now because we have A and E.

So let's go with ""SLATE"".

Therefore, our next guess is ""slate"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A(✓) is confirmed at position 3 (third letter).
- E(✓) is confirmed at position 5 (fifth letter).
- C(x), R(x), N(x) are eliminated—they are not in the secret word.
- The word pattern is _ _ A _ E.

For the next guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Positions 3 and 5 are fixed as 'A' and 'E' (_ _ A _ E).
- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.
- Tests new common consonants (e.g., S, T, L, P, D) to gather more information on positions 1, 2, and 4.

A strong candidate is **""SLATE""** (S L A T E):
- It tests S, L, T—high-frequency letters not yet checked.
- It has all distinct letters, maximizing potential feedback.
- The pattern _ _ A _ E is satisfied (S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).

This guess will help identify correct positions of S, L, T or reveal if they are absent/in the word elsewhere.

If any of them are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLATE"" (P L A T E) tests P, L, T.\n\nBut ""SLATE"" is very common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SHADE"" (S H A D E) tests S, H, D.\n\nSince we are early in the game, any of these could work. Let\'s choose ""SLATE"".\n\nBut note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But ""SLATE"" has all distinct.\n\nAnother thing: we don\'t know if the word has the letters we are about to test, so we are trying to cover a lot.\n\nWait, what about ""STAGE""? S T A G E -> but that\'s also a possibility.\n\nBut ""SLATE"" is a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, to cover more vowels? But we already have two vowels, and consonants are more varied. We can avoid vowels for now because we have A and E.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SLATE"".\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""slate"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A(✓) is confirmed at position 3 (third letter).\n- E(✓) is confirmed at position 5 (fifth letter).\n- C(x), R(x), N(x) are eliminated—they are not in the secret word.\n- The word pattern is _ _ A _ E.\n\nFor the next guess, we need a 5-letter word that:\n- Positions 3 and 5 are fixed as \'A\' and \'E\' (_ _ A _ E).\n- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.\n- Tests new common consonants (e.g., S, T, L, P, D) to gather more information on positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SLATE""** (S L A T E):\n- It tests S, L, T—high-frequency letters not yet checked.\n- It has all distinct letters, maximizing potential feedback.\n- The pattern _ _ A _ E is satisfied (S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).\n\nThis guess will help identify correct positions of S, L, T or reveal if they are absent/in the word elsewhere.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the second guess ""slate"":
S(✓) - S is in the correct position (position 1).
L(-) - L is in the word but in the wrong position.
A(✓) - A is in the correct position (position 3, as before).
T(x) - T is not in the word.
E(✓) - E is in the correct position (position 5).

So, from all feedback so far:

Correct positions:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E

Wrong position but present:
- L is in the word, but not at position 2.

Absent letters:
- C, R, N, T (from both guesses: C, R, N from first; T from second)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- First letter: S
- Third letter: A
- Fifth letter: E
- The letter L is present, but not at position 2 (so it must be at position 4, since positions 1,3,5 are fixed and we have only positions 2 and 4 left? But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 1,3,5, and we know L is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at position 4? Because that's the only position left? But wait, position 4 is the only unknown position? Actually, we have two unknown positions: 2 and 4.

But we know L is present and not at position 2, so it must be at position 4? Not necessarily, because the word might have more than one occurrence of a letter? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But in this case, since we have only two unknown positions (2 and 4) and we know L is present and not at 2, then if the word has no duplicate, L must be at position 4.

But let's not assume no duplicates. However, the feedback for L is that it is present but not at position 2. So it could be at position 4, or if there is a duplicate, it could be at position 4 and also elsewhere? But we don't have any duplicate in our guess, so we only know one L is present and not at 2.

Given the fixed positions, the word is: S _ A _ E

We know L is in the word and not at position 2, so it must be at position 4? Because that's the only other position? Or could it be that L is at position 4 and also at position 2? But we don't have any information about position 2 yet. However, the feedback for the second guess: when we put L at position 2, it said L(-) meaning it's present but not at that position. So if the word had L at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). Since it's not, position 2 is not L.

Therefore, the only other position for L is position 4. But what if the word has L at position 4 and also at position 2? Then when we put L at position 2, it would have been marked as present but in the wrong position? Actually, no: if the word has two L's, and we guess L at position 2, but if the word has L at position 4 and not at position 2, then the feedback for L at position 2 would be (-) because there is an L in the word but not at that position. But if the word had an L at position 2, then it would be (✓). So the feedback tells us that position 2 is not L, and there is at least one L in the word. Since the only other unknown position is 4, it must be that L is at position 4? Unless the word has an L in a position we already know? But positions 1,3,5 are fixed: S, A, E. None of them is L. So L must be at position 4.

Therefore, we can deduce that the secret word has L at position 4.

So the word is: S _ A L E

Now, we only need to find the second letter.

The word is: S ? A L E

We know the absent letters: C, R, N, T.

We also know that the second letter cannot be any of the absent letters, and it must be a letter that forms a valid English word.

What are possible words? Some examples:
- scale: but C is absent, so no.
- shale: H is not eliminated, so possible? But let's check: S H A L E -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, A at 3, L at 4, E at 5. H is not eliminated? We haven't guessed H before.
- stale: but T is absent, so no.
- sale: but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.
- whale: W is not eliminated, but whale is W H A L E -> that's 5 letters.

But we have to consider the feedback: we know that in the first guess, we had no other letters, and in the second guess, we had T absent. So T is out.

Possible letters for the second position: any letter except C, R, N, T, and also except the ones we know (S, A, L, E) because if it were one of these, we might have seen it? But we don't have a duplicate rule. However, we haven't tested many letters.

We have only eliminated C, R, N, T. So the second letter can be any other letter of the alphabet.

But we must form a valid English word: S ? A L E

Common words that fit:
- shale (H)
- whale (W)
- stale (but T is absent, so no)
- scale (C absent, no)
- dale? But that would be S D A L E? That's not a word. We need the word to have the pattern S?ALE.

Actually, the word must be S _ A L E, so the second letter and then ""ALE"" as a unit? Not exactly, but the letters are fixed: S at 1, then a letter at 2, then A at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

So the word is: [S] [letter] [A] [L] [E]

What are the possible words? Let me list a few:
- shale: S H A L E
- whale: W H A L E? Wait, whale is W at 1, H at 2? No, whale is W H A L E, so that would be position 1: W, 2: H, 3: A, 4: L, 5: E. But we need position 1 to be S. So whale doesn't fit.

We need the first letter to be S. So the word must start with S.

So: shale (S H A L E) is one.

Are there others?
- stale: S T A L E -> but T is absent, so no.
- scale: S C A L E -> C absent, no.
- snale? Not a word.
- spale? Not a common word.
- swale: S W A L E -> swale is a word (a low or hollow place).

So possible words: shale, swale, and maybe others? Let me think.

Also, ""sable"": S A B L E -> but that would be S at 1, A at 2? But we need A at position 3. So no, because in sable, A is at position 2, but we need A at position 3.

We have fixed positions: 1:S, 3:A, 4:L, 5:E. So the second letter is the only unknown.

So the word is: S X A L E, where X is the second letter.

What letters can X be? It must form a valid English word.

Common words:
- shale (X=H)
- swale (X=W)

Less common:
- stale (but T is absent, so invalid)
- scale (C absent, invalid)
- smale? Not a word.
- shale and swale seem the main ones.

But there is also ""seale""? Not a word. Or ""siale""? Not a word.

Another one: ""shale"" and ""swale"" are the most common.

But we have to consider that we haven't tested H or W yet.

In our next guess, we can guess one of these to see.

But we have only one unknown letter, so we can guess either ""shale"" or ""swale"" and see if it's correct.

However, we have 6 tries, and we are on guess 3. We can try one.

But we want to be efficient. Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one position unknown, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can also consider that we might have missed some letters? For example, what about ""D""? We haven't tested D. But is there a word ""sdale""? No.

Or ""gale"" is part, but S G A L E? Not a word.

So the only common words are ""shale"" and ""swale"".

But let me confirm: shale is a word (a type of rock), and swale is a word (a marshy depression).

We can also check the word list? But since we are playing, we have to go with what we know.

Another possibility: ""salve"" is S A L V E, but that has A at position 2 and L at 3? We need A at 3 and L at 4. So S A L V E: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need position 3 to be A, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""solve"" is S O L V E, which doesn't have A.

So back to shale and swale.

We have two candidates: shale and swale.

We need to choose one for the next guess.

We can also think: in the feedback, we have L marked as present but not at position 2. But we deduced it must be at position 4. However, what if the word has an L at position 4 and also at another position? But we don't have any indication of that. And in our guess ""slate"", we had L at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent with L being at position 4 and not at 2.

But if we guess ""shale"", for example, and the word is ""swale"", then we get feedback that H is absent and W is not tested? But we would know.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has both H and W? But we don't have such a word that fits the pattern S _ A L E.

So we have to choose one.

Let me see which one is more common? Shale might be more common.

But to be safe, we can guess ""shale"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that H is absent, then we know it must be ""swale"".

Similarly, if we guess ""swale"" and it's wrong, then it must be ""shale"".

So we can do that.

But we are on guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests more letters? But we don't have many unknown positions. We only have one position unknown, so we must fill it.

But we can also consider that the word might have a duplicate? For example, what if the word is ""salle""? But ""salle"" is not a common word, and it has two L's? But in our pattern, we have L at position 4, and if we put L at position 2? But we know position 2 cannot be L because in guess 2, we had L at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that position 2 is not L. So if the word had L at position 2, it would have been marked correct. So position 2 is not L. Therefore, ""salle"" would have L at position 2 and 4? But then when we guessed ""slate"" with L at position 2, it should have been marked as correct (✓) if the word has L at position 2. But it was marked as (-), meaning that the word does not have L at position 2. So the word cannot have L at position 2. Therefore, ""salle"" is not possible because it would require L at position 2? Actually, ""salle"" is S A L L E, so position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. But we need position 3 to be A, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Therefore, the only possibilities are shale and swale.

I think we should guess ""shale"" because it's more common.

But let's see the feedback history: we have not tested H or W, so we can choose.

Alternatively, to be thorough, we can think if there are other words? What about ""sable""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""sabre""? But R is absent and also pattern: S A B R E -> position 3 is B, not A.

No.

So I think shale and swale are the only two.

Therefore, I'll go with ""shale"".

But let me double-check the feedback.

In guess 2: slate -> S(✓) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

We deduced that L must be at position 4 because it's the only position left? But what about the possibility that the word has a duplicate of S, A, or E? For example, if the word has two S's? But we have S at position 1 correct, and if there is another S, then in our guess ""slate"", we have only one S at position 1, which is correct, so no issue. Similarly for A and E. But we don't have any indication of duplicates.

But if there were an L at position 4 and also at position 2, then when we guessed ""slate"" with L at position 2, it would have been marked as (-) because the L at position 2 is not correct (since the word has L at position 4, but not at 2), and the feedback for L would be that it is present but not at that position, which is what we have. So it doesn't tell us if there is a duplicate L at position 2? But we know position 2 is not L because if it were, it would be (✓). So the word does not have L at position 2. Therefore, the L must be at position 4, and there is no duplicate at position 2.

So the word is S ? A L E.

Now, for the next guess, we can guess ""shale"".

If it's correct, we are done. If not, then we know it's ""swale"".

But to be safe, we can also consider if there are other words? What about ""stale""? But T is absent, so no.

Or ""shake""? But that would be S H A K E, which has E at position 5, but position 4 is K, not L. We need position 4 to be L.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""shale"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:  
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: slate** → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:  
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (it must be elsewhere).  
  - A and E are confirmed again in positions 3 and 5 (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - T is not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions 1, 3, and 5 are S, A, E respectively).
- L is present but not in position 2. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed (and not L), L must be in position 4 (the only remaining position). Thus, the pattern is now **S _ A L E**.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- The only unknown is the letter in position 2. Possible words fitting the pattern **S _ A L E** and avoiding eliminated letters include:
  - **shale** (if the second letter is H)
  - **swale** (if the second letter is W)

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- With only one unknown letter (position 2), we can test one of the candidate words directly. 
- **shale** is chosen as the next guess because it is a common word and tests the high-frequency letter H. If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if H is present/absent, narrowing it to **swale** for the next guess.

<guess>shale</guess>",shale,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""slate"":
S(✓) - S is in the correct position (position 1).
L(-) - L is in the word but in the wrong position.
A(✓) - A is in the correct position (position 3, as before).
T(x) - T is not in the word.
E(✓) - E is in the correct position (position 5).

So, from all feedback so far:

Correct positions:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E

Wrong position but present:
- L is in the word, but not at position 2.

Absent letters:
- C, R, N, T (from both guesses: C, R, N from first; T from second)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- First letter: S
- Third letter: A
- Fifth letter: E
- The letter L is present, but not at position 2 (so it must be at position 4, since positions 1,3,5 are fixed and we have only positions 2 and 4 left? But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 1,3,5, and we know L is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at position 4? Because that's the only position left? But wait, position 4 is the only unknown position? Actually, we have two unknown positions: 2 and 4.

But we know L is present and not at position 2, so it must be at position 4? Not necessarily, because the word might have more than one occurrence of a letter? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But in this case, since we have only two unknown positions (2 and 4) and we know L is present and not at 2, then if the word has no duplicate, L must be at position 4.

But let's not assume no duplicates. However, the feedback for L is that it is present but not at position 2. So it could be at position 4, or if there is a duplicate, it could be at position 4 and also elsewhere? But we don't have any duplicate in our guess, so we only know one L is present and not at 2.

Given the fixed positions, the word is: S _ A _ E

We know L is in the word and not at position 2, so it must be at position 4? Because that's the only other position? Or could it be that L is at position 4 and also at position 2? But we don't have any information about position 2 yet. However, the feedback for the second guess: when we put L at position 2, it said L(-) meaning it's present but not at that position. So if the word had L at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). Since it's not, position 2 is not L.

Therefore, the only other position for L is position 4. But what if the word has L at position 4 and also at position 2? Then when we put L at position 2, it would have been marked as present but in the wrong position? Actually, no: if the word has two L's, and we guess L at position 2, but if the word has L at position 4 and not at position 2, then the feedback for L at position 2 would be (-) because there is an L in the word but not at that position. But if the word had an L at position 2, then it would be (✓). So the feedback tells us that position 2 is not L, and there is at least one L in the word. Since the only other unknown position is 4, it must be that L is at position 4? Unless the word has an L in a position we already know? But positions 1,3,5 are fixed: S, A, E. None of them is L. So L must be at position 4.

Therefore, we can deduce that the secret word has L at position 4.

So the word is: S _ A L E

Now, we only need to find the second letter.

The word is: S ? A L E

We know the absent letters: C, R, N, T.

We also know that the second letter cannot be any of the absent letters, and it must be a letter that forms a valid English word.

What are possible words? Some examples:
- scale: but C is absent, so no.
- shale: H is not eliminated, so possible? But let's check: S H A L E -> positions: S at 1, H at 2, A at 3, L at 4, E at 5. H is not eliminated? We haven't guessed H before.
- stale: but T is absent, so no.
- sale: but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.
- whale: W is not eliminated, but whale is W H A L E -> that's 5 letters.

But we have to consider the feedback: we know that in the first guess, we had no other letters, and in the second guess, we had T absent. So T is out.

Possible letters for the second position: any letter except C, R, N, T, and also except the ones we know (S, A, L, E) because if it were one of these, we might have seen it? But we don't have a duplicate rule. However, we haven't tested many letters.

We have only eliminated C, R, N, T. So the second letter can be any other letter of the alphabet.

But we must form a valid English word: S ? A L E

Common words that fit:
- shale (H)
- whale (W)
- stale (but T is absent, so no)
- scale (C absent, no)
- dale? But that would be S D A L E? That's not a word. We need the word to have the pattern S?ALE.

Actually, the word must be S _ A L E, so the second letter and then ""ALE"" as a unit? Not exactly, but the letters are fixed: S at 1, then a letter at 2, then A at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

So the word is: [S] [letter] [A] [L] [E]

What are the possible words? Let me list a few:
- shale: S H A L E
- whale: W H A L E? Wait, whale is W at 1, H at 2? No, whale is W H A L E, so that would be position 1: W, 2: H, 3: A, 4: L, 5: E. But we need position 1 to be S. So whale doesn't fit.

We need the first letter to be S. So the word must start with S.

So: shale (S H A L E) is one.

Are there others?
- stale: S T A L E -> but T is absent, so no.
- scale: S C A L E -> C absent, no.
- snale? Not a word.
- spale? Not a common word.
- swale: S W A L E -> swale is a word (a low or hollow place).

So possible words: shale, swale, and maybe others? Let me think.

Also, ""sable"": S A B L E -> but that would be S at 1, A at 2? But we need A at position 3. So no, because in sable, A is at position 2, but we need A at position 3.

We have fixed positions: 1:S, 3:A, 4:L, 5:E. So the second letter is the only unknown.

So the word is: S X A L E, where X is the second letter.

What letters can X be? It must form a valid English word.

Common words:
- shale (X=H)
- swale (X=W)

Less common:
- stale (but T is absent, so invalid)
- scale (C absent, invalid)
- smale? Not a word.
- shale and swale seem the main ones.

But there is also ""seale""? Not a word. Or ""siale""? Not a word.

Another one: ""shale"" and ""swale"" are the most common.

Or ""gale"" is part, but S G A L E? Not a word.

So the only common words are ""shale"" and ""swale"".

But let me confirm: shale is a word (a type of rock), and swale is a word (a marshy depression).

We can also check the word list? But since we are playing, we have to go with what we know.

Another possibility: ""salve"" is S A L V E, but that has A at position 2 and L at 3? We need A at 3 and L at 4. So S A L V E: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need position 3 to be A, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""solve"" is S O L V E, which doesn't have A.

So back to shale and swale.

We have two candidates: shale and swale.

We need to choose one for the next guess.

We can also think: in the feedback, we have L marked as present but not at position 2. But we deduced it must be at position 4. However, what if the word has an L at position 4 and also at another position? But we don't have any indication of that. And in our guess ""slate"", we had L at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent with L being at position 4 and not at 2.

So if the word had L at position 2, it would have been marked correct. So position 2 is not L. Therefore, ""salle"" would have L at position 2 and 4? But then when we guessed ""slate"" with L at position 2, it should have been marked as correct (✓) if the word has L at position 2. But it was marked as (-), meaning that the word does not have L at position 2. So the word cannot have L at position 2. Therefore, ""salle"" is not possible because it would require L at position 2? Actually, ""salle"" is S A L L E, so position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. But we need position 3 to be A, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Therefore, the only possibilities are shale and swale.

I think we should guess ""shale"" because it's more common.

But let's see the feedback history: we have not tested H or W, so we can choose.

Alternatively, to be thorough, we can think if there are other words? What about ""sable""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""sabre""? But R is absent and also pattern: S A B R E -> position 3 is B, not A.

No.

So I think shale and swale are the only two.

Therefore, I'll go with ""shale"".

But let me double-check the feedback.

In guess 2: slate -> S(✓) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

We deduced that L must be at position 4 because it's the only position left? But what about the possibility that the word has a duplicate of S, A, or E? For example, if the word has two S's? But we have S at position 1 correct, and if there is another S, then in our guess ""slate"", we have only one S at position 1, which is correct, so no issue. Similarly for A and E. But we don't have any indication of duplicates.

But if there were an L at position 4 and also at position 2, then when we guessed ""slate"" with L at position 2, it would have been marked as (-) because the L at position 2 is not correct (since the word has L at position 4, but not at 2), and the feedback for L would be that it is present but not at that position, which is what we have. So it doesn't tell us if there is a duplicate L at position 2? But we know position 2 is not L because if it were, it would be (✓). So the word does not have L at position 2. Therefore, the L must be at position 4, and there is no duplicate at position 2.

So the word is S ? A L E.

Now, for the next guess, we can guess ""shale"".

If it's correct, we are done. If not, then we know it's ""swale"".

But to be safe, we can also consider if there are other words? What about ""stale""? But T is absent, so no.

Or ""shake""? But that would be S H A K E, which has E at position 5, but position 4 is K, not L. We need position 4 to be L.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""shale"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:  
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: slate** → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:  
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (it must be elsewhere).  
  - A and E are confirmed again in positions 3 and 5 (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - T is not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions 1, 3, and 5 are S, A, E respectively).
- L is present but not in position 2. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed (and not L), L must be in position 4 (the only remaining position). Thus, the pattern is now **S _ A L E**.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- The only unknown is the letter in position 2. Possible words fitting the pattern **S _ A L E** and avoiding eliminated letters include:
  - **shale** (if the second letter is H)
  - **swale** (if the second letter is W)

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- With only one unknown letter (position 2), we can test one of the candidate words directly. 
- **shale** is chosen as the next guess because it is a common word and tests the high-frequency letter H. If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if H is present/absent, narrowing it to **swale** for the next guess.",Guess 3: shale -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
