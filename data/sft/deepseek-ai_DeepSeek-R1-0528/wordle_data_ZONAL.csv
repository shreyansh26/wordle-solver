We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.

 Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.

The first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x → C is not in the secret word.
- R: x → R is not in the secret word.
- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- E: x → E is not in the secret word.

So, from this, I know:
- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.
- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with '-', they are in the wrong position.

In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they're not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

The secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let's list the positions:
- Position 1: C (but C is out)
- Position 2: R (out)
- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)
- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)
- Position 5: E (out)

Therefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.

The word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:
- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.
- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.
Similarly for position 2 and 5.

So A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn't affect the position availability for A directly.

I need to think about where A and N can be.

The secret word contains A and N somewhere else.

Also, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.

For my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.

Common English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Letters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.

Potential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

First, let's think about possible words with A and N.

A is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.

In ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let's see the word structure.

As of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.

Now, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.

Also, since it's a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.

Let me brainstorm some words with A and N.

Examples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.

Or ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.

But let's check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn't have R, which is good.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.

Positions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

But from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.

Yes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.

In ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it's fine because I can still get information about other letters.

Perhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.

Similarly for N, not at position 4.

In ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.

But I can use ""plant"" to confirm.

Another word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.

A at position 3? Same as above.

Position 3 is often problematic.

What about words where A is at position 1 or 2?

For example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.

R is out, so words with R are bad.

""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.

In feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.

Letters to avoid: C, R, E.

So ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that's not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.

But I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn't be at 3, N shouldn't be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.

The feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.

Another idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.

What words start with A and contain N?

""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T

Positions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5

But N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.

Similarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.

""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.

And no C,R,E.

Similarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.

""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.

Letters: A,N,V,I,L.

I could use.

But ""angst"" seems good: common word.

Another option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.

""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.

Possible.

But I think ""angst"" is fine.

With ""angst"":
- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -
- Position 2: N, similarly
- Etc.

If secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.

But since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.

Similarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.

To maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.

In ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E

Present: A,N

Absent: C,R,E

New letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.

For ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.

Also, A and N are included.

Positions in ""angst"":
- A at position 1
- N at position 2
- G at position 3
- S at position 4
- T at position 5

Now, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.

N cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn't tested before.

Previous guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.

Now N at position 2, which could be correct or not.

Similarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.

Position 4 had N before, now S is there.

Position 5 had E, now T.

I think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.

But let's see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.

Another common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N

Positions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5

But A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I'll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.

Similarly, N at position 5, which is new.

Position 5 had E, which is out, so new.

In ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).

But A at 3 is redundant because we know it's wrong.

So I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.

Similarly for N at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.

Similarly, N at position 4.

So ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.

""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.

E absent, so not good.

""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.

""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn't say anything about multiple letters.

In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.

But in feedback, I need to be careful.

For example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.

But here, ""crane"" had single letters.

Perhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.

But not necessary.

However for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.

A,N,G,S,T all distinct.

Good.

Another word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.

""angst"" is better.

Or ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.

In ""stand"", A at 3.

Similarly ""land"" is 4 letters.

""brand"" has R, out.

So probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.

""abide"" has I,E? E out.

""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.

But double K, messy.

Perhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.

E is not in word.

Letters to use: avoid C,R,E.

Vowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.

So ""angst"" seems fine.

I'll go with ""angst"".

But let's confirm the word.

""angst"" is a valid word.

In feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.

If A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -

Similarly for others.

Also, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.

Perfect.

So my second guess: angst.
</think>
<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C(x): C is not in the secret word.
- R(x): R is not in the secret word.
- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

This gives us:
- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.
- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).
- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren't). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.
- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.

For the second guess:
- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.
- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.
- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it's incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.
- A good choice is ""angst"": 
  - It contains A and N.
  - Avoids C, R, E.
  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.
  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.
  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.
  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.

Alternatives considered: 
- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). 
- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). 
- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  
""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.

- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)
- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)
- Position 5: E (out)

Therefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out.

Another option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.

""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.

Possible.

But I think ""angst"" is fine.

With ""angst"":
- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -
- Position 2: N, similarly
- Etc.

If secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.

But since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.

Similarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.

To maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.

In ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E

Present: A,N

Absent: C,R,E

New letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.

For ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.

Also, A and N are included.

Positions in ""angst"":
- A at position 1
- N at position 2
- G at position 3
- S at position 4
- T at position 5

Now, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.

N cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn't tested before.

Previous guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.

Now N at position 2, which could be correct or not.

Similarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.

Position 4 had N before, now S is there.

Position 5 had E, now T.

I think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.

But let's see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.

Another common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N

Positions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5

But A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I'll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.

Similarly, N at position 5, which is new.

Position 5 had E, which is out, so new.

In ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).

But A at 3 is redundant because we know it's wrong.

So I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.

Similarly for N at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.

Similarly, N at position 4.

So ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.

""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.

E absent, so not good.

""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.

""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn't say anything about multiple letters.

In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.

But in feedback, I need to be careful.

For example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.

But here, ""crane"" had single letters.

Perhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.

But not necessary.

However for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.

A,N,G,S,T all distinct.

Good.

Another word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.

""angst"" is better.

Or ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.

In ""stand"", A at 3.

Similarly ""land"" is 4 letters.

""brand"" has R, out.

So probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.

""abide"" has I,E? E out.

""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.

But double K, messy.

Perhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.

E is not in word.

Letters to use: avoid C,R,E.

Vowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.

So ""angst"" seems fine.

I'll go with ""angst"".

But let's confirm the word.

""angst"" is a valid word.

In feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.

If A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -

Similarly for others.

Also, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.

Perfect.

So my second guess: angst.<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C(x): C is not in the secret word.
- R(x): R is not in the secret word.
- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

This gives us:
- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.
- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).
- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren't). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.
- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.

For the second guess:
- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.
- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.
- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it's incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.
- A good choice is ""angst"": 
  - It contains A and N.
  - Avoids C, R, E.
  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.
  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.
  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.
  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.

Alternatives considered: 
- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). 
- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). 
- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  
""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ZONAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.

 Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.

The first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x → C is not in the secret word.
- R: x → R is not in the secret word.
- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- E: x → E is not in the secret word.

So, from this, I know:
- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.
- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with '-', they are in the wrong position.

In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they're not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

The secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let's list the positions:
- Position 1: C (but C is out)
- Position 2: R (out)
- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)
- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)
- Position 5: E (out)

Therefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.

The word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:
- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.
- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.
Similarly for position 2 and 5.

So A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn't affect the position availability for A directly.

I need to think about where A and N can be.

The secret word contains A and N somewhere else.

Also, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.

For my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.

Common English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Letters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.

Potential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

First, let's think about possible words with A and N.

A is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.

In ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let's see the word structure.

As of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.

Now, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.

Also, since it's a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.

Let me brainstorm some words with A and N.

Examples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.

Or ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.

But let's check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn't have R, which is good.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.

Positions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

But from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.

Yes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.

In ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it's fine because I can still get information about other letters.

Perhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.

Similarly for N, not at position 4.

In ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.

But I can use ""plant"" to confirm.

Another word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.

A at position 3? Same as above.

Position 3 is often problematic.

What about words where A is at position 1 or 2?

For example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.

R is out, so words with R are bad.

""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.

In feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.

Letters to avoid: C, R, E.

So ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that's not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.

But I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn't be at 3, N shouldn't be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.

The feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.

Another idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.

What words start with A and contain N?

""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T

Positions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5

But N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.

Similarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.

""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.

And no C,R,E.

Similarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.

""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.

Letters: A,N,V,I,L.

I could use.

But ""angst"" seems good: common word.

Another option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.

""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.

Possible.

But I think ""angst"" is fine.

With ""angst"":
- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -
- Position 2: N, similarly
- Etc.

If secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.

But since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.

Similarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.

To maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.

In ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E

Present: A,N

Absent: C,R,E

New letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.

For ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.

Also, A and N are included.

Positions in ""angst"":
- A at position 1
- N at position 2
- G at position 3
- S at position 4
- T at position 5

Now, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.

N cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn't tested before.

Previous guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.

Now N at position 2, which could be correct or not.

Similarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.

Position 4 had N before, now S is there.

Position 5 had E, now T.

I think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.

But let's see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.

Another common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N

Positions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5

But A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I'll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.

Similarly, N at position 5, which is new.

Position 5 had E, which is out, so new.

In ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).

But A at 3 is redundant because we know it's wrong.

So I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.

Similarly for N at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.

Similarly, N at position 4.

So ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.

""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.

E absent, so not good.

""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.

""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn't say anything about multiple letters.

In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.

But in feedback, I need to be careful.

For example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.

But here, ""crane"" had single letters.

Perhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.

But not necessary.

However for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.

A,N,G,S,T all distinct.

Good.

Another word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.

""angst"" is better.

Or ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.

In ""stand"", A at 3.

Similarly ""land"" is 4 letters.

""brand"" has R, out.

So probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.

""abide"" has I,E? E out.

""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.

But double K, messy.

Perhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.

E is not in word.

Letters to use: avoid C,R,E.

Vowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.

So ""angst"" seems fine.

I'll go with ""angst"".

But let's confirm the word.

""angst"" is a valid word.

In feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.

If A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -

Similarly for others.

Also, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.

Perfect.

So my second guess: angst.<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C(x): C is not in the secret word.
- R(x): R is not in the secret word.
- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

This gives us:
- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.
- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).
- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren't).

  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.
  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.

Alternatives considered: 
- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). 
- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). 
- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  
""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.

But let\'s see the word structure.\n\nAs of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.\n\nNow, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.\n\nAlso, since it\'s a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words with A and N.\n\nExamples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.\n\nOr ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn\'t have R, which is good.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.\n\nPositions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nBut from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.\n\nYes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.\n\nIn ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it\'s fine because I can still get information about other letters.\n\nPerhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.\n\nSimilarly for N, not at position 4.\n\nIn ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.\n\nBut I can use ""plant"" to confirm.\n\nAnother word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.\n\nA at position 3? Same as above.\n\nPosition 3 is often problematic.\n\nWhat about words where A is at position 1 or 2?\n\nFor example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.\n\nR is out, so words with R are bad.\n\n""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.\n\nIn feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, E.\n\nSo ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that\'s not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.\n\nBut I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn\'t be at 3, N shouldn\'t be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.\n\nThe feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.\n\nAnother idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.\n\nWhat words start with A and contain N?\n\n""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T\n\nPositions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5\n\nBut N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.\n\n""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.\n\nAnd no C,R,E.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.\n\n""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.\n\nLetters: A,N,V,I,L.\n\nI could use.\n\nBut ""angst"" seems good: common word.\n\nAnother option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.\n\n""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.\n\nPossible.\n\nBut I think ""angst"" is fine.\n\nWith ""angst"":\n- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -\n- Position 2: N, similarly\n- Etc.\n\nIf secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.\n\nBut since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.\n\nTo maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.\n\nSo letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\n\nPresent: A,N\n\nAbsent: C,R,E\n\nNew letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.\n\nFor ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.\n\nAlso, A and N are included.\n\nPositions in ""angst"":\n- A at position 1\n- N at position 2\n- G at position 3\n- S at position 4\n- T at position 5\n\nNow, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.\n\nN cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn\'t tested before.\n\nPrevious guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.\n\nNow N at position 2, which could be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.\n\nPosition 4 had N before, now S is there.\n\nPosition 5 had E, now T.\n\nI think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N\n\nPositions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5\n\nBut A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I\'ll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 5, which is new.\n\nPosition 5 had E, which is out, so new.\n\nIn ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).\n\nBut A at 3 is redundant because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly for N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 4.\n\nSo ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.\n\n""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.\n\nE absent, so not good.\n\n""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.\n\n""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple letters.\n\nIn Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.\n\nBut in feedback, I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.\n\nBut here, ""crane"" had single letters.\n\nPerhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nHowever for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.\n\nA,N,G,S,T all distinct.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.\n\n""angst"" is better.\n\nOr ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.\n\nIn ""stand"", A at 3.\n\nSimilarly ""land"" is 4 letters.\n\n""brand"" has R, out.\n\nSo probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.\n\n""abide"" has I,E? E out.\n\n""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.\n\nBut double K, messy.\n\nPerhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.\n\nE is not in word.\n\nLetters to use: avoid C,R,E.\n\nVowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.\n\nConsonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.\n\nSo ""angst"" seems fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""angst"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word.\n\n""angst"" is a valid word.\n\nIn feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.\n\nIf A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo my second guess: angst.<thoughts>\nFrom the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:\n- C(x): C is not in the secret word.\n- R(x): R is not in the secret word.\n- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- E(x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nThis gives us:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.\n- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).\n- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren\'t). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.\n- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.\n- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.\n- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it\'s incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.\n- A good choice is ""angst"": \n  - It contains A and N.\n  - Avoids C, R, E.\n  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.\n  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.\n  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.\n  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.\n\nAlternatives considered: \n- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). \n- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). \n- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  \n""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>angst</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got '-').
- G, S, T are not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T
- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don't know their positions yet)

From the feedback:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5

But note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list the available positions:

Position 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)
Position 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)
Position 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)
Position 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)
Position 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.

So the word must have:
- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven't tested, but we have constraints)
Actually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.

Similarly for other positions.

But we know A and N must be placed in the word.

Let me denote the positions:

Let P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.

Constraints:
- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).
- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.
- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.
- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.
- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.

But we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.

Also, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.

Alphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.

Possible cases:

Case 1: N is at position 1.
Then A must be at position 2,4, or 5.

But if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.

Similarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.

But A must be somewhere.

Similarly, other cases.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.

For example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let's see:

If we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:
P1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)
P4: new letter
P5: new letter

But we need to form a word.

Similarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.

List of possible words:

- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.

Examples:
- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let's see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can't use E, but ""nappy"" doesn't have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.

But we have double P, which might be okay.

But let's see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.

""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.

But A is already present, so double A might be possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.

""naked"" has E and D? E is out.

""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let's see other options.

Another: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.

Similarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.

So for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.

Similarly, other cases.

Now, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.

For example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.

""banjo"" is a word.

Similarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.

N at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.

""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.

Tricky.

Now, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.

For example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.

N at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't.

In ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""chain"" has C, out.

""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.

So difficult.

Therefore, the easier cases are:

- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""
- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates
- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""

Also, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can't both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.

So impossible.

Therefore, let's list possible words:

1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.

2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.

3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don't know if secret has double A.

4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.

To get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.

""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.

If N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly for A at P4.

In ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Which one to choose?

We also need to consider common letters.

Available common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.

""nomad"" has O, M, D.

""banjo"" has B, J, O.

J is less common.

Perhaps ""nomad"" is better.

Another word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.

""nodal"" is a word.

Similarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.

""focal"" has C.

So ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".

But ""nomad"" might be more common.

We could test if N is at P1.

If we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.

Similarly for A at P4.

Also, we get info on O, M, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Now, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.

By guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.

Similarly for N at P3.

But let's see which positions are more likely.

Since P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.

But to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.

P2 and P3 are middle positions.

In ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.

But let's choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.

But J is not very common, so maybe not.

Another word: ""manor"" has R, out.

""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.

""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.

""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.

""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn't have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.

The guess must include both A and N because they are present.

So we cannot guess a word without A or without N.

Therefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, we must have both.

So back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".

Another word: ""anode"" has E, out.

""alone"" has E, out.

""algin"" not common.

""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.

So invalid.

""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.

""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.

Similarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.

A at P2, N at P3, both allowed.

And letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.

So ""handy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.

Or ""candy"" has C, out.

So ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".

""handy"" is common.

With ""handy"":
- P1: H (new)
- P2: A (test if A is at P2)
- P3: N (test if N is at P3)
- P4: D (new)
- P5: Y (new)

If A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).

Similarly for N at P3.

This will give good information.

Compared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.

""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

""bandy"" is similar.

I think ""handy"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.

If not, we know where they are not.

Also, we learn about H, D, Y.

Since we have limited letters left, we might solve it.

Another word: ""panic"" has C, out.

""manic"" has C.

""lapin"" not common.

So I think ""handy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""handy"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  
    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  
- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  
- **Position Constraints for A:**  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for N:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Available Positions Summary:**  
  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  
- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  
- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  
  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  
- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  
  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  
  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  
  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  
- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  

### Why ""handy""?
- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  
- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.  

<guess>handy</guess>",handy,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got '-').
- G, S, T are not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T
- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don't know their positions yet)

From the feedback:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5

But note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list the available positions:

Position 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)
Position 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)
Position 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)
Position 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)
Position 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.

So the word must have:
- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven't tested, but we have constraints)
Actually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.

Similarly for other positions.

But we know A and N must be placed in the word.

Let me denote the positions:

Let P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.

Constraints:
- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).
- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.
- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.
- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.
- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.

But we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.

Also, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.

Alphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.

Possible cases:

Case 1: N is at position 1.
Then A must be at position 2,4, or 5.

But if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.

Similarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.

But A must be somewhere.

Similarly, other cases.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.

For example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let's see:

If we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:
P1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)
P4: new letter
P5: new letter

But we need to form a word.

Similarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.

List of possible words:

- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.

Examples:
- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let's see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can't use E, but ""nappy"" doesn't have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.

But we have double P, which might be okay.

But let's see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.

""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.

But A is already present, so double A might be possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.

""naked"" has E and D? E is out.

""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let's see other options.

Another: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.

Similarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.

So for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.

Similarly, other cases.

Now, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.

For example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.

""banjo"" is a word.

Similarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.

N at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.

""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.

Tricky.

Now, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.

For example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.

N at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't.

In ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""chain"" has C, out.

""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.

So difficult.

Therefore, the easier cases are:

- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""
- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates
- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""

Also, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can't both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.

So impossible.

Therefore, let's list possible words:

1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.

2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.

3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don't know if secret has double A.

4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.

To get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.

""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.

If N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly for A at P4.

In ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Which one to choose?

We also need to consider common letters.

Available common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.

""nomad"" has O, M, D.

""banjo"" has B, J, O.

J is less common.

Perhaps ""nomad"" is better.

Another word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.

""nodal"" is a word.

Similarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.

""focal"" has C.

So ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".

But ""nomad"" might be more common.

We could test if N is at P1.

If we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.

Similarly for A at P4.

Also, we get info on O, M, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Now, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.

By guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.

Similarly for N at P3.

But let's see which positions are more likely.

Since P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.

But to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.

P2 and P3 are middle positions.

In ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.

But let's choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.

But J is not very common, so maybe not.

Another word: ""manor"" has R, out.

""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.

""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.

""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.

""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn't have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.

The guess must include both A and N because they are present.

So we cannot guess a word without A or without N.

Therefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, we must have both.

So back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".

Another word: ""anode"" has E, out.

""alone"" has E, out.

""algin"" not common.

""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.

So invalid.

""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.

""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.

Similarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.

A at P2, N at P3, both allowed.

And letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.

So ""handy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.

Or ""candy"" has C, out.

So ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".

""handy"" is common.

With ""handy"":
- P1: H (new)
- P2: A (test if A is at P2)
- P3: N (test if N is at P3)
- P4: D (new)
- P5: Y (new)

If A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).

Similarly for N at P3.

This will give good information.

Compared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.

""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

""bandy"" is similar.

I think ""handy"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.

If not, we know where they are not.

Also, we learn about H, D, Y.

Since we have limited letters left, we might solve it.

Another word: ""panic"" has C, out.

""manic"" has C.

""lapin"" not common.

So I think ""handy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  
    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  
- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  
- **Position Constraints for A:**  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for N:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Available Positions Summary:**  
  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  
- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  
- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  
  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  
- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  
  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  
  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  
  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  
- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  

### Why ""handy""?
- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  
- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.",Guess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.

 Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.

The first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x → C is not in the secret word.
- R: x → R is not in the secret word.
- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- E: x → E is not in the secret word.

So, from this, I know:
- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.
- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with '-', they are in the wrong position.

In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they're not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

The secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let's list the positions:
- Position 1: C (but C is out)
- Position 2: R (out)
- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)
- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)
- Position 5: E (out)

Therefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.

The word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:
- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.
- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.
Similarly for position 2 and 5.

So A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn't affect the position availability for A directly.

I need to think about where A and N can be.

The secret word contains A and N somewhere else.

Also, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.

For my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.

Common English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Letters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.

Potential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

First, let's think about possible words with A and N.

A is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.

In ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let's see the word structure.

As of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.

Now, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.

Also, since it's a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.

Let me brainstorm some words with A and N.

Examples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.

Or ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.

But let's check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn't have R, which is good.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.

Positions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

But from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.

Yes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.

In ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it's fine because I can still get information about other letters.

Perhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.

Similarly for N, not at position 4.

In ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.

But I can use ""plant"" to confirm.

Another word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.

A at position 3? Same as above.

Position 3 is often problematic.

What about words where A is at position 1 or 2?

For example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.

R is out, so words with R are bad.

""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.

In feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.

Letters to avoid: C, R, E.

So ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that's not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.

But I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn't be at 3, N shouldn't be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.

The feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.

Another idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.

What words start with A and contain N?

""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T

Positions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5

But N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.

Similarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.

""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.

And no C,R,E.

Similarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.

""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.

Letters: A,N,V,I,L.

I could use.

But ""angst"" seems good: common word.

Another option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.

""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.

Possible.

But I think ""angst"" is fine.

With ""angst"":
- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -
- Position 2: N, similarly
- Etc.

If secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.

But since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.

Similarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.

To maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.

In ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E

Present: A,N

Absent: C,R,E

New letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.

For ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.

Also, A and N are included.

Positions in ""angst"":
- A at position 1
- N at position 2
- G at position 3
- S at position 4
- T at position 5

Now, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.

N cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn't tested before.

Previous guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.

Now N at position 2, which could be correct or not.

Similarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.

Position 4 had N before, now S is there.

Position 5 had E, now T.

I think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.

But let's see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.

Another common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N

Positions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5

But A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I'll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.

Similarly, N at position 5, which is new.

Position 5 had E, which is out, so new.

In ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).

But A at 3 is redundant because we know it's wrong.

So I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.

Similarly for N at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.

Similarly, N at position 4.

So ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.

""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.

E absent, so not good.

""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.

""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn't say anything about multiple letters.

In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.

But in feedback, I need to be careful.

For example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.

But here, ""crane"" had single letters.

Perhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.

But not necessary.

However for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.

A,N,G,S,T all distinct.

Good.

Another word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.

""angst"" is better.

Or ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.

In ""stand"", A at 3.

Similarly ""land"" is 4 letters.

""brand"" has R, out.

So probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.

""abide"" has I,E? E out.

""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.

But double K, messy.

Perhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.

E is not in word.

Letters to use: avoid C,R,E.

Vowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.

So ""angst"" seems fine.

I'll go with ""angst"".

But let's confirm the word.

""angst"" is a valid word.

In feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.

If A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -

Similarly for others.

Also, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.

Perfect.

So my second guess: angst.<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C(x): C is not in the secret word.
- R(x): R is not in the secret word.
- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

This gives us:
- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.
- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).
- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren't). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.
- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.

For the second guess:
- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.
- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.
- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it's incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.
- A good choice is ""angst"": 
  - It contains A and N.
  - Avoids C, R, E.
  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.
  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.
  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.
  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.

Alternatives considered: 
- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). 
- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). 
- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  
""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.

<guess>angst</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got '-').
- G, S, T are not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T
- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don't know their positions yet)

From the feedback:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5

But note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list the available positions:

Position 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)
Position 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)
Position 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)
Position 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)
Position 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.

So the word must have:
- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven't tested, but we have constraints)
Actually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.

Similarly for other positions.

But we know A and N must be placed in the word.

Let me denote the positions:

Let P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.

Constraints:
- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).
- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.
- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.
- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.
- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.

But we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.

Also, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.

Alphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.

Possible cases:

Case 1: N is at position 1.
Then A must be at position 2,4, or 5.

But if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.

Similarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.

But A must be somewhere.

Similarly, other cases.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.

For example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let's see:

If we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:
P1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)
P4: new letter
P5: new letter

But we need to form a word.

Similarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.

List of possible words:

- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.

Examples:
- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let's see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can't use E, but ""nappy"" doesn't have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.

But we have double P, which might be okay.

But let's see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.

""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.

But A is already present, so double A might be possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.

""naked"" has E and D? E is out.

""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let's see other options.

Another: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.

Similarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.

So for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.

Similarly, other cases.

Now, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.

For example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.

""banjo"" is a word.

Similarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.

N at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.

""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.

Tricky.

Now, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.

For example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.

N at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't.

In ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""chain"" has C, out.

""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.

So difficult.

Therefore, the easier cases are:

- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""
- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates
- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""

Also, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can't both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.

So impossible.

Therefore, let's list possible words:

1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.

2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.

3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don't know if secret has double A.

4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.

To get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.

""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.

If N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly for A at P4.

In ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Which one to choose?

We also need to consider common letters.

Available common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.

""nomad"" has O, M, D.

""banjo"" has B, J, O.

J is less common.

Perhaps ""nomad"" is better.

Another word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.

""nodal"" is a word.

Similarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.

""focal"" has C.

So ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".

But ""nomad"" might be more common.

We could test if N is at P1.

If we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.

Similarly for A at P4.

Also, we get info on O, M, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Now, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.

By guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.

Similarly for N at P3.

But let's see which positions are more likely.

Since P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.

But to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.

P2 and P3 are middle positions.

In ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.

But let's choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.

But J is not very common, so maybe not.

Another word: ""manor"" has R, out.

""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.

""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.

""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.

""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn't have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.

The guess must include both A and N because they are present.

So we cannot guess a word without A or without N.

Therefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, we must have both.

So back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".

Another word: ""anode"" has E, out.

""alone"" has E, out.

""algin"" not common.

""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.

So invalid.

""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.

""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.

Similarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.

A at P2, N at P3, both allowed.

And letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.

So ""handy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.

Or ""candy"" has C, out.

So ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".

""handy"" is common.

With ""handy"":
- P1: H (new)
- P2: A (test if A is at P2)
- P3: N (test if N is at P3)
- P4: D (new)
- P5: Y (new)

If A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).

Similarly for N at P3.

This will give good information.

Compared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.

""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

""bandy"" is similar.

I think ""handy"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.

If not, we know where they are not.

Also, we learn about H, D, Y.

Since we have limited letters left, we might solve it.

Another word: ""panic"" has C, out.

""manic"" has C.

""lapin"" not common.

So I think ""handy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  
    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  
- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  
- **Position Constraints for A:**  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for N:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Available Positions Summary:**  
  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  
- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  
- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  
  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  
- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  
  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  
  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  
  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  
- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  

### Why ""handy""?
- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  
- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n   - It has \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\' — all fairly common.\n   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.\n\n Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.\n\nThe first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:\n- C: x → C is not in the secret word.\n- R: x → R is not in the secret word.\n- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.\n- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.\n- E: x → E is not in the secret word.\n\nSo, from this, I know:\n- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.\n- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with \'-\', they are in the wrong position.\n\nIn ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they\'re not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let\'s list the positions:\n- Position 1: C (but C is out)\n- Position 2: R (out)\n- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)\n- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)\n- Position 5: E (out)\n\nTherefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.\n\nThe word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.\n\nAvailable positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:\n- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.\n- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.\nSimilarly for position 2 and 5.\n\nSo A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn\'t affect the position availability for A directly.\n\nI need to think about where A and N can be.\n\nThe secret word contains A and N somewhere else.\n\nAlso, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.\n\nFor my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.\n\nMoreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.\n\nLetters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.\n\nPotential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nFirst, let\'s think about possible words with A and N.\n\nA is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.\n\nIn ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let\'s see the word structure.\n\nAs of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.\n\nNow, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.\n\nAlso, since it\'s a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words with A and N.\n\nExamples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.\n\nOr ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn\'t have R, which is good.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.\n\nPositions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nBut from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.\n\nYes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.\n\nIn ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it\'s fine because I can still get information about other letters.\n\nPerhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.\n\nSimilarly for N, not at position 4.\n\nIn ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.\n\nBut I can use ""plant"" to confirm.\n\nAnother word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.\n\nA at position 3? Same as above.\n\nPosition 3 is often problematic.\n\nWhat about words where A is at position 1 or 2?\n\nFor example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.\n\nR is out, so words with R are bad.\n\n""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.\n\nIn feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, E.\n\nSo ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that\'s not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.\n\nBut I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn\'t be at 3, N shouldn\'t be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.\n\nThe feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.\n\nAnother idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.\n\nWhat words start with A and contain N?\n\n""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T\n\nPositions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5\n\nBut N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.\n\n""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.\n\nAnd no C,R,E.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.\n\n""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.\n\nLetters: A,N,V,I,L.\n\nI could use.\n\nBut ""angst"" seems good: common word.\n\nAnother option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.\n\n""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.\n\nPossible.\n\nBut I think ""angst"" is fine.\n\nWith ""angst"":\n- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -\n- Position 2: N, similarly\n- Etc.\n\nIf secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.\n\nBut since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.\n\nTo maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.\n\nSo letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\n\nPresent: A,N\n\nAbsent: C,R,E\n\nNew letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.\n\nFor ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.\n\nAlso, A and N are included.\n\nPositions in ""angst"":\n- A at position 1\n- N at position 2\n- G at position 3\n- S at position 4\n- T at position 5\n\nNow, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.\n\nN cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn\'t tested before.\n\nPrevious guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.\n\nNow N at position 2, which could be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.\n\nPosition 4 had N before, now S is there.\n\nPosition 5 had E, now T.\n\nI think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N\n\nPositions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5\n\nBut A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I\'ll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 5, which is new.\n\nPosition 5 had E, which is out, so new.\n\nIn ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).\n\nBut A at 3 is redundant because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly for N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 4.\n\nSo ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.\n\n""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.\n\nE absent, so not good.\n\n""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.\n\n""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple letters.\n\nIn Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.\n\nBut in feedback, I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.\n\nBut here, ""crane"" had single letters.\n\nPerhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nHowever for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.\n\nA,N,G,S,T all distinct.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.\n\n""angst"" is better.\n\nOr ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.\n\nIn ""stand"", A at 3.\n\nSimilarly ""land"" is 4 letters.\n\n""brand"" has R, out.\n\nSo probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.\n\n""abide"" has I,E? E out.\n\n""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.\n\nBut double K, messy.\n\nPerhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.\n\nE is not in word.\n\nLetters to use: avoid C,R,E.\n\nVowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.\n\nConsonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.\n\nSo ""angst"" seems fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""angst"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word.\n\n""angst"" is a valid word.\n\nIn feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.\n\nIf A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo my second guess: angst.<thoughts>\nFrom the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:\n- C(x): C is not in the secret word.\n- R(x): R is not in the secret word.\n- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- E(x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nThis gives us:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.\n- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).\n- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren\'t). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.\n- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.\n- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.\n- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it\'s incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.\n- A good choice is ""angst"": \n  - It contains A and N.\n  - Avoids C, R, E.\n  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.\n  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.\n  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.\n  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.\n\nAlternatives considered: \n- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). \n- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). \n- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  \n""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>angst</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got \'-\').\n- G, S, T are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T\n- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don\'t know their positions yet)\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.\n\nWe need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for A: 2,4,5\nPossible positions for N: 1,3,5\n\nBut note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.\n\nBut let\'s list the available positions:\n\nPosition 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)\nPosition 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)\nPosition 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)\nPosition 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)\nPosition 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.\n\nSo the word must have:\n- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven\'t tested, but we have constraints)\nActually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut we know A and N must be placed in the word.\n\nLet me denote the positions:\n\nLet P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.\n\nConstraints:\n- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).\n- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.\n- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.\n- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.\n- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.\n\nBut we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.\n\nAlso, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.\n\nAlphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: N is at position 1.\nThen A must be at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nBut if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.\n\nSimilarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.\n\nBut A must be somewhere.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.\n\nFor example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let\'s see:\n\nIf we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:\nP1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)\nP4: new letter\nP5: new letter\n\nBut we need to form a word.\n\nSimilarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.\n\nBut let\'s think of actual words.\n\nWe need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.\n\nList of possible words:\n\n- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.\n\nExamples:\n- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let\'s see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can\'t use E, but ""nappy"" doesn\'t have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.\n\nBut we have double P, which might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.\n\n""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.\n\nBut A is already present, so double A might be possible.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.\n\n""naked"" has E and D? E is out.\n\n""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let\'s see other options.\n\nAnother: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.\n\nSo for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nNow, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.\n\nFor example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.\n\n""banjo"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.\n\nN at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.\n\n""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.\n\nTricky.\n\nNow, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.\n\nFor example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.\n\nN at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t.\n\nIn ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""chain"" has C, out.\n\n""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.\n\nSo difficult.\n\nTherefore, the easier cases are:\n\n- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""\n- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates\n- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""\n\nAlso, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can\'t both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, let\'s list possible words:\n\n1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.\n\n2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.\n\n3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don\'t know if secret has double A.\n\n4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.\n\nTo get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.\n\n""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.\n\nIf N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.\n\nSimilarly for A at P4.\n\nIn ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe also need to consider common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.\n\n""nomad"" has O, M, D.\n\n""banjo"" has B, J, O.\n\nJ is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""nomad"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.\n\n""nodal"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.\n\n""focal"" has C.\n\nSo ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".\n\nBut ""nomad"" might be more common.\n\nWe could test if N is at P1.\n\nIf we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.\n\nSimilarly for A at P4.\n\nAlso, we get info on O, M, D.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.\n\nNow, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.\n\nSimilarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.\n\nBy guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.\n\nSimilarly for N at P3.\n\nBut let\'s see which positions are more likely.\n\nSince P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.\n\nBut to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.\n\nP2 and P3 are middle positions.\n\nIn ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.\n\nBut J is not very common, so maybe not.\n\nAnother word: ""manor"" has R, out.\n\n""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.\n\n""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.\n\n""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.\n\n""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.\n\n""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn\'t have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.\n\nThe guess must include both A and N because they are present.\n\nSo we cannot guess a word without A or without N.\n\nTherefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.\n\nSimilarly, we must have both.\n\nSo back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".\n\nAnother word: ""anode"" has E, out.\n\n""alone"" has E, out.\n\n""algin"" not common.\n\n""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.\n\n""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.\n\nA at P2, N at P3, both allowed.\n\nAnd letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.\n\nSo ""handy"" is a good option.\n\nSimilarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.\n\nOr ""candy"" has C, out.\n\nSo ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".\n\n""handy"" is common.\n\nWith ""handy"":\n- P1: H (new)\n- P2: A (test if A is at P2)\n- P3: N (test if N is at P3)\n- P4: D (new)\n- P5: Y (new)\n\nIf A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it\'s elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).\n\nSimilarly for N at P3.\n\nThis will give good information.\n\nCompared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.\n\n""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.\n\n""bandy"" is similar.\n\nI think ""handy"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.\n\nIf not, we know where they are not.\n\nAlso, we learn about H, D, Y.\n\nSince we have limited letters left, we might solve it.\n\nAnother word: ""panic"" has C, out.\n\n""manic"" has C.\n\n""lapin"" not common.\n\nSo I think ""handy"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  \n  - This means:  \n    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  \n    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  \n    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  \n  - This means:  \n    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  \n    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  \n    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  \n- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  \n- **Position Constraints for A:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  \n  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  \n  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  \n- **Position Constraints for N:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  \n  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  \n  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n- **Available Positions Summary:**  \n  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  \n- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  \n- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  \n- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  \n  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  \n  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  \n- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  \n  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  \n  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  \n  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  \n- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  \n\n### Why ""handy""?\n- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  \n- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  \n- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  \n- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>handy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 3
- N(-): N in word, not position 4
- E(x): E not in word

Guess 2: ""angst""
- A(-): A in word, not position 1
- N(-): N in word, not position 2
- G(x): G not in word
- S(x): S not in word
- T(x): T not in word

Guess 3: ""handy""
- H(x): H not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 2 (since we guessed A at position 2)
- N(✓): N is in word and correct at position 3 (since N was guessed at position 3 and got ✓)
- D(x): D not in word
- Y(x): Y not in word

So now we know:

1. N is at position 3! Because we got ✓ for N at position 3.

2. A is present but not at position 1 (from guess2), not at position 2 (from guess3), and not at position 3 (from guess1, and position 3 is taken by N now). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.

3. Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y. So absent: C, D, E, G, H, R, S, T, Y.

4. Letters that must be present: A and N (but N is placed at position 3). So A is still unplaced, but in the word.

5. Since ""handy"" had A at position 2 and we got ""-"" meaning A is not at position 2, and position 3 is N, so for A, positions 4 and 5 are possibilities.

6. We also know that N is fixed at position 3.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4 or 5: A
- The other positions: two or three other letters? Since word is 5 letters: position 1,2,4,5 to be filled but position 4 or 5 is A.

Also, absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y.

Available letters: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But A and N are already used? N is used but fixed at position 3. We might have other instances? But so far, no duplicates.

We need to place A at position 4 or 5, and the other positions must be letters from the available set.

But note, the word must contain only A and N as known letters? Not necessarily, there might be additional letters.

In ""handy"", we only know about A and N being present, but H,D,Y are out. And from previous, C,R,E,G,S,T are out.

So the word has N at position 3, A at either position 4 or 5, and positions 1,2, and the other of 4/5 must have new letters.

Specifically:
- If A is at position 4, then positions 1,2,5 are new letters (but one of them is A? No), A is at 4, so pos 1,2,5 are non-A, non-N? But A is only one? Not necessarily, but for now.

But we have limited absent letters.

Let me list the secret word structure:
Pos1: ? (not absent)
Pos2: ? (not absent)
Pos3: N (fixed)
Pos4: A or a new letter
Pos5: if pos4 is A, then pos5 is new; if pos4 is not A, then A must be at pos5.

Since A must be at pos4 or pos5, we have two cases.

Also, note that in positions 1,2, the letters cannot be A because if A were at position 1 or 2, we would have it, but we know A is not at pos1 or pos2.

Similarly, position 3 is N, so not A.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 must not be A.

So for pos4 and pos5: one of them is A, the other is a new letter or possibly N but N is at pos3.

Now, we need to guess a word that has N at position 3, and includes A at position 4 or 5.

Also, avoid absent letters.

First, let's see if we can guess a word with A at position 4 or 5.

Possible words:

If A at position 4: then word pattern _ _ N A _

If A at position 5: then word pattern _ _ N _ A

We need to fill the blanks with letters not absent.

Absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y

So available: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

But N is already at pos3, so we can use other letters.

For example, with A at position 4: _ _ N A _

Fill positions 1,2,5 with available letters.

Similarly for the other pattern.

Since we are in guess 4, we need to be efficient.

To test both possibilities, we can guess a word that covers both cases.

Or choose one.

But let's see common words.

For pattern _ _ N A _, words like ""final"" but E? ""final"" has F,I,N,A,L -> but L? And E not present.

""final"": F at pos1, I at pos2, N at pos3, A at pos4, L at pos5.

Letters absent? C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y: none of these in ""final"", so okay.

Similarly, ""mina"" not 5 letters.

""pinna"" has N,N? Double.

""viral"" has R, absent.

""jural"" not common.

""focal"" has C, absent.

So ""final"" is possible.

But ""final"" has I and L.

Another: ""binal"" not common.

""kinas"" has S, absent.

So ""final"" might work.

Now pattern _ _ N _ A: e.g., ""linen"" has E and N? E absent. ""tonal"" has T,O? T absent. ""canon"" has C, absent.

""bonus"" has S, absent.

""focus"" has C, absent.

""labor"" has R, absent.

""manor"" has R, absent.

""minor"" has R, absent.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> but A at position 4? ""piano"": P at1, I at2, A at3, N at4, O at5? But N is at position 3? In this pattern, if we want A at pos5, then ""piano"" has A at pos3 which we know is invalid, and we are considering A at pos5.

We need words ending with A.

E.g., ""pizza"" has Z,A, but Z,Z? and no N? Must have N at pos3.

""arena"" has R, absent.

""atone"" has R? ""atone"": A,T,O,N,E -> T and E absent.

""china"" has C, absent.

""tibia"" same.

Words like ""ultra"" has T,U,L,T,R but T and R absent, and no N.

We need N at position 3, so letter at pos3 must be N.

For pattern _ _ N _ A: examples with available letters.

E.g., ""benna"" has E? ""gamma"" double M, no N.

""inula"" not common.

""lemma"" no N.

""prima"" has R.

Perhaps few common words ending with A and N at position 3.

""minus"" has S, absent.

Therefore, words with A at position 5 might be less common. So likely A is at position 4.

That is, the word is _ _ N A _

Now, positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Common words: ""final"" as I said.

But what about position 5? In ""final"" it's L.

Other words: ""vinal"" not common.

""final"" might be the most common.

""minbar"" too long.

""pinna"" is P,I,N,N,A but double N and A at end? ""pinna"": P1:P, P2:I, P3:N, P4:N, P5:A? But we have N at pos3 and pos4? Possible, but not necessarily.

In our case, secret has N at pos3, so for ""pinna"", P3 and P4 are both N, but secret only confirmed N at pos3? We don't know if there is another N.

But ""pinna"" might be acceptable.

But let's stick to ""final"".

Another word: ""linac"" has C, absent.

""binal"" not common.

""fiord"" has D? D is absent? From handy, D(x), so D absent.

In ""final"", D not present.

Absent: D is one, so in ""final"", letters F,I,N,A,L: none absent.

Similarly, other words: ""omega"" has E,G, absent.

""opera"" has O,P,E,R? E and R absent.

So ""final"" is good.

To test position 5, we can guess ""final"" and if A is at position 4, we might get ✓ for A if correct.

Even if not, we learn.

Since we have only two possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We can also guess a word that has A at position 4 or 5.

But let's see.

First, if we guess ""final"":
- P1: F
- P2: I
- P3: N (fixed, should be ✓)
- P4: A
- P5: L

If in secret, A is at position 4, then we get ✓ for A at position 4, and we might solve the word.

If secret A is at position 5, then for A at position 4, we get ""-"" meaning A is present but not at position 4, so we then know A must be at position 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on F,I,L.

But it might take another guess.

We could guess a word that has A at position 5 to test.

For pattern _ _ N _ A, and position 3: N.

What 5-letter words end with A and have N at position 3?

E.g., ""arena"" has R.

""china"" has C.

""tuna"" too short.

""donna"" has D, absent.

""manna"" has M,A,N,N,A -> but D absent? M is available.

""manna"": M,A,N,N,A? P1:M, P2:A? But A cannot be at position 2? We know A not at pos2.

""manna"" would have A at pos2 and pos5, but pos2 is invalid.

Similarly, other words.

""umbra"" has M,B,R,U,A? R absent.

Perhaps no common word.

""inertia"" too long.

So practical to assume A is at position 4.

Therefore, I'll guess ""final"".

But in ""final"", position 2 is I, which might be anything.

Another word: ""vinAl"" not, or ""winAl"" not.

""final"" or ""binal"".

""final"" is fine.

But we have position 1 and 2 to fill.

In guess 3, ""handy"" had H(x), A(-) at pos2, N(✓) at pos3, D(x), Y(x).

So we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

And we know A is at pos4 or pos5; in ""final"", we put A at pos4.

But if we are wrong, A at pos5, then in secret, position 4 is not A.

But we can guess.

To cover both, but I think it's unlikely since few words with A at pos5.

Another idea: guess a word with A at position 5.

For example, ""column"" but N? ""column"": C,O,L,U,M,N -> C absent, and N at end, not pos3.

""human"" not 5 letters.

""assai"" no N.

Perhaps ""ultra"" no N.

Words like ""organ"" has G, absent.

So maybe not.

Stick with ""final"".

Thus, next guess: ""final"". It has N at position 3 and A at position 4, which is possible, and we test.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Recap Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 ( ""crane"" ):** C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent letters: C, R, E  
     - A present, but not at position 3  
     - N present, but not at position 4
   - **Guess 2 ( ""angst"" ):** A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  
     - Absent letters: G, S, T  
     - A present, but not at position 1 (since guessed at pos 1)  
     - N present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)
   - **Guess 3 ( ""handy"" ):** H(x), A(-), N(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - Absent letters: H, D, Y  
     - A present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)  
     - N correct at position 3 (✓ confirmation)

2. **Deductions:**
   - **N is fixed at position 3** (from Guess 3 ✓ feedback).
   - **A must be in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **Cumulative absent letters:** C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y → Avoid these letters.
   - **Present letters:** Only A and N confirmed so far (with N at position 3). Since A is not at positions 1–3, it must be at 4 or 5.
   - **Other positions:** Positions 1, 2, and the non-A position (either 4 or 5) must be filled with new letters not in the absent list. Available letters: B, F, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**
   - Must place N at position 3 (known correct).
   - Must include A at either position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Choose a word with common letters to maximize information on positions 1, 2, and the variable position (4 or 5), while avoiding absent letters.
   - Words ending in A are less common (e.g., minimal valid options like ""fjord"" has D absent, ""vinyl"" has Y absent). Thus, prioritize A at position 4 for higher-probability words.
   - ""final"" (F, I, N, A, L) fits well:
     - N at position 3 (fixed ✓).
     - A at position 4 (test if A is here).
     - Positions 1, 2, and 5 filled with F, I, L (new letters, not absent).
     - If feedback for A is ✓, it solves position 4. If A is ""-"", then A must be at position 5 (and position 4 would be incorrect in this guess).
   - Alternatives like ""binal"" (less common) or ""vinal"" (rare) were considered, but ""final"" uses common letters and follows constraints.

### Response:
<guess>final</guess>",final,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 3
- N(-): N in word, not position 4
- E(x): E not in word

Guess 2: ""angst""
- A(-): A in word, not position 1
- N(-): N in word, not position 2
- G(x): G not in word
- S(x): S not in word
- T(x): T not in word

Guess 3: ""handy""
- H(x): H not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 2 (since we guessed A at position 2)
- N(✓): N is in word and correct at position 3 (since N was guessed at position 3 and got ✓)
- D(x): D not in word
- Y(x): Y not in word

So now we know:

1. N is at position 3! Because we got ✓ for N at position 3.

2. A is present but not at position 1 (from guess2), not at position 2 (from guess3), and not at position 3 (from guess1, and position 3 is taken by N now). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.

3. Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y. So absent: C, D, E, G, H, R, S, T, Y.

4. Letters that must be present: A and N (but N is placed at position 3). So A is still unplaced, but in the word.

5. Since ""handy"" had A at position 2 and we got ""-"" meaning A is not at position 2, and position 3 is N, so for A, positions 4 and 5 are possibilities.

6. We also know that N is fixed at position 3.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4 or 5: A
- The other positions: two or three other letters? Since word is 5 letters: position 1,2,4,5 to be filled but position 4 or 5 is A.

Also, absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y.

Available letters: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But A and N are already used? N is used but fixed at position 3. We might have other instances? But so far, no duplicates.

We need to place A at position 4 or 5, and the other positions must be letters from the available set.

But note, the word must contain only A and N as known letters? Not necessarily, there might be additional letters.

In ""handy"", we only know about A and N being present, but H,D,Y are out. And from previous, C,R,E,G,S,T are out.

So the word has N at position 3, A at either position 4 or 5, and positions 1,2, and the other of 4/5 must have new letters.

Specifically:
- If A is at position 4, then positions 1,2,5 are new letters (but one of them is A? No), A is at 4, so pos 1,2,5 are non-A, non-N? But A is only one? Not necessarily, but for now.

But we have limited absent letters.

Let me list the secret word structure:
Pos1: ? (not absent)
Pos2: ? (not absent)
Pos3: N (fixed)
Pos4: A or a new letter
Pos5: if pos4 is A, then pos5 is new; if pos4 is not A, then A must be at pos5.

Since A must be at pos4 or pos5, we have two cases.

Also, note that in positions 1,2, the letters cannot be A because if A were at position 1 or 2, we would have it, but we know A is not at pos1 or pos2.

Similarly, position 3 is N, so not A.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 must not be A.

So for pos4 and pos5: one of them is A, the other is a new letter or possibly N but N is at pos3.

Now, we need to guess a word that has N at position 3, and includes A at position 4 or 5.

Also, avoid absent letters.

First, let's see if we can guess a word with A at position 4 or 5.

Possible words:

If A at position 4: then word pattern _ _ N A _

If A at position 5: then word pattern _ _ N _ A

We need to fill the blanks with letters not absent.

Absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y

So available: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

But N is already at pos3, so we can use other letters.

For example, with A at position 4: _ _ N A _

Fill positions 1,2,5 with available letters.

Similarly for the other pattern.

Since we are in guess 4, we need to be efficient.

To test both possibilities, we can guess a word that covers both cases.

Or choose one.

But let's see common words.

For pattern _ _ N A _, words like ""final"" but E? ""final"" has F,I,N,A,L -> but L? And E not present.

""final"": F at pos1, I at pos2, N at pos3, A at pos4, L at pos5.

Letters absent? C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y: none of these in ""final"", so okay.

Similarly, ""mina"" not 5 letters.

""pinna"" has N,N? Double.

""viral"" has R, absent.

""jural"" not common.

""focal"" has C, absent.

So ""final"" is possible.

But ""final"" has I and L.

Another: ""binal"" not common.

""kinas"" has S, absent.

So ""final"" might work.

Now pattern _ _ N _ A: e.g., ""linen"" has E and N? E absent. ""tonal"" has T,O? T absent. ""canon"" has C, absent.

""bonus"" has S, absent.

""focus"" has C, absent.

""labor"" has R, absent.

""manor"" has R, absent.

""minor"" has R, absent.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> but A at position 4? ""piano"": P at1, I at2, A at3, N at4, O at5? But N is at position 3? In this pattern, if we want A at pos5, then ""piano"" has A at pos3 which we know is invalid, and we are considering A at pos5.

We need words ending with A.

E.g., ""pizza"" has Z,A, but Z,Z? and no N? Must have N at pos3.

""arena"" has R, absent.

""atone"" has R? ""atone"": A,T,O,N,E -> T and E absent.

""china"" has C, absent.

""tibia"" same.

Words like ""ultra"" has T,U,L,T,R but T and R absent, and no N.

We need N at position 3, so letter at pos3 must be N.

For pattern _ _ N _ A: examples with available letters.

E.g., ""benna"" has E? ""gamma"" double M, no N.

""inula"" not common.

""lemma"" no N.

""prima"" has R.

Perhaps few common words ending with A and N at position 3.

""minus"" has S, absent.

Therefore, words with A at position 5 might be less common. So likely A is at position 4.

That is, the word is _ _ N A _

Now, positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Common words: ""final"" as I said.

But what about position 5? In ""final"" it's L.

Other words: ""vinal"" not common.

""final"" might be the most common.

""minbar"" too long.

""pinna"" is P,I,N,N,A but double N and A at end? ""pinna"": P1:P, P2:I, P3:N, P4:N, P5:A? But we have N at pos3 and pos4? Possible, but not necessarily.

In our case, secret has N at pos3, so for ""pinna"", P3 and P4 are both N, but secret only confirmed N at pos3? We don't know if there is another N.

But ""pinna"" might be acceptable.

But let's stick to ""final"".

Another word: ""linac"" has C, absent.

""binal"" not common.

""fiord"" has D? D is absent? From handy, D(x), so D absent.

In ""final"", D not present.

Absent: D is one, so in ""final"", letters F,I,N,A,L: none absent.

Similarly, other words: ""omega"" has E,G, absent.

""opera"" has O,P,E,R? E and R absent.

So ""final"" is good.

To test position 5, we can guess ""final"" and if A is at position 4, we might get ✓ for A if correct.

Even if not, we learn.

Since we have only two possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We can also guess a word that has A at position 4 or 5.

But let's see.

First, if we guess ""final"":
- P1: F
- P2: I
- P3: N (fixed, should be ✓)
- P4: A
- P5: L

If in secret, A is at position 4, then we get ✓ for A at position 4, and we might solve the word.

If secret A is at position 5, then for A at position 4, we get ""-"" meaning A is present but not at position 4, so we then know A must be at position 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on F,I,L.

But it might take another guess.

We could guess a word that has A at position 5 to test.

For pattern _ _ N _ A, and position 3: N.

What 5-letter words end with A and have N at position 3?

E.g., ""arena"" has R.

""china"" has C.

""tuna"" too short.

""donna"" has D, absent.

""manna"" has M,A,N,N,A -> but D absent? M is available.

""manna"": M,A,N,N,A? P1:M, P2:A? But A cannot be at position 2? We know A not at pos2.

""manna"" would have A at pos2 and pos5, but pos2 is invalid.

Similarly, other words.

""umbra"" has M,B,R,U,A? R absent.

Perhaps no common word.

""inertia"" too long.

So practical to assume A is at position 4.

Therefore, I'll guess ""final"".

But in ""final"", position 2 is I, which might be anything.

Another word: ""vinAl"" not, or ""winAl"" not.

""final"" or ""binal"".

""final"" is fine.

But we have position 1 and 2 to fill.

In guess 3, ""handy"" had H(x), A(-) at pos2, N(✓) at pos3, D(x), Y(x).

So we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

And we know A is at pos4 or pos5; in ""final"", we put A at pos4.

But if we are wrong, A at pos5, then in secret, position 4 is not A.

But we can guess.

To cover both, but I think it's unlikely since few words with A at pos5.

Another idea: guess a word with A at position 5.

For example, ""column"" but N? ""column"": C,O,L,U,M,N -> C absent, and N at end, not pos3.

""human"" not 5 letters.

""assai"" no N.

Perhaps ""ultra"" no N.

Words like ""organ"" has G, absent.

So maybe not.

Stick with ""final"".

Thus, next guess: ""final"". It has N at position 3 and A at position 4, which is possible, and we test.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Recap Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 ( ""crane"" ):** C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent letters: C, R, E  
     - A present, but not at position 3  
     - N present, but not at position 4
   - **Guess 2 ( ""angst"" ):** A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  
     - Absent letters: G, S, T  
     - A present, but not at position 1 (since guessed at pos 1)  
     - N present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)
   - **Guess 3 ( ""handy"" ):** H(x), A(-), N(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - Absent letters: H, D, Y  
     - A present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)  
     - N correct at position 3 (✓ confirmation)

2. **Deductions:**
   - **N is fixed at position 3** (from Guess 3 ✓ feedback).
   - **A must be in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **Cumulative absent letters:** C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y → Avoid these letters.
   - **Present letters:** Only A and N confirmed so far (with N at position 3). Since A is not at positions 1–3, it must be at 4 or 5.
   - **Other positions:** Positions 1, 2, and the non-A position (either 4 or 5) must be filled with new letters not in the absent list. Available letters: B, F, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**
   - Must place N at position 3 (known correct).
   - Must include A at either position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Choose a word with common letters to maximize information on positions 1, 2, and the variable position (4 or 5), while avoiding absent letters.
   - Words ending in A are less common (e.g., minimal valid options like ""fjord"" has D absent, ""vinyl"" has Y absent). Thus, prioritize A at position 4 for higher-probability words.
   - ""final"" (F, I, N, A, L) fits well:
     - N at position 3 (fixed ✓).
     - A at position 4 (test if A is here).
     - Positions 1, 2, and 5 filled with F, I, L (new letters, not absent).
     - If feedback for A is ✓, it solves position 4. If A is ""-"", then A must be at position 5 (and position 4 would be incorrect in this guess).
   - Alternatives like ""binal"" (less common) or ""vinal"" (rare) were considered, but ""final"" uses common letters and follows constraints.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,ZONAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.

 Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.

The first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x → C is not in the secret word.
- R: x → R is not in the secret word.
- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- E: x → E is not in the secret word.

So, from this, I know:
- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.
- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with '-', they are in the wrong position.

In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they're not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

The secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let's list the positions:
- Position 1: C (but C is out)
- Position 2: R (out)
- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)
- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)
- Position 5: E (out)

Therefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.

The word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:
- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.
- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.
Similarly for position 2 and 5.

So A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn't affect the position availability for A directly.

I need to think about where A and N can be.

The secret word contains A and N somewhere else.

Also, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.

For my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.

Common English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Letters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.

Potential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

First, let's think about possible words with A and N.

A is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.

In ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let's see the word structure.

As of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.

Now, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.

Also, since it's a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.

Let me brainstorm some words with A and N.

Examples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.

Or ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.

But let's check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn't have R, which is good.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.

Positions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

But from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.

Yes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.

In ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it's fine because I can still get information about other letters.

Perhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.

Similarly for N, not at position 4.

In ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.

But I can use ""plant"" to confirm.

Another word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.

A at position 3? Same as above.

Position 3 is often problematic.

What about words where A is at position 1 or 2?

For example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.

R is out, so words with R are bad.

""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.

In feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.

Letters to avoid: C, R, E.

So ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that's not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.

But I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn't be at 3, N shouldn't be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.

The feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.

Another idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.

What words start with A and contain N?

""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T

Positions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5

But N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.

Similarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.

""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.

And no C,R,E.

Similarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.

""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.

Letters: A,N,V,I,L.

I could use.

But ""angst"" seems good: common word.

Another option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.

""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.

Possible.

But I think ""angst"" is fine.

With ""angst"":
- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -
- Position 2: N, similarly
- Etc.

If secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.

But since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.

Similarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.

To maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.

In ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E

Present: A,N

Absent: C,R,E

New letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.

For ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.

Also, A and N are included.

Positions in ""angst"":
- A at position 1
- N at position 2
- G at position 3
- S at position 4
- T at position 5

Now, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.

N cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn't tested before.

Previous guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.

Now N at position 2, which could be correct or not.

Similarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.

Position 4 had N before, now S is there.

Position 5 had E, now T.

I think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.

But let's see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.

Another common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N

Positions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5

But A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I'll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.

Similarly, N at position 5, which is new.

Position 5 had E, which is out, so new.

In ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).

But A at 3 is redundant because we know it's wrong.

So I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.

Similarly for N at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.

Similarly, N at position 4.

So ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.

""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.

E absent, so not good.

""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.

""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn't say anything about multiple letters.

In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.

But in feedback, I need to be careful.

For example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.

But here, ""crane"" had single letters.

Perhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.

But not necessary.

However for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.

A,N,G,S,T all distinct.

Good.

Another word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.

""angst"" is better.

Or ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.

In ""stand"", A at 3.

Similarly ""land"" is 4 letters.

""brand"" has R, out.

So probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.

""abide"" has I,E? E out.

""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.

But double K, messy.

Perhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.

E is not in word.

Letters to use: avoid C,R,E.

Vowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.

So ""angst"" seems fine.

I'll go with ""angst"".

But let's confirm the word.

""angst"" is a valid word.

In feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.

If A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -

Similarly for others.

Also, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.

Perfect.

So my second guess: angst.<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C(x): C is not in the secret word.
- R(x): R is not in the secret word.
- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

This gives us:
- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.
- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).
- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren't). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.
- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.

For the second guess:
- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.
- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.
- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it's incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.
- A good choice is ""angst"": 
  - It contains A and N.
  - Avoids C, R, E.
  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.
  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.
  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.
  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.

Alternatives considered: 
- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). 
- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). 
- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  
""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T
- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don't know their positions yet)

From the feedback:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5

But note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list the available positions:

Position 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)
Position 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)
Position 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)
Position 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)
Position 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.

So the word must have:
- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven't tested, but we have constraints)
Actually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.

Similarly for other positions.

But we know A and N must be placed in the word.

Let me denote the positions:

Let P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.

Constraints:
- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).
- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.
- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.
- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.
- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.

But we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.

Also, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.

Alphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.

Possible cases:

Case 1: N is at position 1.
Then A must be at position 2,4, or 5.

But if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.

Similarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.

But A must be somewhere.

Similarly, other cases.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.

For example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let's see:

If we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:
P1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)
P4: new letter
P5: new letter

But we need to form a word.

Similarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.

List of possible words:

- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.

Examples:
- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let's see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can't use E, but ""nappy"" doesn't have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.

But we have double P, which might be okay.

But let's see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.

""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.

But A is already present, so double A might be possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.

""naked"" has E and D? E is out.

""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let's see other options.

Another: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.

Similarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.

So for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.

Similarly, other cases.

Now, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.

For example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.

""banjo"" is a word.

Similarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.

N at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.

""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.

Tricky.

Now, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.

For example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.

N at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't.

In ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""chain"" has C, out.

""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.

So difficult.

Therefore, the easier cases are:

- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""
- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates
- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""

Also, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can't both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.

So impossible.

Therefore, let's list possible words:

1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.

2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.

3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don't know if secret has double A.

4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.

To get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.

""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.

If N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly for A at P4.

In ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Which one to choose?

We also need to consider common letters.

Available common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.

""nomad"" has O, M, D.

""banjo"" has B, J, O.

J is less common.

Perhaps ""nomad"" is better.

Another word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.

""nodal"" is a word.

Similarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.

""focal"" has C.

So ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".

But ""nomad"" might be more common.

We could test if N is at P1.

If we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.

Similarly for A at P4.

Also, we get info on O, M, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Now, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.

By guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.

Similarly for N at P3.

But let's see which positions are more likely.

Since P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.

But to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.

P2 and P3 are middle positions.

In ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.

But let's choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.

But J is not very common, so maybe not.

Another word: ""manor"" has R, out.

""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.

""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.

""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.

""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn't have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.

The guess must include both A and N because they are present.

So we cannot guess a word without A or without N.

Therefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, we must have both.

So back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".

Another word: ""anode"" has E, out.

""alone"" has E, out.

""algin"" not common.

""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.

So invalid.

""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.

""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.

Similarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.

A at P2, N at P3, both allowed.

And letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.

So ""handy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.

Or ""candy"" has C, out.

So ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".

""handy"" is common.

With ""handy"":
- P1: H (new)
- P2: A (test if A is at P2)
- P3: N (test if N is at P3)
- P4: D (new)
- P5: Y (new)

If A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).

Similarly for N at P3.

This will give good information.

Compared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.

""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

""bandy"" is similar.

I think ""handy"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.

If not, we know where they are not.

Also, we learn about H, D, Y.

Since we have limited letters left, we might solve it.

Another word: ""panic"" has C, out.

""manic"" has C.

""lapin"" not common.

So I think ""handy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  
    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  
- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  
- **Position Constraints for A:**  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for N:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Available Positions Summary:**  
  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  
- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  
- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  
  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  
- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  
  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  
  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  
  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  
- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  

### Why ""handy""?
- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  
- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

<guess>handy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 3
- N(-): N in word, not position 4
- E(x): E not in word

Guess 2: ""angst""
- A(-): A in word, not position 1
- N(-): N in word, not position 2
- G(x): G not in word
- S(x): S not in word
- T(x): T not in word

Guess 3: ""handy""
- H(x): H not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 2 (since we guessed A at position 2)
- N(✓): N is in word and correct at position 3 (since N was guessed at position 3 and got ✓)
- D(x): D not in word
- Y(x): Y not in word

So now we know:

1. N is at position 3! Because we got ✓ for N at position 3.

2. A is present but not at position 1 (from guess2), not at position 2 (from guess3), and not at position 3 (from guess1, and position 3 is taken by N now). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.

3. Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y. So absent: C, D, E, G, H, R, S, T, Y.

4. Letters that must be present: A and N (but N is placed at position 3). So A is still unplaced, but in the word.

5. Since ""handy"" had A at position 2 and we got ""-"" meaning A is not at position 2, and position 3 is N, so for A, positions 4 and 5 are possibilities.

6. We also know that N is fixed at position 3.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4 or 5: A
- The other positions: two or three other letters? Since word is 5 letters: position 1,2,4,5 to be filled but position 4 or 5 is A.

Also, absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y.

Available letters: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But A and N are already used? N is used but fixed at position 3. We might have other instances? But so far, no duplicates.

We need to place A at position 4 or 5, and the other positions must be letters from the available set.

But note, the word must contain only A and N as known letters? Not necessarily, there might be additional letters.

In ""handy"", we only know about A and N being present, but H,D,Y are out. And from previous, C,R,E,G,S,T are out.

So the word has N at position 3, A at either position 4 or 5, and positions 1,2, and the other of 4/5 must have new letters.

Specifically:
- If A is at position 4, then positions 1,2,5 are new letters (but one of them is A? No), A is at 4, so pos 1,2,5 are non-A, non-N? But A is only one? Not necessarily, but for now.

But we have limited absent letters.

Let me list the secret word structure:
Pos1: ? (not absent)
Pos2: ? (not absent)
Pos3: N (fixed)
Pos4: A or a new letter
Pos5: if pos4 is A, then pos5 is new; if pos4 is not A, then A must be at pos5.

Since A must be at pos4 or pos5, we have two cases.

Also, note that in positions 1,2, the letters cannot be A because if A were at position 1 or 2, we would have it, but we know A is not at pos1 or pos2.

Similarly, position 3 is N, so not A.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 must not be A.

So for pos4 and pos5: one of them is A, the other is a new letter or possibly N but N is at pos3.

Now, we need to guess a word that has N at position 3, and includes A at position 4 or 5.

Also, avoid absent letters.

First, let's see if we can guess a word with A at position 4 or 5.

Possible words:

If A at position 4: then word pattern _ _ N A _

If A at position 5: then word pattern _ _ N _ A

We need to fill the blanks with letters not absent.

Absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y

So available: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

But N is already at pos3, so we can use other letters.

For example, with A at position 4: _ _ N A _

Fill positions 1,2,5 with available letters.

Similarly for the other pattern.

Since we are in guess 4, we need to be efficient.

To test both possibilities, we can guess a word that covers both cases.

Or choose one.

But let's see common words.

For pattern _ _ N A _, words like ""final"" but E? ""final"" has F,I,N,A,L -> but L? And E not present.

""final"": F at pos1, I at pos2, N at pos3, A at pos4, L at pos5.

Letters absent? C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y: none of these in ""final"", so okay.

Similarly, ""mina"" not 5 letters.

""pinna"" has N,N? Double.

""viral"" has R, absent.

""jural"" not common.

""focal"" has C, absent.

So ""final"" is possible.

But ""final"" has I and L.

Another: ""binal"" not common.

""kinas"" has S, absent.

So ""final"" might work.

Now pattern _ _ N _ A: e.g., ""linen"" has E and N? E absent. ""tonal"" has T,O? T absent. ""canon"" has C, absent.

""bonus"" has S, absent.

""focus"" has C, absent.

""labor"" has R, absent.

""manor"" has R, absent.

""minor"" has R, absent.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> but A at position 4? ""piano"": P at1, I at2, A at3, N at4, O at5? But N is at position 3? In this pattern, if we want A at pos5, then ""piano"" has A at pos3 which we know is invalid, and we are considering A at pos5.

We need words ending with A.

E.g., ""pizza"" has Z,A, but Z,Z? and no N? Must have N at pos3.

""arena"" has R, absent.

""atone"" has R? ""atone"": A,T,O,N,E -> T and E absent.

""china"" has C, absent.

""tibia"" same.

Words like ""ultra"" has T,U,L,T,R but T and R absent, and no N.

We need N at position 3, so letter at pos3 must be N.

For pattern _ _ N _ A: examples with available letters.

E.g., ""benna"" has E? ""gamma"" double M, no N.

""inula"" not common.

""lemma"" no N.

""prima"" has R.

Perhaps few common words ending with A and N at position 3.

""minus"" has S, absent.

Therefore, words with A at position 5 might be less common. So likely A is at position 4.

That is, the word is _ _ N A _

Now, positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Common words: ""final"" as I said.

But what about position 5? In ""final"" it's L.

Other words: ""vinal"" not common.

""final"" might be the most common.

""minbar"" too long.

""pinna"" is P,I,N,N,A but double N and A at end? ""pinna"": P1:P, P2:I, P3:N, P4:N, P5:A? But we have N at pos3 and pos4? Possible, but not necessarily.

In our case, secret has N at pos3, so for ""pinna"", P3 and P4 are both N, but secret only confirmed N at pos3? We don't know if there is another N.

But ""pinna"" might be acceptable.

But let's stick to ""final"".

Another word: ""linac"" has C, absent.

""binal"" not common.

""fiord"" has D? D is absent? From handy, D(x), so D absent.

In ""final"", D not present.

Absent: D is one, so in ""final"", letters F,I,N,A,L: none absent.

Similarly, other words: ""omega"" has E,G, absent.

""opera"" has O,P,E,R? E and R absent.

So ""final"" is good.

To test position 5, we can guess ""final"" and if A is at position 4, we might get ✓ for A if correct.

Even if not, we learn.

Since we have only two possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We can also guess a word that has A at position 4 or 5.

But let's see.

First, if we guess ""final"":
- P1: F
- P2: I
- P3: N (fixed, should be ✓)
- P4: A
- P5: L

If in secret, A is at position 4, then we get ✓ for A at position 4, and we might solve the word.

If secret A is at position 5, then for A at position 4, we get ""-"" meaning A is present but not at position 4, so we then know A must be at position 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on F,I,L.

But it might take another guess.

We could guess a word that has A at position 5 to test.

For pattern _ _ N _ A, and position 3: N.

What 5-letter words end with A and have N at position 3?

E.g., ""arena"" has R.

""china"" has C.

""tuna"" too short.

""donna"" has D, absent.

""manna"" has M,A,N,N,A -> but D absent? M is available.

""manna"": M,A,N,N,A? P1:M, P2:A? But A cannot be at position 2? We know A not at pos2.

""manna"" would have A at pos2 and pos5, but pos2 is invalid.

Similarly, other words.

""umbra"" has M,B,R,U,A? R absent.

Perhaps no common word.

""inertia"" too long.

So practical to assume A is at position 4.

Therefore, I'll guess ""final"".

But in ""final"", position 2 is I, which might be anything.

Another word: ""vinAl"" not, or ""winAl"" not.

""final"" or ""binal"".

""final"" is fine.

But we have position 1 and 2 to fill.

In guess 3, ""handy"" had H(x), A(-) at pos2, N(✓) at pos3, D(x), Y(x).

So we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

And we know A is at pos4 or pos5; in ""final"", we put A at pos4.

But if we are wrong, A at pos5, then in secret, position 4 is not A.

But we can guess.

To cover both, but I think it's unlikely since few words with A at pos5.

Another idea: guess a word with A at position 5.

For example, ""column"" but N? ""column"": C,O,L,U,M,N -> C absent, and N at end, not pos3.

""human"" not 5 letters.

""assai"" no N.

Perhaps ""ultra"" no N.

Words like ""organ"" has G, absent.

So maybe not.

Stick with ""final"".

Thus, next guess: ""final"". It has N at position 3 and A at position 4, which is possible, and we test.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Recap Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 ( ""crane"" ):** C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent letters: C, R, E  
     - A present, but not at position 3  
     - N present, but not at position 4
   - **Guess 2 ( ""angst"" ):** A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  
     - Absent letters: G, S, T  
     - A present, but not at position 1 (since guessed at pos 1)  
     - N present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)
   - **Guess 3 ( ""handy"" ):** H(x), A(-), N(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - Absent letters: H, D, Y  
     - A present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)  
     - N correct at position 3 (✓ confirmation)

2. **Deductions:**
   - **N is fixed at position 3** (from Guess 3 ✓ feedback).
   - **A must be in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **Cumulative absent letters:** C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y → Avoid these letters.
   - **Present letters:** Only A and N confirmed so far (with N at position 3). Since A is not at positions 1–3, it must be at 4 or 5.
   - **Other positions:** Positions 1, 2, and the non-A position (either 4 or 5) must be filled with new letters not in the absent list. Available letters: B, F, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**
   - Must place N at position 3 (known correct).
   - Must include A at either position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Choose a word with common letters to maximize information on positions 1, 2, and the variable position (4 or 5), while avoiding absent letters.
   - Words ending in A are less common (e.g., minimal valid options like ""fjord"" has D absent, ""vinyl"" has Y absent). Thus, prioritize A at position 4 for higher-probability words.
   - ""final"" (F, I, N, A, L) fits well:
     - N at position 3 (fixed ✓).
     - A at position 4 (test if A is here).
     - Positions 1, 2, and 5 filled with F, I, L (new letters, not absent).
     - If feedback for A is ✓, it solves position 4. If A is ""-"", then A must be at position 5 (and position 4 would be incorrect in this guess).
   - Alternatives like ""binal"" (less common) or ""vinal"" (rare) were considered, but ""final"" uses common letters and follows constraints.

We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n   - It has \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\' — all fairly common.\n   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.\n\n Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.\n\nThe first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:\n- C: x → C is not in the secret word.\n- R: x → R is not in the secret word.\n- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.\n- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.\n- E: x → E is not in the secret word.\n\nSo, from this, I know:\n- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.\n- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with \'-\', they are in the wrong position.\n\nIn ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they\'re not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let\'s list the positions:\n- Position 1: C (but C is out)\n- Position 2: R (out)\n- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)\n- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)\n- Position 5: E (out)\n\nTherefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.\n\nThe word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.\n\nAvailable positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:\n- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.\n- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.\nSimilarly for position 2 and 5.\n\nSo A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn\'t affect the position availability for A directly.\n\nI need to think about where A and N can be.\n\nThe secret word contains A and N somewhere else.\n\nAlso, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.\n\nFor my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.\n\nMoreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.\n\nLetters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.\n\nPotential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nFirst, let\'s think about possible words with A and N.\n\nA is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.\n\nIn ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let\'s see the word structure.\n\nAs of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.\n\nNow, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.\n\nAlso, since it\'s a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words with A and N.\n\nExamples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.\n\nOr ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn\'t have R, which is good.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.\n\nPositions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nBut from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.\n\nYes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.\n\nIn ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it\'s fine because I can still get information about other letters.\n\nPerhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.\n\nSimilarly for N, not at position 4.\n\nIn ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.\n\nBut I can use ""plant"" to confirm.\n\nAnother word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.\n\nA at position 3? Same as above.\n\nPosition 3 is often problematic.\n\nWhat about words where A is at position 1 or 2?\n\nFor example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.\n\nR is out, so words with R are bad.\n\n""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.\n\nIn feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, E.\n\nSo ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that\'s not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.\n\nBut I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn\'t be at 3, N shouldn\'t be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.\n\nThe feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.\n\nAnother idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.\n\nWhat words start with A and contain N?\n\n""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T\n\nPositions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5\n\nBut N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.\n\n""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.\n\nAnd no C,R,E.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.\n\n""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.\n\nLetters: A,N,V,I,L.\n\nI could use.\n\nBut ""angst"" seems good: common word.\n\nAnother option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.\n\n""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.\n\nPossible.\n\nBut I think ""angst"" is fine.\n\nWith ""angst"":\n- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -\n- Position 2: N, similarly\n- Etc.\n\nIf secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.\n\nBut since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.\n\nTo maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.\n\nSo letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\n\nPresent: A,N\n\nAbsent: C,R,E\n\nNew letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.\n\nFor ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.\n\nAlso, A and N are included.\n\nPositions in ""angst"":\n- A at position 1\n- N at position 2\n- G at position 3\n- S at position 4\n- T at position 5\n\nNow, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.\n\nN cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn\'t tested before.\n\nPrevious guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.\n\nNow N at position 2, which could be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.\n\nPosition 4 had N before, now S is there.\n\nPosition 5 had E, now T.\n\nI think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N\n\nPositions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5\n\nBut A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I\'ll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 5, which is new.\n\nPosition 5 had E, which is out, so new.\n\nIn ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).\n\nBut A at 3 is redundant because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly for N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 4.\n\nSo ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.\n\n""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.\n\nE absent, so not good.\n\n""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.\n\n""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple letters.\n\nIn Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.\n\nBut in feedback, I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.\n\nBut here, ""crane"" had single letters.\n\nPerhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nHowever for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.\n\nA,N,G,S,T all distinct.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.\n\n""angst"" is better.\n\nOr ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.\n\nIn ""stand"", A at 3.\n\nSimilarly ""land"" is 4 letters.\n\n""brand"" has R, out.\n\nSo probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.\n\n""abide"" has I,E? E out.\n\n""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.\n\nBut double K, messy.\n\nPerhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.\n\nE is not in word.\n\nLetters to use: avoid C,R,E.\n\nVowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.\n\nConsonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.\n\nSo ""angst"" seems fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""angst"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word.\n\n""angst"" is a valid word.\n\nIn feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.\n\nIf A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo my second guess: angst.<thoughts>\nFrom the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:\n- C(x): C is not in the secret word.\n- R(x): R is not in the secret word.\n- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- E(x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nThis gives us:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.\n- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).\n- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren\'t). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.\n- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.\n- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.\n- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it\'s incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.\n- A good choice is ""angst"": \n  - It contains A and N.\n  - Avoids C, R, E.\n  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.\n  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.\n  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.\n  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.\n\nAlternatives considered: \n- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). \n- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). \n- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  \n""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>angst</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got \'-\').\n- G, S, T are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T\n- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don\'t know their positions yet)\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2).

Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.\n\nWe need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for A: 2,4,5\nPossible positions for N: 1,3,5\n\nBut note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.\n\nBut let\'s list the available positions:\n\nPosition 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)\nPosition 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)\nPosition 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)\nPosition 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)\nPosition 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.\n\nSo the word must have:\n- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven\'t tested, but we have constraints)\nActually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut we know A and N must be placed in the word.\n\nLet me denote the positions:\n\nLet P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.\n\nConstraints:\n- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).\n- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.\n- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.\n- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.\n- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.\n\nBut we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.\n\nAlso, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.\n\nAlphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: N is at position 1.\nThen A must be at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nBut if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.\n\nSimilarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.\n\nBut A must be somewhere.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.\n\nFor example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let\'s see:\n\nIf we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:\nP1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)\nP4: new letter\nP5: new letter\n\nBut we need to form a word.\n\nSimilarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.\n\nBut let\'s think of actual words.\n\nWe need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.\n\nList of possible words:\n\n- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.\n\nExamples:\n- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let\'s see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can\'t use E, but ""nappy"" doesn\'t have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.\n\nBut we have double P, which might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.\n\n""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.\n\nBut A is already present, so double A might be possible.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.\n\n""naked"" has E and D? E is out.\n\n""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let\'s see other options.\n\nAnother: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.\n\nSo for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nNow, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.\n\nFor example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.\n\n""banjo"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.\n\nN at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.\n\n""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.\n\nTricky.\n\nNow, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.\n\nFor example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.\n\nN at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t.\n\nIn ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""chain"" has C, out.\n\n""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.\n\nSo difficult.\n\nTherefore, the easier cases are:\n\n- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""\n- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates\n- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""\n\nAlso, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can\'t both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, let\'s list possible words:\n\n1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.\n\n2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.\n\n3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don\'t know if secret has double A.\n\n4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.\n\nTo get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.\n\n""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.\n\nIf N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.\n\nSimilarly for A at P4.\n\nIn ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe also need to consider common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.\n\n""nomad"" has O, M, D.\n\n""banjo"" has B, J, O.\n\nJ is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""nomad"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.\n\n""nodal"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.\n\n""focal"" has C.\n\nSo ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".\n\nBut ""nomad"" might be more common.\n\nWe could test if N is at P1.\n\nIf we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.\n\nSimilarly for A at P4.\n\nAlso, we get info on O, M, D.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.\n\nNow, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.\n\nSimilarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.\n\nBy guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.\n\nSimilarly for N at P3.\n\nBut let\'s see which positions are more likely.\n\nSince P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.\n\nBut to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.\n\nP2 and P3 are middle positions.\n\nIn ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.\n\nBut J is not very common, so maybe not.\n\nAnother word: ""manor"" has R, out.\n\n""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.\n\n""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.\n\n""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.\n\n""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.\n\n""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn\'t have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.\n\nThe guess must include both A and N because they are present.\n\nSo we cannot guess a word without A or without N.\n\nTherefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.\n\nSimilarly, we must have both.\n\nSo back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".\n\nAnother word: ""anode"" has E, out.\n\n""alone"" has E, out.\n\n""algin"" not common.\n\n""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.\n\n""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.\n\nA at P2, N at P3, both allowed.\n\nAnd letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.\n\nSo ""handy"" is a good option.\n\nSimilarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.\n\nOr ""candy"" has C, out.\n\nSo ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".\n\n""handy"" is common.\n\nWith ""handy"":\n- P1: H (new)\n- P2: A (test if A is at P2)\n- P3: N (test if N is at P3)\n- P4: D (new)\n- P5: Y (new)\n\nIf A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it\'s elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).\n\nSimilarly for N at P3.\n\nThis will give good information.\n\nCompared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.\n\n""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.\n\n""bandy"" is similar.\n\nI think ""handy"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.\n\nIf not, we know where they are not.\n\nAlso, we learn about H, D, Y.\n\nSince we have limited letters left, we might solve it.\n\nAnother word: ""panic"" has C, out.\n\n""manic"" has C.\n\n""lapin"" not common.\n\nSo I think ""handy"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  \n  - This means:  \n    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  \n    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  \n    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  \n  - This means:  \n    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  \n    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  \n    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  \n- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  \n- **Position Constraints for A:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  \n  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  \n  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  \n- **Position Constraints for N:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  \n  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  \n  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n- **Available Positions Summary:**  \n  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  \n- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  \n- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  \n- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  \n  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  \n  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  \n- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  \n  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  \n  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  \n  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  \n- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  \n\n### Why ""handy""?\n- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  \n- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  \n- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  \n- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>handy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C(x): C not in word\n- R(x): R not in word\n- A(-): A in word, not position 3\n- N(-): N in word, not position 4\n- E(x): E not in word\n\nGuess 2: ""angst""\n- A(-): A in word, not position 1\n- N(-): N in word, not position 2\n- G(x): G not in word\n- S(x): S not in word\n- T(x): T not in word\n\nGuess 3: ""handy""\n- H(x): H not in word\n- A(-): A in word, not position 2 (since we guessed A at position 2)\n- N(✓): N is in word and correct at position 3 (since N was guessed at position 3 and got ✓)\n- D(x): D not in word\n- Y(x): Y not in word\n\nSo now we know:\n\n1. N is at position 3! Because we got ✓ for N at position 3.\n\n2. A is present but not at position 1 (from guess2), not at position 2 (from guess3), and not at position 3 (from guess1, and position 3 is taken by N now). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.\n\n3. Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y. So absent: C, D, E, G, H, R, S, T, Y.\n\n4. Letters that must be present: A and N (but N is placed at position 3). So A is still unplaced, but in the word.\n\n5. Since ""handy"" had A at position 2 and we got ""-"" meaning A is not at position 2, and position 3 is N, so for A, positions 4 and 5 are possibilities.\n\n6. We also know that N is fixed at position 3.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4 or 5: A\n- The other positions: two or three other letters? Since word is 5 letters: position 1,2,4,5 to be filled but position 4 or 5 is A.\n\nAlso, absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y.\n\nAvailable letters: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But A and N are already used? N is used but fixed at position 3. We might have other instances? But so far, no duplicates.\n\nWe need to place A at position 4 or 5, and the other positions must be letters from the available set.\n\nBut note, the word must contain only A and N as known letters? Not necessarily, there might be additional letters.\n\nIn ""handy"", we only know about A and N being present, but H,D,Y are out. And from previous, C,R,E,G,S,T are out.\n\nSo the word has N at position 3, A at either position 4 or 5, and positions 1,2, and the other of 4/5 must have new letters.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If A is at position 4, then positions 1,2,5 are new letters (but one of them is A? No), A is at 4, so pos 1,2,5 are non-A, non-N? But A is only one? Not necessarily, but for now.\n\nBut we have limited absent letters.\n\nLet me list the secret word structure:\nPos1: ? (not absent)\nPos2: ? (not absent)\nPos3: N (fixed)\nPos4: A or a new letter\nPos5: if pos4 is A, then pos5 is new; if pos4 is not A, then A must be at pos5.\n\nSince A must be at pos4 or pos5, we have two cases.\n\nAlso, note that in positions 1,2, the letters cannot be A because if A were at position 1 or 2, we would have it, but we know A is not at pos1 or pos2.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 is N, so not A.\n\nTherefore, positions 1 and 2 must not be A.\n\nSo for pos4 and pos5: one of them is A, the other is a new letter or possibly N but N is at pos3.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that has N at position 3, and includes A at position 4 or 5.\n\nAlso, avoid absent letters.\n\nFirst, let\'s see if we can guess a word with A at position 4 or 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf A at position 4: then word pattern _ _ N A _\n\nIf A at position 5: then word pattern _ _ N _ A\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not absent.\n\nAbsent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y\n\nSo available: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z\n\nBut N is already at pos3, so we can use other letters.\n\nFor example, with A at position 4: _ _ N A _\n\nFill positions 1,2,5 with available letters.\n\nSimilarly for the other pattern.\n\nSince we are in guess 4, we need to be efficient.\n\nTo test both possibilities, we can guess a word that covers both cases.\n\nOr choose one.\n\nBut let\'s see common words.\n\nFor pattern _ _ N A _, words like ""final"" but E? ""final"" has F,I,N,A,L -> but L? And E not present.\n\n""final"": F at pos1, I at pos2, N at pos3, A at pos4, L at pos5.\n\nLetters absent? C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y: none of these in ""final"", so okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""mina"" not 5 letters.\n\n""pinna"" has N,N? Double.\n\n""viral"" has R, absent.\n\n""jural"" not common.\n\n""focal"" has C, absent.\n\nSo ""final"" is possible.\n\nBut ""final"" has I and L.\n\nAnother: ""binal"" not common.\n\n""kinas"" has S, absent.\n\nSo ""final"" might work.\n\nNow pattern _ _ N _ A: e.g., ""linen"" has E and N? E absent. ""tonal"" has T,O? T absent. ""canon"" has C, absent.\n\n""bonus"" has S, absent.\n\n""focus"" has C, absent.\n\n""labor"" has R, absent.\n\n""manor"" has R, absent.\n\n""minor"" has R, absent.\n\n""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> but A at position 4? ""piano"": P at1, I at2, A at3, N at4, O at5? But N is at position 3? In this pattern, if we want A at pos5, then ""piano"" has A at pos3 which we know is invalid, and we are considering A at pos5.\n\nWe need words ending with A.\n\nE.g., ""pizza"" has Z,A, but Z,Z? and no N? Must have N at pos3.\n\n""arena"" has R, absent.\n\n""atone"" has R? ""atone"": A,T,O,N,E -> T and E absent.\n\n""china"" has C, absent.\n\n""tibia"" same.\n\nWords like ""ultra"" has T,U,L,T,R but T and R absent, and no N.\n\nWe need N at position 3, so letter at pos3 must be N.\n\nFor pattern _ _ N _ A: examples with available letters.\n\nE.g., ""benna"" has E? ""gamma"" double M, no N.\n\n""inula"" not common.\n\n""lemma"" no N.\n\n""prima"" has R.\n\nPerhaps few common words ending with A and N at position 3.\n\n""minus"" has S, absent.\n\nTherefore, words with A at position 5 might be less common. So likely A is at position 4.\n\nThat is, the word is _ _ N A _\n\nNow, positions 1,2,5 to fill.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z\n\nCommon words: ""final"" as I said.\n\nBut what about position 5? In ""final"" it\'s L.\n\nOther words: ""vinal"" not common.\n\n""final"" might be the most common.\n\n""minbar"" too long.\n\n""pinna"" is P,I,N,N,A but double N and A at end? ""pinna"": P1:P, P2:I, P3:N, P4:N, P5:A? But we have N at pos3 and pos4? Possible, but not necessarily.\n\nIn our case, secret has N at pos3, so for ""pinna"", P3 and P4 are both N, but secret only confirmed N at pos3? We don\'t know if there is another N.\n\nBut ""pinna"" might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s stick to ""final"".\n\nAnother word: ""linac"" has C, absent.\n\n""binal"" not common.\n\n""fiord"" has D? D is absent? From handy, D(x), so D absent.\n\nIn ""final"", D not present.\n\nAbsent: D is one, so in ""final"", letters F,I,N,A,L: none absent.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""omega"" has E,G, absent.\n\n""opera"" has O,P,E,R? E and R absent.\n\nSo ""final"" is good.\n\nTo test position 5, we can guess ""final"" and if A is at position 4, we might get ✓ for A if correct.\n\nEven if not, we learn.\n\nSince we have only two possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.\n\nWe can also guess a word that has A at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nFirst, if we guess ""final"":\n- P1: F\n- P2: I\n- P3: N (fixed, should be ✓)\n- P4: A\n- P5: L\n\nIf in secret, A is at position 4, then we get ✓ for A at position 4, and we might solve the word.\n\nIf secret A is at position 5, then for A at position 4, we get ""-"" meaning A is present but not at position 4, so we then know A must be at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback on F,I,L.\n\nBut it might take another guess.\n\nWe could guess a word that has A at position 5 to test.\n\nFor pattern _ _ N _ A, and position 3: N.\n\nWhat 5-letter words end with A and have N at position 3?\n\nE.g., ""arena"" has R.\n\n""china"" has C.\n\n""tuna"" too short.\n\n""donna"" has D, absent.\n\n""manna"" has M,A,N,N,A -> but D absent? M is available.\n\n""manna"": M,A,N,N,A? P1:M, P2:A? But A cannot be at position 2? We know A not at pos2.\n\n""manna"" would have A at pos2 and pos5, but pos2 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\n""umbra"" has M,B,R,U,A? R absent.\n\nPerhaps no common word.\n\n""inertia"" too long.\n\nSo practical to assume A is at position 4.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""final"".\n\nBut in ""final"", position 2 is I, which might be anything.\n\nAnother word: ""vinAl"" not, or ""winAl"" not.\n\n""final"" or ""binal"".\n\n""final"" is fine.\n\nBut we have position 1 and 2 to fill.\n\nIn guess 3, ""handy"" had H(x), A(-) at pos2, N(✓) at pos3, D(x), Y(x).\n\nSo we need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nAnd we know A is at pos4 or pos5; in ""final"", we put A at pos4.\n\nBut if we are wrong, A at pos5, then in secret, position 4 is not A.\n\nBut we can guess.\n\nTo cover both, but I think it\'s unlikely since few words with A at pos5.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word with A at position 5.\n\nFor example, ""column"" but N? ""column"": C,O,L,U,M,N -> C absent, and N at end, not pos3.\n\n""human"" not 5 letters.\n\n""assai"" no N.\n\nPerhaps ""ultra"" no N.\n\nWords like ""organ"" has G, absent.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nStick with ""final"".\n\nThus, next guess: ""final"". It has N at position 3 and A at position 4, which is possible, and we test.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Recap Feedback:**\n   - **Guess 1 ( ""crane"" ):** C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  \n     - Absent letters: C, R, E  \n     - A present, but not at position 3  \n     - N present, but not at position 4\n   - **Guess 2 ( ""angst"" ):** A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  \n     - Absent letters: G, S, T  \n     - A present, but not at position 1 (since guessed at pos 1)  \n     - N present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)\n   - **Guess 3 ( ""handy"" ):** H(x), A(-), N(✓), D(x), Y(x)  \n     - Absent letters: H, D, Y  \n     - A present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)  \n     - N correct at position 3 (✓ confirmation)\n\n2. **Deductions:**\n   - **N is fixed at position 3** (from Guess 3 ✓ feedback).\n   - **A must be in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.\n   - **Cumulative absent letters:** C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y → Avoid these letters.\n   - **Present letters:** Only A and N confirmed so far (with N at position 3). Since A is not at positions 1–3, it must be at 4 or 5.\n   - **Other positions:** Positions 1, 2, and the non-A position (either 4 or 5) must be filled with new letters not in the absent list. Available letters: B, F, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**\n   - Must place N at position 3 (known correct).\n   - Must include A at either position 4 or 5 to test its location.\n   - Choose a word with common letters to maximize information on positions 1, 2, and the variable position (4 or 5), while avoiding absent letters.\n   - Words ending in A are less common (e.g., minimal valid options like ""fjord"" has D absent, ""vinyl"" has Y absent). Thus, prioritize A at position 4 for higher-probability words.\n   - ""final"" (F, I, N, A, L) fits well:\n     - N at position 3 (fixed ✓).\n     - A at position 4 (test if A is here).\n     - Positions 1, 2, and 5 filled with F, I, L (new letters, not absent).\n     - If feedback for A is ✓, it solves position 4. If A is ""-"", then A must be at position 5 (and position 4 would be incorrect in this guess).\n   - Alternatives like ""binal"" (less common) or ""vinal"" (rare) were considered, but ""final"" uses common letters and follows constraints.\n\n### Response:\n\n<guess>final</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: final -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) N(✓) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C(x) -> C not in word
- R(x) -> R not in word
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 3
- N(-) -> N in word, not position 4
- E(x) -> E not in word

Guess 2: angst
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 1
- N(-) -> N in word, not position 2
- G(x) -> G not in word
- S(x) -> S not in word
- T(x) -> T not in word

Guess 3: handy
- H(x) -> H not in word
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 2
- N(✓) -> N in word and correct at position 3
- D(x) -> D not in word
- Y(x) -> Y not in word

Guess 4: final
- F(x) -> F not in word
- I(x) -> I not in word
- N(✓) -> N correct at position 3 (consistent)
- A(✓) -> A in word and correct at position 4
- L(✓) -> L in word and correct at position 5

From Guess 4, we have:
- N is at position 3 (as established)
- A is at position 4 (with ✓)
- L is at position 5 (with ✓)

Also, F and I are absent (not in word).

So the secret word now has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L
- Positions 1 and 2 are unknown but must be letters not absent and satisfy the constraints.

Moreover, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.

Cumulative absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.

Therefore, available letters: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, position 1 and 2 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? Not necessarily distinct, but possible.

Also, the word must be a valid English word ending with ""NAL"" since positions 3-5 are N,A,L.

So pattern: _ _ N A L

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with two letters from the available set and ends with ""NAL"".

Available letters for positions 1 and 2: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, common words ending in ""NAL"":

e.g., ""canal"" but C is absent.

""final"" we already guessed and F is absent? In guess4 we have F(x), and ""final"" has F at start.

Other words: ""tonal"" has T, absent.

""cabal"" has C, absent.

""vocal"" has C, absent.

Possible words:

- ""nasal"" but S absent (from guess2 S(x))

""nasal"": N,A,S,A,L? Positions: P1:N, P2:A? But N is at position 3? Not, and A at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2? From guess2 or guess3, A not at pos2.

Moreover, ""nasal"" has S, absent.

Similarly, ""basal"" has B,A,S,A,L? S absent.

""basal"" would be B,A,S,A,L but S absent.

How about ""banal""? B,A,N,A,L? But N at position 3? ""banal"": B at1, A at2, N at3, A at4, L at5? But we have A at position 4 fixed? In secret word, position 4 is A and position 3 is N, so ""banal"" has the pattern: P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. However, we know A cannot be at position 2 (from guess3 handy, A(-) at position 2), so if we guessed ""banal"", A at position 2 would be invalid. But we are not guessing it now; we are considering what secret could be.

The secret word could be ""banal"", with A both at position 2 and 4? But we know from feedback that A is not at position 2. Specifically, in guess3 handy, we guessed A at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning A is not at position 2. Therefore, secret cannot have A at position 2, so ""banal"" would have A at position 2, which contradicts feedback.

Therefore, ""banal"" is impossible.

Similarly, any word with A at position 2 is invalid.

Also, word must have position 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.

Now, for position 1 and 2: any letters from available, and not A since A is fixed at position 4 and cannot be at position 1 or 2 from previous feedback.

Similarly, we already know absent letters.

Possible words ending with ""NAL"":

- ""manual"" too long.

5-letter words: let's list some.

""coral"" has C and R? Absent.

""moral"" has M,O,R,A,L? R absent.

""focal"" has C, absent.

""viral"" has R, absent.

Local search: words like ""vonal"" not word.

""zonal"" Z,O,N,A,L -> P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.

Letters: Z,O. Are these available? Yes, Z not absent, O not absent.

And ""zonal"" is a word? Yes, meaning pertaining to a zone.

Similarly, ""tonal"" has T, absent.

""boral"" not common.

""coval"" not word.

""doral"" has D, absent.

""moral"" has R, absent.

""nopal"" N,O,P,A,L? But N at position 1? Secret has N at position 3. ""nopal"": P1:N,O,P,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:P, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not the case.

The word must have N at position 3, so words like ""nopal"" have different pattern.

Pattern must be _ _ N A L, so position 3 is N.

""zonal"" fits: P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.

Similarly, ""jonal"" not word.

""kraal"" K,R,A,A,L? R absent.

""vial"" too short.

""arial"" has R? And not standard.

""axial"" has X,I? But I absent? From guess4 final I(x), so I absent.

But ""axial"" has I at position 4? A,X,I,A,L? P1:A,X,I,A,L? No, ""axial"" is A,X,I,A,L? Positions: P1:A, P2:X, P3:I, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not I.

The word must be _ _ N A L, so first two letters can be anything, but positions 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.

So ""zonal"" is one: Z,O,N,A,L.

Similarly, ""bwana"" is B,W,A,N,A? Pattern mismatch.

""quena"" has E? Not.

Another word: ""penal"" P,E,N,A,L? E absent? E is absent.

""renal"" R,E? Both absent.

""metal"" M,E,T? E and T absent.

""menal"" M,E,N,A,L? E absent.

But we have M available, E absent.

""modal"" M,O,D,A,L? D absent.

""moral"" as above.

""mural"" M,U,R,A,L? R absent.

""naval"" N? Position.

""oval"" too short.

""local"" C, absent.

So ""zonal"" seems possible.

""vocal"" C absent.

Another word: ""kanal"" K,A,N,A,L? But A at position 2? We know A not at pos2. Guess2 had A at pos1 and not, guess3 at pos2 not. So secret cannot have A at pos2.

""kanal"" would have A at pos2? K,A,N,A,L -> P1:K, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. But A at pos2 invalid.

Similarly, ""banal"" invalid.

So words with A at pos2 are out.

Now, is there another word besides ""zonal""?

""fanal"" would be F,A,N,A,L? F absent? From guess4 F(x), so F absent.

Also A at pos2? Invalid.

""pupal"" not.

""tidal"" T, absent.

""wigan"" not.

""cymal"" not word.

Possible ""zonal"" might be the only common one? Or ""tonal"" not.

""binal"" B,I,N,A,L? But I absent? From guess4 I(x), so I absent.

In ""binal"", if it were, P1:B, P2:I, but I absent.

So not.

Similarly, we have absent I.

Another word: ""monal"" M,O,N,A,L? Pattern: M,O,N,A,L -> P1:M, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. This is similar to ""zonal"" but M and O.

""monal"" is a word? Referring to a bird, monal pheasant? Not commonly used, but valid.

Similarly, ""zonal"" and ""monal"" are both possible.

""coral"" absent.

""moral"" absent.

""rural"" R absent.

So possible words: ""zonal"" (ZO + NAL), ""monal"" (MO + NAL).

Also, ""punal"" not common.

""usual"" U,S? S absent.

""venal"" V,E,N,A,L? E absent.

""mural"" R absent.

So likely ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

Now we need to guess between them.

But we have positions 1 and 2 unknown.

We can guess one of them.

Since we have only letters B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z available for positions 1 and 2, but in ""monal"" it's M and O, in ""zonal"" Z and O.

Both have O at position 2? In ""zonal"" position 2 is O.

In ""monal"" position 2 is O? MONAL: M at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.

Similarly, ZONAL: Z at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.

Both have position 2 as O.

Position 1 could be M or Z.

But also other possibilities? What about ""boral"" B,O,R,A,L? R absent.

""copal"" C, absent.

""lopal"" not word.

""qophs"" not.

So probably ""monal"" or ""zonal"".

To resolve, we need to guess a word with positions 3:N,4:A,5:L, and position 1 and 2 with available letters.

But we don't know which letter for position 1.

Since ""monal"" and ""zonal"" both have ""O"" at position 2, we can guess one.

But let's see the entire word.

In guess 4 ""final"" we have F(x) and I(x), so F and I absent.

Now, for fifth guess, we can guess, say, ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

Since ""monal"" might be less common, or we can think of other patterns.

Another word? ""karnal"" too long.

""panel"" has E? Not 5 with L.

Perhaps only those two.

But let's assume ""moral"" is absent? Not.

Position 1 and 2: could be different letters.

For example, ""manual"" is 6.

""annual"" double N, A at 1? Not pattern.

So ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

To choose, let's guess ""monal"" since M is more common than Z, or vice versa.

But Z might be less common.

We can guess a word that tests position 1.

But we have to use the pattern since we know positions 3,4,5.

So guess ""monal"".

But ""monal"" might be accepted.

Since we have the pattern, and we need to fill position 1 and 2.

But position 2 is O in both, so position 1 is the variable.

In both candidate words, position 2 is O.

Therefore, we know position 2 is O? Not necessarily, but available letters.

Perhaps position 2 is O.

Since it appears in both common possibilities.

But we don't know for sure.

There might be other words, like ""pawal"" not word.

Or ""jawal"" not.

So we can guess with O at position 2 to confirm.

For example, guess a word like ""___NAL"" with position 2 as O.

Then position 1 needs to be any available letter.

For instance, ""bonal"" not word.

""jonal"" not.

""konal"" not.

""monal"" is one.

""uonal"" not.

""ponal"" P,O,N,A,L? Is this a word? Not common.

Similarly, ""wonal"" not.

""yonal"" Y absent.

So only ""monal"" and ""zonal"" are dictionary words.

Therefore, between M and Z for position 1.

Since we have to guess, and ""monal"" might be more plausible.

But ""zonal"" is also valid.

To test, we can guess ""zonal"" for example.

But let's see the feedback history.

Since we are at guess 5, we have two tries left.

Guess ""monal"".

If wrong, guess ""zonal"" next.

But we can do it.

To save a guess, but not necessary.

Perhaps ""canal"" but C absent.

No.

Another idea: position 1 could be B for ""banal"", but ""banal"" has A at position 2, invalid.

Or ""vinal"" V,I,N,A,L? I absent.

Not.

So I think ""monal"" or ""zonal"".

Choose ""monal"".

So guess ""monal"".

But let's confirm.

secret word must be from available letters.

Position 1: in ""monal"" is M.

M not in absent list.

Position 2: O.

O not absent.

Yes.

Similarly for ""zonal"".

Now ,guess ""monal"".
</think>
Based on the accumulated feedback:

1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is present but not at position 3; N is present but not at position 4; C, R, E absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""angst"")**: A is present but not at position 1; N is present but not at position 2; G, S, T absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""handy"")**: N is confirmed at position 3; A is present but not at position 2; H, D, Y absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""final"")**: N is confirmed at position 3; A is confirmed at position 4; L is confirmed at position 5; F, I absent.

2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word ends with ""NAL"" (positions 3-5: N, A, L fixed).
   - **Cumulative absent letters**: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I (avoid these).
   - **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - Position 1 and 2 cannot contain A (A is fixed at position 4, and feedback confirms A not at positions 1-3).
   - Only valid English words fitting the pattern _ _ N A L work.
   - Possible words include ""zonal"" (Z O N A L) and ""monal"" (M O N A L), both ending with ""NAL"" and using available letters.

3. **Strategy**:
   - ""monal"" is tested first due to M being a more common starting letter than Z.
   - If incorrect, ""zonal"" can be guessed next with the remaining try.

<guess>monal</guess>",monal,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C(x) -> C not in word
- R(x) -> R not in word
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 3
- N(-) -> N in word, not position 4
- E(x) -> E not in word

Guess 2: angst
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 1
- N(-) -> N in word, not position 2
- G(x) -> G not in word
- S(x) -> S not in word
- T(x) -> T not in word

Guess 3: handy
- H(x) -> H not in word
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 2
- N(✓) -> N in word and correct at position 3
- D(x) -> D not in word
- Y(x) -> Y not in word

Guess 4: final
- F(x) -> F not in word
- I(x) -> I not in word
- N(✓) -> N correct at position 3 (consistent)
- A(✓) -> A in word and correct at position 4
- L(✓) -> L in word and correct at position 5

From Guess 4, we have:
- N is at position 3 (as established)
- A is at position 4 (with ✓)
- L is at position 5 (with ✓)

Also, F and I are absent (not in word).

So the secret word now has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L
- Positions 1 and 2 are unknown but must be letters not absent and satisfy the constraints.

Moreover, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.

Cumulative absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.

Therefore, available letters: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, position 1 and 2 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? Not necessarily distinct, but possible.

Also, the word must be a valid English word ending with ""NAL"" since positions 3-5 are N,A,L.

So pattern: _ _ N A L

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with two letters from the available set and ends with ""NAL"".

Available letters for positions 1 and 2: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, common words ending in ""NAL"":

e.g., ""canal"" but C is absent.

""final"" we already guessed and F is absent? In guess4 we have F(x), and ""final"" has F at start.

Other words: ""tonal"" has T, absent.

""cabal"" has C, absent.

""vocal"" has C, absent.

Possible words:

- ""nasal"" but S absent (from guess2 S(x))

""nasal"": N,A,S,A,L? Positions: P1:N, P2:A? But N is at position 3? Not, and A at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2? From guess2 or guess3, A not at pos2.

Moreover, ""nasal"" has S, absent.

Similarly, ""basal"" has B,A,S,A,L? S absent.

""basal"" would be B,A,S,A,L but S absent.

How about ""banal""? B,A,N,A,L? But N at position 3? ""banal"": B at1, A at2, N at3, A at4, L at5? But we have A at position 4 fixed? In secret word, position 4 is A and position 3 is N, so ""banal"" has the pattern: P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. However, we know A cannot be at position 2 (from guess3 handy, A(-) at position 2), so if we guessed ""banal"", A at position 2 would be invalid. But we are not guessing it now; we are considering what secret could be.

The secret word could be ""banal"", with A both at position 2 and 4? But we know from feedback that A is not at position 2. Specifically, in guess3 handy, we guessed A at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning A is not at position 2. Therefore, secret cannot have A at position 2, so ""banal"" would have A at position 2, which contradicts feedback.

Therefore, ""banal"" is impossible.

Similarly, any word with A at position 2 is invalid.

Also, word must have position 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.

Now, for position 1 and 2: any letters from available, and not A since A is fixed at position 4 and cannot be at position 1 or 2 from previous feedback.

Similarly, we already know absent letters.

Possible words ending with ""NAL"":

- ""manual"" too long.

5-letter words: let's list some.

""coral"" has C and R? Absent.

""moral"" has M,O,R,A,L? R absent.

""focal"" has C, absent.

""viral"" has R, absent.

Local search: words like ""vonal"" not word.

""zonal"" Z,O,N,A,L -> P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.

Letters: Z,O. Are these available? Yes, Z not absent, O not absent.

Similarly, ""tonal"" has T, absent.

""boral"" not common.

""coval"" not word.

""doral"" has D, absent.

""moral"" has R, absent.

""nopal"" N,O,P,A,L? But N at position 1? Secret has N at position 3. ""nopal"": P1:N,O,P,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:P, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not the case.

The word must have N at position 3, so words like ""nopal"" have different pattern.

Pattern must be _ _ N A L, so position 3 is N.

""zonal"" fits: P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.

Similarly, ""jonal"" not word.

""kraal"" K,R,A,A,L? R absent.

""vial"" too short.

""arial"" has R? And not standard.

""axial"" has X,I? But I absent? From guess4 final I(x), so I absent.

But ""axial"" has I at position 4? A,X,I,A,L? P1:A,X,I,A,L? No, ""axial"" is A,X,I,A,L? Positions: P1:A, P2:X, P3:I, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not I.

The word must be _ _ N A L, so first two letters can be anything, but positions 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.

So ""zonal"" is one: Z,O,N,A,L.

Similarly, ""bwana"" is B,W,A,N,A? Pattern mismatch.

""quena"" has E? Not.

Another word: ""penal"" P,E,N,A,L? E absent? E is absent.

""renal"" R,E? Both absent.

""metal"" M,E,T? E and T absent.

""menal"" M,E,N,A,L? E absent.

But we have M available, E absent.

""modal"" M,O,D,A,L? D absent.

""moral"" as above.

""mural"" M,U,R,A,L? R absent.

""naval"" N? Position.

""oval"" too short.

""local"" C, absent.

So ""zonal"" seems possible.

""vocal"" C absent.

Another word: ""kanal"" K,A,N,A,L? But A at position 2? We know A not at pos2. Guess2 had A at pos1 and not, guess3 at pos2 not. So secret cannot have A at pos2.

""kanal"" would have A at pos2? K,A,N,A,L -> P1:K, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. But A at pos2 invalid.

Similarly, ""banal"" invalid.

So words with A at pos2 are out.

Now, is there another word besides ""zonal""?

""fanal"" would be F,A,N,A,L? F absent? From guess4 F(x), so F absent.

Also A at pos2? Invalid.

""pupal"" not.

""tidal"" T, absent.

""wigan"" not.

""cymal"" not word.

Possible ""zonal"" might be the only common one? Or ""tonal"" not.

""binal"" B,I,N,A,L? But I absent? From guess4 I(x), so I absent.

In ""binal"", if it were, P1:B, P2:I, but I absent.

So not.

Similarly, we have absent I.

Another word: ""monal"" M,O,N,A,L? Pattern: M,O,N,A,L -> P1:M, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. This is similar to ""zonal"" but M and O.

""monal"" is a word? Referring to a bird, monal pheasant? Not commonly used, but valid.

Similarly, ""zonal"" and ""monal"" are both possible.

""coral"" absent.

""moral"" absent.

""rural"" R absent.

So possible words: ""zonal"" (ZO + NAL), ""monal"" (MO + NAL).

Also, ""punal"" not common.

""usual"" U,S? S absent.

""venal"" V,E,N,A,L? E absent.

""mural"" R absent.

So likely ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

Now we need to guess between them.

But we have positions 1 and 2 unknown.

We can guess one of them.

Since we have only letters B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z available for positions 1 and 2, but in ""monal"" it's M and O, in ""zonal"" Z and O.

Both have O at position 2? In ""zonal"" position 2 is O.

In ""monal"" position 2 is O? MONAL: M at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.

Similarly, ZONAL: Z at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.

Both have position 2 as O.

Position 1 could be M or Z.

But also other possibilities? What about ""boral"" B,O,R,A,L? R absent.

""copal"" C, absent.

""lopal"" not word.

""qophs"" not.

So probably ""monal"" or ""zonal"".

To resolve, we need to guess a word with positions 3:N,4:A,5:L, and position 1 and 2 with available letters.

But we don't know which letter for position 1.

Since ""monal"" and ""zonal"" both have ""O"" at position 2, we can guess one.

But let's see the entire word.

In guess 4 ""final"" we have F(x) and I(x), so F and I absent.

Now, for fifth guess, we can guess, say, ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

Since ""monal"" might be less common, or we can think of other patterns.

Another word? ""karnal"" too long.

""panel"" has E? Not 5 with L.

Perhaps only those two.

But let's assume ""moral"" is absent? Not.

Position 1 and 2: could be different letters.

For example, ""manual"" is 6.

""annual"" double N, A at 1? Not pattern.

So ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

To choose, let's guess ""monal"" since M is more common than Z, or vice versa.

But Z might be less common.

We can guess a word that tests position 1.

But we have to use the pattern since we know positions 3,4,5.

So guess ""monal"".

But ""monal"" might be accepted.

Since we have the pattern, and we need to fill position 1 and 2.

But position 2 is O in both, so position 1 is the variable.

In both candidate words, position 2 is O.

Therefore, we know position 2 is O? Not necessarily, but available letters.

Perhaps position 2 is O.

Since it appears in both common possibilities.

But we don't know for sure.

There might be other words, like ""pawal"" not word.

Or ""jawal"" not.

So we can guess with O at position 2 to confirm.

For example, guess a word like ""___NAL"" with position 2 as O.

Then position 1 needs to be any available letter.

For instance, ""bonal"" not word.

""jonal"" not.

""konal"" not.

""monal"" is one.

""uonal"" not.

""ponal"" P,O,N,A,L? Is this a word? Not common.

Similarly, ""wonal"" not.

""yonal"" Y absent.

So only ""monal"" and ""zonal"" are dictionary words.

Therefore, between M and Z for position 1.

Since we have to guess, and ""monal"" might be more plausible.

But ""zonal"" is also valid.

To test, we can guess ""zonal"" for example.

But let's see the feedback history.

Since we are at guess 5, we have two tries left.

Guess ""monal"".

If wrong, guess ""zonal"" next.

But we can do it.

To save a guess, but not necessary.

Perhaps ""canal"" but C absent.

No.

Another idea: position 1 could be B for ""banal"", but ""banal"" has A at position 2, invalid.

Or ""vinal"" V,I,N,A,L? I absent.

Not.

So I think ""monal"" or ""zonal"".

Choose ""monal"".

So guess ""monal"".

But let's confirm.

secret word must be from available letters.

Position 1: in ""monal"" is M.

M not in absent list.

Position 2: O.

O not absent.

Yes.

Similarly for ""zonal"".

Now ,guess ""monal"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is present but not at position 3; N is present but not at position 4; C, R, E absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""angst"")**: A is present but not at position 1; N is present but not at position 2; G, S, T absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""handy"")**: N is confirmed at position 3; A is present but not at position 2; H, D, Y absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""final"")**: N is confirmed at position 3; A is confirmed at position 4; L is confirmed at position 5; F, I absent.

2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word ends with ""NAL"" (positions 3-5: N, A, L fixed).
   - **Cumulative absent letters**: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I (avoid these).
   - **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - Position 1 and 2 cannot contain A (A is fixed at position 4, and feedback confirms A not at positions 1-3).
   - Only valid English words fitting the pattern _ _ N A L work.
   - Possible words include ""zonal"" (Z O N A L) and ""monal"" (M O N A L), both ending with ""NAL"" and using available letters.

3. **Strategy**:
   - ""monal"" is tested first due to M being a more common starting letter than Z.
   - If incorrect, ""zonal"" can be guessed next with the remaining try.",Guess 5: monal -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,ZONAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.

 Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.

The first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x → C is not in the secret word.
- R: x → R is not in the secret word.
- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.
- E: x → E is not in the secret word.

So, from this, I know:
- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.
- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with '-', they are in the wrong position.

In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they're not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

The secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let's list the positions:
- Position 1: C (but C is out)
- Position 2: R (out)
- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)
- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)
- Position 5: E (out)

Therefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.

The word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:
- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.
- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.
Similarly for position 2 and 5.

So A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn't affect the position availability for A directly.

I need to think about where A and N can be.

The secret word contains A and N somewhere else.

Also, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.

For my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.

Common English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Letters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.

Potential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

First, let's think about possible words with A and N.

A is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.

In ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let's see the word structure.

As of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.

Now, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.

Also, since it's a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.

Let me brainstorm some words with A and N.

Examples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.

Or ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.

But let's check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn't have R, which is good.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.

Positions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

But from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.

Yes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.

In ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it's fine because I can still get information about other letters.

Perhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.

Similarly for N, not at position 4.

In ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.

But I can use ""plant"" to confirm.

Another word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.

A at position 3? Same as above.

Position 3 is often problematic.

What about words where A is at position 1 or 2?

For example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.

R is out, so words with R are bad.

""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.

In feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.

Letters to avoid: C, R, E.

So ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that's not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.

But I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.

""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn't be at 3, N shouldn't be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.

The feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.

Another idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.

What words start with A and contain N?

""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T

Positions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5

But N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.

Similarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.

""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.

And no C,R,E.

Similarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.

""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.

Letters: A,N,V,I,L.

I could use.

But ""angst"" seems good: common word.

Another option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.

""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.

Possible.

But I think ""angst"" is fine.

With ""angst"":
- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -
- Position 2: N, similarly
- Etc.

If secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.

But since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.

Similarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.

To maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.

In ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E

Present: A,N

Absent: C,R,E

New letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.

For ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.

Also, A and N are included.

Positions in ""angst"":
- A at position 1
- N at position 2
- G at position 3
- S at position 4
- T at position 5

Now, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.

N cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn't tested before.

Previous guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.

Now N at position 2, which could be correct or not.

Similarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.

Position 4 had N before, now S is there.

Position 5 had E, now T.

I think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.

But let's see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.

Another common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N

Positions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5

But A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I'll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.

Similarly, N at position 5, which is new.

Position 5 had E, which is out, so new.

In ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).

But A at 3 is redundant because we know it's wrong.

So I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.

Similarly for N at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.

Similarly, N at position 4.

So ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.

""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.

E absent, so not good.

""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.

""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn't say anything about multiple letters.

In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.

But in feedback, I need to be careful.

For example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.

But here, ""crane"" had single letters.

Perhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.

But not necessary.

However for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.

A,N,G,S,T all distinct.

Good.

Another word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.

""angst"" is better.

Or ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.

In ""stand"", A at 3.

Similarly ""land"" is 4 letters.

""brand"" has R, out.

So probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.

""abide"" has I,E? E out.

""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.

But double K, messy.

Perhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.

E is not in word.

Letters to use: avoid C,R,E.

Vowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.

So ""angst"" seems fine.

I'll go with ""angst"".

But let's confirm the word.

""angst"" is a valid word.

In feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.

If A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -

Similarly for others.

Also, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.

Perfect.

So my second guess: angst.<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C(x): C is not in the secret word.
- R(x): R is not in the secret word.
- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

This gives us:
- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.
- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).
- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren't). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.
- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.

For the second guess:
- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.
- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.
- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it's incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.
- A good choice is ""angst"": 
  - It contains A and N.
  - Avoids C, R, E.
  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.
  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.
  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.
  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.

Alternatives considered: 
- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). 
- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). 
- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  
""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.

<guess>angst</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got '-').
- G, S, T are not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T
- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don't know their positions yet)

From the feedback:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5

But note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list the available positions:

Position 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)
Position 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)
Position 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)
Position 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)
Position 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.

So the word must have:
- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven't tested, but we have constraints)
Actually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.

Similarly for other positions.

But we know A and N must be placed in the word.

Let me denote the positions:

Let P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.

Constraints:
- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).
- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.
- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.
- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.
- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.

But we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.

Also, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.

Alphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.

Possible cases:

Case 1: N is at position 1.
Then A must be at position 2,4, or 5.

But if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.

Similarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.

But A must be somewhere.

Similarly, other cases.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.

For example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let's see:

If we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:
P1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)
P4: new letter
P5: new letter

But we need to form a word.

Similarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.

List of possible words:

- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.

Examples:
- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let's see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can't use E, but ""nappy"" doesn't have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.

But we have double P, which might be okay.

But let's see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.

""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.

But A is already present, so double A might be possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.

""naked"" has E and D? E is out.

""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let's see other options.

Another: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.

Similarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.

So for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.

Similarly, other cases.

Now, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.

For example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.

""banjo"" is a word.

Similarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.

N at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.

""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.

Tricky.

Now, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.

For example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.

N at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't.

In ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""chain"" has C, out.

""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.

So difficult.

Therefore, the easier cases are:

- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""
- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates
- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""

Also, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can't both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.

So impossible.

Therefore, let's list possible words:

1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.

2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.

3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don't know if secret has double A.

4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.

To get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.

""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.

If N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly for A at P4.

In ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Which one to choose?

We also need to consider common letters.

Available common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.

""nomad"" has O, M, D.

""banjo"" has B, J, O.

J is less common.

Perhaps ""nomad"" is better.

Another word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.

""nodal"" is a word.

Similarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.

""focal"" has C.

So ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".

But ""nomad"" might be more common.

We could test if N is at P1.

If we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.

Similarly for A at P4.

Also, we get info on O, M, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.

Now, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.

Similarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.

By guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.

Similarly for N at P3.

But let's see which positions are more likely.

Since P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.

But to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.

P2 and P3 are middle positions.

In ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.

But let's choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.

But J is not very common, so maybe not.

Another word: ""manor"" has R, out.

""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.

""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.

""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.

""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn't have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.

The guess must include both A and N because they are present.

So we cannot guess a word without A or without N.

Therefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, we must have both.

So back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".

Another word: ""anode"" has E, out.

""alone"" has E, out.

""algin"" not common.

""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.

So invalid.

""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.

""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.

Similarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.

A at P2, N at P3, both allowed.

And letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.

So ""handy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.

Or ""candy"" has C, out.

So ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".

""handy"" is common.

With ""handy"":
- P1: H (new)
- P2: A (test if A is at P2)
- P3: N (test if N is at P3)
- P4: D (new)
- P5: Y (new)

If A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).

Similarly for N at P3.

This will give good information.

Compared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.

""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

""bandy"" is similar.

I think ""handy"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.

If not, we know where they are not.

Also, we learn about H, D, Y.

Since we have limited letters left, we might solve it.

Another word: ""panic"" has C, out.

""manic"" has C.

""lapin"" not common.

So I think ""handy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  
    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  
    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  
- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  
- **Position Constraints for A:**  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for N:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Available Positions Summary:**  
  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  
  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  
- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  
- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  
  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  
- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  
  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  
  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  
  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  
- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  

### Why ""handy""?
- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  
- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

<guess>handy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 3
- N(-): N in word, not position 4
- E(x): E not in word

Guess 2: ""angst""
- A(-): A in word, not position 1
- N(-): N in word, not position 2
- G(x): G not in word
- S(x): S not in word
- T(x): T not in word

Guess 3: ""handy""
- H(x): H not in word
- A(-): A in word, not position 2 (since we guessed A at position 2)
- N(✓): N is in word and correct at position 3 (since N was guessed at position 3 and got ✓)
- D(x): D not in word
- Y(x): Y not in word

So now we know:

1. N is at position 3! Because we got ✓ for N at position 3.

2. A is present but not at position 1 (from guess2), not at position 2 (from guess3), and not at position 3 (from guess1, and position 3 is taken by N now). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.

3. Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y. So absent: C, D, E, G, H, R, S, T, Y.

4. Letters that must be present: A and N (but N is placed at position 3). So A is still unplaced, but in the word.

5. Since ""handy"" had A at position 2 and we got ""-"" meaning A is not at position 2, and position 3 is N, so for A, positions 4 and 5 are possibilities.

6. We also know that N is fixed at position 3.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4 or 5: A
- The other positions: two or three other letters? Since word is 5 letters: position 1,2,4,5 to be filled but position 4 or 5 is A.

Also, absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y.

Available letters: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But A and N are already used? N is used but fixed at position 3. We might have other instances? But so far, no duplicates.

We need to place A at position 4 or 5, and the other positions must be letters from the available set.

But note, the word must contain only A and N as known letters? Not necessarily, there might be additional letters.

In ""handy"", we only know about A and N being present, but H,D,Y are out. And from previous, C,R,E,G,S,T are out.

So the word has N at position 3, A at either position 4 or 5, and positions 1,2, and the other of 4/5 must have new letters.

Specifically:
- If A is at position 4, then positions 1,2,5 are new letters (but one of them is A? No), A is at 4, so pos 1,2,5 are non-A, non-N? But A is only one? Not necessarily, but for now.

But we have limited absent letters.

Let me list the secret word structure:
Pos1: ? (not absent)
Pos2: ? (not absent)
Pos3: N (fixed)
Pos4: A or a new letter
Pos5: if pos4 is A, then pos5 is new; if pos4 is not A, then A must be at pos5.

Since A must be at pos4 or pos5, we have two cases.

Also, note that in positions 1,2, the letters cannot be A because if A were at position 1 or 2, we would have it, but we know A is not at pos1 or pos2.

Similarly, position 3 is N, so not A.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 must not be A.

So for pos4 and pos5: one of them is A, the other is a new letter or possibly N but N is at pos3.

Now, we need to guess a word that has N at position 3, and includes A at position 4 or 5.

Also, avoid absent letters.

First, let's see if we can guess a word with A at position 4 or 5.

Possible words:

If A at position 4: then word pattern _ _ N A _

If A at position 5: then word pattern _ _ N _ A

We need to fill the blanks with letters not absent.

Absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y

So available: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

But N is already at pos3, so we can use other letters.

For example, with A at position 4: _ _ N A _

Fill positions 1,2,5 with available letters.

Similarly for the other pattern.

Since we are in guess 4, we need to be efficient.

To test both possibilities, we can guess a word that covers both cases.

Or choose one.

But let's see common words.

For pattern _ _ N A _, words like ""final"" but E? ""final"" has F,I,N,A,L -> but L? And E not present.

""final"": F at pos1, I at pos2, N at pos3, A at pos4, L at pos5.

Letters absent? C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y: none of these in ""final"", so okay.

Similarly, ""mina"" not 5 letters.

""pinna"" has N,N? Double.

""viral"" has R, absent.

""jural"" not common.

""focal"" has C, absent.

So ""final"" is possible.

But ""final"" has I and L.

Another: ""binal"" not common.

""kinas"" has S, absent.

So ""final"" might work.

Now pattern _ _ N _ A: e.g., ""linen"" has E and N? E absent. ""tonal"" has T,O? T absent. ""canon"" has C, absent.

""bonus"" has S, absent.

""focus"" has C, absent.

""labor"" has R, absent.

""manor"" has R, absent.

""minor"" has R, absent.

""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> but A at position 4? ""piano"": P at1, I at2, A at3, N at4, O at5? But N is at position 3? In this pattern, if we want A at pos5, then ""piano"" has A at pos3 which we know is invalid, and we are considering A at pos5.

We need words ending with A.

E.g., ""pizza"" has Z,A, but Z,Z? and no N? Must have N at pos3.

""arena"" has R, absent.

""atone"" has R? ""atone"": A,T,O,N,E -> T and E absent.

""china"" has C, absent.

""tibia"" same.

Words like ""ultra"" has T,U,L,T,R but T and R absent, and no N.

We need N at position 3, so letter at pos3 must be N.

For pattern _ _ N _ A: examples with available letters.

E.g., ""benna"" has E? ""gamma"" double M, no N.

""inula"" not common.

""lemma"" no N.

""prima"" has R.

Perhaps few common words ending with A and N at position 3.

""minus"" has S, absent.

Therefore, words with A at position 5 might be less common. So likely A is at position 4.

That is, the word is _ _ N A _

Now, positions 1,2,5 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Common words: ""final"" as I said.

But what about position 5? In ""final"" it's L.

Other words: ""vinal"" not common.

""final"" might be the most common.

""minbar"" too long.

""pinna"" is P,I,N,N,A but double N and A at end? ""pinna"": P1:P, P2:I, P3:N, P4:N, P5:A? But we have N at pos3 and pos4? Possible, but not necessarily.

In our case, secret has N at pos3, so for ""pinna"", P3 and P4 are both N, but secret only confirmed N at pos3? We don't know if there is another N.

But ""pinna"" might be acceptable.

But let's stick to ""final"".

Another word: ""linac"" has C, absent.

""binal"" not common.

""fiord"" has D? D is absent? From handy, D(x), so D absent.

In ""final"", D not present.

Absent: D is one, so in ""final"", letters F,I,N,A,L: none absent.

Similarly, other words: ""omega"" has E,G, absent.

""opera"" has O,P,E,R? E and R absent.

So ""final"" is good.

To test position 5, we can guess ""final"" and if A is at position 4, we might get ✓ for A if correct.

Even if not, we learn.

Since we have only two possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.

We can also guess a word that has A at position 4 or 5.

But let's see.

First, if we guess ""final"":
- P1: F
- P2: I
- P3: N (fixed, should be ✓)
- P4: A
- P5: L

If in secret, A is at position 4, then we get ✓ for A at position 4, and we might solve the word.

If secret A is at position 5, then for A at position 4, we get ""-"" meaning A is present but not at position 4, so we then know A must be at position 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on F,I,L.

But it might take another guess.

We could guess a word that has A at position 5 to test.

For pattern _ _ N _ A, and position 3: N.

What 5-letter words end with A and have N at position 3?

E.g., ""arena"" has R.

""china"" has C.

""tuna"" too short.

""donna"" has D, absent.

""manna"" has M,A,N,N,A -> but D absent? M is available.

""manna"": M,A,N,N,A? P1:M, P2:A? But A cannot be at position 2? We know A not at pos2.

""manna"" would have A at pos2 and pos5, but pos2 is invalid.

Similarly, other words.

""umbra"" has M,B,R,U,A? R absent.

Perhaps no common word.

""inertia"" too long.

So practical to assume A is at position 4.

Therefore, I'll guess ""final"".

But in ""final"", position 2 is I, which might be anything.

Another word: ""vinAl"" not, or ""winAl"" not.

""final"" or ""binal"".

""final"" is fine.

But we have position 1 and 2 to fill.

In guess 3, ""handy"" had H(x), A(-) at pos2, N(✓) at pos3, D(x), Y(x).

So we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

And we know A is at pos4 or pos5; in ""final"", we put A at pos4.

But if we are wrong, A at pos5, then in secret, position 4 is not A.

But we can guess.

To cover both, but I think it's unlikely since few words with A at pos5.

Another idea: guess a word with A at position 5.

For example, ""column"" but N? ""column"": C,O,L,U,M,N -> C absent, and N at end, not pos3.

""human"" not 5 letters.

""assai"" no N.

Perhaps ""ultra"" no N.

Words like ""organ"" has G, absent.

So maybe not.

Stick with ""final"".

Thus, next guess: ""final"". It has N at position 3 and A at position 4, which is possible, and we test.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Recap Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 ( ""crane"" ):** C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent letters: C, R, E  
     - A present, but not at position 3  
     - N present, but not at position 4
   - **Guess 2 ( ""angst"" ):** A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  
     - Absent letters: G, S, T  
     - A present, but not at position 1 (since guessed at pos 1)  
     - N present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)
   - **Guess 3 ( ""handy"" ):** H(x), A(-), N(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - Absent letters: H, D, Y  
     - A present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)  
     - N correct at position 3 (✓ confirmation)

2. **Deductions:**
   - **N is fixed at position 3** (from Guess 3 ✓ feedback).
   - **A must be in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **Cumulative absent letters:** C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y → Avoid these letters.
   - **Present letters:** Only A and N confirmed so far (with N at position 3). Since A is not at positions 1–3, it must be at 4 or 5.
   - **Other positions:** Positions 1, 2, and the non-A position (either 4 or 5) must be filled with new letters not in the absent list. Available letters: B, F, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**
   - Must place N at position 3 (known correct).
   - Must include A at either position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Choose a word with common letters to maximize information on positions 1, 2, and the variable position (4 or 5), while avoiding absent letters.
   - Words ending in A are less common (e.g., minimal valid options like ""fjord"" has D absent, ""vinyl"" has Y absent). Thus, prioritize A at position 4 for higher-probability words.
   - ""final"" (F, I, N, A, L) fits well:
     - N at position 3 (fixed ✓).
     - A at position 4 (test if A is here).
     - Positions 1, 2, and 5 filled with F, I, L (new letters, not absent).
     - If feedback for A is ✓, it solves position 4. If A is ""-"", then A must be at position 5 (and position 4 would be incorrect in this guess).
   - Alternatives like ""binal"" (less common) or ""vinal"" (rare) were considered, but ""final"" uses common letters and follows constraints.

- C(x) -> C not in word
- R(x) -> R not in word
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 3
- N(-) -> N in word, not position 4
- E(x) -> E not in word

Guess 2: angst
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 1
- N(-) -> N in word, not position 2
- G(x) -> G not in word
- S(x) -> S not in word
- T(x) -> T not in word

Guess 3: handy
- H(x) -> H not in word
- A(-) -> A in word, not position 2
- N(✓) -> N in word and correct at position 3
- D(x) -> D not in word
- Y(x) -> Y not in word

Guess 4: final
- F(x) -> F not in word
- I(x) -> I not in word
- N(✓) -> N correct at position 3 (consistent)
- A(✓) -> A in word and correct at position 4
- L(✓) -> L in word and correct at position 5

From Guess 4, we have:
- N is at position 3 (as established)
- A is at position 4 (with ✓)
- L is at position 5 (with ✓)

Also, F and I are absent (not in word).

So the secret word now has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L
- Positions 1 and 2 are unknown but must be letters not absent and satisfy the constraints.

Moreover, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.

Cumulative absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.

Therefore, available letters: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, position 1 and 2 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? Not necessarily distinct, but possible.

Also, the word must be a valid English word ending with ""NAL"" since positions 3-5 are N,A,L.

So pattern: _ _ N A L

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with two letters from the available set and ends with ""NAL"".

Available letters for positions 1 and 2: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, common words ending in ""NAL"":

e.g., ""canal"" but C is absent.

""final"" we already guessed and F is absent? In guess4 we have F(x), and ""final"" has F at start.

Other words: ""tonal"" has T, absent.

""cabal"" has C, absent.

""vocal"" has C, absent.

Possible words:

- ""nasal"" but S absent (from guess2 S(x))

""nasal"": N,A,S,A,L? Positions: P1:N, P2:A? But N is at position 3? Not, and A at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2? From guess2 or guess3, A not at pos2.

Moreover, ""nasal"" has S, absent.

Similarly, ""basal"" has B,A,S,A,L? S absent.

""basal"" would be B,A,S,A,L but S absent.

How about ""banal""? B,A,N,A,L? But N at position 3? ""banal"": B at1, A at2, N at3, A at4, L at5? But we have A at position 4 fixed? In secret word, position 4 is A and position 3 is N, so ""banal"" has the pattern: P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. However, we know A cannot be at position 2 (from guess3 handy, A(-) at position 2), so if we guessed ""banal"", A at position 2 would be invalid. But we are not guessing it now; we are considering what secret could be.

The secret word could be ""banal"", with A both at position 2 and 4? But we know from feedback that A is not at position 2. Specifically, in guess3 handy, we guessed A at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning A is not at position 2. Therefore, secret cannot have A at position 2, so ""banal"" would have A at position 2, which contradicts feedback.

Therefore, ""banal"" is impossible.

Similarly, any word with A at position 2 is invalid.

Also, word must have position 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.

Now, for position 1 and 2: any letters from available, and not A since A is fixed at position 4 and cannot be at position 1 or 2 from previous feedback.

Similarly, we already know absent letters.

Possible words ending with ""NAL"":

- ""manual"" too long.

5-letter words: let's list some.

""coral"" has C and R? Absent.

""moral"" has M,O,R,A,L? R absent.

""focal"" has C, absent.

""viral"" has R, absent.

Local search: words like ""vonal"" not word.

""zonal"" Z,O,N,A,L -> P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.

Letters: Z,O. Are these available? Yes, Z not absent, O not absent.

And ""zonal"" is a word? Yes, meaning pertaining to a zone.

Similarly, ""tonal"" has T, absent.

""boral"" not common.

""coval"" not word.

""doral"" has D, absent.

""moral"" has R, absent.

""nopal"" N,O,P,A,L? But N at position 1? Secret has N at position 3. ""nopal"": P1:N,O,P,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:P, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not the case.

The word must have N at position 3, so words like ""nopal"" have different pattern.

Pattern must be _ _ N A L, so position 3 is N.

""zonal"" fits: P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.

Similarly, ""jonal"" not word.

""kraal"" K,R,A,A,L? R absent.

""vial"" too short.

""arial"" has R? And not standard.

""axial"" has X,I? But I absent? From guess4 final I(x), so I absent.

But ""axial"" has I at position 4? A,X,I,A,L? P1:A,X,I,A,L? No, ""axial"" is A,X,I,A,L? Positions: P1:A, P2:X, P3:I, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not I.

The word must be _ _ N A L, so first two letters can be anything, but positions 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.

So ""zonal"" is one: Z,O,N,A,L.

Similarly, ""bwana"" is B,W,A,N,A? Pattern mismatch.

""quena"" has E? Not.

Another word: ""penal"" P,E,N,A,L? E absent? E is absent.

""renal"" R,E? Both absent.

""metal"" M,E,T? E and T absent.

""menal"" M,E,N,A,L? E absent.

But we have M available, E absent.

""modal"" M,O,D,A,L? D absent.

""moral"" as above.

""mural"" M,U,R,A,L? R absent.

""naval"" N? Position.

""oval"" too short.

""local"" C, absent.

So ""zonal"" seems possible.

""vocal"" C absent.

Another word: ""kanal"" K,A,N,A,L? But A at position 2? We know A not at pos2. Guess2 had A at pos1 and not, guess3 at pos2 not. So secret cannot have A at pos2.

""kanal"" would have A at pos2? K,A,N,A,L -> P1:K, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. But A at pos2 invalid.

Similarly, ""banal"" invalid.

So words with A at pos2 are out.

Now, is there another word besides ""zonal""?

""fanal"" would be F,A,N,A,L? F absent? From guess4 F(x), so F absent.

Also A at pos2? Invalid.

""pupal"" not.

""tidal"" T, absent.

""wigan"" not.

""cymal"" not word.

Possible ""zonal"" might be the only common one? Or ""tonal"" not.

""binal"" B,I,N,A,L? But I absent? From guess4 I(x), so I absent.

In ""binal"", if it were, P1:B, P2:I, but I absent.

So not.

Similarly, we have absent I.

Another word: ""monal"" M,O,N,A,L? Pattern: M,O,N,A,L -> P1:M, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. This is similar to ""zonal"" but M and O.

""monal"" is a word? Referring to a bird, monal pheasant? Not commonly used, but valid.

Similarly, ""zonal"" and ""monal"" are both possible.

""coral"" absent.

""moral"" absent.

""rural"" R absent.

So possible words: ""zonal"" (ZO + NAL), ""monal"" (MO + NAL).

Also, ""punal"" not common.

""usual"" U,S? S absent.

""venal"" V,E,N,A,L? E absent.

""mural"" R absent.

So likely ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

Now we need to guess between them.

But we have positions 1 and 2 unknown.

We can guess one of them.

Since we have only letters B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z available for positions 1 and 2, but in ""monal"" it's M and O, in ""zonal"" Z and O.

Both have O at position 2? In ""zonal"" position 2 is O.

In ""monal"" position 2 is O? MONAL: M at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.

Similarly, ZONAL: Z at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.

Both have position 2 as O.

Position 1 could be M or Z.

But also other possibilities? What about ""boral"" B,O,R,A,L? R absent.

""copal"" C, absent.

""lopal"" not word.

""qophs"" not.

So probably ""monal"" or ""zonal"".

To resolve, we need to guess a word with positions 3:N,4:A,5:L, and position 1 and 2 with available letters.

But we don't know which letter for position 1.

Since ""monal"" and ""zonal"" both have ""O"" at position 2, we can guess one.

But let's see the entire word.

In guess 4 ""final"" we have F(x) and I(x), so F and I absent.

Now, for fifth guess, we can guess, say, ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

Since ""monal"" might be less common, or we can think of other patterns.

Another word? ""karnal"" too long.

""panel"" has E? Not 5 with L.

Perhaps only those two.

But let's assume ""moral"" is absent? Not.

Position 1 and 2: could be different letters.

For example, ""manual"" is 6.

""annual"" double N, A at 1? Not pattern.

So ""zonal"" or ""monal"".

To choose, let's guess ""monal"" since M is more common than Z, or vice versa.

But Z might be less common.

We can guess a word that tests position 1.

But we have to use the pattern since we know positions 3,4,5.

So guess ""monal"".

But ""monal"" might be accepted.

Since we have the pattern, and we need to fill position 1 and 2.

But position 2 is O in both, so position 1 is the variable.

In both candidate words, position 2 is O.

Therefore, we know position 2 is O? Not necessarily, but available letters.

Perhaps position 2 is O.

Since it appears in both common possibilities.

But we don't know for sure.

There might be other words, like ""pawal"" not word.

Or ""jawal"" not.

So we can guess with O at position 2 to confirm.

For example, guess a word like ""___NAL"" with position 2 as O.

Then position 1 needs to be any available letter.

For instance, ""bonal"" not word.

""jonal"" not.

""konal"" not.

""monal"" is one.

""uonal"" not.

""ponal"" P,O,N,A,L? Is this a word? Not common.

Similarly, ""wonal"" not.

""yonal"" Y absent.

So only ""monal"" and ""zonal"" are dictionary words.

Therefore, between M and Z for position 1.

Since we have to guess, and ""monal"" might be more plausible.

But ""zonal"" is also valid.

To test, we can guess ""zonal"" for example.

But let's see the feedback history.

Since we are at guess 5, we have two tries left.

Guess ""monal"".

If wrong, guess ""zonal"" next.

But we can do it.

To save a guess, but not necessary.

Perhaps ""canal"" but C absent.

No.

Another idea: position 1 could be B for ""banal"", but ""banal"" has A at position 2, invalid.

Or ""vinal"" V,I,N,A,L? I absent.

Not.

So I think ""monal"" or ""zonal"".

Choose ""monal"".

So guess ""monal"".

But let's confirm.

secret word must be from available letters.

Position 1: in ""monal"" is M.

M not in absent list.

Position 2: O.

O not absent.

Yes.

Similarly for ""zonal"".

Now ,guess ""monal"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is present but not at position 3; N is present but not at position 4; C, R, E absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""angst"")**: A is present but not at position 1; N is present but not at position 2; G, S, T absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""handy"")**: N is confirmed at position 3; A is present but not at position 2; H, D, Y absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""final"")**: N is confirmed at position 3; A is confirmed at position 4; L is confirmed at position 5; F, I absent.

2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word ends with ""NAL"" (positions 3-5: N, A, L fixed).
   - **Cumulative absent letters**: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I (avoid these).
   - **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - Position 1 and 2 cannot contain A (A is fixed at position 4, and feedback confirms A not at positions 1-3).
   - Only valid English words fitting the pattern _ _ N A L work.
   - Possible words include ""zonal"" (Z O N A L) and ""monal"" (M O N A L), both ending with ""NAL"" and using available letters.

3. **Strategy**:
   - ""monal"" is tested first due to M being a more common starting letter than Z.
   - If incorrect, ""zonal"" can be guessed next with the remaining try.

We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n   - It has \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\' — all fairly common.\n   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"", but ""CRANE"" is a popular choice.\n\n Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, I need to recap the feedback from the first guess.\n\nThe first guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:\n- C: x → C is not in the secret word.\n- R: x → R is not in the secret word.\n- A: - → A is in the secret word but not in the correct position.\n- N: - → N is in the secret word but not in the correct position.\n- E: x → E is not in the secret word.\n\nSo, from this, I know:\n- Letters C, R, and E are not present in the secret word. That means I should avoid using these letters in future guesses.\n- Letters A and N are in the word, but since they were marked with \'-\', they are in the wrong position.\n\nIn ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N was in position 4. But since they\'re not correct there, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters, so A could be in positions 1,2,4, or 5? Let\'s list the positions:\n- Position 1: C (but C is out)\n- Position 2: R (out)\n- Position 3: A (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 3)\n- Position 4: N (in word but wrong pos, so not pos 4)\n- Position 5: E (out)\n\nTherefore, for A, it must be in positions 1,2, or 5. But positions: 1 and 2 letters are C and R, which are out. Position 1 (C) is out, position 2 (R) is out. Position 5 (E) is out. So possible positions for A: 1,2,5 are all incorrect because those letters are wrong, but the position might be available.\n\nThe word has letters in different positions. Since C, R, E are not in the word at all, positions 1, 2, and 5 could potentially hold different letters. A must be in one of the positions except position 3. Similarly, N must be in one of the positions except position 4.\n\nAvailable positions: 1,2,3,4,5 but:\n- Position 1: cannot be C, but can be other letters.\n- Position 1 had C which is not in word, so position 1 might still be open for other letters.\nSimilarly for position 2 and 5.\n\nSo A must appear in the word, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? Position 4 had N which is present but wrong position, but that doesn\'t affect the position availability for A directly.\n\nI need to think about where A and N can be.\n\nThe secret word contains A and N somewhere else.\n\nAlso, I know C, R, E are not in the word, so I must avoid them.\n\nFor my next guess, I should use a word that includes A and N, since they are present, and I need to place them correctly. Also, I should avoid C, R, E.\n\nMoreover, I should introduce new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon English letters: after vowels like A, consonants like S, T, L, etc.\n\nLetters in the word so far: A and N are confirmed, C,R,E not present.\n\nPotential letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nFirst, let\'s think about possible words with A and N.\n\nA is not at position 3, N is not at position 4.\n\nIn ""crane"", position 3 was A, which is wrong, so A could be at pos 1,2,4,5? But let\'s see the word structure.\n\nAs of now, secret word has: A somewhere not pos 3, N somewhere not pos 4.\n\nNow, for my guess, I need to place A and N in different positions to test.\n\nAlso, since it\'s a 5-letter word, I need to include other letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words with A and N.\n\nExamples: ""sandy"" – but Y is common? Better to stick to common words.\n\nOr ""plant"" – has P,L,A,N,T.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: C,R,E are out, so ""plant"" doesn\'t have R, which is good.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T.\n\nPositions: if I use ""plant"", with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nBut from feedback, A is not at position 3? Wait, feedback was for ""crane"" at pos 3 A is wrong position, so for ""plant"", if I put A at pos 3, it might still be wrong because in secret word A is not at pos 3.\n\nYes, A cannot be at pos 3 because of the first feedback.\n\nIn ""plant"", A is at position 3, but since secret A is not at pos 3, that would be incorrect. So if I use ""plant"" and A is at pos 3, feedback would show ""-"" for A if secret has A elsewhere, but since I know A is not at 3, I might avoid putting it there to save a guess? Actually, it\'s fine because I can still get information about other letters.\n\nPerhaps I should put A in a different position to test a possible location.\n\nSimilarly for N, not at position 4.\n\nIn ""plant"", N is at position 4, which might be wrong if in secret N is not there.\n\nBut I can use ""plant"" to confirm.\n\nAnother word: ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D.\n\nA at position 3? Same as above.\n\nPosition 3 is often problematic.\n\nWhat about words where A is at position 1 or 2?\n\nFor example, ""adopt""? But O? ""adorn"" has R, but R is out.\n\nR is out, so words with R are bad.\n\n""panel"" – P,A,N,E,L. But E is out, E is not in word, since E was x in crane.\n\nIn feedback, E is not in word, so I cannot use E.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, E.\n\nSo ""panel"" has E, which is invalid? No, I can guess any valid English word, but if I use a letter that\'s not in the secret, it will show x, which might waste a position.\n\nBut I can guess words with letters from the previous ones.\n\n""plant"": P, L, A, N, T – all possible, and A at 3, N at 4, but I know A shouldn\'t be at 3, N shouldn\'t be at 4, so if I guess ""plant"", I expect A and N to be wrong position, unless I get lucky.\n\nThe feedback for A and N might not be optimal because I know they are misplaced.\n\nAnother idea: I should try to place A in position 1 or 2.\n\nWhat words start with A and contain N?\n\n""angst"" – A,N,G,S,T\n\nPositions: A1, N2, G3, S4, T5\n\nBut N at position 2? In feedback, N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, A at position 1, which is a possibility.\n\n""angst"" letters: A,N,G,S,T – S and T are common.\n\nAnd no C,R,E.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""anvil"" has I,V? ""anode"" has O,E but E out.\n\n""anvil"": A,N,V,I,L – V and L,L.\n\nLetters: A,N,V,I,L.\n\nI could use.\n\nBut ""angst"" seems good: common word.\n\nAnother option: ""hands"" – H,A,E? E is out, so no.\n\n""lanky"" – L,A,N,K,Y.\n\nPossible.\n\nBut I think ""angst"" is fine.\n\nWith ""angst"":\n- Position 1: A, if A is supposed to be elsewhere, I get -\n- Position 2: N, similarly\n- Etc.\n\nIf secret A is not at 1, and N not at 2, but they are both present, I might get - for both if position wrong.\n\nBut since A cannot be at 3, position 1 is a good test.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be at 4, position 2 is different.\n\nTo maximize information, I could choose a word with letters not yet tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", I tested C,R,A,N,E.\n\nSo letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\n\nPresent: A,N\n\nAbsent: C,R,E\n\nNew letters should be introduced: e.g., S,T,L,O,D, etc.\n\nFor ""angst"", it introduces G,S,T.\n\nAlso, A and N are included.\n\nPositions in ""angst"":\n- A at position 1\n- N at position 2\n- G at position 3\n- S at position 4\n- T at position 5\n\nNow, from previous, A cannot be at position 3, so position 1 is new.\n\nN cannot be at position 4, so position 2 is new for N? Position 2 wasn\'t tested before.\n\nPrevious guess had N at position 4, which is wrong.\n\nNow N at position 2, which could be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 was A before, but now G is there.\n\nPosition 4 had N before, now S is there.\n\nPosition 5 had E, now T.\n\nI think ""angst"" is a reasonable second guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if I can find a word with A not at 3 and N not at 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""stain"" – S,T,A,I,N\n\nPositions: S1, T2, A3, I4, N5\n\nBut A at position 3 – but we know A cannot be at position 3 because of the first feedback. So if I use ""stain"", A is at pos 3, which will be incorrect, and I\'ll get ""-"" for A, confirming what I already know. But I might waste a chance to test other positions.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 5, which is new.\n\nPosition 5 had E, which is out, so new.\n\nIn ""stain"": A at 3 (known wrong), N at 5 (could be possible).\n\nBut A at 3 is redundant because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo I should avoid placing A at position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly for N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, words like ""plant"" or ""stain"" with A at position 3 should be avoided to save a position.\n\nSimilarly, N at position 4.\n\nSo ""angst"" has A at 1, N at 2, so both are in different positions.\n\n""panel"" has A at 2, N at 2? No, ""panel"" is P,A,N,E,L – A at 2, but E is out.\n\nE absent, so not good.\n\n""manic"" – M,A,N,I,C – C out, bad.\n\n""banal"" – B,A,N,A,L – has double A, but only one A might be present? Feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple letters.\n\nIn Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, it depends on the secret word.\n\nBut in feedback, I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, if secret is ""apple"" and guess ""panel"", P might be correct or something.\n\nBut here, ""crane"" had single letters.\n\nPerhaps stick to distinct letters for clarity.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nHowever for now, ""angst"" has distinct letters except perhaps none repeated.\n\nA,N,G,S,T all distinct.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother word: ""tangy"" – T,A,N,G,Y – similar, but Y might be less common.\n\n""angst"" is better.\n\nOr ""stand"" – S,T,A,N,D – but A at position 3, which is invalid to place.\n\nIn ""stand"", A at 3.\n\nSimilarly ""land"" is 4 letters.\n\n""brand"" has R, out.\n\nSo probably ""angst"" or something with A at start or end.\n\n""abide"" has I,E? E out.\n\n""knack"" has K,C out? C is out, K possible.\n\nBut double K, messy.\n\nPerhaps ""angle"" – A,N,G,L,E – E out.\n\nE is not in word.\n\nLetters to use: avoid C,R,E.\n\nVowels: we have A, could be O,I,U, but U less common.\n\nConsonants: B,D,F,G,H,etc.\n\nSo ""angst"" seems fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""angst"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word.\n\n""angst"" is a valid word.\n\nIn feedback, we will see where A and N are according to their positions.\n\nIf A is correct at position 1, I get ✓, else -\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, G,S,T are new, so I can learn about them.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo my second guess: angst.<thoughts>\nFrom the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:\n- C(x): C is not in the secret word.\n- R(x): R is not in the secret word.\n- A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n- N(-): N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- E(x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nThis gives us:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E → These must not be used in subsequent guesses.\n- Present letters: A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at position 3, N not at position 4).\n- Possible positions for A: Since position 3 is invalid for A, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 4-5 (but based on feedback, position 1 and 2 were occupied by absent letters C and R, so positions 1 and 2 are still candidates for A as long as not C or R, which they aren\'t). Similarly, N cannot be at position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.\n- The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, with A and N included somewhere.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I should prioritize words that include A and N to test their correct positions, while avoiding the absent letters C, R, E.\n- To maximize new information, I should introduce common English letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, G, etc.), as only C, R, A, N, E have been tested.\n- Avoid placing A at position 3 again, since we know it\'s incorrect from feedback. Similarly, avoid placing N at position 4.\n- A good choice is ""angst"": \n  - It contains A and N.\n  - Avoids C, R, E.\n  - Uses new common letters: G, S, T.\n  - Positions: A at position 1 (tests a new possible position), N at position 2 (tests a new possible position), G at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5.\n  - This will provide feedback on whether A is at position 1, N is at position 2, and whether G, S, or T are in the word and in what positions.\n  - ""angst"" is a valid English word.\n\nAlternatives considered: \n- ""stain"" (but A is at position 3, which we know is wrong, wasting a test opportunity). \n- ""plant"" (A at position 3, same issue). \n- ""angle"" (includes E, which is absent).  \n""angst"" is efficient for gathering new information while respecting the feedback.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>angst</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""angst"" -> A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- N is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed at position 2, got \'-\').\n- G, S, T are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T\n- Present letters: A and N (both must be in the word, but we don\'t know their positions yet)\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- A cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions, and both A and N are present. Also, we have 6 absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T.\n\nWe need to find a word that includes A and N, avoids C,R,E,G,S,T, and places A and N in the possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for A: 2,4,5\nPossible positions for N: 1,3,5\n\nBut note: position 5 could be claimed by either A or N, but not both unless the word has two of the same letter? But we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any indication of duplicates, so we should consider both possibilities.\n\nBut let\'s list the available positions:\n\nPosition 1: Only N can be here (since A cannot be at 1, and N can be at 1)\nPosition 2: Only A can be here (since N cannot be at 2, and A can be at 2)\nPosition 3: Only N can be here (A cannot be at 3, and N can be at 3)\nPosition 4: Only A can be here (N cannot be at 4, and A can be at 4)\nPosition 5: Both A and N can be here, but only one can occupy it.\n\nSo the word must have:\n- At position 1: either N or not (if not, then it must be a letter we haven\'t tested, but we have constraints)\nActually, position 1 must be one of the letters that is not absent, and it could be N or a new letter.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut we know A and N must be placed in the word.\n\nLet me denote the positions:\n\nLet P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 be the positions.\n\nConstraints:\n- P1: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T. So P1 must be N or another letter not tested (but we have only A and N as known present, and others must be new and not absent).\n- Similarly, P2: cannot be N (from guess2), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P2 could be A or a new letter.\n- P3: cannot be A (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and N can be here. So P3 could be N or a new letter.\n- P4: cannot be N (from guess1), cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and A can be here. So P4 could be A or a new letter.\n- P5: cannot be C,R,E,G,S,T, and can be A or N or a new letter.\n\nBut we know that A must be in one of P2, P4, P5 and N must be in one of P1, P3, P5.\n\nAlso, since there are only 5 positions, and two of them are A and N, the other three must be new letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T. So available letters: all others except these and the absent ones.\n\nAlphabet minus absent: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut we have A and N already, so the other three letters must be from B,D,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word that includes A and N, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we need to place A and N in the allowed positions.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: N is at position 1.\nThen A must be at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nBut if N is at P1, then P2 can be A? Yes, because A can be at P2.\n\nSimilarly, if N is at P1, then P3 must be a new letter (since N is at P1, not P3), and P4 can be A or new, P5 can be A or new.\n\nBut A must be somewhere.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that tests possible positions for A and N.\n\nFor example, we can try to put A at position 2 and N at position 3? Let\'s see:\n\nIf we put A at P2 and N at P3, then:\nP1: must be a new letter (since not A, not N at P1? N is at P3, so P1 is free for new)\nP4: new letter\nP5: new letter\n\nBut we need to form a word.\n\nSimilarly, we could put N at P1 and A at P4, for example.\n\nBut let\'s think of actual words.\n\nWe need a word with A and N, avoiding C,R,E,G,S,T.\n\nList of possible words:\n\n- If N at P1: words starting with N, then A in P2, P4, or P5.\n\nExamples:\n- N at P1, A at P2: e.g., ""naive"" but E is out. ""nappy"" has P, but double P? ""nappy"" is a word, but let\'s see letters: N,A,P,P,Y. E is not in it, but we have to avoid E? E is absent, so we can\'t use E, but ""nappy"" doesn\'t have E. But S and T are absent, but not in ""nappy"". G absent, not in. So ""nappy"" has N,A,P,P,Y. But P is not tested yet.\n\nBut we have double P, which might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find words with distinct letters to get more information.\n\n""naval"" has V,A,L, but A at P2? N at P1, A at P2: ""naval"" -> N,A,V,A,L. Double A, and V and L.\n\nBut A is already present, so double A might be possible.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n""nadir"" has R, which is absent. R is out.\n\n""naked"" has E and D? E is out.\n\n""nappy"" might be acceptable, but let\'s see other options.\n\nAnother: N at P1, A at P4: e.g., ""nomad"" has O,M,A,D. A at P4? ""nomad"": N,O,M,A,D -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:M, P4:A, P5:D. A at P4, which is allowed. And no absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, N at P1, A at P5: e.g., ""novel"" has O,V,E,L but E out. ""noble"" has E. ""nymph"" has Y,M,P,H. A not present? We need A in the word. So must have A.\n\nSo for N at P1 and A at P5: ""nubia""? Not common. ""noria"" has O,R,I,A but R out. Hard.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nNow, if N at P3: then A can be at P2, P4, P5.\n\nFor example, N at P3, A at P2: e.g., ""manic"" has C, out. ""panic"" has C. ""banjo"" has B,A,N,J,O -> P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:J, P5:O. A at P2, N at P3. Both positions allowed? A at P2: yes, because A can be at P2. N at P3: yes, because N can be at P3. And letters: B,A,N,J,O. Absent letters: C,R,E,G,S,T not in this, so okay.\n\n""banjo"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, N at P3, A at P4: e.g., ""urban"" has U,R,B,A,N but R out. ""organ"" has G, out. ""titan"" has T, out. Hard.\n\nN at P3, A at P5: e.g., ""latin"" has T, out. ""rabin"" not word. ""cumin"" has U,M,I,N, but A not present? Must have A.\n\n""china"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C is out.\n\nTricky.\n\nNow, if N at P5: then A can be at P2 or P4.\n\nFor example, N at P5, A at P2: e.g., ""cabin"" has C, out. ""basin"" has S, out. ""fagin"" not common. ""tapin"" not word.\n\nN at P5, A at P4: e.g., ""train"" has T,R, out. ""plain"" has P,L,A,I,N -> P1:P, P2:L, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! From first feedback, A not at P3. So if we put A at P3, it would be wrong, but we know it\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t.\n\nIn ""plain"", A is at P3, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""chain"" has C, out.\n\n""drain"" has D,R,A,I,N -> R out.\n\nSo difficult.\n\nTherefore, the easier cases are:\n\n- N at P1 and A at P4: e.g., ""nomad""\n- N at P1 and A at P2: e.g., ""naval"" or ""nappy"" but with duplicates\n- N at P3 and A at P2: e.g., ""banjo""\n\nAlso, we have the case where both A and N at P5? But P5 can only have one letter, so they can\'t both be at P5 unless same letter, but A and N are different.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, let\'s list possible words:\n\n1. ""nomad"": N at P1, A at P4. Letters: N,O,M,A,D. All new except N and A. O, M, D are new.\n\n2. ""banjo"": B at P1, A at P2, N at P3, J at P4, O at P5. B, J, O new.\n\n3. ""naval"": N at P1, A at P2, V at P3, A at P4, L at P5. But double A, and V and L new. But we don\'t know if secret has double A.\n\n4. ""nappy"": N at P1, A at P2, P at P3, P at P4, Y at P5. Double P.\n\nTo get more information, ""nomad"" and ""banjo"" have distinct letters.\n\n""nomad"" tests N at P1 and A at P4.\n\nIf N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else if not, then N must be at P3 or P5.\n\nSimilarly for A at P4.\n\nIn ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe also need to consider common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: L, O, U, D, B, P, etc.\n\n""nomad"" has O, M, D.\n\n""banjo"" has B, J, O.\n\nJ is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""nomad"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""nodal"" – N,O,D,A,L. But A at P4? ""nodal"": N,O,D,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:D, P4:A, P5:L. So A at P4, N at P1. Same as ""nomad"" but with L instead of M.\n\n""nodal"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""vocal"" has C, out.\n\n""focal"" has C.\n\nSo ""nodal"" or ""nomad"".\n\nBut ""nomad"" might be more common.\n\nWe could test if N is at P1.\n\nIf we guess ""nomad"" and N is at P1, we get ✓ for N, else - or x, but we know N is present, so if not at P1, it must be - meaning wrong position.\n\nSimilarly for A at P4.\n\nAlso, we get info on O, M, D.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""banjo"", we test A at P2 and N at P3.\n\nNow, from the position constraints, if N is not at P1, then it must be at P3 or P5.\n\nSimilarly, if A is not at P1 (which we know), and not at P3 (known), so P2, P4, P5.\n\nBy guessing ""banjo"", if A is at P2, we might get ✓, else -.\n\nSimilarly for N at P3.\n\nBut let\'s see which positions are more likely.\n\nSince P1 must be N or a new letter, and similarly for others.\n\nBut to break the tie, I think ""banjo"" might be better because it tests two positions that are not the edges.\n\nP2 and P3 are middle positions.\n\nIn ""nomad"", we test P1 and P4.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""banjo"" to have a different set of letters.\n\nBut J is not very common, so maybe not.\n\nAnother word: ""manor"" has R, out.\n\n""major"" has M,A,J,O,R but R out.\n\n""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> P1:P, P2:I, P3:A? A at P3? But A cannot be at P3! So invalid.\n\n""plain"" has A at P3, invalid.\n\n""lilac"" has L,I,L,A,C but C out.\n\n""valid"" has V,A,L,I,D -> P1:V, P2:A, P3:L, P4:I, P5:D. A at P2, which is allowed. But N? We need to include N. ""valid"" has no N, so it doesn\'t have N, but we know N is present, so we must include N in the guess.\n\nThe guess must include both A and N because they are present.\n\nSo we cannot guess a word without A or without N.\n\nTherefore, ""valid"" is invalid for this purpose.\n\nSimilarly, we must have both.\n\nSo back to ""banjo"" or ""nomad"".\n\nAnother word: ""anode"" has E, out.\n\n""alone"" has E, out.\n\n""algin"" not common.\n\n""admin"" has D,M,I,N, but A? P1:A? But A cannot be at P1 from guess2. ""admin"": A,D,M,I,N -> A at P1, which is not allowed because we know A is not at P1.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""dandy"" has D,A,N,D,Y -> A at P2, N at P3? ""dandy"": D,A,N,D,Y -> P1:D, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y. So A at P2, N at P3, and double D. But D is new.\n\n""dandy"" is a word, and avoids absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""handy"" has H,A,N,D,Y -> same positions, but H instead of D at P1? ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y -> P1:H, P2:A, P3:N, P4:D, P5:Y.\n\nA at P2, N at P3, both allowed.\n\nAnd letters: H,A,N,D,Y. Absent letters not included.\n\nSo ""handy"" is a good option.\n\nSimilarly, ""bandy"" B,A,N,D,Y.\n\nOr ""candy"" has C, out.\n\nSo ""handy"" or ""dandy"" or ""bandy"".\n\n""handy"" is common.\n\nWith ""handy"":\n- P1: H (new)\n- P2: A (test if A is at P2)\n- P3: N (test if N is at P3)\n- P4: D (new)\n- P5: Y (new)\n\nIf A is at P2, we get ✓, else - (but since A is present, it must be - meaning it\'s elsewhere, but we know it can be P4 or P5).\n\nSimilarly for N at P3.\n\nThis will give good information.\n\nCompared to ""banjo"", ""handy"" has more common letters.\n\n""handy"" also has Y, which is less common, but acceptable.\n\n""bandy"" is similar.\n\nI think ""handy"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""handy"" and the secret has A at P2 and N at P3, we get both correct, which is good.\n\nIf not, we know where they are not.\n\nAlso, we learn about H, D, Y.\n\nSince we have limited letters left, we might solve it.\n\nAnother word: ""panic"" has C, out.\n\n""manic"" has C.\n\n""lapin"" not common.\n\nSo I think ""handy"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""handy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)**  \n  - This means:  \n    - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.  \n    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 3.  \n    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""angst"" → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)**  \n  - This means:  \n    - A is in the secret word but **not** in position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and marked as ""-"").  \n    - N is in the secret word but **not** in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as ""-"").  \n    - G, S, and T are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Absent Letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.  \n- **Present Letters (must include):** A and N are confirmed to be in the secret word.  \n- **Position Constraints for A:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"" feedback).  \n  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback).  \n  - Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  \n- **Position Constraints for N:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"" feedback).  \n  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).  \n  - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n- **Available Positions Summary:**  \n  - Position 1: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 2: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 3: Can only be N (since A is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 4: Can only be A (since N is excluded here) or a new letter.  \n  - Position 5: Can be A, N, or a new letter (but only one letter can occupy it).  \n- **Available Letters:** All letters except the absent ones (C, R, E, G, S, T). This includes: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Since A and N are already known, the other 3 letters must be from the remaining pool.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Must include both A and N to test their positions.  \n- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, E, G, S, T).  \n- Prioritize words that test plausible positions for A and N to maximize information:  \n  - A should be placed in position 2, 4, or 5.  \n  - N should be placed in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n- Choose a word with common letters to increase chances of hits.  \n- Consider words like ""handy"" (H, A, N, D, Y):  \n  - A is in position 2 (a valid test position).  \n  - N is in position 3 (a valid test position).  \n  - H, D, and Y are new, common-enough letters not yet tested.  \n- Alternatives like ""banjo"" (B, A, N, J, O) or ""nomad"" (N, O, M, A, D) were considered, but ""handy"" uses more common letters (J in ""banjo"" is less common).  \n\n### Why ""handy""?\n- Tests A at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know A must be in position 4 or 5.  \n- Tests N at position 3: If correct, we get ""✓""; if not, we know N must be in position 1 or 5.  \n- Introduces H, D, and Y: Feedback on these will help narrow down the secret word.  \n- ""handy"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>handy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C(x): C not in word\n- R(x): R not in word\n- A(-): A in word, not position 3\n- N(-): N in word, not position 4\n- E(x): E not in word\n\nGuess 2: ""angst""\n- A(-): A in word, not position 1\n- N(-): N in word, not position 2\n- G(x): G not in word\n- S(x): S not in word\n- T(x): T not in word\n\nGuess 3: ""handy""\n- H(x): H not in word\n- A(-): A in word, not position 2 (since we guessed A at position 2)\n- N(✓): N is in word and correct at position 3 (since N was guessed at position 3 and got ✓)\n- D(x): D not in word\n- Y(x): Y not in word\n\nSo now we know:\n\n1. N is at position 3! Because we got ✓ for N at position 3.\n\n2. A is present but not at position 1 (from guess2), not at position 2 (from guess3), and not at position 3 (from guess1, and position 3 is taken by N now). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.\n\n3. Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y. So absent: C, D, E, G, H, R, S, T, Y.\n\n4. Letters that must be present: A and N (but N is placed at position 3). So A is still unplaced, but in the word.\n\n5. Since ""handy"" had A at position 2 and we got ""-"" meaning A is not at position 2, and position 3 is N, so for A, positions 4 and 5 are possibilities.\n\n6. We also know that N is fixed at position 3.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4 or 5: A\n- The other positions: two or three other letters? Since word is 5 letters: position 1,2,4,5 to be filled but position 4 or 5 is A.\n\nAlso, absent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y.\n\nAvailable letters: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But A and N are already used? N is used but fixed at position 3. We might have other instances? But so far, no duplicates.\n\nWe need to place A at position 4 or 5, and the other positions must be letters from the available set.\n\nBut note, the word must contain only A and N as known letters? Not necessarily, there might be additional letters.\n\nIn ""handy"", we only know about A and N being present, but H,D,Y are out. And from previous, C,R,E,G,S,T are out.\n\nSo the word has N at position 3, A at either position 4 or 5, and positions 1,2, and the other of 4/5 must have new letters.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If A is at position 4, then positions 1,2,5 are new letters (but one of them is A? No), A is at 4, so pos 1,2,5 are non-A, non-N? But A is only one? Not necessarily, but for now.\n\nBut we have limited absent letters.\n\nLet me list the secret word structure:\nPos1: ? (not absent)\nPos2: ? (not absent)\nPos3: N (fixed)\nPos4: A or a new letter\nPos5: if pos4 is A, then pos5 is new; if pos4 is not A, then A must be at pos5.\n\nSince A must be at pos4 or pos5, we have two cases.\n\nAlso, note that in positions 1,2, the letters cannot be A because if A were at position 1 or 2, we would have it, but we know A is not at pos1 or pos2.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 is N, so not A.\n\nTherefore, positions 1 and 2 must not be A.\n\nSo for pos4 and pos5: one of them is A, the other is a new letter or possibly N but N is at pos3.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that has N at position 3, and includes A at position 4 or 5.\n\nAlso, avoid absent letters.\n\nFirst, let\'s see if we can guess a word with A at position 4 or 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf A at position 4: then word pattern _ _ N A _\n\nIf A at position 5: then word pattern _ _ N _ A\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not absent.\n\nAbsent letters: C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y\n\nSo available: A,B,F,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z\n\nBut N is already at pos3, so we can use other letters.\n\nFor example, with A at position 4: _ _ N A _\n\nFill positions 1,2,5 with available letters.\n\nSimilarly for the other pattern.\n\nSince we are in guess 4, we need to be efficient.\n\nTo test both possibilities, we can guess a word that covers both cases.\n\nOr choose one.\n\nBut let\'s see common words.\n\nFor pattern _ _ N A _, words like ""final"" but E? ""final"" has F,I,N,A,L -> but L? And E not present.\n\n""final"": F at pos1, I at pos2, N at pos3, A at pos4, L at pos5.\n\nLetters absent? C,D,E,G,H,R,S,T,Y: none of these in ""final"", so okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""mina"" not 5 letters.\n\n""pinna"" has N,N? Double.\n\n""viral"" has R, absent.\n\n""jural"" not common.\n\n""focal"" has C, absent.\n\nSo ""final"" is possible.\n\nBut ""final"" has I and L.\n\nAnother: ""binal"" not common.\n\n""kinas"" has S, absent.\n\nSo ""final"" might work.\n\nNow pattern _ _ N _ A: e.g., ""linen"" has E and N? E absent. ""tonal"" has T,O? T absent. ""canon"" has C, absent.\n\n""bonus"" has S, absent.\n\n""focus"" has C, absent.\n\n""labor"" has R, absent.\n\n""manor"" has R, absent.\n\n""minor"" has R, absent.\n\n""piano"" has P,I,A,N,O -> but A at position 4? ""piano"": P at1, I at2, A at3, N at4, O at5? But N is at position 3? In this pattern, if we want A at pos5, then ""piano"" has A at pos3 which we know is invalid, and we are considering A at pos5.\n\nWe need words ending with A.\n\nE.g., ""pizza"" has Z,A, but Z,Z? and no N? Must have N at pos3.\n\n""arena"" has R, absent.\n\n""atone"" has R? ""atone"": A,T,O,N,E -> T and E absent.\n\n""china"" has C, absent.\n\n""tibia"" same.\n\nWords like ""ultra"" has T,U,L,T,R but T and R absent, and no N.\n\nWe need N at position 3, so letter at pos3 must be N.\n\nFor pattern _ _ N _ A: examples with available letters.\n\nE.g., ""benna"" has E? ""gamma"" double M, no N.\n\n""inula"" not common.\n\n""lemma"" no N.\n\n""prima"" has R.\n\nPerhaps few common words ending with A and N at position 3.\n\n""minus"" has S, absent.\n\nTherefore, words with A at position 5 might be less common. So likely A is at position 4.\n\nThat is, the word is _ _ N A _\n\nNow, positions 1,2,5 to fill.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z\n\nCommon words: ""final"" as I said.\n\nBut what about position 5? In ""final"" it\'s L.\n\nOther words: ""vinal"" not common.\n\n""final"" might be the most common.\n\n""minbar"" too long.\n\n""pinna"" is P,I,N,N,A but double N and A at end? ""pinna"": P1:P, P2:I, P3:N, P4:N, P5:A? But we have N at pos3 and pos4? Possible, but not necessarily.\n\nIn our case, secret has N at pos3, so for ""pinna"", P3 and P4 are both N, but secret only confirmed N at pos3? We don\'t know if there is another N.\n\nBut ""pinna"" might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s stick to ""final"".\n\nAnother word: ""linac"" has C, absent.\n\n""binal"" not common.\n\n""fiord"" has D? D is absent? From handy, D(x), so D absent.\n\nIn ""final"", D not present.\n\nAbsent: D is one, so in ""final"", letters F,I,N,A,L: none absent.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""omega"" has E,G, absent.\n\n""opera"" has O,P,E,R? E and R absent.\n\nSo ""final"" is good.\n\nTo test position 5, we can guess ""final"" and if A is at position 4, we might get ✓ for A if correct.\n\nEven if not, we learn.\n\nSince we have only two possibilities for A: position 4 or 5.\n\nWe can also guess a word that has A at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nFirst, if we guess ""final"":\n- P1: F\n- P2: I\n- P3: N (fixed, should be ✓)\n- P4: A\n- P5: L\n\nIf in secret, A is at position 4, then we get ✓ for A at position 4, and we might solve the word.\n\nIf secret A is at position 5, then for A at position 4, we get ""-"" meaning A is present but not at position 4, so we then know A must be at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback on F,I,L.\n\nBut it might take another guess.\n\nWe could guess a word that has A at position 5 to test.\n\nFor pattern _ _ N _ A, and position 3: N.\n\nWhat 5-letter words end with A and have N at position 3?\n\nE.g., ""arena"" has R.\n\n""china"" has C.\n\n""tuna"" too short.\n\n""donna"" has D, absent.\n\n""manna"" has M,A,N,N,A -> but D absent? M is available.\n\n""manna"": M,A,N,N,A? P1:M, P2:A? But A cannot be at position 2? We know A not at pos2.\n\n""manna"" would have A at pos2 and pos5, but pos2 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\n""umbra"" has M,B,R,U,A? R absent.\n\nPerhaps no common word.\n\n""inertia"" too long.\n\nSo practical to assume A is at position 4.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""final"".\n\nBut in ""final"", position 2 is I, which might be anything.\n\nAnother word: ""vinAl"" not, or ""winAl"" not.\n\n""final"" or ""binal"".\n\n""final"" is fine.\n\nBut we have position 1 and 2 to fill.\n\nIn guess 3, ""handy"" had H(x), A(-) at pos2, N(✓) at pos3, D(x), Y(x).\n\nSo we need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nAnd we know A is at pos4 or pos5; in ""final"", we put A at pos4.\n\nBut if we are wrong, A at pos5, then in secret, position 4 is not A.\n\nBut we can guess.\n\nTo cover both, but I think it\'s unlikely since few words with A at pos5.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word with A at position 5.\n\nFor example, ""column"" but N? ""column"": C,O,L,U,M,N -> C absent, and N at end, not pos3.\n\n""human"" not 5 letters.\n\n""assai"" no N.\n\nPerhaps ""ultra"" no N.\n\nWords like ""organ"" has G, absent.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nStick with ""final"".\n\nThus, next guess: ""final"". It has N at position 3 and A at position 4, which is possible, and we test.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Recap Feedback:**\n   - **Guess 1 ( ""crane"" ):** C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  \n     - Absent letters: C, R, E  \n     - A present, but not at position 3  \n     - N present, but not at position 4\n   - **Guess 2 ( ""angst"" ):** A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  \n     - Absent letters: G, S, T  \n     - A present, but not at position 1 (since guessed at pos 1)  \n     - N present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)\n   - **Guess 3 ( ""handy"" ):** H(x), A(-), N(✓), D(x), Y(x)  \n     - Absent letters: H, D, Y  \n     - A present, but not at position 2 (since guessed at pos 2)  \n     - N correct at position 3 (✓ confirmation)\n\n2. **Deductions:**\n   - **N is fixed at position 3** (from Guess 3 ✓ feedback).\n   - **A must be in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.\n   - **Cumulative absent letters:** C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y → Avoid these letters.\n   - **Present letters:** Only A and N confirmed so far (with N at position 3). Since A is not at positions 1–3, it must be at 4 or 5.\n   - **Other positions:** Positions 1, 2, and the non-A position (either 4 or 5) must be filled with new letters not in the absent list. Available letters: B, F, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**\n   - Must place N at position 3 (known correct).\n   - Must include A at either position 4 or 5 to test its location.\n   - Choose a word with common letters to maximize information on positions 1, 2, and the variable position (4 or 5), while avoiding absent letters.\n   - Words ending in A are less common (e.g., minimal valid options like ""fjord"" has D absent, ""vinyl"" has Y absent). Thus, prioritize A at position 4 for higher-probability words.\n   - ""final"" (F, I, N, A, L) fits well:\n     - N at position 3 (fixed ✓).\n     - A at position 4 (test if A is here).\n     - Positions 1, 2, and 5 filled with F, I, L (new letters, not absent).\n     - If feedback for A is ✓, it solves position 4. If A is ""-"", then A must be at position 5 (and position 4 would be incorrect in this guess).\n   - Alternatives like ""binal"" (less common) or ""vinal"" (rare) were considered, but ""final"" uses common letters and follows constraints.\n\n### Response:\n\n<guess>final</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: final -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) N(✓) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane\n- C(x) -> C not in word\n- R(x) -> R not in word\n- A(-) -> A in word, not position 3\n- N(-) -> N in word, not position 4\n- E(x) -> E not in word\n\nGuess 2: angst\n- A(-) -> A in word, not position 1\n- N(-) -> N in word, not position 2\n- G(x) -> G not in word\n- S(x) -> S not in word\n- T(x) -> T not in word\n\nGuess 3: handy\n- H(x) -> H not in word\n- A(-) -> A in word, not position 2\n- N(✓) -> N in word and correct at position 3\n- D(x) -> D not in word\n- Y(x) -> Y not in word\n\nGuess 4: final\n- F(x) -> F not in word\n- I(x) -> I not in word\n- N(✓) -> N correct at position 3 (consistent)\n- A(✓) -> A in word and correct at position 4\n- L(✓) -> L in word and correct at position 5\n\nFrom Guess 4, we have:\n- N is at position 3 (as established)\n- A is at position 4 (with ✓)\n- L is at position 5 (with ✓)\n\nAlso, F and I are absent (not in word).\n\nSo the secret word now has:\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: L\n- Positions 1 and 2 are unknown but must be letters not absent and satisfy the constraints.\n\nMoreover, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.\n\nCumulative absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I.\n\nTherefore, available letters: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, position 1 and 2 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? Not necessarily distinct, but possible.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word ending with ""NAL"" since positions 3-5 are N,A,L.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ N A L\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with two letters from the available set and ends with ""NAL"".\n\nAvailable letters for positions 1 and 2: B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, common words ending in ""NAL"":\n\ne.g., ""canal"" but C is absent.\n\n""final"" we already guessed and F is absent? In guess4 we have F(x), and ""final"" has F at start.\n\nOther words: ""tonal"" has T, absent.\n\n""cabal"" has C, absent.\n\n""vocal"" has C, absent.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""nasal"" but S absent (from guess2 S(x))\n\n""nasal"": N,A,S,A,L?

B,A,N,A,L? But N at position 3? ""banal"": B at1, A at2, N at3, A at4, L at5? But we have A at position 4 fixed? In secret word, position 4 is A and position 3 is N, so ""banal"" has the pattern: P1:B, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. However, we know A cannot be at position 2 (from guess3 handy, A(-) at position 2), so if we guessed ""banal"", A at position 2 would be invalid. But we are not guessing it now; we are considering what secret could be.\n\nThe secret word could be ""banal"", with A both at position 2 and 4? But we know from feedback that A is not at position 2. Specifically, in guess3 handy, we guessed A at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning A is not at position 2. Therefore, secret cannot have A at position 2, so ""banal"" would have A at position 2, which contradicts feedback.\n\nTherefore, ""banal"" is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, any word with A at position 2 is invalid.\n\nAlso, word must have position 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.\n\nNow, for position 1 and 2: any letters from available, and not A since A is fixed at position 4 and cannot be at position 1 or 2 from previous feedback.\n\nSimilarly, we already know absent letters.\n\nPossible words ending with ""NAL"":\n\n- ""manual"" too long.\n\n5-letter words: let\'s list some.\n\n""coral"" has C and R?

Yes, meaning pertaining to a zone.\n\nSimilarly, ""tonal"" has T, absent.\n\n""boral"" not common.\n\n""coval"" not word.\n\n""doral"" has D, absent.\n\n""moral"" has R, absent.\n\n""nopal"" N,O,P,A,L? But N at position 1? Secret has N at position 3. ""nopal"": P1:N,O,P,A,L -> P1:N, P2:O, P3:P, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not the case.\n\nThe word must have N at position 3, so words like ""nopal"" have different pattern.\n\nPattern must be _ _ N A L, so position 3 is N.\n\n""zonal"" fits: P1:Z, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L.\n\nSimilarly, ""jonal"" not word.\n\n""kraal"" K,R,A,A,L? R absent.\n\n""vial"" too short.\n\n""arial"" has R? And not standard.\n\n""axial"" has X,I? But I absent? From guess4 final I(x), so I absent.\n\nBut ""axial"" has I at position 4? A,X,I,A,L? P1:A,X,I,A,L? No, ""axial"" is A,X,I,A,L? Positions: P1:A, P2:X, P3:I, P4:A, P5:L? But we need P3:N, which is not I.\n\nThe word must be _ _ N A L, so first two letters can be anything, but positions 3:N, 4:A, 5:L.\n\nSo ""zonal"" is one: Z,O,N,A,L.\n\nSimilarly, ""bwana"" is B,W,A,N,A? Pattern mismatch.\n\n""quena"" has E? Not.\n\nAnother word: ""penal"" P,E,N,A,L? E absent? E is absent.\n\n""renal"" R,E? Both absent.\n\n""metal"" M,E,T? E and T absent.\n\n""menal"" M,E,N,A,L?

Position.\n\n""oval"" too short.\n\n""local"" C, absent.\n\nSo ""zonal"" seems possible.\n\n""vocal"" C absent.\n\nAnother word: ""kanal"" K,A,N,A,L? But A at position 2? We know A not at pos2. Guess2 had A at pos1 and not, guess3 at pos2 not. So secret cannot have A at pos2.\n\n""kanal"" would have A at pos2? K,A,N,A,L -> P1:K, P2:A, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. But A at pos2 invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""banal"" invalid.\n\nSo words with A at pos2 are out.\n\nNow, is there another word besides ""zonal""?\n\n""fanal"" would be F,A,N,A,L? F absent? From guess4 F(x), so F absent.\n\nAlso A at pos2? Invalid.\n\n""pupal"" not.\n\n""tidal"" T, absent.\n\n""wigan"" not.\n\n""cymal"" not word.\n\nPossible ""zonal"" might be the only common one? Or ""tonal"" not.\n\n""binal"" B,I,N,A,L? But I absent? From guess4 I(x), so I absent.\n\nIn ""binal"", if it were, P1:B, P2:I, but I absent.\n\nSo not.\n\nSimilarly, we have absent I.\n\nAnother word: ""monal"" M,O,N,A,L? Pattern: M,O,N,A,L -> P1:M, P2:O, P3:N, P4:A, P5:L. This is similar to ""zonal"" but M and O.\n\n""monal"" is a word? Referring to a bird, monal pheasant? Not commonly used, but valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""zonal"" and ""monal"" are both possible.\n\n""coral"" absent.\n\n""moral"" absent.\n\n""rural"" R absent.\n\nSo possible words: ""zonal"" (ZO + NAL), ""monal"" (MO + NAL).\n\nAlso, ""punal"" not common.\n\n""usual"" U,S? S absent.\n\n""venal"" V,E,N,A,L? E absent.\n\n""mural"" R absent.\n\nSo likely ""zonal"" or ""monal"".\n\nNow we need to guess between them.\n\nBut we have positions 1 and 2 unknown.\n\nWe can guess one of them.\n\nSince we have only letters B, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z available for positions 1 and 2, but in ""monal"" it\'s M and O, in ""zonal"" Z and O.\n\nBoth have O at position 2? In ""zonal"" position 2 is O.\n\nIn ""monal"" position 2 is O? MONAL: M at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.\n\nSimilarly, ZONAL: Z at pos1, O at pos2, N pos3, A pos4, L pos5.\n\nBoth have position 2 as O.\n\nPosition 1 could be M or Z.\n\nBut also other possibilities? What about ""boral"" B,O,R,A,L? R absent.\n\n""copal"" C, absent.\n\n""lopal"" not word.\n\n""qophs"" not.\n\nSo probably ""monal"" or ""zonal"".\n\nTo resolve, we need to guess a word with positions 3:N,4:A,5:L, and position 1 and 2 with available letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know which letter for position 1.\n\nSince ""monal"" and ""zonal"" both have ""O"" at position 2, we can guess one.\n\nBut let\'s see the entire word.\n\nIn guess 4 ""final"" we have F(x) and I(x), so F and I absent.\n\nNow, for fifth guess, we can guess, say, ""zonal"" or ""monal"".\n\nSince ""monal"" might be less common, or we can think of other patterns.\n\nAnother word? ""karnal"" too long.\n\n""panel"" has E? Not 5 with L.\n\nPerhaps only those two.\n\nBut let\'s assume ""moral"" is absent? Not.\n\nPosition 1 and 2: could be different letters.\n\nFor example, ""manual"" is 6.\n\n""annual"" double N, A at 1? Not pattern.\n\nSo ""zonal"" or ""monal"".\n\nTo choose, let\'s guess ""monal"" since M is more common than Z, or vice versa.\n\nBut Z might be less common.\n\nWe can guess a word that tests position 1.\n\nBut we have to use the pattern since we know positions 3,4,5.\n\nSo guess ""monal"".\n\nBut ""monal"" might be accepted.\n\nSince we have the pattern, and we need to fill position 1 and 2.\n\nBut position 2 is O in both, so position 1 is the variable.\n\nIn both candidate words, position 2 is O.\n\nTherefore, we know position 2 is O? Not necessarily, but available letters.\n\nPerhaps position 2 is O.\n\nSince it appears in both common possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure.\n\nThere might be other words, like ""pawal"" not word.\n\nOr ""jawal"" not.\n\nSo we can guess with O at position 2 to confirm.\n\nFor example, guess a word like ""___NAL"" with position 2 as O.\n\nThen position 1 needs to be any available letter.\n\nFor instance, ""bonal"" not word.\n\n""jonal"" not.\n\n""konal"" not.\n\n""monal"" is one.\n\n""uonal"" not.\n\n""ponal"" P,O,N,A,L?

We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""monal"" -> M(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) L(✓)
 This means:
 - M is not in the word (since M(x))
 - O is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (O(✓))
 - N, A, L are confirmed in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively (which we already knew)

 Therefore, from the feedback:
 - M is absent (newly added to absent list)
 - O is present and fixed at position 2.

 We now know the secret word has:
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: N
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: L

 Only position 1 is missing.

 Absent letters so far: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I, M (from guess5 M(x))
 Available letters for position 1: B, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and note O is already used at position 2, but position 1 is a separate)

 We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ O N A L

 Where the first blank must be one of the available letters.

 Possible words:
   ""zonal"" -> Z O N A L (Z is available, and ""zonal"" is a valid word)
   ""conal"" -> C is absent
   ""tonal"" -> T absent
   ""bonal"" -> not a word
   ""jonal"" -> not a word
   ""ponal"" -> not a word

 Essentially, ""zonal"" is the only common word that fits.

 Since we have only one guess left (since this is the 6th guess), we should guess ""zonal"".

 Let's verify:
   We know:
     Position 2 must be O (we have O(✓) at position 2 from guess5)
     Positions 3,4,5 are fixed as N, A, L.

 The only word that fits the pattern and uses available letters is ""zonal"".

 Therefore, we guess ""zonal"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 5 (""monal""):** M(x), O(✓), N(✓), A(✓), L(✓)  
     - **M(x)**: M is **absent** from the secret word.  
     - **O(✓)**: O is correct at position 2.  
     - **N(✓)**, **A(✓)**, **L(✓)**: N at position 3, A at position 4, and L at position 5 are **confirmed** (consistent with Guess 4).  

2. **Cumulative Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:  
     - Position 2: O (from ✓)  
     - Position 3: N (✓ from Guess 3 and 4)  
     - Position 4: A (✓ from Guess 4)  
     - Position 5: L (✓ from Guess 4)  
   - **Position 1**: The only unknown letter.  
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, G, S, T, H, D, Y, F, I, M (all marked ""x"" across guesses).  
   - **Available Letters for Position 1**: B, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since O, N, A, L are placed).  

3. **Word Constraints**:  
   - The secret word must match the pattern `_ O N A L`.  
   - Position 1 must be a valid English letter from the available list that forms a real 5-letter word.  
   - Common words fitting `_ONAL`: ""zonal"" (Z), ""jonal"" (rare), ""bonal"" (invalid), ""tonal"" (T absent). ""zonal"" is the only viable common word (meaning ""relating to a zone"").  

4. **Final Decision**:  
   - With ""zonal"":
     - Position 1: Z (tests the only unknown).  
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect (e.g., Z is absent or wrong), no guesses remain—but ""zonal"" is the only logical option given constraints.
