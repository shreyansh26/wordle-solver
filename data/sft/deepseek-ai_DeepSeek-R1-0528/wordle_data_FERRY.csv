We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 3. Places R and E in positions different from the first guess (i.e., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5. So E could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word does not contain C, A, N.

 For the next guess, we can try to place R and E in new positions and introduce three new letters.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to choose a word that has R and E and three new letters, and that is a valid English word.

 Some candidate words:

 Option 1: Place R at the beginning and E in the middle? For example: R _ _ E _
 But we don't know the other letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Example words:
 - ""roger"": has R, O, G, E, R -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.
   However, we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one R (as a minus). If there were two R's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: the secret word might have only one R.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R. 
   This has T, I, G, E, R. 
   But note: the word ""tiger"" has R at the end (position 5) and E at position 4? 
   Positions: 
      T (1), I (2), G (3), E (4), R (5)

 However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was a minus. Now we are putting E at position 4 and R at position 5. This is acceptable because the feedback said E is not at position 5 (so position 4 is allowed) and R is not at position 2 (so position 5 is allowed).

 But wait: the feedback for R in the first guess was at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 5. That's a different position, so it's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have more than one R? But we don't have evidence for that. We'll assume one R for now.

 Let's check if ""tiger"" is a valid word: yes.

 But note: we are introducing T, I, G. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R in positions we haven't tried and also covers common letters.

 Another candidate: ""water"" -> W, A, T, E, R. But wait, we know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was x). So we cannot use A.

 Another: ""swept"" -> but that doesn't have R and E? We need to include R and E.

 How about ""robed""? But we know we cannot use A? Actually, we don't have A in ""robed"", but we have B, D. However, we also have O and E. But note: we don't have R in the second position? 
 ""robed"": R at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
 But we know that R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put R at position 1 because the feedback only said R is not at position 2. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed).

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N. ""robed"" doesn't have those.

 But we are introducing O, B, D.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" seems good.

 Let me compare with ""risen"": R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5. But wait, we know N is not in the word (from first feedback: N was x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""rides"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This avoids A, C, N. And positions: R is at 1 (not 2) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's valid.

 But we have two options: ""tiger"" and ""rides"". Which one is better?

 We want to cover more common letters. Also, note that in ""tiger"", we have T, I, G, E, R. In ""rides"", we have R, I, D, E, S.

 The letter S is very common, so maybe ""rides"" is good? But we also have D and S.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> but then R is at position 3? That's allowed. And E at 4? Allowed. And S at 5? We don't know about S.

 However, we are trying to maximize new information. We have 6 tries, so we can try one.

 Let me choose ""tiger"" because it has G which is less common? Actually, we want to test more common letters.

 Another idea: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). 
   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? 
   Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we know it will be wrong again? 
   So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, in ""store"", E is at position 5 -> that's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""stare""? But we know A is not in the word. So no.

 How about ""strep""? But that's 5 letters? S, T, R, E, P. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), E(4), P(5). 
   This avoids E at 5 and R at 2. Also, no A, C, N.

 But we don't know if P is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" is a valid word and places E at 4 and R at 5, which are new positions.

 Let me go with ""tiger"".

 But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 2. We don't know about I.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R and also uses the fact that we know the first letter is not C (and not A, etc.). We don't know the first letter.

 After thinking, I choose ""tiger"".

 So the next guess is ""tiger"".

<guess>tiger</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid **C, A, N** (excluded letters).
- Place **R** anywhere except position 2, and **E** anywhere except position 5.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., **T, I, G**).

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E** (position 4, not 5), **R** (position 5, not 2).
- Tests three new letters while strategically repositioning R and E.

 Another candidate: ""water"" -> W, A, T, E, R. But wait, we know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was x). So we cannot use A.

 Another: ""swept"" -> but that doesn't have R and E? We need to include R and E.

 How about ""robed""? But we know we cannot use A? Actually, we don't have A in ""robed"", but we have B, D. However, we also have O and E. But note: we don't have R in the second position? 
 ""robed"": R at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
 But we know that R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put R at position 1 because the feedback only said R is not at position 2. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed).

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N. ""robed"" doesn't have those.

 But we are introducing O, B, D.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" seems good.

 Let me compare with ""risen"": R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5. But wait, we know N is not in the word (from first feedback: N was x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""rides"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This avoids A, C, N. And positions: R is at 1 (not 2) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's valid.

 But we have two options: ""tiger"" and ""rides"". Which one is better?

 We want to cover more common letters. Also, note that in ""tiger"", we have T, I, G, E, R. In ""rides"", we have R, I, D, E, S.

 The letter S is very common, so maybe ""rides"" is good? But we also have D and S.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> but then R is at position 3? That's allowed. And E at 4? Allowed. And S at 5? We don't know about S.

 However, we are trying to maximize new information. We have 6 tries, so we can try one.

 Let me choose ""tiger"" because it has G which is less common? Actually, we want to test more common letters.

 Another idea: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). 
   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? 
   Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we know it will be wrong again? 
   So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, in ""store"", E is at position 5 -> that's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""stare""? But we know A is not in the word. So no.

 How about ""strep""? But that's 5 letters? S, T, R, E, P. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), E(4), P(5). 
   This avoids E at 5 and R at 2. Also, no A, C, N.

 But we don't know if P is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" is a valid word and places E at 4 and R at 5, which are new positions.

 Let me go with ""tiger"".

 But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 2. We don't know about I.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R and also uses the fact that we know the first letter is not C (and not A, etc.). We don't know the first letter.

 After thinking, I choose ""tiger"".

 So the next guess is ""tiger"".

<guess>tiger</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid **C, A, N** (excluded letters).
- Place **R** anywhere except position 2, and **E** anywhere except position 5.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., **T, I, G**).

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E** (position 4, not 5), **R** (position 5, not 2).
- Tests three new letters while strategically repositioning R and E.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""tiger"": T(x), I(x), G(x), E(-), R(-)
   - T, I, G are not in the word (new exclusions).
   - E and R are in the word, but not in the positions guessed. In ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is not at position 4, and R is not at position 5.

Combining the feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G
- Confirmed letters in the word: R and E (but we don't know their positions).

We also know from both guesses the positions that R and E cannot be in:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 5 (from ""tiger"").
- E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 4 (from ""tiger"").

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since not 2 or 5)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We have two letters confirmed: R and E. We must include these in the next guess, placed in positions that haven't been tried and are still possible.

We also need to choose three additional letters that are not in the excluded list and not R or E.

Excluded so far: C, A, N, T, I, G. So available letters are:
B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.

Moreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). 

Let's try to form a word:

Consider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.

Candidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don't have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let's see:

""robed"": R, O, B, E, D
- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)
- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.

So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.

Wait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
But R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.

Option: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _
But RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.

Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Alternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.

Possibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R's? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.

Better: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S's? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S's. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.

We need E at position 3: R _ E _ _

So position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.

Same issue: we cannot have E at 4.

So we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven't tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.

Moreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.

So let's recap:

We need a word that:
- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don't know duplicates)
- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G
- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)

Structure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We'll avoid unless necessary.

How about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _

Example words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R's? not good), ""perky""

Another: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.

We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Candidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.

Another: ""merry"" -> again, two R's? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don't know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates to get clean information.

Another word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. 
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: O
      3: W
      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.

Similarly, we avoid position 4 for E.

Another candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.

How about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.

Therefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: 
  1: F
  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.
  3: V
  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don't know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.

We need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let's try one:

Option: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ 
Words: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.

So ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.

""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.

""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.

""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.

How about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don't know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? 

We want to test new positions? Still, let's see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? 
R at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? 
But E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? 

But ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it's acceptable.

But duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that's okay.

We can try, but to avoid complexity, let's try to avoid duplicates.

Alternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ 

We would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? 

Example: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.

How about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.

We can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _

Words: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.

""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.

Wait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? 

Example: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.

How about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.

Another: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.

Letter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.

Example: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? 

But we can't use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.

How about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.

We must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:
- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?
- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? 
- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? 

And we can make a word.

So let's try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _

Example: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. 
""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? 
We need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? 

Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

We need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

Example: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? 
""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.

We haven't many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.

How about ""flicker""? Too long.

""seams""? S E A? A excluded.

""pears""? P E A? A excluded.

""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.

It's challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.

"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.

Maybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _

Example word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That's allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.

How about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.

But we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
- E at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).

And the letters: P, E, R, K, S. 
- P: not excluded
- K: available
- S: available

Also, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.

And the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.

Yes, ""perks"" is a valid word.

So let's go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.

<guess>perks</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).
- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.
- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.

The next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:
- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).
- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).
- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.

This maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.

<guess>perks</guess>",perks,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""tiger"": T(x), I(x), G(x), E(-), R(-)
   - T, I, G are not in the word (new exclusions).
   - E and R are in the word, but not in the positions guessed. In ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is not at position 4, and R is not at position 5.

Combining the feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G
- Confirmed letters in the word: R and E (but we don't know their positions).

We also know from both guesses the positions that R and E cannot be in:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 5 (from ""tiger"").
- E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 4 (from ""tiger"").

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since not 2 or 5)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We have two letters confirmed: R and E. We must include these in the next guess, placed in positions that haven't been tried and are still possible.

We also need to choose three additional letters that are not in the excluded list and not R or E.

Excluded so far: C, A, N, T, I, G. So available letters are:
B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.

Moreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). 

Let's try to form a word:

Consider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.

Candidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don't have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let's see:

""robed"": R, O, B, E, D
- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)
- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.

So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.

Wait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
But R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.

Option: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _
But RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.

Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Alternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.

Possibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R's? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.

Better: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S's? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S's. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.

We need E at position 3: R _ E _ _

So position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.

Same issue: we cannot have E at 4.

So we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven't tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.

Moreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.

So let's recap:

We need a word that:
- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don't know duplicates)
- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G
- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)

Structure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We'll avoid unless necessary.

How about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _

Example words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R's? not good), ""perky""

Another: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.

We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Candidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.

Another: ""merry"" -> again, two R's? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don't know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates to get clean information.

Another word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. 
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: O
      3: W
      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.

Similarly, we avoid position 4 for E.

Another candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.

How about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.

Therefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: 
  1: F
  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.
  3: V
  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don't know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.

We need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let's try one:

Option: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ 
Words: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.

So ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.

""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.

""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.

""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.

How about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don't know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? 

We want to test new positions? Still, let's see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? 
R at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? 
But E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? 

But ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it's acceptable.

But duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that's okay.

We can try, but to avoid complexity, let's try to avoid duplicates.

Alternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ 

We would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? 

Example: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.

How about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.

We can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _

Words: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.

""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.

Wait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? 

Example: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.

How about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.

Another: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.

Letter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.

Example: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? 

But we can't use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.

How about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.

We must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:
- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?
- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? 
- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? 

And we can make a word.

So let's try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _

Example: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. 
""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? 
We need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? 

Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

We need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

Example: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? 
""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.

We haven't many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.

How about ""flicker""? Too long.

""seams""? S E A? A excluded.

""pears""? P E A? A excluded.

""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.

It's challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.

"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.

Maybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _

Example word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That's allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.

How about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.

But we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
- E at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).

And the letters: P, E, R, K, S. 
- P: not excluded
- K: available
- S: available

Also, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.

And the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.

Yes, ""perks"" is a valid word.

So let's go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.

<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).
- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.
- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.

The next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:
- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).
- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).
- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.

This maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.",Guess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,FERRY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word in Wordle. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 3. Places R and E in positions different from the first guess (i.e., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5. So E could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word does not contain C, A, N.

 For the next guess, we can try to place R and E in new positions and introduce three new letters.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to choose a word that has R and E and three new letters, and that is a valid English word.

 Some candidate words:

 Option 1: Place R at the beginning and E in the middle? For example: R _ _ E _
 But we don't know the other letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Example words:
 - ""roger"": has R, O, G, E, R -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.
   However, we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one R (as a minus). If there were two R's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: the secret word might have only one R.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R. 
   This has T, I, G, E, R. 
   But note: the word ""tiger"" has R at the end (position 5) and E at position 4? 
   Positions: 
      T (1), I (2), G (3), E (4), R (5)

 However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was a minus. Now we are putting E at position 4 and R at position 5. This is acceptable because the feedback said E is not at position 5 (so position 4 is allowed) and R is not at position 2 (so position 5 is allowed).

 But wait: the feedback for R in the first guess was at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 5. That's a different position, so it's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have more than one R? But we don't have evidence for that. We'll assume one R for now.

 Let's check if ""tiger"" is a valid word: yes.

 But note: we are introducing T, I, G. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R in positions we haven't tried and also covers common letters.

 Another candidate: ""water"" -> W, A, T, E, R. But wait, we know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was x). So we cannot use A.

 Another: ""swept"" -> but that doesn't have R and E? We need to include R and E.

 How about ""robed""? But we know we cannot use A? Actually, we don't have A in ""robed"", but we have B, D. However, we also have O and E. But note: we don't have R in the second position? 
 ""robed"": R at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
 But we know that R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put R at position 1 because the feedback only said R is not at position 2. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed).

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N. ""robed"" doesn't have those.

 But we are introducing O, B, D.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" seems good.

 Let me compare with ""risen"": R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5. But wait, we know N is not in the word (from first feedback: N was x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""rides"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This avoids A, C, N. And positions: R is at 1 (not 2) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's valid.

 But we have two options: ""tiger"" and ""rides"". Which one is better?

 We want to cover more common letters. Also, note that in ""tiger"", we have T, I, G, E, R. In ""rides"", we have R, I, D, E, S.

 The letter S is very common, so maybe ""rides"" is good? But we also have D and S.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> but then R is at position 3? That's allowed. And E at 4? Allowed. And S at 5? We don't know about S.

 However, we are trying to maximize new information. We have 6 tries, so we can try one.

 Let me choose ""tiger"" because it has G which is less common? Actually, we want to test more common letters.

 Another idea: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). 
   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? 
   Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we know it will be wrong again? 
   So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, in ""store"", E is at position 5 -> that's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""stare""? But we know A is not in the word. So no.

 How about ""strep""? But that's 5 letters? S, T, R, E, P. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), E(4), P(5). 
   This avoids E at 5 and R at 2. Also, no A, C, N.

 But we don't know if P is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" is a valid word and places E at 4 and R at 5, which are new positions.

 Let me go with ""tiger"".

 But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 2. We don't know about I.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R and also uses the fact that we know the first letter is not C (and not A, etc.). We don't know the first letter.

 After thinking, I choose ""tiger"".

 So the next guess is ""tiger"".

<guess>tiger</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid **C, A, N** (excluded letters).
- Place **R** anywhere except position 2, and **E** anywhere except position 5.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., **T, I, G**).

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E** (position 4, not 5), **R** (position 5, not 2).
- Tests three new letters while strategically repositioning R and E.

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""tiger"": T(x), I(x), G(x), E(-), R(-)
   - T, I, G are not in the word (new exclusions).
   - E and R are in the word, but not in the positions guessed. In ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is not at position 4, and R is not at position 5.

Combining the feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G
- Confirmed letters in the word: R and E (but we don't know their positions).

We also know from both guesses the positions that R and E cannot be in:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 5 (from ""tiger"").
- E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 4 (from ""tiger"").

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since not 2 or 5)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We have two letters confirmed: R and E. We must include these in the next guess, placed in positions that haven't been tried and are still possible.

We also need to choose three additional letters that are not in the excluded list and not R or E.

Excluded so far: C, A, N, T, I, G. So available letters are:
B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.

Moreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). 

Let's try to form a word:

Consider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.

Candidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don't have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let's see:

""robed"": R, O, B, E, D
- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)
- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.

So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.

Wait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
But R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.

Option: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _
But RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.

Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Alternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.

Possibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R's? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.

Better: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S's? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S's. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.

We need E at position 3: R _ E _ _

So position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.

Same issue: we cannot have E at 4.

So we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven't tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.

Moreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.

So let's recap:

We need a word that:
- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don't know duplicates)
- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G
- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)

Structure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We'll avoid unless necessary.

How about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _

Example words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R's? not good), ""perky""

Another: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.

We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Candidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.

Another: ""merry"" -> again, two R's? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don't know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates to get clean information.

Another word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. 
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: O
      3: W
      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.

Similarly, we avoid position 4 for E.

Another candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.

How about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.

Therefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: 
  1: F
  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.
  3: V
  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don't know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.

We need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let's try one:

Option: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ 
Words: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.

So ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.

""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.

""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.

""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.

How about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don't know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? 

We want to test new positions? Still, let's see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? 
R at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? 
But E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? 

But ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it's acceptable.

But duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that's okay.

We can try, but to avoid complexity, let's try to avoid duplicates.

Alternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ 

We would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? 

Example: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.

How about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.

We can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _

Words: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.

""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.

Wait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? 

Example: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.

How about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.

Another: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.

Letter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.

Example: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? 

But we can't use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.

How about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.

We must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:
- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?
- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? 
- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? 

And we can make a word.

So let's try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _

Example: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. 
""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? 
We need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? 

Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

We need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

Example: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? 
""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.

We haven't many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.

How about ""flicker""? Too long.

""seams""? S E A? A excluded.

""pears""? P E A? A excluded.

""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.

It's challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.

"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.

Maybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _

Example word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That's allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.

How about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.

But we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
- E at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).

And the letters: P, E, R, K, S. 
- P: not excluded
- K: available
- S: available

Also, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.

And the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.

Yes, ""perks"" is a valid word.

So let's go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.

<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).
- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.
- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.

The next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:
- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).
- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).
- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.

This maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.

So available letters are:\nB, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.\n\nMoreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). \n\nLet\'s try to form a word:\n\nConsider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.\n\nCandidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don\'t have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let\'s see:\n\n""robed"": R, O, B, E, D\n- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)\n- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.\n\nSo E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.\n\nWait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? \nBut R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.\n\nOption: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _\nBut RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.\n\nActually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.\n\nAlternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.\n\nPossibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R\'s? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.\n\nBetter: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S\'s? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S\'s. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.\n\nWe need E at position 3: R _ E _ _\n\nSo position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.\n\nSame issue: we cannot have E at 4.\n\nSo we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven\'t tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.\n\nMoreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.\n\nSo let\'s recap:\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don\'t know duplicates)\n- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G\n- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)\n- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)\n\nStructure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We\'ll avoid unless necessary.\n\nHow about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _\n\nExample words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R\'s? not good), ""perky""\n\nAnother: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.\n\nWe need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.\n\nCandidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.\n\nAnother: ""merry"" -> again, two R\'s? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don\'t know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates to get clean information.\n\nAnother word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. \n   Positions: \n      1: S\n      2: O\n      3: W\n      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, we avoid position 4 for E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.\n\nHow about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: \n  1: F\n  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.\n  3: V\n  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don\'t know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let\'s try one:\n\nOption: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ \nWords: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.\n\nSo ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.\n\n""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.\n\n""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.\n\n""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.\n\nHow about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don\'t know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? \n\nWe want to test new positions? Still, let\'s see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? \nR at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? \nBut E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? \n\nBut ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that\'s okay.\n\nWe can try, but to avoid complexity, let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\nAlternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ \n\nWe would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? \n\nExample: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.\n\nHow about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.\n\nWe can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _\n\nWords: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.\n\n""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.\n\nWait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? \n\nExample: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.\n\nHow about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.\n\nAnother: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.\n\nLetter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.\n\nExample: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? \n\nBut we can\'t use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.\n\nHow about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.\n\nWe must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:\n- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?\n- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? \n- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? \n\nAnd we can make a word.\n\nSo let\'s try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _\n\nExample: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. \n""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? \nWe need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? \n\nPositions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?\n\nWe need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z\n\nExample: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? \n""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.\n\nHow about ""flicker""? Too long.\n\n""seams""? S E A? A excluded.\n\n""pears""? P E A? A excluded.\n\n""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.\n\n"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.\n\nMaybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _\n\nExample word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That\'s allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.\n\nHow about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.\n\nBut we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \n- E at 2: allowed.\n- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).\n\nAnd the letters: P, E, R, K, S. \n- P: not excluded\n- K: available\n- S: available\n\nAlso, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.\n\nAnd the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.\n\nYes, ""perks"" is a valid word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.\n\n<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).\n- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:\n- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).\n- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).\n- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.\n\nThis maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.\n\n<guess>perks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback history:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in position 2 (for R) and not in position 5 (for E).
   - Also, C, A, N are not in the word.
2. For ""tiger"": T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - This tells us that E is not in position 4 and R is not in position 5 (since in ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5, and both were minuses).
   - Additionally, T, I, G are not in the word.
3. For ""perks"": P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
   - E and R are now correctly placed! Specifically, E is in position 2 and R is in position 3? Wait, let's check the positions:
     ""perks"": positions are 1:P, 2:E, 3:R, 4:K, 5:S
     Feedback: E(✓) at position 2 and R(✓) at position 3? But P, K, S got x.
   - This means:
        - E is at position 2 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - R is at position 3 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - P, K, S are not in the word.

So, the secret word has the pattern: _ E R _ _ 
We know:
- Position 2 is E
- Position 3 is R
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (all marked with x in previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to guess a word that starts with an unknown letter, then E (fixed at position 2), R (fixed at position 3), and then two more letters.

The constraints:
- First letter: must be one of the available letters (not in excluded list)
- Fourth letter: must be one of the available letters
- Fifth letter: must be one of the available letters

Additionally, since we know E and R are fixed at positions 2 and 3, the other positions can be filled with letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have to ensure that the word exists.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ E R _ _

Some possibilities:
- ""berry"": but B is allowed? Available. But it ends with Y? However note: we have double R? But position 3 is R, so if we have another R? The word would have R at position 3 and another R? Also, E at position 2? So B E R R Y? Positions:
  1: B, 2:E (ok), 3:R (ok), 4:R, 5:Y.
  However, we got feedback for ""perks"" that S, K, P are not in the word? And we haven't used Y? But B is available? But wait: does ""berry"" have only one R? We are placing R at position 3 and 4? The secret word might have two R's? But we don't know? So it's possible? However, we have no constraints against it.
  But note: the excluded list does not include B or Y? So it's possible? But then letter at position 4 is R? Which could be? From previous feedback? In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and got minus? But now positions are different? So it might be okay?
  Also, position 5: Y? Not excluded? 
  However, we must use distinct letters or include existing ones? Since E and R are already in, they can be reused? But the feedback for ""perks"" only showed E and R correctly placed? If there were other E or R, we wouldn't know? 

But let's consider: the feedback doesn't reveal duplicates? That is true? We only get symbols per guess? We don't know? So it could be possible? However, to be safe, we should test a word without reusing E and R unnecessarily? And include new letters to gain information.

But we only have two positions to fill? Position 1 and positions 4 and 5? And we have three unknowns? But the secret word has five positions? We know two are E and R? The remaining are unknown.

We know the available letters? Since the word is _ E R _ _, it must be composed of:

First letter: from available set
Fourth letter: from available set
Fifth letter: from available set

And the letters must not include any excluded letter.

We want to maximize the new letters? Also, try to cover common letters.

Common letters to test: Let's try to find words with M, L, D, H, O, etc.

Some candidate words:
- ""merry"": M E R R Y -> but duplicate R? And position 4 is R? Then pattern: M E R? That fixes the first three? Then fourth is R? Fifth is Y.
  But then the word has R at position 3 and 4? 

Alternative: ""berry"" as above? 
But let me check if there are other candidates.

Another: ""heron"": H E R O N -> but N is excluded? From ""crane"" we had N(x)? So N is not in the word. Cannot use.

""derby"": D E R B Y
  Positions: 
      1: D (available)
      2: E (fixed)
      3: R (fixed)
      4: B (available)
      5: Y (available)
And letters: D, E, R, B, Y? Distinct and all not excluded? 
""derby"" is a valid English word? It means a type of race or a place?

Yes, ""derby"" is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""feral"": F E R A L -> A excluded? Cannot.

""jewel"": but we don't have R? We need R at position 3? The pattern is fixed E at 2 and R at 3? So no.

""cervix"": too long? Or include X?

""perky"": used P? P is excluded? From perks feedback P(x).

How about ""merit""? but T excluded? From ""tiger"" T(x)? And I in ""tiger"" was I(x)? We cannot use I.

""nerve"": N excluded? And E appears twice? But we have N excluded? 

So ""derby"" seems a good option: uses D, E, R, B, Y? E and R fixed? And new letters D, B, Y? 

Another: ""herby"": H E R B Y? Same, or ""verge"" has E at the end? Doesn't fit pattern? We have E at position 2? And R at 3? So words must start with ? E R? 

Examples of words that fit _ E R _ _
- verb (too short? need 5 letters)? 
- verbs? That's 5 letters: V E R B S? But S is excluded? From perks S(x)? Cannot.
- herby? H E R B Y -> H not excluded? B and Y available? Yes.
- mercy? M E R C Y -> But C excluded? No.

Another: ""leroy""? Doesn't have the pattern? Must have E at 2 and R at 3? So L E R O Y? That's L E R O Y? positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:R, 4:O, 5:Y? All letters available? But is it a word? Leroy is a name? But acceptable? But not common? 

Alternatively, ""derby"" is a common word? Or ""herby""? But herby is an adjective, meaning full of herbs.

But let's also consider ""derry""? but duplicate R? D E R R Y? Position 4:R? So we fill positions: D(1), E(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5)? Then we have two R's? But we are using R at 3 and 4? Secret word might have two R's? 

But ""derry"" is a word? A place? 

However, we want to maximize new letters? In ""derby"", we have D, B, Y which have not been tested? Similarly in ""herby"", we have H, B, Y? Both introduce new letters? 

I think ""derby"" is a valid option? Also, it has distinct letters except that E and R are not duplicated? 

We'll choose ""derby"" as the guess? Because it covers common letters D, B, Y? 

But note: we have the pattern locked? We know positions 2 and 3? So the other positions are our target? 

But we don't have constraints on the first letter? So any of D, H, B, etc. are valid? 

Since we have two guesses? We can try to pin down the remaining letters? But we have 6 tries? We are at guess 4? So we have enough time? 

We'll guess ""derby""

<guess>derby</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - E is in position 2 (✓ from ""perks"").
  - R is in position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").
- The secret word pattern is: **\_ E R \_ \_**.

The next guess must:
- Maintain E in position 2 and R in position 3.
- Use only untested letters from the available set: B, D, F, H, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, Z.
- Test new common letters to identify the missing letters at positions 1, 4, and 5.

The word **""derby""** fits perfectly:
- **D** (new), **B** (new), **Y** (new) — all untested letters.
- Matches the pattern: D in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, B in 4, Y in 5.
- Valid English word meaning a type of race or competition.
- Maximizes information by testing three new letters (D, B, Y) against the secret word's remaining positions.

<guess>derby</guess>",derby,"We have the following feedback history:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in position 2 (for R) and not in position 5 (for E).
   - Also, C, A, N are not in the word.
2. For ""tiger"": T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - This tells us that E is not in position 4 and R is not in position 5 (since in ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5, and both were minuses).
   - Additionally, T, I, G are not in the word.
3. For ""perks"": P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
   - E and R are now correctly placed! Specifically, E is in position 2 and R is in position 3? Wait, let's check the positions:
     ""perks"": positions are 1:P, 2:E, 3:R, 4:K, 5:S
     Feedback: E(✓) at position 2 and R(✓) at position 3? But P, K, S got x.
   - This means:
        - E is at position 2 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - R is at position 3 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - P, K, S are not in the word.

So, the secret word has the pattern: _ E R _ _ 
We know:
- Position 2 is E
- Position 3 is R
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (all marked with x in previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to guess a word that starts with an unknown letter, then E (fixed at position 2), R (fixed at position 3), and then two more letters.

The constraints:
- First letter: must be one of the available letters (not in excluded list)
- Fourth letter: must be one of the available letters
- Fifth letter: must be one of the available letters

Additionally, since we know E and R are fixed at positions 2 and 3, the other positions can be filled with letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have to ensure that the word exists.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ E R _ _

Some possibilities:
- ""berry"": but B is allowed? Available. But it ends with Y? However note: we have double R? But position 3 is R, so if we have another R? The word would have R at position 3 and another R? Also, E at position 2? So B E R R Y? Positions:
  1: B, 2:E (ok), 3:R (ok), 4:R, 5:Y.
  However, we got feedback for ""perks"" that S, K, P are not in the word? And we haven't used Y? But B is available? But wait: does ""berry"" have only one R? We are placing R at position 3 and 4? The secret word might have two R's? But we don't know? So it's possible? However, we have no constraints against it.
  But note: the excluded list does not include B or Y? So it's possible? But then letter at position 4 is R? Which could be? From previous feedback? In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and got minus? But now positions are different? So it might be okay?
  Also, position 5: Y? Not excluded? 
  However, we must use distinct letters or include existing ones? Since E and R are already in, they can be reused? But the feedback for ""perks"" only showed E and R correctly placed? If there were other E or R, we wouldn't know? 

But let's consider: the feedback doesn't reveal duplicates? That is true? We only get symbols per guess? We don't know? So it could be possible? However, to be safe, we should test a word without reusing E and R unnecessarily? And include new letters to gain information.

But we only have two positions to fill? Position 1 and positions 4 and 5? And we have three unknowns? But the secret word has five positions? We know two are E and R? The remaining are unknown.

We know the available letters? Since the word is _ E R _ _, it must be composed of:

First letter: from available set
Fourth letter: from available set
Fifth letter: from available set

And the letters must not include any excluded letter.

We want to maximize the new letters? Also, try to cover common letters.

Common letters to test: Let's try to find words with M, L, D, H, O, etc.

Some candidate words:
- ""merry"": M E R R Y -> but duplicate R? And position 4 is R? Then pattern: M E R? That fixes the first three? Then fourth is R? Fifth is Y.
  But then the word has R at position 3 and 4? 

Alternative: ""berry"" as above? 
But let me check if there are other candidates.

Another: ""heron"": H E R O N -> but N is excluded? From ""crane"" we had N(x)? So N is not in the word. Cannot use.

""derby"": D E R B Y
  Positions: 
      1: D (available)
      2: E (fixed)
      3: R (fixed)
      4: B (available)
      5: Y (available)
And letters: D, E, R, B, Y? Distinct and all not excluded? 
""derby"" is a valid English word? It means a type of race or a place?

Yes, ""derby"" is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""feral"": F E R A L -> A excluded? Cannot.

""jewel"": but we don't have R? We need R at position 3? The pattern is fixed E at 2 and R at 3? So no.

""cervix"": too long? Or include X?

""perky"": used P? P is excluded? From perks feedback P(x).

How about ""merit""? but T excluded? From ""tiger"" T(x)? And I in ""tiger"" was I(x)? We cannot use I.

""nerve"": N excluded? And E appears twice? But we have N excluded? 

So ""derby"" seems a good option: uses D, E, R, B, Y? E and R fixed? And new letters D, B, Y? 

Another: ""herby"": H E R B Y? Same, or ""verge"" has E at the end? Doesn't fit pattern? We have E at position 2? And R at 3? So words must start with ? E R? 

Examples of words that fit _ E R _ _
- verb (too short? need 5 letters)? 
- verbs? That's 5 letters: V E R B S? But S is excluded? From perks S(x)? Cannot.
- herby? H E R B Y -> H not excluded? B and Y available? Yes.
- mercy? M E R C Y -> But C excluded? No.

Another: ""leroy""? Doesn't have the pattern? Must have E at 2 and R at 3? So L E R O Y? That's L E R O Y? positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:R, 4:O, 5:Y? All letters available? But is it a word? Leroy is a name? But acceptable? But not common? 

Alternatively, ""derby"" is a common word? Or ""herby""? But herby is an adjective, meaning full of herbs.

But let's also consider ""derry""? but duplicate R? D E R R Y? Position 4:R? So we fill positions: D(1), E(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5)? Then we have two R's? But we are using R at 3 and 4? Secret word might have two R's? 

But ""derry"" is a word? A place? 

However, we want to maximize new letters? In ""derby"", we have D, B, Y which have not been tested? Similarly in ""herby"", we have H, B, Y? Both introduce new letters? 

I think ""derby"" is a valid option? Also, it has distinct letters except that E and R are not duplicated? 

We'll choose ""derby"" as the guess? Because it covers common letters D, B, Y? 

But note: we have the pattern locked? We know positions 2 and 3? So the other positions are our target? 

But we don't have constraints on the first letter? So any of D, H, B, etc. are valid? 

Since we have two guesses? We can try to pin down the remaining letters? But we have 6 tries? We are at guess 4? So we have enough time? 

We'll guess ""derby""

<guess>derby</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - E is in position 2 (✓ from ""perks"").
  - R is in position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").
- The secret word pattern is: **\_ E R \_ \_**.

The next guess must:
- Maintain E in position 2 and R in position 3.
- Use only untested letters from the available set: B, D, F, H, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, Z.
- Test new common letters to identify the missing letters at positions 1, 4, and 5.

The word **""derby""** fits perfectly:
- **D** (new), **B** (new), **Y** (new) — all untested letters.
- Matches the pattern: D in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, B in 4, Y in 5.
- Valid English word meaning a type of race or competition.
- Maximizes information by testing three new letters (D, B, Y) against the secret word's remaining positions.",Guess 4: derby -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,FERRY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word in Wordle. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 3. Places R and E in positions different from the first guess (i.e., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5. So E could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word does not contain C, A, N.

 For the next guess, we can try to place R and E in new positions and introduce three new letters.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to choose a word that has R and E and three new letters, and that is a valid English word.

 Some candidate words:

 Option 1: Place R at the beginning and E in the middle? For example: R _ _ E _
 But we don't know the other letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Example words:
 - ""roger"": has R, O, G, E, R -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.
   However, we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one R (as a minus). If there were two R's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: the secret word might have only one R.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R. 
   This has T, I, G, E, R. 
   But note: the word ""tiger"" has R at the end (position 5) and E at position 4? 
   Positions: 
      T (1), I (2), G (3), E (4), R (5)

 However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was a minus. Now we are putting E at position 4 and R at position 5. This is acceptable because the feedback said E is not at position 5 (so position 4 is allowed) and R is not at position 2 (so position 5 is allowed).

 But wait: the feedback for R in the first guess was at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 5. That's a different position, so it's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have more than one R? But we don't have evidence for that. We'll assume one R for now.

 Let's check if ""tiger"" is a valid word: yes.

 But note: we are introducing T, I, G. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R in positions we haven't tried and also covers common letters.

 Another candidate: ""water"" -> W, A, T, E, R. But wait, we know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was x). So we cannot use A.

 Another: ""swept"" -> but that doesn't have R and E? We need to include R and E.

 How about ""robed""? But we know we cannot use A? Actually, we don't have A in ""robed"", but we have B, D. However, we also have O and E. But note: we don't have R in the second position? 
 ""robed"": R at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
 But we know that R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put R at position 1 because the feedback only said R is not at position 2. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed).

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N. ""robed"" doesn't have those.

 But we are introducing O, B, D.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" seems good.

 Let me compare with ""risen"": R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5. But wait, we know N is not in the word (from first feedback: N was x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""rides"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This avoids A, C, N. And positions: R is at 1 (not 2) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's valid.

 But we have two options: ""tiger"" and ""rides"". Which one is better?

 We want to cover more common letters. Also, note that in ""tiger"", we have T, I, G, E, R. In ""rides"", we have R, I, D, E, S.

 The letter S is very common, so maybe ""rides"" is good? But we also have D and S.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> but then R is at position 3? That's allowed. And E at 4? Allowed. And S at 5? We don't know about S.

 However, we are trying to maximize new information. We have 6 tries, so we can try one.

 Let me choose ""tiger"" because it has G which is less common? Actually, we want to test more common letters.

 Another idea: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). 
   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? 
   Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we know it will be wrong again? 
   So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, in ""store"", E is at position 5 -> that's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""stare""? But we know A is not in the word. So no.

 How about ""strep""? But that's 5 letters? S, T, R, E, P. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), E(4), P(5). 
   This avoids E at 5 and R at 2. Also, no A, C, N.

 But we don't know if P is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" is a valid word and places E at 4 and R at 5, which are new positions.

 Let me go with ""tiger"".

 But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 2. We don't know about I.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R and also uses the fact that we know the first letter is not C (and not A, etc.). We don't know the first letter.

 After thinking, I choose ""tiger"".

 So the next guess is ""tiger"".

<guess>tiger</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid **C, A, N** (excluded letters).
- Place **R** anywhere except position 2, and **E** anywhere except position 5.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., **T, I, G**).

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E** (position 4, not 5), **R** (position 5, not 2).
- Tests three new letters while strategically repositioning R and E.

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""tiger"": T(x), I(x), G(x), E(-), R(-)
   - T, I, G are not in the word (new exclusions).
   - E and R are in the word, but not in the positions guessed. In ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is not at position 4, and R is not at position 5.

Combining the feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G
- Confirmed letters in the word: R and E (but we don't know their positions).

We also know from both guesses the positions that R and E cannot be in:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 5 (from ""tiger"").
- E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 4 (from ""tiger"").

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since not 2 or 5)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We have two letters confirmed: R and E. We must include these in the next guess, placed in positions that haven't been tried and are still possible.

We also need to choose three additional letters that are not in the excluded list and not R or E.

Excluded so far: C, A, N, T, I, G. So available letters are:
B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.

Moreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). 

Let's try to form a word:

Consider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.

Candidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don't have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let's see:

""robed"": R, O, B, E, D
- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)
- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.

So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.

Wait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
But R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.

Option: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _
But RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.

Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Alternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.

Possibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R's? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.

Better: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S's? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S's. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.

We need E at position 3: R _ E _ _

So position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.

Same issue: we cannot have E at 4.

So we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven't tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.

Moreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.

So let's recap:

We need a word that:
- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don't know duplicates)
- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G
- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)

Structure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We'll avoid unless necessary.

How about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _

Example words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R's? not good), ""perky""

Another: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.

We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Candidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.

Another: ""merry"" -> again, two R's? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don't know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates to get clean information.

Another word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. 
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: O
      3: W
      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.

Similarly, we avoid position 4 for E.

Another candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.

How about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.

Therefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: 
  1: F
  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.
  3: V
  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don't know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.

We need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let's try one:

Option: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ 
Words: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.

So ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.

""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.

""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.

""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.

How about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don't know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? 

We want to test new positions? Still, let's see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? 
R at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? 
But E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? 

But ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it's acceptable.

But duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that's okay.

We can try, but to avoid complexity, let's try to avoid duplicates.

Alternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ 

We would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? 

Example: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.

How about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.

We can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _

Words: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.

""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.

Wait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? 

Example: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.

How about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.

Another: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.

Letter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.

Example: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? 

But we can't use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.

How about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.

We must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:
- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?
- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? 
- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? 

And we can make a word.

So let's try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _

Example: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. 
""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? 
We need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? 

Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

We need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

Example: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? 
""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.

We haven't many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.

How about ""flicker""? Too long.

""seams""? S E A? A excluded.

""pears""? P E A? A excluded.

""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.

It's challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.

"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.

Maybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _

Example word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That's allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.

How about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.

But we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
- E at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).

And the letters: P, E, R, K, S. 
- P: not excluded
- K: available
- S: available

Also, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.

And the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.

Yes, ""perks"" is a valid word.

So let's go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.

<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).
- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.
- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.

The next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:
- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).
- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).
- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.

This maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.

<guess>perks</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback history:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in position 2 (for R) and not in position 5 (for E).
   - Also, C, A, N are not in the word.
2. For ""tiger"": T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - This tells us that E is not in position 4 and R is not in position 5 (since in ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5, and both were minuses).
   - Additionally, T, I, G are not in the word.
3. For ""perks"": P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
   - E and R are now correctly placed! Specifically, E is in position 2 and R is in position 3? Wait, let's check the positions:
     ""perks"": positions are 1:P, 2:E, 3:R, 4:K, 5:S
     Feedback: E(✓) at position 2 and R(✓) at position 3? But P, K, S got x.
   - This means:
        - E is at position 2 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - R is at position 3 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - P, K, S are not in the word.

So, the secret word has the pattern: _ E R _ _ 
We know:
- Position 2 is E
- Position 3 is R
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (all marked with x in previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to guess a word that starts with an unknown letter, then E (fixed at position 2), R (fixed at position 3), and then two more letters.

The constraints:
- First letter: must be one of the available letters (not in excluded list)
- Fourth letter: must be one of the available letters
- Fifth letter: must be one of the available letters

Additionally, since we know E and R are fixed at positions 2 and 3, the other positions can be filled with letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have to ensure that the word exists.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ E R _ _

Some possibilities:
- ""berry"": but B is allowed? Available. But it ends with Y? However note: we have double R? But position 3 is R, so if we have another R? The word would have R at position 3 and another R? Also, E at position 2? So B E R R Y? Positions:
  1: B, 2:E (ok), 3:R (ok), 4:R, 5:Y.
  However, we got feedback for ""perks"" that S, K, P are not in the word? And we haven't used Y? But B is available? But wait: does ""berry"" have only one R? We are placing R at position 3 and 4? The secret word might have two R's? But we don't know? So it's possible? However, we have no constraints against it.
  But note: the excluded list does not include B or Y? So it's possible? But then letter at position 4 is R? Which could be? From previous feedback? In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and got minus? But now positions are different? So it might be okay?
  Also, position 5: Y? Not excluded? 
  However, we must use distinct letters or include existing ones? Since E and R are already in, they can be reused? But the feedback for ""perks"" only showed E and R correctly placed? If there were other E or R, we wouldn't know? 

But let's consider: the feedback doesn't reveal duplicates? That is true? We only get symbols per guess? We don't know? So it could be possible? However, to be safe, we should test a word without reusing E and R unnecessarily? And include new letters to gain information.

But we only have two positions to fill? Position 1 and positions 4 and 5? And we have three unknowns? But the secret word has five positions? We know two are E and R? The remaining are unknown.

We know the available letters? Since the word is _ E R _ _, it must be composed of:

First letter: from available set
Fourth letter: from available set
Fifth letter: from available set

And the letters must not include any excluded letter.

We want to maximize the new letters? Also, try to cover common letters.

Common letters to test: Let's try to find words with M, L, D, H, O, etc.

Some candidate words:
- ""merry"": M E R R Y -> but duplicate R? And position 4 is R? Then pattern: M E R? That fixes the first three? Then fourth is R? Fifth is Y.
  But then the word has R at position 3 and 4? 

Alternative: ""berry"" as above? 
But let me check if there are other candidates.

Another: ""heron"": H E R O N -> but N is excluded? From ""crane"" we had N(x)? So N is not in the word. Cannot use.

""derby"": D E R B Y
  Positions: 
      1: D (available)
      2: E (fixed)
      3: R (fixed)
      4: B (available)
      5: Y (available)
And letters: D, E, R, B, Y? Distinct and all not excluded? 
""derby"" is a valid English word? It means a type of race or a place?

Yes, ""derby"" is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""feral"": F E R A L -> A excluded? Cannot.

""jewel"": but we don't have R? We need R at position 3? The pattern is fixed E at 2 and R at 3? So no.

""cervix"": too long? Or include X?

""perky"": used P? P is excluded? From perks feedback P(x).

How about ""merit""? but T excluded? From ""tiger"" T(x)? And I in ""tiger"" was I(x)? We cannot use I.

""nerve"": N excluded? And E appears twice? But we have N excluded? 

So ""derby"" seems a good option: uses D, E, R, B, Y? E and R fixed? And new letters D, B, Y? 

Another: ""herby"": H E R B Y? Same, or ""verge"" has E at the end? Doesn't fit pattern? We have E at position 2? And R at 3? So words must start with ? E R? 

Examples of words that fit _ E R _ _
- verb (too short? need 5 letters)? 
- verbs? That's 5 letters: V E R B S? But S is excluded? From perks S(x)? Cannot.
- herby? H E R B Y -> H not excluded? B and Y available? Yes.
- mercy? M E R C Y -> But C excluded? No.

Another: ""leroy""? Doesn't have the pattern? Must have E at 2 and R at 3? So L E R O Y? That's L E R O Y? positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:R, 4:O, 5:Y? All letters available? But is it a word? Leroy is a name? But acceptable? But not common? 

Alternatively, ""derby"" is a common word? Or ""herby""? But herby is an adjective, meaning full of herbs.

But let's also consider ""derry""? but duplicate R? D E R R Y? Position 4:R? So we fill positions: D(1), E(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5)? Then we have two R's? But we are using R at 3 and 4? Secret word might have two R's? 

But ""derry"" is a word? A place? 

However, we want to maximize new letters? In ""derby"", we have D, B, Y which have not been tested? Similarly in ""herby"", we have H, B, Y? Both introduce new letters? 

I think ""derby"" is a valid option? Also, it has distinct letters except that E and R are not duplicated? 

We'll choose ""derby"" as the guess? Because it covers common letters D, B, Y? 

But note: we have the pattern locked? We know positions 2 and 3? So the other positions are our target? 

But we don't have constraints on the first letter? So any of D, H, B, etc. are valid? 

Since we have two guesses? We can try to pin down the remaining letters? But we have 6 tries? We are at guess 4? So we have enough time? 

We'll guess ""derby""

<guess>derby</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - E is in position 2 (✓ from ""perks"").
  - R is in position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").
- The secret word pattern is: **\_ E R \_ \_**.

The next guess must:
- Maintain E in position 2 and R in position 3.
- Use only untested letters from the available set: B, D, F, H, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, Z.
- Test new common letters to identify the missing letters at positions 1, 4, and 5.

The word **""derby""** fits perfectly:
- **D** (new), **B** (new), **Y** (new) — all untested letters.
- Matches the pattern: D in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, B in 4, Y in 5.
- Valid English word meaning a type of race or competition.
- Maximizes information by testing three new letters (D, B, Y) against the secret word's remaining positions.

We cannot do that.\n\nWe need E at position 3: R _ E _ _\n\nSo position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.\n\nSame issue: we cannot have E at 4.\n\nSo we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven\'t tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.\n\nMoreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.\n\nSo let\'s recap:\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don\'t know duplicates)\n- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G\n- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)\n- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)\n\nStructure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We\'ll avoid unless necessary.\n\nHow about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _\n\nExample words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R\'s? not good), ""perky""\n\nAnother: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.\n\nWe need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.\n\nCandidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.\n\nAnother: ""merry"" -> again, two R\'s? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don\'t know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates to get clean information.\n\nAnother word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. \n   Positions: \n      1: S\n      2: O\n      3: W\n      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, we avoid position 4 for E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.\n\nHow about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: \n  1: F\n  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.\n  3: V\n  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don\'t know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let\'s try one:\n\nOption: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ \nWords: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.\n\nSo ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.\n\n""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.\n\n""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.\n\n""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.\n\nHow about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don\'t know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? \n\nWe want to test new positions? Still, let\'s see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? \nR at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? \nBut E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? \n\nBut ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that\'s okay.\n\nWe can try, but to avoid complexity, let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\nAlternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ \n\nWe would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? \n\nExample: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.\n\nHow about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.\n\nWe can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _\n\nWords: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.\n\n""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.\n\nWait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? \n\nExample: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.\n\nHow about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.\n\nAnother: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.\n\nLetter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.\n\nExample: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? \n\nBut we can\'t use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.\n\nHow about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.\n\nWe must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:\n- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?\n- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? \n- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? \n\nAnd we can make a word.\n\nSo let\'s try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _\n\nExample: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. \n""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? \nWe need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? \n\nPositions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?\n\nWe need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z\n\nExample: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? \n""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.\n\nHow about ""flicker""? Too long.\n\n""seams""? S E A? A excluded.\n\n""pears""? P E A? A excluded.\n\n""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.\n\n"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.\n\nMaybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _\n\nExample word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That\'s allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.\n\nHow about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.\n\nBut we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \n- E at 2: allowed.\n- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).\n\nAnd the letters: P, E, R, K, S. \n- P: not excluded\n- K: available\n- S: available\n\nAlso, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.\n\nAnd the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.\n\nYes, ""perks"" is a valid word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.\n\n<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).\n- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:\n- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).\n- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).\n- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.\n\nThis maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.\n\n<guess>perks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback history:\n1.

But wait: does ""berry"" have only one R? We are placing R at position 3 and 4? The secret word might have two R\'s? But we don\'t know? So it\'s possible? However, we have no constraints against it.\n  But note: the excluded list does not include B or Y? So it\'s possible? But then letter at position 4 is R? Which could be? From previous feedback?

Not excluded? \n  However, we must use distinct letters or include existing ones? Since E and R are already in, they can be reused? But the feedback for ""perks"" only showed E and R correctly placed? If there were other E or R, we wouldn\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s consider: the feedback doesn\'t reveal duplicates? That is true? We only get symbols per guess? We don\'t know? So it could be possible? However, to be safe, we should test a word without reusing E and R unnecessarily?

We have feedback from guess 4 ""derby"": D(x) E(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- D (position 1) -> x: not in the secret word at all.
- E (position 2) -> ✓: correct and correct position (which we already knew).
- R (position 3) -> ✓: correct and correct position (known).
- B (position 4) -> x: not in the secret word.
- Y (position 5) -> ✓: correct and in the correct position.

So, new information:
- Y is in the secret word and in position 5? Wait, Y is at position 5? The feedback says Y(✓) so yes? Therefore:
  - Position 5 is Y.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ E R _ Y

Also, new exclusions:
- D is not in the word (so we add to the excluded list).
- B is not in the word (excluded).

Therefore, the current secret word structure: 1st letter unknown, 4th letter unknown, and:
Known letters: 
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y

And the positions that are unknown: positions 1 and 4.

We know the secret word must not include: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (excluded).

Available letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and Y is already in position 5? But we are still testing? No, we already know position 5 is Y).

We need to find a word that fits the pattern _ E R _ Y

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B

Therefore, only possibilities for position 1 and 4?

We also need to satisfy the known constraints: E at 2, R at 3, Y at 5? And the word must be formed from the available letters? 

Moreover, there might be duplicates? But we haven't seen any? So we assume distinct for now? But we don't know? However, we have five distinct positions? 

Possible words:
- ferry: F E R R Y -> but R is already at position 3? So position 4 would be another R? Duplicate? But also, ferry has two R's? But we don't know? Also, F is available? But let's see: positions: 
  1: F -> available? Yes
  2: E -> fixed
  3: R -> fixed
  4: R -> if we put R? Then we have two R's? 
  5: Y -> fixed

But is that a word? ""ferry"" is valid? 
But we already know R is at position 3? If the secret word has two R's, then in ""derby"", we had R at position 3 and Y at 5? But position 4 was B? And we got B(x)? So the secret word has R at position 3 and if it has another R, it didn't show? Because in ""perks"", position 3 was R? and in ""tiger"" position 5 R? But if ""ferry"" has R at 1? That's position 4? But that's not position 1? Wait ""ferry"": 
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? Yes

So position 4 is R? So the word is F E R R Y? Then we have two R's? But we don't know? The feedback ""perks"" said R was in position 3? And that was confirmed? But does not rule out another R? Similarly, the feedback for ""crane"" had R minus? Which could mean one or more R's? But only revealed one? 

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating R? 

For example: 
- ""every"": E V E R Y? But then position 1 would be E? But pattern says position 1 is unknown? 
""every"": E V E R Y -> positions: 
  1: E? But we have E at position 2? So two E's? 
  Also, E at position 1? But then we have E at position 1 and 2? 
  However, in ""every"", the pattern: 
      pos1: E, pos2: V? that doesn't match E at pos2! 

Because we need the pattern _ E R _ Y? So position 2 is E? So any word that doesn't have E at position 2 doesn't fit? 

We must have position 2 fixed as E? And position 3 fixed as R? 

So we need words that start with any letter, then E, then R, then any letter, then Y? 

Example: ""furry"": F U R R Y? But position 3 is R? So we have F U R R Y? No: 
  ""furry"": F at 1, U at 2, R at 3, R at 4, Y at 5? 
But we require position 2 to be E? So ""furry"" doesn't have E at position 2? So it doesn't fit? 

We need the word to have E at position 2? So examples:
- ""merry"" -> M E R R Y? Pattern: M, E, R, R, Y? 
But we know M is available? 
And R at position 4? 
So it fits pattern? 
But also, ""herry"" is not a word? 
""berry"" -> B? B is excluded? From ""derby"" we have B(x)? 

Another: ""jerry"": J E R R Y? Or ""jerky"": J E R K Y? But K is excluded? 

""leery"": L E E R Y? Then pattern: L(1), E(2), E at 3? But position 3 must be R? So no? 
We need position 3 to be R? 

How about ""every""? Doesn't fit? 
Also, ""query"": Q U E R Y? That doesn't have E at position 2? It has Q(1), U(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
But we require position 3 to be R? So E at position 3? So that pattern doesn't match our requirement. 

Another try? Words ending in ...ERY? Or more precisely, the pattern includes E at position 2 and R at position 3? 

So we need words of the form: ? E R ? Y

With the available letters for positions 1 and 4? And no excluded letters.

Let me see possible words:
- merry: M E R R Y? But M available? R at position 4? 
  But M not excluded? R? We are reusing R? But not excluded? 
- ferry: F E R R Y? Same? 
- herry: is that a word? Not common? 
- berry: but B excluded? 
- terry: T excluded? 
- perry: P excluded? 

Without repeating R? 
- ""leery"": L E E R Y? But then position 3 is E? We need R at position 3? 
- ""query"": Q U E R Y? But E is at position 3? 

We need R explicitly at position 3? So no? 

Possibly: ""fever""? But we have E at position 4? And also we need Y? 

The only options? We have limited words? 

Another: ""merle"" doesn't end with Y? 

How about ""every""? Doesn't fit? 

Consider? ""fury"" is 4 letters? 

Alternatively, ""emery"": E M E R Y? But then pattern: E(1), M(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
But we need position 2 to be E? And position 3 to be R? 

Not matching: 
  We require: pos1:?, pos2:E, pos3:R, pos4:?, pos5:Y

In ""emery"": 
  pos1: E, pos2: M, pos3: E, pos4: R, pos5: Y? So doesn't have E at position 2? 

Another possibility? ""deray""? But we excluded D and A? 

Wait, we must find a word that has E at position 2, R at position 3, Y at position 5, and positions 1 and 4 filled with available letters? 

Available letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Examples:
- F E R ? Y? For position 4, it could be L? So ""ferly""? Is that a word? Meaning rare? Not common? 
- H E R ? Y? ""Herby""? But we excluded B? 
- ""Hermy""? Not a word? 
- L E R? ""lerry""? No? 
- M E R ? Y: ""mercy""? But C excluded? ""merry"" is a common word? And M available? 
- O E R ? Y: ""oery""? Not a word? 
- Q E R ? Y: ""query"" doesn't fit pattern? 
- U E R ? Y: ""uerry""? Not a word? 
- V E R ? Y: ""verry""? Not common? 

Therefore, the only common words seem to be ""merry"" and ""ferry""? 

We'll choose ""merry""? Since M is a common letter? 

But let me see: ""jelly"" doesn't work? 

Or ""worry""? W O R R Y? But we need E at position 2? Not available? 

So only ""merry"" and ""ferry"" are likely? 

We have M and F available? 

We'll guess ""merry""? 

But note: in the feedback from ""perks"", we saw S and K excluded? And in ""derby"", D and B excluded? 

Also, we already used R? But we are reusing it? 

Since we have two options? And we are at guess 5 (we started at 1: crane, 2: tiger, 3: perks, 4: derby? So next is 5: this one)? We have tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't repeat R? But we haven't found any? 

So let's guess ""merry""? 

But wait, what about ""every""? We discussed? Doesn't fit? 

Perhaps we have the wrong pattern? 

But what about ""fairy""? But A excluded? And I excluded? 

Confirmed: only possibilities are words like ""merry"", ""ferry""? 

So I choose ""merry""

### Thought Process

Based on the cumulative feedback:

1. **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (all marked with ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - These letters are **not** in the secret word.
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - **E** is fixed at position 2 (✓ from ""perks"" and ""derby"").
   - **R** is fixed at position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").
   - **Y** is fixed at position 5 (✓ from ""derby"").
3. **Secret Word Pattern**: The word follows the structure **\_ E R \_ Y**, where:
   - Position 1 must be an untested letter from the remaining available pool.
   - Position 4 must be an untested letter from the remaining available pool.
4. **Available Letters**: Only untested letters remain: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since Y is confirmed at position 5).
5. **Constraints**:
   - Position 4 cannot reuse R (due to earlier feedback), though duplicates are possible but unconfirmed. Common words fitting the pattern with Y at position 5 (e.g., ""merry"", ""ferry"") suggest position 4 may use R, but alternatives are limited.

### Analysis
- The word must match **\_ E R \_ Y**.
- Common English words with position 2 as ""E"", position 3 as ""R"", and position 5 as ""Y"" include **""merry""** and **""ferry""**, both using R at position 4.
  - ""merry"": M at position 1, R at position 4 (M is untested and available).
  - ""ferry"": F at position 1, R at position 4 (F is untested and available).
- Duplicate R is plausible (not ruled out by feedback), and ""merry"" introduces **M**, a common untested letter. If correct, it confirms the full word; if incorrect, it reveals position 4 isn't R (and we retain U, V, etc. for position 1/4).

### Guess Selection
- **""merry""** is chosen:
  - Tests **M** (position 1) and reuses **R** for position 4 (which may be correct based on pattern).
  - If ""merry"" fails, it eliminates M and positions R at position 4, prioritizing information gain for the final guess.

<guess>merry</guess>",merry,"We have feedback from guess 4 ""derby"": D(x) E(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- D (position 1) -> x: not in the secret word at all.
- E (position 2) -> ✓: correct and correct position (which we already knew).
- R (position 3) -> ✓: correct and correct position (known).
- B (position 4) -> x: not in the secret word.
- Y (position 5) -> ✓: correct and in the correct position.

So, new information:
- Y is in the secret word and in position 5? Wait, Y is at position 5? The feedback says Y(✓) so yes? Therefore:
  - Position 5 is Y.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ E R _ Y

Also, new exclusions:
- D is not in the word (so we add to the excluded list).
- B is not in the word (excluded).

Therefore, the current secret word structure: 1st letter unknown, 4th letter unknown, and:
Known letters: 
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y

And the positions that are unknown: positions 1 and 4.

We know the secret word must not include: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (excluded).

Available letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and Y is already in position 5? But we are still testing? No, we already know position 5 is Y).

We need to find a word that fits the pattern _ E R _ Y

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B

Therefore, only possibilities for position 1 and 4?

We also need to satisfy the known constraints: E at 2, R at 3, Y at 5? And the word must be formed from the available letters? 

Moreover, there might be duplicates? But we haven't seen any? So we assume distinct for now? But we don't know? However, we have five distinct positions? 

Possible words:
- ferry: F E R R Y -> but R is already at position 3? So position 4 would be another R? Duplicate? But also, ferry has two R's? But we don't know? Also, F is available? But let's see: positions: 
  1: F -> available? Yes
  2: E -> fixed
  3: R -> fixed
  4: R -> if we put R? Then we have two R's? 
  5: Y -> fixed

But is that a word? ""ferry"" is valid? 
But we already know R is at position 3? If the secret word has two R's, then in ""derby"", we had R at position 3 and Y at 5? But position 4 was B? And we got B(x)? So the secret word has R at position 3 and if it has another R, it didn't show? Because in ""perks"", position 3 was R? and in ""tiger"" position 5 R? But if ""ferry"" has R at 1? That's position 4? But that's not position 1? Wait ""ferry"": 
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? Yes

So position 4 is R? So the word is F E R R Y? Then we have two R's? But we don't know? The feedback ""perks"" said R was in position 3? And that was confirmed? But does not rule out another R? Similarly, the feedback for ""crane"" had R minus? Which could mean one or more R's? But only revealed one? 

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating R? 

For example: 
- ""every"": E V E R Y? But then position 1 would be E? But pattern says position 1 is unknown? 
""every"": E V E R Y -> positions: 
  1: E? But we have E at position 2? So two E's? 
  Also, E at position 1? But then we have E at position 1 and 2? 
  However, in ""every"", the pattern: 
      pos1: E, pos2: V? that doesn't match E at pos2! 

Because we need the pattern _ E R _ Y? So position 2 is E? So any word that doesn't have E at position 2 doesn't fit? 

We must have position 2 fixed as E? And position 3 fixed as R? 

So we need words that start with any letter, then E, then R, then any letter, then Y? 

Example: ""furry"": F U R R Y? But position 3 is R? So we have F U R R Y? No: 
  ""furry"": F at 1, U at 2, R at 3, R at 4, Y at 5? 
But we require position 2 to be E? So ""furry"" doesn't have E at position 2? So it doesn't fit? 

We need the word to have E at position 2? So examples:
- ""merry"" -> M E R R Y? Pattern: M, E, R, R, Y? 
But we know M is available? 
And R at position 4? 
So it fits pattern? 
But also, ""herry"" is not a word? 
""berry"" -> B? B is excluded? From ""derby"" we have B(x)? 

Another: ""jerry"": J E R R Y? Or ""jerky"": J E R K Y? But K is excluded? 

""leery"": L E E R Y? Then pattern: L(1), E(2), E at 3? But position 3 must be R? So no? 
We need position 3 to be R? 

How about ""every""? Doesn't fit? 
Also, ""query"": Q U E R Y? That doesn't have E at position 2? It has Q(1), U(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
But we require position 3 to be R? So E at position 3? So that pattern doesn't match our requirement. 

Another try? Words ending in ...ERY? Or more precisely, the pattern includes E at position 2 and R at position 3? 

So we need words of the form: ? E R ? Y

With the available letters for positions 1 and 4? And no excluded letters.

Let me see possible words:
- merry: M E R R Y? But M available? R at position 4? 
  But M not excluded? R? We are reusing R? But not excluded? 
- ferry: F E R R Y? Same? 
- herry: is that a word? Not common? 
- berry: but B excluded? 
- terry: T excluded? 
- perry: P excluded? 

Without repeating R? 
- ""leery"": L E E R Y? But then position 3 is E? We need R at position 3? 
- ""query"": Q U E R Y? But E is at position 3? 

We need R explicitly at position 3? So no? 

Possibly: ""fever""? But we have E at position 4? And also we need Y? 

The only options? We have limited words? 

Another: ""merle"" doesn't end with Y? 

How about ""every""? Doesn't fit? 

Consider? ""fury"" is 4 letters? 

Alternatively, ""emery"": E M E R Y? But then pattern: E(1), M(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
But we need position 2 to be E? And position 3 to be R? 

Not matching: 
  We require: pos1:?, pos2:E, pos3:R, pos4:?, pos5:Y

In ""emery"": 
  pos1: E, pos2: M, pos3: E, pos4: R, pos5: Y? So doesn't have E at position 2? 

Another possibility? ""deray""? But we excluded D and A? 

Wait, we must find a word that has E at position 2, R at position 3, Y at position 5, and positions 1 and 4 filled with available letters? 

Available letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Examples:
- F E R ? Y? For position 4, it could be L? So ""ferly""? Is that a word? Meaning rare? Not common? 
- H E R ? Y? ""Herby""? But we excluded B? 
- ""Hermy""? Not a word? 
- L E R? ""lerry""? No? 
- M E R ? Y: ""mercy""? But C excluded? ""merry"" is a common word? And M available? 
- O E R ? Y: ""oery""? Not a word? 
- Q E R ? Y: ""query"" doesn't fit pattern? 
- U E R ? Y: ""uerry""? Not a word? 
- V E R ? Y: ""verry""? Not common? 

Therefore, the only common words seem to be ""merry"" and ""ferry""? 

We'll choose ""merry""? Since M is a common letter? 

But let me see: ""jelly"" doesn't work? 

Or ""worry""? W O R R Y? But we need E at position 2? Not available? 

So only ""merry"" and ""ferry"" are likely? 

We have M and F available? 

We'll guess ""merry""? 

But note: in the feedback from ""perks"", we saw S and K excluded? And in ""derby"", D and B excluded? 

Also, we already used R? But we are reusing it? 

Since we have two options? And we are at guess 5 (we started at 1: crane, 2: tiger, 3: perks, 4: derby? So next is 5: this one)? We have tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't repeat R? But we haven't found any? 

So let's guess ""merry""? 

But wait, what about ""every""? We discussed? Doesn't fit? 

Perhaps we have the wrong pattern? 

But what about ""fairy""? But A excluded? And I excluded? 

Confirmed: only possibilities are words like ""merry"", ""ferry""? 

So I choose ""merry""

<guess>merry</guess>### Thought Process

Based on the cumulative feedback:

1. **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (all marked with ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - These letters are **not** in the secret word.
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,FERRY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word in Wordle. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 3. Places R and E in positions different from the first guess (i.e., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5. So E could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word does not contain C, A, N.

 For the next guess, we can try to place R and E in new positions and introduce three new letters.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to choose a word that has R and E and three new letters, and that is a valid English word.

 Some candidate words:

 Option 1: Place R at the beginning and E in the middle? For example: R _ _ E _
 But we don't know the other letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Example words:
 - ""roger"": has R, O, G, E, R -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.
   However, we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one R (as a minus). If there were two R's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: the secret word might have only one R.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R. 
   This has T, I, G, E, R. 
   But note: the word ""tiger"" has R at the end (position 5) and E at position 4? 
   Positions: 
      T (1), I (2), G (3), E (4), R (5)

 However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was a minus. Now we are putting E at position 4 and R at position 5. This is acceptable because the feedback said E is not at position 5 (so position 4 is allowed) and R is not at position 2 (so position 5 is allowed).

 But wait: the feedback for R in the first guess was at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 5. That's a different position, so it's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have more than one R? But we don't have evidence for that. We'll assume one R for now.

 Let's check if ""tiger"" is a valid word: yes.

 But note: we are introducing T, I, G. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R in positions we haven't tried and also covers common letters.

 Another candidate: ""water"" -> W, A, T, E, R. But wait, we know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was x). So we cannot use A.

 Another: ""swept"" -> but that doesn't have R and E? We need to include R and E.

 How about ""robed""? But we know we cannot use A? Actually, we don't have A in ""robed"", but we have B, D. However, we also have O and E. But note: we don't have R in the second position? 
 ""robed"": R at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
 But we know that R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put R at position 1 because the feedback only said R is not at position 2. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed).

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N. ""robed"" doesn't have those.

 But we are introducing O, B, D.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" seems good.

 Let me compare with ""risen"": R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5. But wait, we know N is not in the word (from first feedback: N was x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""rides"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This avoids A, C, N. And positions: R is at 1 (not 2) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's valid.

 But we have two options: ""tiger"" and ""rides"". Which one is better?

 We want to cover more common letters. Also, note that in ""tiger"", we have T, I, G, E, R. In ""rides"", we have R, I, D, E, S.

 The letter S is very common, so maybe ""rides"" is good? But we also have D and S.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> but then R is at position 3? That's allowed. And E at 4? Allowed. And S at 5? We don't know about S.

 However, we are trying to maximize new information. We have 6 tries, so we can try one.

 Let me choose ""tiger"" because it has G which is less common? Actually, we want to test more common letters.

 Another idea: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). 
   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? 
   Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we know it will be wrong again? 
   So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, in ""store"", E is at position 5 -> that's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""stare""? But we know A is not in the word. So no.

 How about ""strep""? But that's 5 letters? S, T, R, E, P. 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), E(4), P(5). 
   This avoids E at 5 and R at 2. Also, no A, C, N.

 But we don't know if P is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""tiger"" is a valid word and places E at 4 and R at 5, which are new positions.

 Let me go with ""tiger"".

 But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 2. We don't know about I.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R and also uses the fact that we know the first letter is not C (and not A, etc.). We don't know the first letter.

 After thinking, I choose ""tiger"".

 So the next guess is ""tiger"".

<guess>tiger</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid **C, A, N** (excluded letters).
- Place **R** anywhere except position 2, and **E** anywhere except position 5.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., **T, I, G**).

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E** (position 4, not 5), **R** (position 5, not 2).
- Tests three new letters while strategically repositioning R and E.

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""tiger"": T(x), I(x), G(x), E(-), R(-)
   - T, I, G are not in the word (new exclusions).
   - E and R are in the word, but not in the positions guessed. In ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is not at position 4, and R is not at position 5.

Combining the feedback:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G
- Confirmed letters in the word: R and E (but we don't know their positions).

We also know from both guesses the positions that R and E cannot be in:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 5 (from ""tiger"").
- E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 4 (from ""tiger"").

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since not 2 or 5)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We have two letters confirmed: R and E. We must include these in the next guess, placed in positions that haven't been tried and are still possible.

We also need to choose three additional letters that are not in the excluded list and not R or E.

Excluded so far: C, A, N, T, I, G. So available letters are:
B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.

Moreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). 

Let's try to form a word:

Consider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.

Candidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don't have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let's see:

""robed"": R, O, B, E, D
- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)
- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.

So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.

Wait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
But R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.

Option: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _
But RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.

Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Alternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.

Possibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R's? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.

Better: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S's? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S's. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.

We need E at position 3: R _ E _ _

So position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.

Same issue: we cannot have E at 4.

So we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven't tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.

Moreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.

So let's recap:

We need a word that:
- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don't know duplicates)
- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G
- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)

Structure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We'll avoid unless necessary.

How about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _

Example words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R's? not good), ""perky""

Another: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.

We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Candidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.

Another: ""merry"" -> again, two R's? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don't know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates to get clean information.

Another word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. 
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: O
      3: W
      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.

Similarly, we avoid position 4 for E.

Another candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.

How about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.

Therefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: 
  1: F
  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.
  3: V
  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don't know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.

We need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let's try one:

Option: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ 
Words: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.

So ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.

""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.

""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.

""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.

How about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don't know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? 

We want to test new positions? Still, let's see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? 
R at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? 
But E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? 

But ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it's acceptable.

But duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that's okay.

We can try, but to avoid complexity, let's try to avoid duplicates.

Alternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ 

We would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? 

Example: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.

How about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.

We can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _

Words: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.

""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.

Wait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? 

Example: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.

How about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.

Another: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.

Letter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _

We need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.

Example: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? 

But we can't use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.

How about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.

We must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:
- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?
- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? 
- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? 

And we can make a word.

So let's try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _

Example: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. 
""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? 
We need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? 

Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

We need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z

Example: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? 
""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.

We haven't many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.

How about ""flicker""? Too long.

""seams""? S E A? A excluded.

""pears""? P E A? A excluded.

""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.

It's challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.

"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.

Maybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _

Example word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That's allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.

How about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.

But we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
- E at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).

And the letters: P, E, R, K, S. 
- P: not excluded
- K: available
- S: available

Also, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.

And the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.

Yes, ""perks"" is a valid word.

So let's go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.

<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).
- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.
- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.

The next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:
- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).
- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).
- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.

This maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.

<guess>perks</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback history:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - This tells us that R and E are in the word, but not in position 2 (for R) and not in position 5 (for E).
   - Also, C, A, N are not in the word.
2. For ""tiger"": T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - This tells us that E is not in position 4 and R is not in position 5 (since in ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5, and both were minuses).
   - Additionally, T, I, G are not in the word.
3. For ""perks"": P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
   - E and R are now correctly placed! Specifically, E is in position 2 and R is in position 3? Wait, let's check the positions:
     ""perks"": positions are 1:P, 2:E, 3:R, 4:K, 5:S
     Feedback: E(✓) at position 2 and R(✓) at position 3? But P, K, S got x.
   - This means:
        - E is at position 2 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - R is at position 3 (correct) and that's confirmed.
        - P, K, S are not in the word.

So, the secret word has the pattern: _ E R _ _ 
We know:
- Position 2 is E
- Position 3 is R
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (all marked with x in previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to guess a word that starts with an unknown letter, then E (fixed at position 2), R (fixed at position 3), and then two more letters.

The constraints:
- First letter: must be one of the available letters (not in excluded list)
- Fourth letter: must be one of the available letters
- Fifth letter: must be one of the available letters

Additionally, since we know E and R are fixed at positions 2 and 3, the other positions can be filled with letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have to ensure that the word exists.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ E R _ _

Some possibilities:
- ""berry"": but B is allowed? Available. But it ends with Y? However note: we have double R? But position 3 is R, so if we have another R? The word would have R at position 3 and another R? Also, E at position 2? So B E R R Y? Positions:
  1: B, 2:E (ok), 3:R (ok), 4:R, 5:Y.
  However, we got feedback for ""perks"" that S, K, P are not in the word? And we haven't used Y? But B is available? But wait: does ""berry"" have only one R? We are placing R at position 3 and 4? The secret word might have two R's? But we don't know? So it's possible? However, we have no constraints against it.
  But note: the excluded list does not include B or Y? So it's possible? But then letter at position 4 is R? Which could be? From previous feedback? In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and got minus? But now positions are different? So it might be okay?
  Also, position 5: Y? Not excluded? 
  However, we must use distinct letters or include existing ones? Since E and R are already in, they can be reused? But the feedback for ""perks"" only showed E and R correctly placed? If there were other E or R, we wouldn't know? 

But let's consider: the feedback doesn't reveal duplicates? That is true? We only get symbols per guess? We don't know? So it could be possible? However, to be safe, we should test a word without reusing E and R unnecessarily? And include new letters to gain information.

But we only have two positions to fill? Position 1 and positions 4 and 5? And we have three unknowns? But the secret word has five positions? We know two are E and R? The remaining are unknown.

We know the available letters? Since the word is _ E R _ _, it must be composed of:

First letter: from available set
Fourth letter: from available set
Fifth letter: from available set

And the letters must not include any excluded letter.

We want to maximize the new letters? Also, try to cover common letters.

Common letters to test: Let's try to find words with M, L, D, H, O, etc.

Some candidate words:
- ""merry"": M E R R Y -> but duplicate R? And position 4 is R? Then pattern: M E R? That fixes the first three? Then fourth is R? Fifth is Y.
  But then the word has R at position 3 and 4? 

Alternative: ""berry"" as above? 
But let me check if there are other candidates.

Another: ""heron"": H E R O N -> but N is excluded? From ""crane"" we had N(x)? So N is not in the word. Cannot use.

""derby"": D E R B Y
  Positions: 
      1: D (available)
      2: E (fixed)
      3: R (fixed)
      4: B (available)
      5: Y (available)
And letters: D, E, R, B, Y? Distinct and all not excluded? 
""derby"" is a valid English word? It means a type of race or a place?

Yes, ""derby"" is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""feral"": F E R A L -> A excluded? Cannot.

""jewel"": but we don't have R? We need R at position 3? The pattern is fixed E at 2 and R at 3? So no.

""cervix"": too long? Or include X?

""perky"": used P? P is excluded? From perks feedback P(x).

How about ""merit""? but T excluded? From ""tiger"" T(x)? And I in ""tiger"" was I(x)? We cannot use I.

""nerve"": N excluded? And E appears twice? But we have N excluded? 

So ""derby"" seems a good option: uses D, E, R, B, Y? E and R fixed? And new letters D, B, Y? 

Another: ""herby"": H E R B Y? Same, or ""verge"" has E at the end? Doesn't fit pattern? We have E at position 2? And R at 3? So words must start with ? E R? 

Examples of words that fit _ E R _ _
- verb (too short? need 5 letters)? 
- verbs? That's 5 letters: V E R B S? But S is excluded? From perks S(x)? Cannot.
- herby? H E R B Y -> H not excluded? B and Y available? Yes.
- mercy? M E R C Y -> But C excluded? No.

Another: ""leroy""? Doesn't have the pattern? Must have E at 2 and R at 3? So L E R O Y? That's L E R O Y? positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:R, 4:O, 5:Y? All letters available? But is it a word? Leroy is a name? But acceptable? But not common? 

Alternatively, ""derby"" is a common word? Or ""herby""? But herby is an adjective, meaning full of herbs.

But let's also consider ""derry""? but duplicate R? D E R R Y? Position 4:R? So we fill positions: D(1), E(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5)? Then we have two R's? But we are using R at 3 and 4? Secret word might have two R's? 

But ""derry"" is a word? A place? 

However, we want to maximize new letters? In ""derby"", we have D, B, Y which have not been tested? Similarly in ""herby"", we have H, B, Y? Both introduce new letters? 

I think ""derby"" is a valid option? Also, it has distinct letters except that E and R are not duplicated? 

We'll choose ""derby"" as the guess? Because it covers common letters D, B, Y? 

But note: we have the pattern locked? We know positions 2 and 3? So the other positions are our target? 

But we don't have constraints on the first letter? So any of D, H, B, etc. are valid? 

Since we have two guesses? We can try to pin down the remaining letters? But we have 6 tries? We are at guess 4? So we have enough time? 

We'll guess ""derby""

<guess>derby</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S (marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - E is in position 2 (✓ from ""perks"").
  - R is in position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").
- The secret word pattern is: **\_ E R \_ \_**.

The next guess must:
- Maintain E in position 2 and R in position 3.
- Use only untested letters from the available set: B, D, F, H, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, Z.
- Test new common letters to identify the missing letters at positions 1, 4, and 5.

The word **""derby""** fits perfectly:
- **D** (new), **B** (new), **Y** (new) — all untested letters.
- Matches the pattern: D in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, B in 4, Y in 5.
- Valid English word meaning a type of race or competition.
- Maximizes information by testing three new letters (D, B, Y) against the secret word's remaining positions.

<guess>derby</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
Guess 4: derby -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from guess 4 ""derby"": D(x) E(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- D (position 1) -> x: not in the secret word at all.
- E (position 2) -> ✓: correct and correct position (which we already knew).
- R (position 3) -> ✓: correct and correct position (known).
- B (position 4) -> x: not in the secret word.
- Y (position 5) -> ✓: correct and in the correct position.

So, new information:
- Y is in the secret word and in position 5? Wait, Y is at position 5? The feedback says Y(✓) so yes? Therefore:
  - Position 5 is Y.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ E R _ Y

Also, new exclusions:
- D is not in the word (so we add to the excluded list).
- B is not in the word (excluded).

Therefore, the current secret word structure: 1st letter unknown, 4th letter unknown, and:
Known letters: 
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y

And the positions that are unknown: positions 1 and 4.

We know the secret word must not include: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (excluded).

Available letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and Y is already in position 5? But we are still testing? No, we already know position 5 is Y).

We need to find a word that fits the pattern _ E R _ Y

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B

Therefore, only possibilities for position 1 and 4?

We also need to satisfy the known constraints: E at 2, R at 3, Y at 5? And the word must be formed from the available letters? 

Moreover, there might be duplicates? But we haven't seen any? So we assume distinct for now? But we don't know? However, we have five distinct positions? 

Possible words:
- ferry: F E R R Y -> but R is already at position 3? So position 4 would be another R? Duplicate? But also, ferry has two R's? But we don't know? Also, F is available? But let's see: positions: 
  1: F -> available? Yes
  2: E -> fixed
  3: R -> fixed
  4: R -> if we put R? Then we have two R's? 
  5: Y -> fixed

But is that a word? ""ferry"" is valid? 
But we already know R is at position 3? If the secret word has two R's, then in ""derby"", we had R at position 3 and Y at 5? But position 4 was B? And we got B(x)? So the secret word has R at position 3 and if it has another R, it didn't show? Because in ""perks"", position 3 was R? and in ""tiger"" position 5 R? But if ""ferry"" has R at 1? That's position 4? But that's not position 1? Wait ""ferry"": 
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? Yes

So position 4 is R? So the word is F E R R Y? Then we have two R's? But we don't know? The feedback ""perks"" said R was in position 3? And that was confirmed? But does not rule out another R? Similarly, the feedback for ""crane"" had R minus? Which could mean one or more R's? But only revealed one? 

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating R? 

For example: 
- ""every"": E V E R Y? But then position 1 would be E? But pattern says position 1 is unknown? 
""every"": E V E R Y -> positions: 
  1: E? But we have E at position 2? So two E's? 
  Also, E at position 1? But then we have E at position 1 and 2? 
  However, in ""every"", the pattern: 
      pos1: E, pos2: V? that doesn't match E at pos2! 

Because we need the pattern _ E R _ Y? So position 2 is E? So any word that doesn't have E at position 2 doesn't fit? 

We must have position 2 fixed as E? And position 3 fixed as R? 

So we need words that start with any letter, then E, then R, then any letter, then Y? 

Example: ""furry"": F U R R Y? But position 3 is R? So we have F U R R Y? No: 
  ""furry"": F at 1, U at 2, R at 3, R at 4, Y at 5? 
But we require position 2 to be E? So ""furry"" doesn't have E at position 2? So it doesn't fit? 

We need the word to have E at position 2? So examples:
- ""merry"" -> M E R R Y? Pattern: M, E, R, R, Y? 
But we know M is available? 
And R at position 4? 
So it fits pattern? 
But also, ""herry"" is not a word? 
""berry"" -> B? B is excluded? From ""derby"" we have B(x)? 

Another: ""jerry"": J E R R Y? Or ""jerky"": J E R K Y? But K is excluded? 

""leery"": L E E R Y? Then pattern: L(1), E(2), E at 3? But position 3 must be R? So no? 
We need position 3 to be R? 

How about ""every""? Doesn't fit? 
Also, ""query"": Q U E R Y? That doesn't have E at position 2? It has Q(1), U(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
But we require position 3 to be R? So E at position 3? So that pattern doesn't match our requirement. 

Another try? Words ending in ...ERY? Or more precisely, the pattern includes E at position 2 and R at position 3? 

So we need words of the form: ? E R ? Y

With the available letters for positions 1 and 4? And no excluded letters.

Let me see possible words:
- merry: M E R R Y? But M available? R at position 4? 
  But M not excluded? R? We are reusing R? But not excluded? 
- ferry: F E R R Y? Same? 
- herry: is that a word? Not common? 
- berry: but B excluded? 
- terry: T excluded? 
- perry: P excluded? 

Without repeating R? 
- ""leery"": L E E R Y? But then position 3 is E? We need R at position 3? 
- ""query"": Q U E R Y? But E is at position 3? 

We need R explicitly at position 3? So no? 

Possibly: ""fever""? But we have E at position 4? And also we need Y? 

The only options? We have limited words? 

Another: ""merle"" doesn't end with Y? 

How about ""every""? Doesn't fit? 

Consider? ""fury"" is 4 letters? 

Alternatively, ""emery"": E M E R Y? But then pattern: E(1), M(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
But we need position 2 to be E? And position 3 to be R? 

Not matching: 
  We require: pos1:?, pos2:E, pos3:R, pos4:?, pos5:Y

In ""emery"": 
  pos1: E, pos2: M, pos3: E, pos4: R, pos5: Y? So doesn't have E at position 2? 

Another possibility? ""deray""? But we excluded D and A? 

Wait, we must find a word that has E at position 2, R at position 3, Y at position 5, and positions 1 and 4 filled with available letters? 

Available letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Examples:
- F E R ? Y? For position 4, it could be L? So ""ferly""? Is that a word? Meaning rare? Not common? 
- H E R ? Y? ""Herby""? But we excluded B? 
- ""Hermy""? Not a word? 
- L E R? ""lerry""? No? 
- M E R ? Y: ""mercy""? But C excluded? ""merry"" is a common word? And M available? 
- O E R ? Y: ""oery""? Not a word? 
- Q E R ? Y: ""query"" doesn't fit pattern? 
- U E R ? Y: ""uerry""? Not a word? 
- V E R ? Y: ""verry""? Not common? 

Therefore, the only common words seem to be ""merry"" and ""ferry""? 

We'll choose ""merry""? Since M is a common letter? 

But let me see: ""jelly"" doesn't work? 

Or ""worry""? W O R R Y? But we need E at position 2? Not available? 

So only ""merry"" and ""ferry"" are likely? 

We have M and F available? 

We'll guess ""merry""? 

But note: in the feedback from ""perks"", we saw S and K excluded? And in ""derby"", D and B excluded? 

Also, we already used R? But we are reusing it? 

Since we have two options? And we are at guess 5 (we started at 1: crane, 2: tiger, 3: perks, 4: derby? So next is 5: this one)? We have tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't repeat R? But we haven't found any? 

So let's guess ""merry""? 

But wait, what about ""every""? We discussed? Doesn't fit? 

Perhaps we have the wrong pattern? 

But what about ""fairy""? But A excluded? And I excluded? 

Confirmed: only possibilities are words like ""merry"", ""ferry""? 

So I choose ""merry""

<guess>merry</guess>### Thought Process

Based on the cumulative feedback:

1. **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (all marked with ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - These letters are **not** in the secret word.
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - **E** is fixed at position 2 (✓ from ""perks"" and ""derby"").
   - **R** is fixed at position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").
   - **Y** is fixed at position 5 (✓ from ""derby"").
3. **Secret Word Pattern**: The word follows the structure **\_ E R \_ Y**, where:
   - Position 1 must be an untested letter from the remaining available pool.
   - Position 4 must be an untested letter from the remaining available pool.
4. **Available Letters**: Only untested letters remain: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since Y is confirmed at position 5).
5. **Constraints**:
   - Position 4 cannot reuse R (due to earlier feedback), though duplicates are possible but unconfirmed. Common words fitting the pattern with Y at position 5 (e.g., ""merry"", ""ferry"") suggest position 4 may use R, but alternatives are limited.

### Analysis
- The word must match **\_ E R \_ Y**.
- Common English words with position 2 as ""E"", position 3 as ""R"", and position 5 as ""Y"" include **""merry""** and **""ferry""**, both using R at position 4.
  - ""merry"": M at position 1, R at position 4 (M is untested and available).
  - ""ferry"": F at position 1, R at position 4 (F is untested and available).
- Duplicate R is plausible (not ruled out by feedback), and ""merry"" introduces **M**, a common untested letter. If correct, it confirms the full word; if incorrect, it reveals position 4 isn't R (and we retain U, V, etc. for position 1/4).

### Guess Selection
- **""merry""** is chosen:
  - Tests **M** (position 1) and reuses **R** for position 4 (which may be correct based on pattern).
  - If ""merry"" fails, it eliminates M and positions R at position 4, prioritizing information gain for the final guess.

Places R and E in positions different from the first guess (i.e., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).\n\n Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think about the positions:\n - The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _\n\n We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5. So E could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We also know that the word does not contain C, A, N.\n\n For the next guess, we can try to place R and E in new positions and introduce three new letters.\n\n Let\'s consider common letters that we haven\'t tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to choose a word that has R and E and three new letters, and that is a valid English word.\n\n Some candidate words:\n\n Option 1: Place R at the beginning and E in the middle? For example: R _ _ E _\n But we don\'t know the other letters.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Example words:\n - ""roger"": has R, O, G, E, R -> but we have two R\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but we can try.\n   However, we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one R (as a minus). If there were two R\'s, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: the secret word might have only one R.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new consonants or vowels.\n\n Another idea: ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R. \n   This has T, I, G, E, R. \n   But note: the word ""tiger"" has R at the end (position 5) and E at position 4? \n   Positions: \n      T (1), I (2), G (3), E (4), R (5)\n\n However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was a minus. Now we are putting E at position 4 and R at position 5. This is acceptable because the feedback said E is not at position 5 (so position 4 is allowed) and R is not at position 2 (so position 5 is allowed).\n\n But wait: the feedback for R in the first guess was at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 5. That\'s a different position, so it\'s okay.\n\n However, we must also consider that the secret word might have more than one R? But we don\'t have evidence for that. We\'ll assume one R for now.\n\n Let\'s check if ""tiger"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n But note: we are introducing T, I, G. We don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R in positions we haven\'t tried and also covers common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""water"" -> W, A, T, E, R. But wait, we know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was x). So we cannot use A.\n\n Another: ""swept"" -> but that doesn\'t have R and E? We need to include R and E.\n\n How about ""robed""? But we know we cannot use A? Actually, we don\'t have A in ""robed"", but we have B, D. However, we also have O and E. But note: we don\'t have R in the second position? \n ""robed"": R at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n But we know that R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put R at position 1 because the feedback only said R is not at position 2. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed).\n\n However, we are avoiding A, C, N. ""robed"" doesn\'t have those.\n\n But we are introducing O, B, D.\n\n Alternatively, ""tiger"" seems good.\n\n Let me compare with ""risen"": R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5. But wait, we know N is not in the word (from first feedback: N was x). So we cannot use N.\n\n Another: ""rides"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This avoids A, C, N. And positions: R is at 1 (not 2) and E at 4 (not 5). So that\'s valid.\n\n But we have two options: ""tiger"" and ""rides"". Which one is better?\n\n We want to cover more common letters. Also, note that in ""tiger"", we have T, I, G, E, R. In ""rides"", we have R, I, D, E, S.\n\n The letter S is very common, so maybe ""rides"" is good? But we also have D and S.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> but then R is at position 3? That\'s allowed. And E at 4? Allowed. And S at 5? We don\'t know about S.\n\n However, we are trying to maximize new information. We have 6 tries, so we can try one.\n\n Let me choose ""tiger"" because it has G which is less common? Actually, we want to test more common letters.\n\n Another idea: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E. \n   Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). \n   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? \n   Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we know it will be wrong again? \n   So it\'s a waste of a position? We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, in ""store"", E is at position 5 -> that\'s the same as the first guess and we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""stare""? But we know A is not in the word. So no.\n\n How about ""strep""? But that\'s 5 letters? S, T, R, E, P. \n   Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), E(4), P(5). \n   This avoids E at 5 and R at 2. Also, no A, C, N.\n\n But we don\'t know if P is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""tiger"" is a valid word and places E at 4 and R at 5, which are new positions.\n\n Let me go with ""tiger"".\n\n But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 2. We don\'t know about I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and R and also uses the fact that we know the first letter is not C (and not A, etc.). We don\'t know the first letter.\n\n After thinking, I choose ""tiger"".\n\n So the next guess is ""tiger"".\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, A, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).\n- Avoid **C, A, N** (excluded letters).\n- Place **R** anywhere except position 2, and **E** anywhere except position 5.\n- Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., **T, I, G**).\n\nThe word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:\n- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E** (position 4, not 5), **R** (position 5, not 2).\n- Tests three new letters while strategically repositioning R and E.\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1.

""tiger"": T(x), I(x), G(x), E(-), R(-)\n   - T, I, G are not in the word (new exclusions).\n   - E and R are in the word, but not in the positions guessed. In ""tiger"", E was in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is not at position 4, and R is not at position 5.\n\nCombining the feedback:\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G\n- Confirmed letters in the word: R and E (but we don\'t know their positions).\n\nWe also know from both guesses the positions that R and E cannot be in:\n- R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 5 (from ""tiger"").\n- E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at position 4 (from ""tiger"").\n\nSo possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since not 2 or 5)\nPossible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)\n\nWe have two letters confirmed: R and E. We must include these in the next guess, placed in positions that haven\'t been tried and are still possible.\n\nWe also need to choose three additional letters that are not in the excluded list and not R or E.\n\nExcluded so far: C, A, N, T, I, G. So available letters are:\nB, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe want to choose a word that uses two of the available letters and includes R and E.\n\nMoreover, we have two positions to avoid for R (2 and 5) and two for E (4 and 5). \n\nLet\'s try to form a word:\n\nConsider placing R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then we have: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded. For example, we could have R, then a new letter at position 2, then E, then two other new letters.\n\nCandidate: ""robed""? But we know O? O is not excluded? Yes, available. But wait: we don\'t have O? Actually, O is available. However, we have B, D. But let\'s see:\n\n""robed"": R, O, B, E, D\n- Position of R: 1 (not 2 or 5 -> allowed)\n- Position of E: 4 (but we know E cannot be at position 4 from ""tiger"" feedback). So that is not allowed.\n\nSo E cannot be at 4. Therefore, if we put R at 1, then E must be at position 2 or 3? Or position 1? But we cannot have two letters at the same position at once.\n\nWait: the word has five positions. We can only put E at positions 1, 2, or 3? \nBut R is at position 1. So E cannot be at position 1. Thus only positions 2 or 3.\n\nOption: R at 1, E at 2: then word is R E _ _ _\nBut RE at the beginning? What words? Example: ""reeds"" -> but E is repeated? And we have S? But also D? However, ""reeds"" is not 5 unique letters? Also, we are not sure about duplicates.\n\nActually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but so far we have seen no duplicates in feedback? The feedback for ""crane"" had one R and one E, and for ""tiger"" one E and one R. So unless there are duplicates, we should avoid repeating letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we will try to avoid duplicates unless necessary.\n\nAlternative: place R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need three new letters for positions 2, 4, 5. And avoid excluded letters.\n\nPossibilities: R O E? Then we need two more letters. How about ""rover"": R, O, V, E, R? That has two R\'s? We are repeating R. But we know R is in the word? It could be twice? But we have no evidence. Alternatively, we avoid repeating R.\n\nBetter: ""roses"" -> but we know S? But S is available, but then we have two S\'s? ""roses"": R, O, S, E, S. Two S\'s. Also, E is at position 4? We cannot do that.\n\nWe need E at position 3: R _ E _ _\n\nSo position 4 and 5 must be filled. How about ""rowed"": R, O, W, E, D? Then E is at position 4 -> not allowed because from ""tiger"" we know E cannot be at 4.\n\nSame issue: we cannot have E at 4.\n\nSo we cannot put E at position 4? Then in the word R _ E _ _, E is at position 3 -> that is allowed? Because we haven\'t tried position 3 for E. The only restrictions on E are positions 4 and 5. So position 3 is allowed.\n\nMoreover, we can have E at position 2? We do not have a restriction for position 2? But in ""crane"", position 2 was R? And in ""tiger"", position 4 was E? But not tested. So position 2 is not forbidden for E.\n\nSo let\'s recap:\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Contains R and E (exactly once? or at least once? we don\'t know duplicates)\n- Does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, G\n- R cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (so only 1, 3, 4)\n- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (so only 1, 2, 3)\n\nStructure: five distinct letters? Probably, but duplicates possible? We\'ll avoid unless necessary.\n\nHow about placing E at position 2 and R at position 3? Then: _ E R _ _\n\nExample words: ""beryl"", ""ferry"" (but has two R\'s? not good), ""perky""\n\nAnother: position 1: available, E at 2, R at 3.\n\nWe need letters for positions 1, 4, 5.\n\nCandidate: ""peril"" -> unfortunately, we have I? I is excluded (from ""tiger"": I was x). So cannot use I.\n\nAnother: ""merry"" -> again, two R\'s? and we have E at 2? M, E, R, R, Y -> duplicate R? Also, we have included R? We know R is in the word? But we don\'t know about duplicates? And also Y is available? But duplicate R might be bad because we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates to get clean information.\n\nAnother word: ""sower"" -> S, O, W, E, R. \n   Positions: \n      1: S\n      2: O\n      3: W\n      4: E -> but E cannot be at position 4? We have a restriction that E cannot be at 4? Exactly, from ""tiger"" feedback: position 4 was E and we got minus? So we cannot put E at 4? So ""sower"" has E at 4? Not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, we avoid position 4 for E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""hover"" -> H, O, V, E, R? Then E at position 4? Again not allowed.\n\nHow about ""fever""? F, E, V, E, R -> but duplicate E? And E at position 2? Then R at position 5? But R cannot be at position 5? From ""tiger"", R was at position 5 and we got minus? So R cannot be at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""fever"" is invalid because R at 5 and E at 4? Actually, positions: \n  1: F\n  2: E -> allowed? We can? Because E restriction is only not 4 or 5? Position 2 is allowed.\n  3: V\n  4: E -> duplicate E? but we don\'t know? Also, position 4 for E is disallowed? So we cannot put E at position 4. So ""fever"" is invalid because of E at 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word where E is at 1, 2, or 3 and R is at 1, 3, or 4? And not overlapping? And avoid duplicates? Let\'s try one:\n\nOption: place R at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: R E _ _ _ \nWords: ""rebus"" (B is available), ""rebut"", ""realm"" (A excluded), ""recur"" (C excluded), ""rebel"" (E duplicate? but at position 4? Also, R E B E L -> E at position 2 and 4? Position 4 E is not allowed? So we need to avoid E at 4.\n\nSo ""rebel"": E at position 4 -> disallowed? So we cannot.\n\n""reeds"": R E E ... -> duplicate E? And E at 4? Also disallowed.\n\n""ready"": R E A ... -> A is excluded? So no.\n\n""renew"": R E N ... -> N excluded.\n\nHow about ""repro""? R E P R O -> duplicate R? And R at position 4? R would be at positions 1 and 4? We are testing R at 1 and 4? But the feedback on R: we already know R is in the word? But we don\'t know positions? However, we are placing R at two positions? That might be confusing? Also, duplicate R? \n\nWe want to test new positions? Still, let\'s see if permitted? But we need to avoid E at 4? So in ""repro"", E is at position 2? Then positions: 1: R, 2: E, 3: P, 4: R, 5: O. So R at 1 and 4? \nR at position 4: we have no restriction for or against position 4? Because previous restrictions were for R: not 2 and not 5? So 4 is allowed? \nBut E at position 2: allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? 2 is allowed? \n\nBut ""repro"" is a valid word? Repro means reprint? I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut duplicate R? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one R marked? And ""tiger"" had one R marked? So the secret word might have only one R? If we guess double R, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback will mark one as minus? But we might get two minuses? But that\'s okay.\n\nWe can try, but to avoid complexity, let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\nAlternative: place R at position 4 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E R _ \n\nWe would have to fill the first two positions and the last one? \n\nExample: ""user"": that is 4 letters? Need 5 letters.\n\nHow about ""power""? P O W E R? But E is at position 4? disallowed? Same problem.\n\nWe can have E at position 3 and R at position 4: then _ _ E R _\n\nWords: ""chaver"" -> wait? 5 letters: ""liver"", but we have I? excluded? ""overt""? O V E R T -> T is excluded? ""facer""? F A C? excluded.\n\n""super""? S U P E R -> E at position 4? disallowed? Oh no.\n\nWait, in this structure: positions: 1: S, 2: U, 3: E, 4: R, 5: something? Then E is at position 3? Okay? And R at 4? Which is allowed? \n\nExample: ""surer""? S U R E R -> duplicate R? And E at position 4? Because ""surer"" is S, U, R, E, R? Then E is at position 4? disallowed? No: if you spell it: position 1: S, 2: U, 3: R, 4: E, 5: R -> E is at position 4? disallowed.\n\nHow about ""homer""? H, O, M, E, R -> E at position 4? disallowed? No.\n\nAnother: ""laser""? L A S? A excluded.\n\nLetter availability: available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that fits the form: if we do R at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: R _ E _ _\n\nWe need a letter for position 2: must not be excluded? Then positions 4 and 5.\n\nExample: role? too short? 5 letter word: ""robed""? E at 4 -> disallowed? \n\nBut we can\'t use E at 4? So we need position 4 and 5 to be non-E and non-R? So they are new letters.\n\nHow about ""rower"": R O W E R -> duplicate R? E at position 4? disallowed.\n\nWe must avoid position 4 for E? So the only safe possibilities for E are positions 1, 2, and 3? And for R: 1, 3, 4? And we cannot have R and E at the same position? So avoid position 1 for both and position 3 for both simultaneously? We can assign:\n- Case 1: R at 1, then E at 2 or 3?\n- Case 2: R at 3, then E at 2? Or E at 1? Or E at 3? But if E at 3, same as R? Conflict? So must different position? \n- Case 3: R at 4, then E at 1, 2, or 3? \n\nAnd we can make a word.\n\nSo let\'s try R at 4 and E at 2: then _ E _ R _\n\nExample: ""heart""? H E A? A excluded. \n""bless""? B L E S S? But positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: E? But we need E at position 2? \nWe need E at position 2? So structure: first letter arbitrary, second letter E, then any letter (but not R? because R is at position 4), then R, then last letter? \n\nPositions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?\n\nWe need to fill 1 and 3 and 5 with available letters? Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z\n\nExample: ""bench""? But C excluded? And N excluded? \n""hello""? H E L L O -> duplicate L? Not excluded? But we have E at 2? R at 4? Not present? We need R at 4? So we must have R at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t many words? How about ""debar""? We have D E B A R? A excluded.\n\nHow about ""flicker""? Too long.\n\n""seams""? S E A? A excluded.\n\n""pears""? P E A? A excluded.\n\n""diner""? D I N? I and N excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging to find a word with E at position 2 and R at position 4? Let me think of: ""seeds"" -> S E E... duplicate? E at 4? disallowed.\n\n"" rector? "" R at position 1? E at position 2? But R at 1 and E at 2 is not the case we are trying? We have two options in this case: R at positions other than 2 and 5, E at positions other than 4 and 5.\n\nMaybe place R at position 3 and E at position 2? Then: _ E R _ _\n\nExample word: ""ber with 5 letters?"" like ""berg"", no? 5 letter word: ""berry""? B E R R Y -> duplicate R? Also, E at 2, R at 3? That\'s allowed? Because R cannot be at 2 or 5? Position 3 is allowed? And E at 2 allowed? But we have duplicate R? Or ""hertz"": H E R T Z -> but T is excluded? So no.\n\nHow about ""merle""? M E R L E -> duplicate E? And positions: 1: M, 2: E, 3: R, 4: L, 5: E? Then E at position 5? disallowed? So not.\n\nBut we can use ""perks""? P E R K S -> positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \n- E at 2: allowed.\n- R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 5).\n\nAnd the letters: P, E, R, K, S. \n- P: not excluded\n- K: available\n- S: available\n\nAlso, no duplicate letters? Distinct: P, E, R, K, S.\n\nAnd the word ""perks"" is valid? It means something like advantages.\n\nYes, ""perks"" is a valid word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""perks"". It places E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed). Also, introduces three new letters: P, K, S.\n\n<guess>perks</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- **Excluded letters:** C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).\n- **Confirmed letters:** R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Position constraints for R:** Not at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 5 (from ""tiger""), so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Position constraints for E:** Not at position 4 (from ""tiger"") or position 5 (from ""crane""), so possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe next guess must include R and E while avoiding excluded letters, and test new common letters. The word **""perks""** fits:\n- **P, K, S** are new letters (not excluded).\n- Positions: E at position 2 (allowed) and R at position 3 (allowed).\n- Structure ensures all position constraints are respected and avoids duplicates.\n\nThis maximizes information by introducing three new letters (P, K, S) and strategically repositioning R and E.\n\n<guess>perks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback history:\n1.

For ""perks"": P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\n   - E and R are now correctly placed! Specifically, E is in position 2 and R is in position 3?

Available. But it ends with Y? However note: we have double R? But position 3 is R, so if we have another R? The word would have R at position 3 and another R? Also, E at position 2? So B E R R Y? Positions:\n  1: B, 2:E (ok), 3:R (ok), 4:R, 5:Y.\n  However, we got feedback for ""perks"" that S, K, P are not in the word? And we haven\'t used Y? But B is available? But wait: does ""berry"" have only one R? We are placing R at position 3 and 4? The secret word might have two R\'s? But we don\'t know? So it\'s possible? However, we have no constraints against it.\n  But note: the excluded list does not include B or Y? So it\'s possible? But then letter at position 4 is R? Which could be? From previous feedback? In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and got minus? But now positions are different? So it might be okay?\n  Also, position 5: Y? Not excluded? \n  However, we must use distinct letters or include existing ones? Since E and R are already in, they can be reused? But the feedback for ""perks"" only showed E and R correctly placed? If there were other E or R, we wouldn\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s consider: the feedback doesn\'t reveal duplicates? That is true? We only get symbols per guess? We don\'t know? So it could be possible? However, to be safe, we should test a word without reusing E and R unnecessarily? And include new letters to gain information.\n\nBut we only have two positions to fill? Position 1 and positions 4 and 5? And we have three unknowns? But the secret word has five positions? We know two are E and R? The remaining are unknown.\n\nWe know the available letters? Since the word is _ E R _ _, it must be composed of:\n\nFirst letter: from available set\nFourth letter: from available set\nFifth letter: from available set\n\nAnd the letters must not include any excluded letter.\n\nWe want to maximize the new letters? Also, try to cover common letters.\n\nCommon letters to test: Let\'s try to find words with M, L, D, H, O, etc.\n\nSome candidate words:\n- ""merry"": M E R R Y -> but duplicate R? And position 4 is R? Then pattern: M E R? That fixes the first three? Then fourth is R? Fifth is Y.\n  But then the word has R at position 3 and 4? \n\nAlternative: ""berry"" as above? \nBut let me check if there are other candidates.\n\nAnother: ""heron"": H E R O N -> but N is excluded?

But herby is an adjective, meaning full of herbs.\n\nBut let\'s also consider ""derry""? but duplicate R? D E R R Y? Position 4:R? So we fill positions: D(1), E(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5)? Then we have two R\'s? But we are using R at 3 and 4? Secret word might have two R\'s? \n\nBut ""derry"" is a word? A place? \n\nHowever, we want to maximize new letters? In ""derby"", we have D, B, Y which have not been tested? Similarly in ""herby"", we have H, B, Y? Both introduce new letters? \n\nI think ""derby"" is a valid option? Also, it has distinct letters except that E and R are not duplicated? \n\nWe\'ll choose ""derby"" as the guess? Because it covers common letters D, B, Y? \n\nBut note: we have the pattern locked?

Wait, Y is at position 5? The feedback says Y(✓) so yes?

No, we already know position 5 is Y).\n\nWe need to find a word that fits the pattern _ E R _ Y\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B\n\nTherefore, only possibilities for position 1 and 4?\n\nWe also need to satisfy the known constraints: E at 2, R at 3, Y at 5? And the word must be formed from the available letters? \n\nMoreover, there might be duplicates? But we haven\'t seen any? So we assume distinct for now? But we don\'t know? However, we have five distinct positions? \n\nPossible words:\n- ferry: F E R R Y -> but R is already at position 3? So position 4 would be another R? Duplicate? But also, ferry has two R\'s? But we don\'t know? Also, F is available? But let\'s see: positions: \n  1: F -> available? Yes\n  2: E -> fixed\n  3: R -> fixed\n  4: R -> if we put R? Then we have two R\'s? \n  5: Y -> fixed\n\nBut is that a word? ""ferry"" is valid? \nBut we already know R is at position 3? If the secret word has two R\'s, then in ""derby"", we had R at position 3 and Y at 5? But position 4 was B? And we got B(x)? So the secret word has R at position 3 and if it has another R, it didn\'t show? Because in ""perks"", position 3 was R? and in ""tiger"" position 5 R? But if ""ferry"" has R at 1? That\'s position 4? But that\'s not position 1? Wait ""ferry"": \n  Position 1: F\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 3: R\n  Position 4: R? Yes\n\nSo position 4 is R? So the word is F E R R Y? Then we have two R\'s? But we don\'t know? The feedback ""perks"" said R was in position 3? And that was confirmed? But does not rule out another R? Similarly, the feedback for ""crane"" had R minus? Which could mean one or more R\'s? But only revealed one? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without repeating R? \n\nFor example: \n- ""every"": E V E R Y? But then position 1 would be E? But pattern says position 1 is unknown? \n""every"": E V E R Y -> positions: \n  1: E? But we have E at position 2? So two E\'s? \n  Also, E at position 1? But then we have E at position 1 and 2? \n  However, in ""every"", the pattern: \n      pos1: E, pos2: V? that doesn\'t match E at pos2! \n\nBecause we need the pattern _ E R _ Y? So position 2 is E? So any word that doesn\'t have E at position 2 doesn\'t fit? \n\nWe must have position 2 fixed as E? And position 3 fixed as R? \n\nSo we need words that start with any letter, then E, then R, then any letter, then Y? \n\nExample: ""furry"": F U R R Y? But position 3 is R? So we have F U R R Y? No: \n  ""furry"": F at 1, U at 2, R at 3, R at 4, Y at 5? \nBut we require position 2 to be E? So ""furry"" doesn\'t have E at position 2? So it doesn\'t fit? \n\nWe need the word to have E at position 2? So examples:\n- ""merry"" -> M E R R Y? Pattern: M, E, R, R, Y? \nBut we know M is available? \nAnd R at position 4? \nSo it fits pattern? \nBut also, ""herry"" is not a word? \n""berry"" -> B? B is excluded? From ""derby"" we have B(x)? \n\nAnother: ""jerry"": J E R R Y? Or ""jerky"": J E R K Y? But K is excluded? \n\n""leery"": L E E R Y? Then pattern: L(1), E(2), E at 3? But position 3 must be R? So no? \nWe need position 3 to be R? \n\nHow about ""every""? Doesn\'t fit? \nAlso, ""query"": Q U E R Y? That doesn\'t have E at position 2? It has Q(1), U(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? \nBut we require position 3 to be R? So E at position 3? So that pattern doesn\'t match our requirement. \n\nAnother try? Words ending in ...ERY? Or more precisely, the pattern includes E at position 2 and R at position 3? \n\nSo we need words of the form: ? E R ? Y\n\nWith the available letters for positions 1 and 4? And no excluded letters.\n\nLet me see possible words:\n- merry: M E R R Y? But M available? R at position 4? \n  But M not excluded? R? We are reusing R? But not excluded? \n- ferry: F E R R Y? Same? \n- herry: is that a word? Not common? \n- berry: but B excluded? \n- terry: T excluded? \n- perry: P excluded? \n\nWithout repeating R? \n- ""leery"": L E E R Y? But then position 3 is E? We need R at position 3? \n- ""query"": Q U E R Y? But E is at position 3? \n\nWe need R explicitly at position 3? So no? \n\nPossibly: ""fever""? But we have E at position 4? And also we need Y? \n\nThe only options? We have limited words? \n\nAnother: ""merle"" doesn\'t end with Y? \n\nHow about ""every""? Doesn\'t fit? \n\nConsider? ""fury"" is 4 letters? \n\nAlternatively, ""emery"": E M E R Y? But then pattern: E(1), M(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5)? \nBut we need position 2 to be E? And position 3 to be R? \n\nNot matching: \n  We require: pos1:?, pos2:E, pos3:R, pos4:?, pos5:Y\n\nIn ""emery"": \n  pos1: E, pos2: M, pos3: E, pos4: R, pos5: Y? So doesn\'t have E at position 2? \n\nAnother possibility? ""deray""? But we excluded D and A? \n\nWait, we must find a word that has E at position 2, R at position 3, Y at position 5, and positions 1 and 4 filled with available letters? \n\nAvailable letters: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nExamples:\n- F E R ? Y? For position 4, it could be L? So ""ferly""? Is that a word? Meaning rare? Not common? \n- H E R ? Y? ""Herby""? But we excluded B? \n- ""Hermy""? Not a word? \n- L E R? ""lerry""? No? \n- M E R ? Y: ""mercy""? But C excluded? ""merry"" is a common word? And M available? \n- O E R ? Y: ""oery""? Not a word? \n- Q E R ? Y: ""query"" doesn\'t fit pattern? \n- U E R ? Y: ""uerry""? Not a word? \n- V E R ? Y: ""verry""? Not common? \n\nTherefore, the only common words seem to be ""merry"" and ""ferry""? \n\nWe\'ll choose ""merry""? Since M is a common letter? \n\nBut let me see: ""jelly"" doesn\'t work? \n\nOr ""worry""? W O R R Y? But we need E at position 2? Not available? \n\nSo only ""merry"" and ""ferry"" are likely? \n\nWe have M and F available? \n\nWe\'ll guess ""merry""? \n\nBut note: in the feedback from ""perks"", we saw S and K excluded? And in ""derby"", D and B excluded? \n\nAlso, we already used R? But we are reusing it? \n\nSince we have two options? And we are at guess 5 (we started at 1: crane, 2: tiger, 3: perks, 4: derby? So next is 5: this one)? We have tries? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t repeat R? But we haven\'t found any? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""merry""? \n\nBut wait, what about ""every""? We discussed? Doesn\'t fit? \n\nPerhaps we have the wrong pattern? \n\nBut what about ""fairy""? But A excluded? And I excluded? \n\nConfirmed: only possibilities are words like ""merry"", ""ferry""? \n\nSo I choose ""merry""\n\n<guess>merry</guess>### Thought Process\n\nBased on the cumulative feedback:\n\n1. **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B (all marked with ""x"" in previous guesses).\n   - These letters are **not** in the secret word.\n2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:\n   - **E** is fixed at position 2 (✓ from ""perks"" and ""derby"").\n   - **R** is fixed at position 3 (✓ from ""perks"").\n   - **Y** is fixed at position 5 (✓ from ""derby"").\n3. **Secret Word Pattern**: The word follows the structure **\\_ E R \\_ Y**, where:\n   - Position 1 must be an untested letter from the remaining available pool.\n   - Position 4 must be an untested letter from the remaining available pool.\n4. **Available Letters**: Only untested letters remain: F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since Y is confirmed at position 5).\n5. **Constraints**:\n   - Position 4 cannot reuse R (due to earlier feedback), though duplicates are possible but unconfirmed. Common words fitting the pattern with Y at position 5 (e.g., ""merry"", ""ferry"") suggest position 4 may use R, but alternatives are limited.\n\n### Analysis\n- The word must match **\\_ E R \\_ Y**.\n- Common English words with position 2 as ""E"", position 3 as ""R"", and position 5 as ""Y"" include **""merry""** and **""ferry""**, both using R at position 4.\n  - ""merry"": M at position 1, R at position 4 (M is untested and available).\n  - ""ferry"": F at position 1, R at position 4 (F is untested and available).\n- Duplicate R is plausible (not ruled out by feedback), and ""merry"" introduces **M**, a common untested letter. If correct, it confirms the full word; if incorrect, it reveals position 4 isn\'t R (and we retain U, V, etc. for position 1/4).\n\n### Guess Selection\n- **""merry""** is chosen:\n  - Tests **M** (position 1) and reuses **R** for position 4 (which may be correct based on pattern).\n  - If ""merry"" fails, it eliminates M and positions R at position 4, prioritizing information gain for the final guess.\n\n<guess>merry</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 3: perks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\nGuess 4: derby -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: merry -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback for Guess 5: merry -> M(x) E(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- M (position 1) is not in the word (x)
- E (position 2) is correct (✓)
- R (position 3) is correct (✓)
- The second R (position 4) is correct (✓) -> so position 4 is R
- Y (position 5) is correct (✓)

So the word is: _ E R R Y? But wait, position 4 is R? So the secret word must have E at position 2, R at position 3 and 4? And Y at position 5? 
But position 1 is unknown? But the secret word is M E R R Y? But M is excluded? So the word cannot be ""merry""? So what is it? 

The feedback shows:
- M got x, so M is not in the word? 
- The first R (position 3) is ✓? The second R (position 4) is ✓? And Y is ✓? 

Therefore, the secret word has E at position 2, R at position 3 and 4, and Y at position 5? So the word must be of the form: ? E R R Y? 

But we know the available letters? Also, we just excluded M? 

Possible positions: the first letter? 

We have feedback: 
- M(x): so the first letter is not M? And M is excluded? 
- Position 4: R is present? So we have double R? 

So the secret word is: [first letter] E R R Y

We know the first letter cannot be any of the excluded? 

Excluded letters (from previous): C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B, M (new)

Available letters: F, H, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Now, we need a word that starts with one of these, then E, then R, then R, then Y? 

What words end in ERRY? And are 5 letters? 

Common words: 
- berry (B excluded? and B was excluded earlier)
- ferry (F available? and no A? So ""ferry"" is F E R R Y? 
- herry? not common? 
- jerry? J E R R Y? 
- terry? T is excluded? 
- perry? P excluded? 

So the remaining: ""ferry"", ""jerry""

Also, ""query"" doesn't fit because it would be Q U E R Y? Not our pattern? 

So only ""ferry"" and ""jerry""? 

We have F and J available? 

We'll choose ""ferry"" because F is more common? 

But we are at guess 6? Last try? 

If we guess ""ferry"": F at position 1, E at 2, R at 3 and 4, Y at 5? 

If the secret word is ""ferry"", it matches the pattern? 

Alternatively, ""jerry""? Also matches? 

But let's see? How about ""worry""? W O R R Y? But then position 2 is O? Not E? So no? We need position 2 to be E? 

Therefore, ""ferry"" or ""jerry""? 

We'll guess ""ferry""

### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback from all guesses:
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, P, K, S, D, B, M (all marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed Positions**:
  - Position 2: E (✓ from Guess 3, 4, 5).
  - Position 3: R (✓ from Guess 3, 4, 5).
  - Position 4: R (✓ from Guess 5).
  - Position 5: Y (✓ from Guess 4 and 5).
- **Secret Word Pattern**: With positions 2–5 confirmed as ""E R R Y"", the full word is **\_ E R R Y**.
  - Only position 1 is unknown.
- **Available Letters for Position 1**: Untested letters from the alphabet pool: F, H, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Analysis
- The word must end with ""ERRY"" (positions 2–5 fixed).
- Common English words matching this pattern:
  - ""**ferry**"" (F is available and untested).
  - ""**jerry**"" (J is available and untested).
- ""ferry"" is prioritized as:
  - F is a high-frequency consonant.
  - If incorrect, it confirms position 1 isn’t F, leaving ""jerry"" as the only remaining common option.

### Guess Selection
- **""ferry""** is selected to test position 1 with F.
