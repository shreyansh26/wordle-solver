We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we might choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, R, N, L, etc.

One of the common starting words is ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of many letters.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular.

But note: We are allowed to use any English word. Let's go with ""CRANE"" today because it has C, R, A, N, E which are also common.

However, let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has more vowels.
</think>
I'll start with a common strategy: choose a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize the information gained from the first guess. For this, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). This combination often helps identify several letters or their positions early on. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will reveal valuable clues for the next guess.

We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R(x) : R is not in the secret word.
- A(x) : A is not in the secret word.
- I(x) : I is not in the secret word.
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since we guessed S in the 4th and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have S somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Now, for our next guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it exists) but in a different position than 4.
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E because they are not in the word.
- We want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters to try: consonants like T, N, O, L, and vowels like O, U (since A,E,I are out).

We also have to avoid R, A, I, E.

Possible words that include S:

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, let's consider putting S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

But note: we don't know which position S is in, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tried yet.

We tried ""RAISE"" which had S in position 4.

Let's try a word with S in position 1.

Also, we shouldn't use R,A,I,E.

A candidate: ""STOMP"" - but wait, we need common letters.

""S"" at the start: possible words: SHOWY, SNOWY, but let's avoid Y if possible? But we don't know.

A better word might be ""SONGS"" but that has two S's? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since we only know one S is present, we should not assume duplicates. But ""SONGS"" would test S in position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is wrong for S, but if we put S in position 4 again, it will still be wrong? We already know S is not in position 4, so repeating it might not be efficient.

Actually, the feedback said S is in wrong position, so if we put S in position 4 again, it would still be wrong position if the correct position isn't 4. But to avoid wasting a slot, we can put S in a different position.

So for next guess, we should avoid position 4 for S and put it in one of 1,2,3,5.

Also, we need a word that contains S and other letters we haven't tried yet.

List of available letters: We can use B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding R,A,I,E).

Common among these: T, N, L, O, etc.

Let me think of words:

- S in position 1: SLATE? But A and E are out. SLATE has A and E which we know are not present. So avoid.

So we need to avoid A,E,I,R.

S in position 1: SOULS? No, duplicate S and U,L,S.

Better: ""STUNK"" - S at 1, T,U,N,K. But U and N are new. K is new.

But let's see: STUNK: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),K(5).

We know position 4 had S in first guess, but now we are putting N in position 4? We haven't tested N before.

Another idea: ""SONLY"" but Y might be less common.

Another: ""STOCK"" - S(1),T(2),O(3),C(4),K(5). This avoids A,E,I,R. Let's use that.

But O is a vowel, good to test.

But we also have feedback about S being in the word. In ""STOCK"", S is at position 1.

If we put S at position 1 and it is correct, we get ✓ for S. If not, we might get - or x, but we know S is somewhere else.

But we need to maximize information.

Another possibility: since S must be somewhere from 1,2,3,5, we can try S at position 1 and 5 simultaneously? But we have to guess one word.

What about words with S at the end? Like in position 5.

For example: ""PLOTS"" - P,L,O,T,S. S at position 5.

This tests P,L,O,T, and S at 5.

But P and L are new, O and T are common.

Similarly, ""CULTS"" - but C,U,L,T,S.

Since our first word had S at 4, and now we move it to another position to see.

But to be systematic.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains S and four other new letters.

For example: ""SCOLD"" - S(1),C(2),O(3),L(4),D(5). Avoid A,E,I,R. But L is at position 4. However, we know position 4 in the secret word is not S (from first guess) so it could be something else.

But in ""RAISE"", position 4 was S and we got wrong position, so the correct letter at position 4 is something else.

In ""SCOLD"", we put L at position 4, which might be correct or not.

But let's see which letters are covered.

Since we only have one known letter S, and it must be in position 1,2,3, or 5, I think putting S at position 1 is a good idea.

Let me go with ""STOCK"": it has S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, C at 4, K at 5.

All letters are new except S.

We avoid R,A,I,E.

If the word is ""STOCK"", it would be perfect, but we don't know.

But likely not, but we get information.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" - S(1),H(2),O(3),W(4),N(5). H and W are less common? But let's try.

I think ""STOCK"" is fine.

But let's consider that in the first guess, S was not in position 4, so if the correct position is 1, then in ""STOCK"" we get S(1) ✓. If it's position 2, we might get S(-) only if S is at position 2 but we have it at 1? We'll get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if S is at position 2, putting it at position 1 will show as wrong position.

So I'll go with ""STOCK"".

But let me write it down.

Guess: STOCK

But wait, let's ensure it's valid: STOCK is a word.

Yes.

Another option: ""SLICK"" - but L and I, but I is out. Cannot, because I is not allowed.

I not in word? Yes, we know I is not in the word.

So SLICK has I, which we know is absent? So invalid to include I? Because we know I is not in the word, so we must not use letters we know are absent? Actually, that's correct strategy. We avoid letters known absent.

Similarly, avoiding R,A,I,E.

So STOCK: S,T,O,C,K all not in R,A,I,E and are possible.

Similarly, SHOWN: S,H,O,W,N - all possible.

But I think STOCK is fine.

But let me consider: in STOCK, position 4 is C. But we already know position 4 isn't S. But we can test C there.

Since S is the only known letter, we might want to test its position.

Another word: ""SULLY"" but U,Y and L? Has L, but also duplicate L? S has to be included.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but no S. We must include S because it's the only known letter, and we want to find its position.

So we need a word that includes S.

So STOCK: S at 1, includes O, T, C, K.

Similarly, ""SKIMP"" - S at 1, K,I? I is out, cannot use.

""SCALP"" has A, which is out.

""SONIC"" has O,N,I,C? But I is out.

Avoid I.

SONIC has I? S-O-N-I-C. Yes, I is position 4? S-O-N-I-C? S(1),O(2),N(3),I(4),C(5). But I is forbidden, so we cannot use SONIC because I is not in the secret word.

Must avoid excluded letters.

So STOCK is good: S-T-O-C-K. No excluded letters.

Another: ""SMOCK"" - similar.

But I'll go with STOCK.

S at position 1.

But we don't know if position 1 is S or not.

Perhaps put S at a different position to sample.

For example, to test position 1 separately, I could put another letter at position 1 and S elsewhere.

But since we don't know, either way.

Perhaps to maximize position coverage.

In first guess, positions 1-2-3-4-5 had R-A-I-S-E all excluded except S which is wrong in 4.

So we have no info on positions 1,2,3,5 except that they are not S? No, position 4 was S and wrong, but positions 1,2,3,5 could have S if not 4.

But S is somewhere else.

Now, putting S at position 1: if S is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get - if it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S at 5, same thing.

But besides S, we test T,O,C,K, which are common.

I think ""STOCK"" is a reasonable guess.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"", we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
- The letters R, A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

This means:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, or E in our next guess.
- S must be included in the guess but in a position other than 4th (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- We should test new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess, ""STOCK"" is chosen because:
- It includes S in the 1st position to test if S belongs there.
- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.

If S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.

- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.

If S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.",Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SOOTH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we might choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, R, N, L, etc.

One of the common starting words is ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of many letters.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular.

But note: We are allowed to use any English word. Let's go with ""CRANE"" today because it has C, R, A, N, E which are also common.

However, let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has more vowels.I'll start with a common strategy: choose a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize the information gained from the first guess. For this, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). This combination often helps identify several letters or their positions early on. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will reveal valuable clues for the next guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R(x) : R is not in the secret word.
- A(x) : A is not in the secret word.
- I(x) : I is not in the secret word.
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since we guessed S in the 4th and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have S somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Now, for our next guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it exists) but in a different position than 4.
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E because they are not in the word.
- We want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters to try: consonants like T, N, O, L, and vowels like O, U (since A,E,I are out).

We also have to avoid R, A, I, E.

Possible words that include S:

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, let's consider putting S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

But note: we don't know which position S is in, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tried yet.

We tried ""RAISE"" which had S in position 4.

Let's try a word with S in position 1.

Also, we shouldn't use R,A,I,E.

A candidate: ""STOMP"" - but wait, we need common letters.

""S"" at the start: possible words: SHOWY, SNOWY, but let's avoid Y if possible? But we don't know.

A better word might be ""SONGS"" but that has two S's? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since we only know one S is present, we should not assume duplicates. But ""SONGS"" would test S in position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is wrong for S, but if we put S in position 4 again, it will still be wrong? We already know S is not in position 4, so repeating it might not be efficient.

Actually, the feedback said S is in wrong position, so if we put S in position 4 again, it would still be wrong position if the correct position isn't 4. But to avoid wasting a slot, we can put S in a different position.

So for next guess, we should avoid position 4 for S and put it in one of 1,2,3,5.

Also, we need a word that contains S and other letters we haven't tried yet.

List of available letters: We can use B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding R,A,I,E).

Common among these: T, N, L, O, etc.

Let me think of words:

- S in position 1: SLATE? But A and E are out. SLATE has A and E which we know are not present. So avoid.

So we need to avoid A,E,I,R.

S in position 1: SOULS? No, duplicate S and U,L,S.

Better: ""STUNK"" - S at 1, T,U,N,K. But U and N are new. K is new.

But let's see: STUNK: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),K(5).

We know position 4 had S in first guess, but now we are putting N in position 4? We haven't tested N before.

Another idea: ""SONLY"" but Y might be less common.

Another: ""STOCK"" - S(1),T(2),O(3),C(4),K(5). This avoids A,E,I,R. Let's use that.

But O is a vowel, good to test.

But we also have feedback about S being in the word. In ""STOCK"", S is at position 1.

If we put S at position 1 and it is correct, we get ✓ for S. If not, we might get - or x, but we know S is somewhere else.

But we need to maximize information.

Another possibility: since S must be somewhere from 1,2,3,5, we can try S at position 1 and 5 simultaneously? But we have to guess one word.

What about words with S at the end? Like in position 5.

For example: ""PLOTS"" - P,L,O,T,S. S at position 5.

This tests P,L,O,T, and S at 5.

But P and L are new, O and T are common.

Similarly, ""CULTS"" - but C,U,L,T,S.

Since our first word had S at 4, and now we move it to another position to see.

But to be systematic.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains S and four other new letters.

For example: ""SCOLD"" - S(1),C(2),O(3),L(4),D(5). Avoid A,E,I,R. But L is at position 4. However, we know position 4 in the secret word is not S (from first guess) so it could be something else.

But in ""RAISE"", position 4 was S and we got wrong position, so the correct letter at position 4 is something else.

In ""SCOLD"", we put L at position 4, which might be correct or not.

But let's see which letters are covered.

Since we only have one known letter S, and it must be in position 1,2,3, or 5, I think putting S at position 1 is a good idea.

Let me go with ""STOCK"": it has S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, C at 4, K at 5.

All letters are new except S.

We avoid R,A,I,E.

If the word is ""STOCK"", it would be perfect, but we don't know.

But likely not, but we get information.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" - S(1),H(2),O(3),W(4),N(5). H and W are less common? But let's try.

I think ""STOCK"" is fine.

But let's consider that in the first guess, S was not in position 4, so if the correct position is 1, then in ""STOCK"" we get S(1) ✓. If it's position 2, we might get S(-) only if S is at position 2 but we have it at 1? We'll get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if S is at position 2, putting it at position 1 will show as wrong position.

So I'll go with ""STOCK"".

But let me write it down.

Guess: STOCK

But wait, let's ensure it's valid: STOCK is a word.

Yes.

Another option: ""SLICK"" - but L and I, but I is out. Cannot, because I is not allowed.

I not in word? Yes, we know I is not in the word.

So SLICK has I, which we know is absent? So invalid to include I? Because we know I is not in the word, so we must not use letters we know are absent? Actually, that's correct strategy. We avoid letters known absent.

Similarly, avoiding R,A,I,E.

So STOCK: S,T,O,C,K all not in R,A,I,E and are possible.

Similarly, SHOWN: S,H,O,W,N - all possible.

But I think STOCK is fine.

But let me consider: in STOCK, position 4 is C. But we already know position 4 isn't S. But we can test C there.

Since S is the only known letter, we might want to test its position.

Another word: ""SULLY"" but U,Y and L? Has L, but also duplicate L? S has to be included.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but no S. We must include S because it's the only known letter, and we want to find its position.

So we need a word that includes S.

So STOCK: S at 1, includes O, T, C, K.

Similarly, ""SKIMP"" - S at 1, K,I? I is out, cannot use.

""SCALP"" has A, which is out.

""SONIC"" has O,N,I,C? But I is out.

Avoid I.

SONIC has I? S-O-N-I-C. Yes, I is position 4? S-O-N-I-C? S(1),O(2),N(3),I(4),C(5). But I is forbidden, so we cannot use SONIC because I is not in the secret word.

Must avoid excluded letters.

So STOCK is good: S-T-O-C-K. No excluded letters.

Another: ""SMOCK"" - similar.

But I'll go with STOCK.

S at position 1.

But we don't know if position 1 is S or not.

Perhaps put S at a different position to sample.

For example, to test position 1 separately, I could put another letter at position 1 and S elsewhere.

But since we don't know, either way.

Perhaps to maximize position coverage.

In first guess, positions 1-2-3-4-5 had R-A-I-S-E all excluded except S which is wrong in 4.

So we have no info on positions 1,2,3,5 except that they are not S? No, position 4 was S and wrong, but positions 1,2,3,5 could have S if not 4.

But S is somewhere else.

Now, putting S at position 1: if S is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get - if it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S at 5, same thing.

But besides S, we test T,O,C,K, which are common.

I think ""STOCK"" is a reasonable guess.Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"", we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
- The letters R, A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

This means:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, or E in our next guess.
- S must be included in the guess but in a position other than 4th (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- We should test new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess, ""STOCK"" is chosen because:
- It includes S in the 1st position to test if S belongs there.
- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.

If S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.

We have feedback from two guesses.

First guess ""RAISE"" feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
- This told us that S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- Also, R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Second guess ""STOCK"" feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
- S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1. This overrides the earlier feedback about position; now we know S is at position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 3 and correct.
- T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(x) means C is not in the word.
- K(x) means K is not in the word.

So from the feedback so far:

- **Known correct positions:**
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 3: O

- **Present letters but wrong position:**
  - T is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2.

- **Absent letters:**
  - R, A, I, E, C, K are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we knew S was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 1, so no issue.

The word structure is: S _ O _ _

We know T is present but not at position 2. So T must be at position 4 or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include T in position 4 or 5 to discover where it is.
- Avoid letters R, A, I, E, C, K.
- We need to choose letters for position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5) that haven't been tested and aren't absent.

Known absent letters: S is present but already placed, actually S is fixed at position 1 so no issue. But we used S and O.

Letters we haven't tested: many consonants and vowels. But vowels: A, E, I are out, so remaining vowels are O (already placed at 3, but O might not be duplicate?), U, and possibly Y.

O is at position 3 and fixed, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere? Not necessarily.

Other vowels: U, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: we need letters not in the absent list.

Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T (used but present), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But T is present and must be included.

The word is S _ O _ _

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: unknown
3: O (fixed)
4: could be T or something else?
5: could be T or other?

T is in the word and not at 2, so it must be at 4 or 5.

We should test T in one of these positions and new letters elsewhere.

For position 2, we need a letter that hasn't been tested and not absent.

Also, we should avoid using multiple absent letters.

Let me think of possible words.

Word pattern: S ? O ? ? 

With T required in positions 4 or 5.

First, option: put T at position 4.

Then the word would be S ? O T ?

Position 2 is unknown, and position 5 needs a letter.

What letters can we use? B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to get information. For example, L, N, U, M.

So possible word: ""SOLT"" ... but needs 5 letters. S ? O T _

Say ""S O L T Y"" but position 2 is missing.

Word: Position 2 must be a letter.

For example: if T is at 4, then ""S"" + letter2 + ""O"" + ""T"" + letter5.

What word exists? Like ""SPOUT"" – S P O U T? But U is a vowel, available.

SPOUT: S(1), P(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But if we put T at position 4? No, we want T at position 4? T(-) was position 2 in guess 2, so T can be at 4.

But in ""SPOUT"", U is at 4 and T at 5? Oh, I mispositioned.

If T is at position 4, then word: S ? O T ?

For example: ""S L O T S"" but duplicate S? Not necessarily duplicated.

But better to have distinct letters to test more.

Is S duplicated? We don't know; probably not, but possible.

But safe to assume no dup unless indicated.

Similarly, O at position 3, might not duplicate.

So ""S?OT?"" words: ""SILOT"" not word. ""SPOT"": but 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Common words: How about ""SHOUT"": S H O U T? Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). T is at position 5, not 4.

But we are considering T at position 4 or 5 separately.

First, suppose we put T at position 4. What words? ""S"" + X + ""O"" + ""T"" + Y.

For example: ""SCOTE"" not word. ""STOIC"" has I and C? Out. ""STOMP"" has M, P? S(1) T(2) O(3) M(4) P(5)? But T is at position 2, but T(-) in guess 2 was at position 2, so T cannot be at pos 2? Correct, T cannot be at pos 2.

If we have T at position 4, word: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:O, 4:T, 5:?

So: S ? O T ?

Examples: ""S M O T H"" – SMOTH not a word; it's SMOTE? SMOTE has E? E absent. ""S L O T H"" – SLOTH is a word: S L O T H? But TH at end? S(1), L(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). Yes, SLOTH.

But H? We haven't tested H.

Similarly, ""S P O T S"" SPOTS has S duplicate? S at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicate exists.

But let's avoid for now.

Similarly, ""SHOTE"" has E absent.

""SWOPS"" has S twice.

Perhaps ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? But T is at position 5.

For T at position 4, ""S NOT ?"" hard.

""BESOT"" but has E absent.

Perhaps not many common words with S? O T pattern?

Another idea: put T at position 5 instead.

Then word: S ? O ? T

For example, ""S H O T T"" duplicate T? Not.

""SHOOT"" – S H O O T? Duplicate O? O is at position 3, and position 4 would be O again? Possible.

But let's see: SHOOT has O at position 3 and 4? But position 3 is O, but position 4 would be O duplicate.

We might test that.

But we want to test new letters.

Perhaps ""S O L U T"" not word.

""SPLOT"" not word.

Common words: ""SCOUT"" – S C O U T? But C is absent? C(x) from second guess, so C not in word. Cannot use C.

Second feedback: C(x), so C absent.

Similarly, K absent.

So SCOUT has C, invalid.

""SHOUT"" – S H O U T, positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. So T at 5, U at 4.

H and U untested.

Similarly, ""SCOWL"" has C, absent.

""STOOP"" – S T O O P? But T at position 2, which is forbidden? T cannot be at pos 2 because we have T(-) at pos 2 from guess 2.

In STOOP, T is at 2, which would be wrong position again? But we cannot put T at pos 2.

Similarly, ""STOUT"" has T at position 2? S T O U T? Position 2: T, which is forbidden.

So we cannot have T at position 2.

Therefore, for our guess, position 2 must not be T; T must be at 4 or 5.

Therefore, back to patterns:

Option 1: T at position 4: word S ? O T ? 

Like ""SLOTH"": S L O T H

Option 2: T at position 5: word S ? O ? T

Like ""SHOUT"": S H O U T

""SHOUT"" tests H and U, and puts T at 5.

Similarly, other words: ""SMOUT"" not word.

""GLOUT"" not common.

""TROUT"" has T at start but position 1 is S, cannot.

So ""SHOUT"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? N and U tested.

But N is common.

We also have to consider that T might be at position 4 or 5, so by guessing one, we can confirm.

Moreover, for position 2, we can use a common letter like H or N or L.

In ""SHOUT"", we get to test:

Position 1: S (should be correct, already fixed)
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: U
Position 5: T

If we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) U(?) T(?) 

If T is at position 5 and correct, we get T(✓) at 5. If not, we might know T is at position 4.

Similarly, U might be present or not.

But we also cover position 4 with U.

Another possibility: ""S O L V T"" not word.

Or ""PIOUS"" but S at end and O at position 3, but position 1 would be P? Not matching.

I think ""SHOUT"" or ""SLOTH"" are candidates.

But in ""SLOTH"", T is at position 4: S L O T H

If we guess this, and T is at position 4, we get T(✓), else if not, we might get T(-) if it's elsewhere, but we know only position 5 possible? Since position 2 forbidden and position 3 fixed.

Position 3 is O fixed, so T can only be at 4 or 5.

So if we guess SLOTH with T at 4:
- If T is at 4, we get T(✓)
- If T is at 5, we get T(-) for position 4? And feedback for position 4 wrong.

Similarly for SHOUT.

Perhaps choose one that test more common letters.

""SHOUT"" tests H, U, and T at 5.
""SLOTH"" tests L, H, and T at 4.

L and H are both useful.

Another word: ""SMITH"" has I absent? I not allowed.

""SWOOP"" has W,O,O? Duplicate O? And O fixed at 3, so position 4 O? Possible but less common.

""S Y L P H"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOUTH"": S O U T H? But O at position 3, so ""S"" + position2 + ""U"" + ""O""? No.

SOUTH: S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But in our pattern, position 3 must be O fixed, here O is at position 2? Not matching pattern.

Our pattern must have position 3 as O.

So SOUTH cannot be because position 2 would be O? No, actually if word is SOUTH, position 2 is O, but we know position 3 is O, so if O is fixed at position 3, then position 2 cannot be O? Unless duplicate.

But O might duplicate? Possible.

For example, word like ""FOOLS"" position 3 O? But let's forget.

Back to S?O? with T at end or middle.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good choice: S H O U T

Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

This tests H at position 2, U at position 4, T at position 5.

If T is actually at position 4, we will get:
- Position 5: T might be absent or something? But T present, so if T is at 4, then position 4 T, position 5 U? U might be absent.

Similarly, vice versa.

But by guessing, we learn the position of T and whether H and U are present.

Moreover, if T is not at 5, we know it must be at 4.

Similarly, other options.

To avoid U which is less common, but vowel needed possibly.

Another word: ""SHOTT"" not word.

"" S T O P E "" has E absent and T at position 2 forbidden.

Cannot.

"" S L O P E "" E absent.

So ""SHOUT"" seems reasonable.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"" same structure: S N O U T

But N instead of H.

Both fine.

Also ""SCOUT"" has C absent, invalid.

So let's choose ""SHOUT"".

But in SHOUT, position 4 and 5: U and T.

We test both.

If T is at position 5, it will be correct. If T is at position 4, then position 5 U might be wrong if U not present.

But we will get feedback.

Similarly for H at position 2.

So I think it's a good guess.

Since position 3 O is fixed, and position 1 S fixed, we only have positions 2,4,5 to determine.

And T must be at 4 or 5.

By putting T at 5, and U at 4, we test both positions.

If U is present, we get info; if not, absent.

Similarly H at position 2.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHOUT"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
    - R, A, I, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: STOCK** → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in position 1 (correct).  
    - O is in position 3 (correct).  
    - T is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and K are absent.  

**Current knowledge:**  
- The secret word has the pattern: S _ O _ _  
  - Position 1: S (fixed).  
  - Position 3: O (fixed).  
- T must be present but not in position 2 (since it was a wrong-position match in guess 2). Given positions 1 and 3 are occupied, T must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K (avoid these).  
- Untested common letters: Focus on consonants like H, L, N, U, etc., as vowels A, E, I are out (only O is confirmed, U/Y may be viable).  

**Strategy for the next guess:**  
- Must include T to determine its position (either 4 or 5).  
- Test new common letters in position 2 and the remaining positions (4 or 5) to maximize information:  
  - Position 2: Untested and not absent (e.g., H, L, N).  
  - Position 4 or 5: Untested and not absent, depending on T's placement.  
- Preferred word choice:  
  - ""SHOUT"" fits perfectly: S H O U T.  
    - Tests T in position 5 (if T is here, it should be correct; if not, T must be in position 4).  
    - Tests H in position 2, and U in position 4—both untested and common.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
- Alternative words considered (like ""SNOUT"" or ""SLOTH"") but ""SHOUT"" is prioritized for its simplicity and coverage.  

**Expected outcomes from guessing ""SHOUT"":**  
- If T is at position 5: Feedback should show T(✓).  
- If T is at position 4: Feedback may show T(-) for position 5, confirming T must be at position 4.  
- If H is in the word, feedback will indicate its position correctness or presence (✓ or -).  
- If U is in the word, feedback will similarly indicate its status.  

<guess>SHOUT</guess>",SHOUT,"We have feedback from two guesses.

First guess ""RAISE"" feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
- This told us that S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- Also, R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Second guess ""STOCK"" feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
- S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1. This overrides the earlier feedback about position; now we know S is at position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 3 and correct.
- T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(x) means C is not in the word.
- K(x) means K is not in the word.

So from the feedback so far:

- **Known correct positions:**
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 3: O

- **Present letters but wrong position:**
  - T is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2.

- **Absent letters:**
  - R, A, I, E, C, K are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we knew S was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 1, so no issue.

The word structure is: S _ O _ _

We know T is present but not at position 2. So T must be at position 4 or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include T in position 4 or 5 to discover where it is.
- Avoid letters R, A, I, E, C, K.
- We need to choose letters for position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5) that haven't been tested and aren't absent.

Known absent letters: S is present but already placed, actually S is fixed at position 1 so no issue. But we used S and O.

Letters we haven't tested: many consonants and vowels. But vowels: A, E, I are out, so remaining vowels are O (already placed at 3, but O might not be duplicate?), U, and possibly Y.

O is at position 3 and fixed, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere? Not necessarily.

Other vowels: U, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: we need letters not in the absent list.

Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T (used but present), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But T is present and must be included.

The word is S _ O _ _

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: unknown
3: O (fixed)
4: could be T or something else?
5: could be T or other?

T is in the word and not at 2, so it must be at 4 or 5.

We should test T in one of these positions and new letters elsewhere.

For position 2, we need a letter that hasn't been tested and not absent.

Also, we should avoid using multiple absent letters.

Let me think of possible words.

Word pattern: S ? O ? ? 

With T required in positions 4 or 5.

First, option: put T at position 4.

Then the word would be S ? O T ?

Position 2 is unknown, and position 5 needs a letter.

What letters can we use? B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to get information. For example, L, N, U, M.

So possible word: ""SOLT"" ... but needs 5 letters. S ? O T _

Say ""S O L T Y"" but position 2 is missing.

Word: Position 2 must be a letter.

For example: if T is at 4, then ""S"" + letter2 + ""O"" + ""T"" + letter5.

What word exists? Like ""SPOUT"" – S P O U T? But U is a vowel, available.

SPOUT: S(1), P(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But if we put T at position 4? No, we want T at position 4? T(-) was position 2 in guess 2, so T can be at 4.

But in ""SPOUT"", U is at 4 and T at 5? Oh, I mispositioned.

If T is at position 4, then word: S ? O T ?

For example: ""S L O T S"" but duplicate S? Not necessarily duplicated.

But better to have distinct letters to test more.

Is S duplicated? We don't know; probably not, but possible.

But safe to assume no dup unless indicated.

Similarly, O at position 3, might not duplicate.

So ""S?OT?"" words: ""SILOT"" not word. ""SPOT"": but 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Common words: How about ""SHOUT"": S H O U T? Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). T is at position 5, not 4.

But we are considering T at position 4 or 5 separately.

First, suppose we put T at position 4. What words? ""S"" + X + ""O"" + ""T"" + Y.

For example: ""SCOTE"" not word. ""STOIC"" has I and C? Out. ""STOMP"" has M, P? S(1) T(2) O(3) M(4) P(5)? But T is at position 2, but T(-) in guess 2 was at position 2, so T cannot be at pos 2? Correct, T cannot be at pos 2.

If we have T at position 4, word: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:O, 4:T, 5:?

So: S ? O T ?

Examples: ""S M O T H"" – SMOTH not a word; it's SMOTE? SMOTE has E? E absent. ""S L O T H"" – SLOTH is a word: S L O T H? But TH at end? S(1), L(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). Yes, SLOTH.

But H? We haven't tested H.

Similarly, ""S P O T S"" SPOTS has S duplicate? S at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicate exists.

But let's avoid for now.

Similarly, ""SHOTE"" has E absent.

""SWOPS"" has S twice.

Perhaps ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? But T is at position 5.

For T at position 4, ""S NOT ?"" hard.

""BESOT"" but has E absent.

Perhaps not many common words with S? O T pattern?

Another idea: put T at position 5 instead.

Then word: S ? O ? T

For example, ""S H O T T"" duplicate T? Not.

""SHOOT"" – S H O O T? Duplicate O? O is at position 3, and position 4 would be O again? Possible.

But let's see: SHOOT has O at position 3 and 4? But position 3 is O, but position 4 would be O duplicate.

We might test that.

But we want to test new letters.

Perhaps ""S O L U T"" not word.

""SPLOT"" not word.

Common words: ""SCOUT"" – S C O U T? But C is absent? C(x) from second guess, so C not in word. Cannot use C.

Second feedback: C(x), so C absent.

Similarly, K absent.

So SCOUT has C, invalid.

""SHOUT"" – S H O U T, positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. So T at 5, U at 4.

H and U untested.

Similarly, ""SCOWL"" has C, absent.

""STOOP"" – S T O O P? But T at position 2, which is forbidden? T cannot be at pos 2 because we have T(-) at pos 2 from guess 2.

In STOOP, T is at 2, which would be wrong position again? But we cannot put T at pos 2.

Similarly, ""STOUT"" has T at position 2? S T O U T? Position 2: T, which is forbidden.

So we cannot have T at position 2.

Therefore, for our guess, position 2 must not be T; T must be at 4 or 5.

Therefore, back to patterns:

Option 1: T at position 4: word S ? O T ? 

Like ""SLOTH"": S L O T H

Option 2: T at position 5: word S ? O ? T

Like ""SHOUT"": S H O U T

""SHOUT"" tests H and U, and puts T at 5.

Similarly, other words: ""SMOUT"" not word.

""GLOUT"" not common.

""TROUT"" has T at start but position 1 is S, cannot.

So ""SHOUT"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? N and U tested.

But N is common.

We also have to consider that T might be at position 4 or 5, so by guessing one, we can confirm.

Moreover, for position 2, we can use a common letter like H or N or L.

In ""SHOUT"", we get to test:

Position 1: S (should be correct, already fixed)
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: U
Position 5: T

If we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) U(?) T(?) 

If T is at position 5 and correct, we get T(✓) at 5. If not, we might know T is at position 4.

Similarly, U might be present or not.

But we also cover position 4 with U.

Another possibility: ""S O L V T"" not word.

Or ""PIOUS"" but S at end and O at position 3, but position 1 would be P? Not matching.

I think ""SHOUT"" or ""SLOTH"" are candidates.

But in ""SLOTH"", T is at position 4: S L O T H

If we guess this, and T is at position 4, we get T(✓), else if not, we might get T(-) if it's elsewhere, but we know only position 5 possible? Since position 2 forbidden and position 3 fixed.

Position 3 is O fixed, so T can only be at 4 or 5.

So if we guess SLOTH with T at 4:
- If T is at 4, we get T(✓)
- If T is at 5, we get T(-) for position 4? And feedback for position 4 wrong.

Similarly for SHOUT.

Perhaps choose one that test more common letters.

""SHOUT"" tests H, U, and T at 5.
""SLOTH"" tests L, H, and T at 4.

L and H are both useful.

Another word: ""SMITH"" has I absent? I not allowed.

""SWOOP"" has W,O,O? Duplicate O? And O fixed at 3, so position 4 O? Possible but less common.

""S Y L P H"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOUTH"": S O U T H? But O at position 3, so ""S"" + position2 + ""U"" + ""O""? No.

SOUTH: S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But in our pattern, position 3 must be O fixed, here O is at position 2? Not matching pattern.

Our pattern must have position 3 as O.

So SOUTH cannot be because position 2 would be O? No, actually if word is SOUTH, position 2 is O, but we know position 3 is O, so if O is fixed at position 3, then position 2 cannot be O? Unless duplicate.

But O might duplicate? Possible.

For example, word like ""FOOLS"" position 3 O? But let's forget.

Back to S?O? with T at end or middle.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good choice: S H O U T

Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

This tests H at position 2, U at position 4, T at position 5.

If T is actually at position 4, we will get:
- Position 5: T might be absent or something? But T present, so if T is at 4, then position 4 T, position 5 U? U might be absent.

Similarly, vice versa.

But by guessing, we learn the position of T and whether H and U are present.

Moreover, if T is not at 5, we know it must be at 4.

Similarly, other options.

To avoid U which is less common, but vowel needed possibly.

Another word: ""SHOTT"" not word.

"" S T O P E "" has E absent and T at position 2 forbidden.

Cannot.

"" S L O P E "" E absent.

So ""SHOUT"" seems reasonable.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"" same structure: S N O U T

But N instead of H.

Both fine.

Also ""SCOUT"" has C absent, invalid.

So let's choose ""SHOUT"".

But in SHOUT, position 4 and 5: U and T.

We test both.

If T is at position 5, it will be correct. If T is at position 4, then position 5 U might be wrong if U not present.

But we will get feedback.

Similarly for H at position 2.

So I think it's a good guess.

Since position 3 O is fixed, and position 1 S fixed, we only have positions 2,4,5 to determine.

And T must be at 4 or 5.

By putting T at 5, and U at 4, we test both positions.

If U is present, we get info; if not, absent.

Similarly H at position 2.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we might choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, R, N, L, etc.

One of the common starting words is ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of many letters.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular.

But note: We are allowed to use any English word. Let's go with ""CRANE"" today because it has C, R, A, N, E which are also common.

However, let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has more vowels.I'll start with a common strategy: choose a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize the information gained from the first guess. For this, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). This combination often helps identify several letters or their positions early on. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will reveal valuable clues for the next guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R(x) : R is not in the secret word.
- A(x) : A is not in the secret word.
- I(x) : I is not in the secret word.
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since we guessed S in the 4th and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have S somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Now, for our next guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it exists) but in a different position than 4.
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E because they are not in the word.
- We want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters to try: consonants like T, N, O, L, and vowels like O, U (since A,E,I are out).

We also have to avoid R, A, I, E.

Possible words that include S:

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, let's consider putting S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

But note: we don't know which position S is in, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tried yet.

We tried ""RAISE"" which had S in position 4.

Let's try a word with S in position 1.

Also, we shouldn't use R,A,I,E.

A candidate: ""STOMP"" - but wait, we need common letters.

""S"" at the start: possible words: SHOWY, SNOWY, but let's avoid Y if possible? But we don't know.

A better word might be ""SONGS"" but that has two S's? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since we only know one S is present, we should not assume duplicates. But ""SONGS"" would test S in position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is wrong for S, but if we put S in position 4 again, it will still be wrong? We already know S is not in position 4, so repeating it might not be efficient.

Actually, the feedback said S is in wrong position, so if we put S in position 4 again, it would still be wrong position if the correct position isn't 4. But to avoid wasting a slot, we can put S in a different position.

So for next guess, we should avoid position 4 for S and put it in one of 1,2,3,5.

Also, we need a word that contains S and other letters we haven't tried yet.

List of available letters: We can use B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding R,A,I,E).

Common among these: T, N, L, O, etc.

Let me think of words:

- S in position 1: SLATE? But A and E are out. SLATE has A and E which we know are not present. So avoid.

So we need to avoid A,E,I,R.

S in position 1: SOULS? No, duplicate S and U,L,S.

Better: ""STUNK"" - S at 1, T,U,N,K. But U and N are new. K is new.

But let's see: STUNK: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),K(5).

We know position 4 had S in first guess, but now we are putting N in position 4? We haven't tested N before.

Another idea: ""SONLY"" but Y might be less common.

Another: ""STOCK"" - S(1),T(2),O(3),C(4),K(5). This avoids A,E,I,R. Let's use that.

But O is a vowel, good to test.

But we also have feedback about S being in the word. In ""STOCK"", S is at position 1.

If we put S at position 1 and it is correct, we get ✓ for S. If not, we might get - or x, but we know S is somewhere else.

But we need to maximize information.

Another possibility: since S must be somewhere from 1,2,3,5, we can try S at position 1 and 5 simultaneously? But we have to guess one word.

What about words with S at the end? Like in position 5.

For example: ""PLOTS"" - P,L,O,T,S. S at position 5.

This tests P,L,O,T, and S at 5.

But P and L are new, O and T are common.

Similarly, ""CULTS"" - but C,U,L,T,S.

Since our first word had S at 4, and now we move it to another position to see.

But to be systematic.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains S and four other new letters.

For example: ""SCOLD"" - S(1),C(2),O(3),L(4),D(5). Avoid A,E,I,R. But L is at position 4. However, we know position 4 in the secret word is not S (from first guess) so it could be something else.

But in ""RAISE"", position 4 was S and we got wrong position, so the correct letter at position 4 is something else.

In ""SCOLD"", we put L at position 4, which might be correct or not.

But let's see which letters are covered.

Since we only have one known letter S, and it must be in position 1,2,3, or 5, I think putting S at position 1 is a good idea.

Let me go with ""STOCK"": it has S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, C at 4, K at 5.

All letters are new except S.

We avoid R,A,I,E.

If the word is ""STOCK"", it would be perfect, but we don't know.

But likely not, but we get information.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" - S(1),H(2),O(3),W(4),N(5). H and W are less common? But let's try.

I think ""STOCK"" is fine.

But let's consider that in the first guess, S was not in position 4, so if the correct position is 1, then in ""STOCK"" we get S(1) ✓. If it's position 2, we might get S(-) only if S is at position 2 but we have it at 1? We'll get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if S is at position 2, putting it at position 1 will show as wrong position.

So I'll go with ""STOCK"".

But let me write it down.

Guess: STOCK

But wait, let's ensure it's valid: STOCK is a word.

Yes.

Another option: ""SLICK"" - but L and I, but I is out. Cannot, because I is not allowed.

I not in word? Yes, we know I is not in the word.

So SLICK has I, which we know is absent? So invalid to include I? Because we know I is not in the word, so we must not use letters we know are absent? Actually, that's correct strategy. We avoid letters known absent.

Similarly, avoiding R,A,I,E.

So STOCK: S,T,O,C,K all not in R,A,I,E and are possible.

Similarly, SHOWN: S,H,O,W,N - all possible.

But I think STOCK is fine.

But let me consider: in STOCK, position 4 is C. But we already know position 4 isn't S. But we can test C there.

Since S is the only known letter, we might want to test its position.

Another word: ""SULLY"" but U,Y and L? Has L, but also duplicate L? S has to be included.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but no S. We must include S because it's the only known letter, and we want to find its position.

So we need a word that includes S.

So STOCK: S at 1, includes O, T, C, K.

Similarly, ""SKIMP"" - S at 1, K,I? I is out, cannot use.

""SCALP"" has A, which is out.

""SONIC"" has O,N,I,C? But I is out.

Avoid I.

SONIC has I? S-O-N-I-C. Yes, I is position 4? S-O-N-I-C? S(1),O(2),N(3),I(4),C(5). But I is forbidden, so we cannot use SONIC because I is not in the secret word.

Must avoid excluded letters.

So STOCK is good: S-T-O-C-K. No excluded letters.

Another: ""SMOCK"" - similar.

But I'll go with STOCK.

S at position 1.

But we don't know if position 1 is S or not.

Perhaps put S at a different position to sample.

For example, to test position 1 separately, I could put another letter at position 1 and S elsewhere.

But since we don't know, either way.

Perhaps to maximize position coverage.

In first guess, positions 1-2-3-4-5 had R-A-I-S-E all excluded except S which is wrong in 4.

So we have no info on positions 1,2,3,5 except that they are not S? No, position 4 was S and wrong, but positions 1,2,3,5 could have S if not 4.

But S is somewhere else.

Now, putting S at position 1: if S is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get - if it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S at 5, same thing.

But besides S, we test T,O,C,K, which are common.

I think ""STOCK"" is a reasonable guess.Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"", we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
- The letters R, A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

This means:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, or E in our next guess.
- S must be included in the guess but in a position other than 4th (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- We should test new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess, ""STOCK"" is chosen because:
- It includes S in the 1st position to test if S belongs there.
- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.

If S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.

<guess>STOCK</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses.

First guess ""RAISE"" feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
- This told us that S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- Also, R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Second guess ""STOCK"" feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
- S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1. This overrides the earlier feedback about position; now we know S is at position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 3 and correct.
- T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(x) means C is not in the word.
- K(x) means K is not in the word.

So from the feedback so far:

- **Known correct positions:**
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 3: O

- **Present letters but wrong position:**
  - T is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2.

- **Absent letters:**
  - R, A, I, E, C, K are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we knew S was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 1, so no issue.

The word structure is: S _ O _ _

We know T is present but not at position 2. So T must be at position 4 or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include T in position 4 or 5 to discover where it is.
- Avoid letters R, A, I, E, C, K.
- We need to choose letters for position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5) that haven't been tested and aren't absent.

Known absent letters: S is present but already placed, actually S is fixed at position 1 so no issue. But we used S and O.

Letters we haven't tested: many consonants and vowels. But vowels: A, E, I are out, so remaining vowels are O (already placed at 3, but O might not be duplicate?), U, and possibly Y.

O is at position 3 and fixed, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere? Not necessarily.

Other vowels: U, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: we need letters not in the absent list.

Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T (used but present), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But T is present and must be included.

The word is S _ O _ _

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: unknown
3: O (fixed)
4: could be T or something else?
5: could be T or other?

T is in the word and not at 2, so it must be at 4 or 5.

We should test T in one of these positions and new letters elsewhere.

For position 2, we need a letter that hasn't been tested and not absent.

Also, we should avoid using multiple absent letters.

Let me think of possible words.

Word pattern: S ? O ? ? 

With T required in positions 4 or 5.

First, option: put T at position 4.

Then the word would be S ? O T ?

Position 2 is unknown, and position 5 needs a letter.

What letters can we use? B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to get information. For example, L, N, U, M.

So possible word: ""SOLT"" ... but needs 5 letters. S ? O T _

Say ""S O L T Y"" but position 2 is missing.

Word: Position 2 must be a letter.

For example: if T is at 4, then ""S"" + letter2 + ""O"" + ""T"" + letter5.

What word exists? Like ""SPOUT"" – S P O U T? But U is a vowel, available.

SPOUT: S(1), P(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But if we put T at position 4? No, we want T at position 4? T(-) was position 2 in guess 2, so T can be at 4.

But in ""SPOUT"", U is at 4 and T at 5? Oh, I mispositioned.

If T is at position 4, then word: S ? O T ?

For example: ""S L O T S"" but duplicate S? Not necessarily duplicated.

But better to have distinct letters to test more.

Is S duplicated? We don't know; probably not, but possible.

But safe to assume no dup unless indicated.

Similarly, O at position 3, might not duplicate.

So ""S?OT?"" words: ""SILOT"" not word. ""SPOT"": but 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Common words: How about ""SHOUT"": S H O U T? Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). T is at position 5, not 4.

But we are considering T at position 4 or 5 separately.

First, suppose we put T at position 4. What words? ""S"" + X + ""O"" + ""T"" + Y.

For example: ""SCOTE"" not word. ""STOIC"" has I and C? Out. ""STOMP"" has M, P? S(1) T(2) O(3) M(4) P(5)? But T is at position 2, but T(-) in guess 2 was at position 2, so T cannot be at pos 2? Correct, T cannot be at pos 2.

If we have T at position 4, word: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:O, 4:T, 5:?

So: S ? O T ?

Examples: ""S M O T H"" – SMOTH not a word; it's SMOTE? SMOTE has E? E absent. ""S L O T H"" – SLOTH is a word: S L O T H? But TH at end? S(1), L(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). Yes, SLOTH.

But H? We haven't tested H.

Similarly, ""S P O T S"" SPOTS has S duplicate? S at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicate exists.

But let's avoid for now.

Similarly, ""SHOTE"" has E absent.

""SWOPS"" has S twice.

Perhaps ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? But T is at position 5.

For T at position 4, ""S NOT ?"" hard.

""BESOT"" but has E absent.

Perhaps not many common words with S? O T pattern?

Another idea: put T at position 5 instead.

Then word: S ? O ? T

For example, ""S H O T T"" duplicate T? Not.

""SHOOT"" – S H O O T? Duplicate O? O is at position 3, and position 4 would be O again? Possible.

But let's see: SHOOT has O at position 3 and 4? But position 3 is O, but position 4 would be O duplicate.

We might test that.

But we want to test new letters.

Perhaps ""S O L U T"" not word.

""SPLOT"" not word.

Common words: ""SCOUT"" – S C O U T? But C is absent? C(x) from second guess, so C not in word. Cannot use C.

Second feedback: C(x), so C absent.

Similarly, K absent.

So SCOUT has C, invalid.

""SHOUT"" – S H O U T, positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. So T at 5, U at 4.

H and U untested.

Similarly, ""SCOWL"" has C, absent.

""STOOP"" – S T O O P? But T at position 2, which is forbidden? T cannot be at pos 2 because we have T(-) at pos 2 from guess 2.

In STOOP, T is at 2, which would be wrong position again? But we cannot put T at pos 2.

Similarly, ""STOUT"" has T at position 2? S T O U T? Position 2: T, which is forbidden.

So we cannot have T at position 2.

Therefore, for our guess, position 2 must not be T; T must be at 4 or 5.

Therefore, back to patterns:

Option 1: T at position 4: word S ? O T ? 

Like ""SLOTH"": S L O T H

Option 2: T at position 5: word S ? O ? T

Like ""SHOUT"": S H O U T

""SHOUT"" tests H and U, and puts T at 5.

Similarly, other words: ""SMOUT"" not word.

""GLOUT"" not common.

""TROUT"" has T at start but position 1 is S, cannot.

So ""SHOUT"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? N and U tested.

But N is common.

We also have to consider that T might be at position 4 or 5, so by guessing one, we can confirm.

Moreover, for position 2, we can use a common letter like H or N or L.

In ""SHOUT"", we get to test:

Position 1: S (should be correct, already fixed)
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: U
Position 5: T

If we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) U(?) T(?) 

If T is at position 5 and correct, we get T(✓) at 5. If not, we might know T is at position 4.

Similarly, U might be present or not.

But we also cover position 4 with U.

Another possibility: ""S O L V T"" not word.

Or ""PIOUS"" but S at end and O at position 3, but position 1 would be P? Not matching.

I think ""SHOUT"" or ""SLOTH"" are candidates.

But in ""SLOTH"", T is at position 4: S L O T H

If we guess this, and T is at position 4, we get T(✓), else if not, we might get T(-) if it's elsewhere, but we know only position 5 possible? Since position 2 forbidden and position 3 fixed.

Position 3 is O fixed, so T can only be at 4 or 5.

So if we guess SLOTH with T at 4:
- If T is at 4, we get T(✓)
- If T is at 5, we get T(-) for position 4? And feedback for position 4 wrong.

Similarly for SHOUT.

Perhaps choose one that test more common letters.

""SHOUT"" tests H, U, and T at 5.
""SLOTH"" tests L, H, and T at 4.

L and H are both useful.

Another word: ""SMITH"" has I absent? I not allowed.

""SWOOP"" has W,O,O? Duplicate O? And O fixed at 3, so position 4 O? Possible but less common.

""S Y L P H"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOUTH"": S O U T H? But O at position 3, so ""S"" + position2 + ""U"" + ""O""? No.

SOUTH: S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But in our pattern, position 3 must be O fixed, here O is at position 2? Not matching pattern.

Our pattern must have position 3 as O.

So SOUTH cannot be because position 2 would be O? No, actually if word is SOUTH, position 2 is O, but we know position 3 is O, so if O is fixed at position 3, then position 2 cannot be O? Unless duplicate.

But O might duplicate? Possible.

For example, word like ""FOOLS"" position 3 O? But let's forget.

Back to S?O? with T at end or middle.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good choice: S H O U T

Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

This tests H at position 2, U at position 4, T at position 5.

If T is actually at position 4, we will get:
- Position 5: T might be absent or something? But T present, so if T is at 4, then position 4 T, position 5 U? U might be absent.

Similarly, vice versa.

But by guessing, we learn the position of T and whether H and U are present.

Moreover, if T is not at 5, we know it must be at 4.

Similarly, other options.

To avoid U which is less common, but vowel needed possibly.

Another word: ""SHOTT"" not word.

"" S T O P E "" has E absent and T at position 2 forbidden.

Cannot.

"" S L O P E "" E absent.

So ""SHOUT"" seems reasonable.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"" same structure: S N O U T

But N instead of H.

Both fine.

Also ""SCOUT"" has C absent, invalid.

So let's choose ""SHOUT"".

But in SHOUT, position 4 and 5: U and T.

We test both.

If T is at position 5, it will be correct. If T is at position 4, then position 5 U might be wrong if U not present.

But we will get feedback.

Similarly for H at position 2.

So I think it's a good guess.

Since position 3 O is fixed, and position 1 S fixed, we only have positions 2,4,5 to determine.

And T must be at 4 or 5.

By putting T at 5, and U at 4, we test both positions.

If U is present, we get info; if not, absent.

Similarly H at position 2.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
    - R, A, I, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: STOCK** → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in position 1 (correct).  
    - O is in position 3 (correct).  
    - T is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and K are absent.  

**Current knowledge:**  
- The secret word has the pattern: S _ O _ _  
  - Position 1: S (fixed).  
  - Position 3: O (fixed).  
- T must be present but not in position 2 (since it was a wrong-position match in guess 2). Given positions 1 and 3 are occupied, T must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K (avoid these).  
- Untested common letters: Focus on consonants like H, L, N, U, etc., as vowels A, E, I are out (only O is confirmed, U/Y may be viable).  

**Strategy for the next guess:**  
- Must include T to determine its position (either 4 or 5).  
- Test new common letters in position 2 and the remaining positions (4 or 5) to maximize information:  
  - Position 2: Untested and not absent (e.g., H, L, N).  
  - Position 4 or 5: Untested and not absent, depending on T's placement.  
- Preferred word choice:  
  - ""SHOUT"" fits perfectly: S H O U T.  
    - Tests T in position 5 (if T is here, it should be correct; if not, T must be in position 4).  
    - Tests H in position 2, and U in position 4—both untested and common.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
- Alternative words considered (like ""SNOUT"" or ""SLOTH"") but ""SHOUT"" is prioritized for its simplicity and coverage.  

**Expected outcomes from guessing ""SHOUT"":**  
- If T is at position 5: Feedback should show T(✓).  
- If T is at position 4: Feedback may show T(-) for position 5, confirming T must be at position 4.  
- If H is in the word, feedback will indicate its position correctness or presence (✓ or -).  
- If U is in the word, feedback will similarly indicate its status.

Let\'s go with ""CRANE"" today because it has C, R, A, N, E which are also common.\n\nHowever, let\'s choose ""RAISE"" because it has more vowels.I\'ll start with a common strategy: choose a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize the information gained from the first guess. For this, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). This combination often helps identify several letters or their positions early on. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will reveal valuable clues for the next guess.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R(x) : R is not in the secret word.\n- A(x) : A is not in the secret word.\n- I(x) : I is not in the secret word.\n- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- E(x) : E is not in the secret word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since we guessed S in the 4th and it was marked as wrong position).\n- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have S somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5 (but not position 4).\n\nNow, for our next guess, we should try a word that:\n- Includes the letter S (since we know it exists) but in a different position than 4.\n- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E because they are not in the word.\n- We want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters to try: consonants like T, N, O, L, and vowels like O, U (since A,E,I are out).\n\nWe also have to avoid R, A, I, E.\n\nPossible words that include S:\n\nSince S is in the word but not in position 4, let\'s consider putting S in position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which position S is in, so we can try to put it in a position we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe tried ""RAISE"" which had S in position 4.\n\nLet\'s try a word with S in position 1.\n\nAlso, we shouldn\'t use R,A,I,E.\n\nA candidate: ""STOMP"" - but wait, we need common letters.\n\n""S"" at the start: possible words: SHOWY, SNOWY, but let\'s avoid Y if possible? But we don\'t know.\n\nA better word might be ""SONGS"" but that has two S\'s? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But since we only know one S is present, we should not assume duplicates. But ""SONGS"" would test S in position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is wrong for S, but if we put S in position 4 again, it will still be wrong? We already know S is not in position 4, so repeating it might not be efficient.\n\nActually, the feedback said S is in wrong position, so if we put S in position 4 again, it would still be wrong position if the correct position isn\'t 4. But to avoid wasting a slot, we can put S in a different position.\n\nSo for next guess, we should avoid position 4 for S and put it in one of 1,2,3,5.\n\nAlso, we need a word that contains S and other letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nList of available letters: We can use B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding R,A,I,E).\n\nCommon among these: T, N, L, O, etc.\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- S in position 1: SLATE? But A and E are out. SLATE has A and E which we know are not present. So avoid.\n\nSo we need to avoid A,E,I,R.\n\nS in position 1: SOULS? No, duplicate S and U,L,S.\n\nBetter: ""STUNK"" - S at 1, T,U,N,K. But U and N are new. K is new.\n\nBut let\'s see: STUNK: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),K(5).\n\nWe know position 4 had S in first guess, but now we are putting N in position 4? We haven\'t tested N before.\n\nAnother idea: ""SONLY"" but Y might be less common.\n\nAnother: ""STOCK"" - S(1),T(2),O(3),C(4),K(5). This avoids A,E,I,R. Let\'s use that.\n\nBut O is a vowel, good to test.\n\nBut we also have feedback about S being in the word. In ""STOCK"", S is at position 1.\n\nIf we put S at position 1 and it is correct, we get ✓ for S. If not, we might get - or x, but we know S is somewhere else.\n\nBut we need to maximize information.\n\nAnother possibility: since S must be somewhere from 1,2,3,5, we can try S at position 1 and 5 simultaneously? But we have to guess one word.\n\nWhat about words with S at the end? Like in position 5.\n\nFor example: ""PLOTS"" - P,L,O,T,S. S at position 5.\n\nThis tests P,L,O,T, and S at 5.\n\nBut P and L are new, O and T are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""CULTS"" - but C,U,L,T,S.\n\nSince our first word had S at 4, and now we move it to another position to see.\n\nBut to be systematic.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that contains S and four other new letters.\n\nFor example: ""SCOLD"" - S(1),C(2),O(3),L(4),D(5). Avoid A,E,I,R. But L is at position 4. However, we know position 4 in the secret word is not S (from first guess) so it could be something else.\n\nBut in ""RAISE"", position 4 was S and we got wrong position, so the correct letter at position 4 is something else.\n\nIn ""SCOLD"", we put L at position 4, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut let\'s see which letters are covered.\n\nSince we only have one known letter S, and it must be in position 1,2,3, or 5, I think putting S at position 1 is a good idea.\n\nLet me go with ""STOCK"": it has S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, C at 4, K at 5.\n\nAll letters are new except S.\n\nWe avoid R,A,I,E.\n\nIf the word is ""STOCK"", it would be perfect, but we don\'t know.\n\nBut likely not, but we get information.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHOWN"" - S(1),H(2),O(3),W(4),N(5). H and W are less common? But let\'s try.\n\nI think ""STOCK"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s consider that in the first guess, S was not in position 4, so if the correct position is 1, then in ""STOCK"" we get S(1) ✓. If it\'s position 2, we might get S(-) only if S is at position 2 but we have it at 1? We\'ll get feedback accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if S is at position 2, putting it at position 1 will show as wrong position.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STOCK"".\n\nBut let me write it down.\n\nGuess: STOCK\n\nBut wait, let\'s ensure it\'s valid: STOCK is a word.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother option: ""SLICK"" - but L and I, but I is out. Cannot, because I is not allowed.\n\nI not in word? Yes, we know I is not in the word.\n\nSo SLICK has I, which we know is absent? So invalid to include I? Because we know I is not in the word, so we must not use letters we know are absent? Actually, that\'s correct strategy. We avoid letters known absent.\n\nSimilarly, avoiding R,A,I,E.\n\nSo STOCK: S,T,O,C,K all not in R,A,I,E and are possible.\n\nSimilarly, SHOWN: S,H,O,W,N - all possible.\n\nBut I think STOCK is fine.\n\nBut let me consider: in STOCK, position 4 is C. But we already know position 4 isn\'t S. But we can test C there.\n\nSince S is the only known letter, we might want to test its position.\n\nAnother word: ""SULLY"" but U,Y and L? Has L, but also duplicate L? S has to be included.\n\nPerhaps ""POINT"" but no S. We must include S because it\'s the only known letter, and we want to find its position.\n\nSo we need a word that includes S.\n\nSo STOCK: S at 1, includes O, T, C, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""SKIMP"" - S at 1, K,I? I is out, cannot use.\n\n""SCALP"" has A, which is out.\n\n""SONIC"" has O,N,I,C? But I is out.\n\nAvoid I.\n\nSONIC has I? S-O-N-I-C. Yes, I is position 4? S-O-N-I-C? S(1),O(2),N(3),I(4),C(5). But I is forbidden, so we cannot use SONIC because I is not in the secret word.\n\nMust avoid excluded letters.\n\nSo STOCK is good: S-T-O-C-K. No excluded letters.\n\nAnother: ""SMOCK"" - similar.\n\nBut I\'ll go with STOCK.\n\nS at position 1.\n\nBut we don\'t know if position 1 is S or not.\n\nPerhaps put S at a different position to sample.\n\nFor example, to test position 1 separately, I could put another letter at position 1 and S elsewhere.\n\nBut since we don\'t know, either way.\n\nPerhaps to maximize position coverage.\n\nIn first guess, positions 1-2-3-4-5 had R-A-I-S-E all excluded except S which is wrong in 4.\n\nSo we have no info on positions 1,2,3,5 except that they are not S? No, position 4 was S and wrong, but positions 1,2,3,5 could have S if not 4.\n\nBut S is somewhere else.\n\nNow, putting S at position 1: if S is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get - if it\'s elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, if we put S at 5, same thing.\n\nBut besides S, we test T,O,C,K, which are common.\n\nI think ""STOCK"" is a reasonable guess.Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"", we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.\n- The letters R, A, I, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nThis means:\n- We must avoid using R, A, I, or E in our next guess.\n- S must be included in the guess but in a position other than 4th (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- We should test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nFor the second guess, ""STOCK"" is chosen because:\n- It includes S in the 1st position to test if S belongs there.\n- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.\n- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.\n\nIf S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.\n\n<guess>STOCK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses.\n\nFirst guess ""RAISE"" feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n- This told us that S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- Also, R, A, I, E are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess ""STOCK"" feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)\n- S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1.

For example, L, N, U, M.\n\nSo possible word: ""SOLT"" ... but needs 5 letters. S ? O T _\n\nSay ""S O L T Y"" but position 2 is missing.\n\nWord: Position 2 must be a letter.\n\nFor example: if T is at 4, then ""S"" + letter2 + ""O"" + ""T"" + letter5.\n\nWhat word exists? Like ""SPOUT"" – S P O U T? But U is a vowel, available.\n\nSPOUT: S(1), P(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But if we put T at position 4? No, we want T at position 4? T(-) was position 2 in guess 2, so T can be at 4.\n\nBut in ""SPOUT"", U is at 4 and T at 5? Oh, I mispositioned.\n\nIf T is at position 4, then word: S ? O T ?\n\nFor example: ""S L O T S"" but duplicate S? Not necessarily duplicated.\n\nBut better to have distinct letters to test more.\n\nIs S duplicated? We don\'t know; probably not, but possible.\n\nBut safe to assume no dup unless indicated.\n\nSimilarly, O at position 3, might not duplicate.\n\nSo ""S?OT?"" words: ""SILOT"" not word. ""SPOT"": but 4 letters. Need 5 letters.\n\nCommon words: How about ""SHOUT"": S H O U T? Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). T is at position 5, not 4.\n\nBut we are considering T at position 4 or 5 separately.\n\nFirst, suppose we put T at position 4. What words? ""S"" + X + ""O"" + ""T"" + Y.\n\nFor example: ""SCOTE"" not word. ""STOIC"" has I and C? Out. ""STOMP"" has M, P? S(1) T(2) O(3) M(4) P(5)? But T is at position 2, but T(-) in guess 2 was at position 2, so T cannot be at pos 2? Correct, T cannot be at pos 2.\n\nIf we have T at position 4, word: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:O, 4:T, 5:?\n\nSo: S ? O T ?\n\nExamples: ""S M O T H"" – SMOTH not a word; it\'s SMOTE? SMOTE has E? E absent. ""S L O T H"" – SLOTH is a word: S L O T H? But TH at end? S(1), L(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). Yes, SLOTH.\n\nBut H? We haven\'t tested H.\n\nSimilarly, ""S P O T S"" SPOTS has S duplicate? S at 1 and 5? We don\'t know if duplicate exists.\n\nBut let\'s avoid for now.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHOTE"" has E absent.\n\n""SWOPS"" has S twice.\n\nPerhaps ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? But T is at position 5.\n\nFor T at position 4, ""S NOT ?"" hard.\n\n""BESOT"" but has E absent.\n\nPerhaps not many common words with S? O T pattern?\n\nAnother idea: put T at position 5 instead.\n\nThen word: S ? O ? T\n\nFor example, ""S H O T T"" duplicate T? Not.\n\n""SHOOT"" – S H O O T? Duplicate O? O is at position 3, and position 4 would be O again? Possible.\n\nBut let\'s see: SHOOT has O at position 3 and 4? But position 3 is O, but position 4 would be O duplicate.\n\nWe might test that.\n\nBut we want to test new letters.\n\nPerhaps ""S O L U T"" not word.\n\n""SPLOT"" not word.\n\nCommon words: ""SCOUT"" – S C O U T? But C is absent? C(x) from second guess, so C not in word. Cannot use C.\n\nSecond feedback: C(x), so C absent.\n\nSimilarly, K absent.\n\nSo SCOUT has C, invalid.\n\n""SHOUT"" – S H O U T, positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. So T at 5, U at 4.\n\nH and U untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""SCOWL"" has C, absent.\n\n""STOOP"" – S T O O P? But T at position 2, which is forbidden? T cannot be at pos 2 because we have T(-) at pos 2 from guess 2.\n\nIn STOOP, T is at 2, which would be wrong position again? But we cannot put T at pos 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""STOUT"" has T at position 2? S T O U T? Position 2: T, which is forbidden.\n\nSo we cannot have T at position 2.\n\nTherefore, for our guess, position 2 must not be T; T must be at 4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, back to patterns:\n\nOption 1: T at position 4: word S ? O T ? \n\nLike ""SLOTH"": S L O T H\n\nOption 2: T at position 5: word S ? O ? T\n\nLike ""SHOUT"": S H O U T\n\n""SHOUT"" tests H and U, and puts T at 5.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""SMOUT"" not word.\n\n""GLOUT"" not common.\n\n""TROUT"" has T at start but position 1 is S, cannot.\n\nSo ""SHOUT"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? N and U tested.\n\nBut N is common.\n\nWe also have to consider that T might be at position 4 or 5, so by guessing one, we can confirm.\n\nMoreover, for position 2, we can use a common letter like H or N or L.\n\nIn ""SHOUT"", we get to test:\n\nPosition 1: S (should be correct, already fixed)\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: O (fixed)\nPosition 4: U\nPosition 5: T\n\nIf we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) U(?) T(?) \n\nIf T is at position 5 and correct, we get T(✓) at 5. If not, we might know T is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, U might be present or not.\n\nBut we also cover position 4 with U.\n\nAnother possibility: ""S O L V T"" not word.\n\nOr ""PIOUS"" but S at end and O at position 3, but position 1 would be P? Not matching.\n\nI think ""SHOUT"" or ""SLOTH"" are candidates.\n\nBut in ""SLOTH"", T is at position 4: S L O T H\n\nIf we guess this, and T is at position 4, we get T(✓), else if not, we might get T(-) if it\'s elsewhere, but we know only position 5 possible? Since position 2 forbidden and position 3 fixed.\n\nPosition 3 is O fixed, so T can only be at 4 or 5.\n\nSo if we guess SLOTH with T at 4:\n- If T is at 4, we get T(✓)\n- If T is at 5, we get T(-) for position 4? And feedback for position 4 wrong.\n\nSimilarly for SHOUT.\n\nPerhaps choose one that test more common letters.\n\n""SHOUT"" tests H, U, and T at 5.\n""SLOTH"" tests L, H, and T at 4.\n\nL and H are both useful.\n\nAnother word: ""SMITH"" has I absent? I not allowed.\n\n""SWOOP"" has W,O,O? Duplicate O? And O fixed at 3, so position 4 O? Possible but less common.\n\n""S Y L P H"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""SOUTH"": S O U T H? But O at position 3, so ""S"" + position2 + ""U"" + ""O""? No.\n\nSOUTH: S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But in our pattern, position 3 must be O fixed, here O is at position 2? Not matching pattern.\n\nOur pattern must have position 3 as O.\n\nSo SOUTH cannot be because position 2 would be O? No, actually if word is SOUTH, position 2 is O, but we know position 3 is O, so if O is fixed at position 3, then position 2 cannot be O? Unless duplicate.\n\nBut O might duplicate? Possible.\n\nFor example, word like ""FOOLS"" position 3 O? But let\'s forget.\n\nBack to S?O? with T at end or middle.\n\nI think ""SHOUT"" is a good choice: S H O U T\n\nPositions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T\n\nThis tests H at position 2, U at position 4, T at position 5.\n\nIf T is actually at position 4, we will get:\n- Position 5: T might be absent or something? But T present, so if T is at 4, then position 4 T, position 5 U? U might be absent.\n\nSimilarly, vice versa.\n\nBut by guessing, we learn the position of T and whether H and U are present.\n\nMoreover, if T is not at 5, we know it must be at 4.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nTo avoid U which is less common, but vowel needed possibly.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOTT"" not word.\n\n"" S T O P E "" has E absent and T at position 2 forbidden.\n\nCannot.\n\n"" S L O P E "" E absent.\n\nSo ""SHOUT"" seems reasonable.\n\nSimilarly, ""SNOUT"" same structure: S N O U T\n\nBut N instead of H.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nAlso ""SCOUT"" has C absent, invalid.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SHOUT"".\n\nBut in SHOUT, position 4 and 5: U and T.\n\nWe test both.\n\nIf T is at position 5, it will be correct. If T is at position 4, then position 5 U might be wrong if U not present.\n\nBut we will get feedback.\n\nSimilarly for H at position 2.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nSince position 3 O is fixed, and position 1 S fixed, we only have positions 2,4,5 to determine.\n\nAnd T must be at 4 or 5.\n\nBy putting T at 5, and U at 4, we test both positions.\n\nIf U is present, we get info; if not, absent.\n\nSimilarly H at position 2.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)  \n  - **Inferences:**  \n    - S is in the word but not in position 4.  \n    - R, A, I, E are absent from the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: STOCK** → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  \n  - **Inferences:**  \n    - S is in position 1 (correct).  \n    - O is in position 3 (correct).  \n    - T is in the word but not in position 2.  \n    - C and K are absent.  \n\n**Current knowledge:**  \n- The secret word has the pattern: S _ O _ _  \n  - Position 1: S (fixed).  \n  - Position 3: O (fixed).  \n- T must be present but not in position 2 (since it was a wrong-position match in guess 2).

- T is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 2) and now not in position 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, T must be in position 4 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken, and 2 and 5 are eliminated).
- H is present but not in position 2.
- U is absent, so we must avoid U in future guesses.
- Previously absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U. And now U is added to absent.
- Present letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), T (position 4, deduced), H (present but position unknown, not at 2).

From the deduction, T must be at position 4. So we update our pattern:
- Secret word: S _ O T _

Now, the missing letter is at position 2 and position 5.
- Position 2 must be filled with a letter that includes H? Not necessarily directly; we know H is present but not at position 2. Therefore, H must be at position 5? Let's see:
  The word has five positions: 
    Position 1: S (fixed)
    Position 2: unknown (cannot be H because H(-) at position 2)
    Position 3: O (fixed)
    Position 4: T (deduced fixed)
    Position 5: unknown

But H is present and cannot be at position 2 or at position 1 or 3 (since they are filled). Therefore, H must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? 
We have only five positions. H cannot be at position 2, and positions 1 and 3 are taken by S and O, so H must be at position 4 or 5. But position 4 is now T, so H must be at position 5? Let's confirm.

H can be at position 4? But position 4 is T. Unless there is a duplicate? But we don't know.

In Guess 3 SHOUT, position 4 was U and it was absent (U(x)), and position 5 was T and we got T(-). Since T(-) at position 5, T is present but not at 5. Therefore, T must be at position 4 because 2 is also ruled out.

Given that, the word must have H present, and it cannot be at position 2. The only positions left are 5? Position 4 is now T, so yes, H must be at position 5? Or could there be duplicates? For example, could H be at position 4? But position 4 is T, so no, unless we have duplicate T? But T is at position 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is T, and H is present, so the only place for H is position 5? Because position 2 cannot have H.

So let's assume H must be at position 5. Therefore, the secret word would be S _ O T H ?

But we haven't tested H at position 5. Is it possible?

Alternatively, H might not be at position 5; it could be that position 2 can be H? No, because in SHOUT, H was at position 2 and got (-), meaning H is not at position 2. And position 4 is T, position 1 S, position 3 O, so the only available position for H is position 5. Therefore, the secret word must end with H? So pattern: S ? O T H

Now, what about the letter at position 2? We need a letter that has not been tested and is not absent.

Moreover, we need to confirm if H is at position 5 and what the position 2 letter is.

But for our next guess, since we think the pattern is S ? O T H and H at position 5, we should try to find a word that fits S ? O T H.

What can be at position 2? It has to be a letter not absent and not used elsewhere? We have tested S, O, T, H. Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form S * O T H where * is one of the available letters.

Common possibilities: 
- SMOTH? Not a word.
- SLOTH: S L O T H -> this is the word we considered earlier.

SLOTH is a word: S L O T H.

L is available, not absent.

Other words: SPOTH? Not word. SNOTH? Not common. SWOTH? No.

So ""SLOTH"" is a candidate. And L hasn't been tested, so it would give new information.

But note: if the secret word is ""SLOTH"", then our guess would be SHOUT previously, which had U absent and H at position 2 wrong but present. And O at position 3 correct. S correct. T at position 5 wrong, but present.

In ""SLOTH"": S at 1, L at 2, O at 3, T at 4, H at 5.

But we thought H should be at position 5? Yes.

So let me confirm: with pattern S L O T H.

For position 2: L. We haven't tested L.

If we guess ""SLOTH"", here's what we expect:
- Position 1: S(✓) (fixed)
- Position 2: L (?) 
- Position 3: O(✓) (fixed)
- Position 4: T(✓) (since we deduced T at position 4)
- Position 5: H(?) 

Since H must be at position 5, we might get H(✓) at 5.

But L might be the letter at position 2.

If L is not present, we get L(x), and then we know position 2 is something else.

But the only other possibility is that H might be duplicated? But our deduction: H is present and can only be at position 5, so unless there's a duplicate, position 2 must be a single letter.

For example, if ""SLOTH"" is not the word, what else? Say ""STOAT"" but T duplicate? S T O A T? A absent? No.

""SHOWY"" but no T, etc.

I think ""SLOTH"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to consider that in SHOUT, H was marked as (-) at position 2, meaning H is in the word but not at 2. That doesn't imply H is at another specific position, only that it exists.

Therefore, for the pattern S ? O T _, H must be at position 5 because position 4 is T, and positions 1,3 are fixed, so position 5 is the only spot left? Unless duplicates: I think we should allow for the possibility that H is at a different position? No, because all positions: pos1 S, pos3 O, pos4 T, pos5 must be H? Or pos2 could be something else and pos5 something else, but H must be somewhere.

Positions:
Pos1: S (fixed)
Pos2: unknown, cannot be H
Pos3: O (fixed)
Pos4: T (fixed, as deduced)
Pos5: must be H? Or there might be a duplicate? But T is fixed at pos4, so if H is present, it must be at pos5? Because pos2 cannot have H, and the others are occupied.

Therefore, the secret word must be S ? O T H.

So we guess ""SLOTH"" as the next word, with position 2 being L.

If it's incorrect, we will get feedback on L.

If L is in the word or not.

Since L is untested, this guess covers it.

Other possibilities? Words like ""SMOOTH"" too long? No.

""S V O T H"" not a word.

So ""SLOTH"" seems the best option.

Therefore, next guess: SLOTH

But in terms of the response format: we need to output the guess.

So I will go with ""SLOTH"".Based on cumulative feedback:

- **From Guess 1 (RAISE):**  
  - S is present (wrong position then).  
  - R, A, I, E absent.  

- **From Guess 2 (STOCK):**  
  - S, O confirmed in positions 1 and 3.  
  - T present (not position 2).  
  - C, K absent.  

- **From Guess 3 (SHOUT):**  
  - S, O reconfirmed.  
  - H present (not position 2).  
  - U absent.  
  - T present but not position 5.  

**Critical Inferences:**  
1. **Pattern:** Secret word is S _ O _ _  
   Positions:  
   - 1: S (fixed)  
   - 3: O (fixed)  
   - Position 2: Cannot be H, and cannot be any absent letter.  
   - Position 4 and 5: Unknown, but T must be present.  

2. **T's Position:**  
   - T cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3), leaving only position 4 available.  
   - **Thus, position 4 is T.**  
   - Updated pattern: S _ O T _  

3. **H's Position:**  
   - H must be present (from Guess 3) but cannot be in position 2 (same feedback).  
   - With positions 1 (S), 3 (O), 4 (T) occupied, H must be in position 5.  
   - **Thus, position 5 should be H.**  
   - Final pattern: S _ O T H  

4. **Solving Position 2:**  
   - Only position 2 remains unknown.  
   - Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U.  
   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested consonants/vowels).  
   - Common letters to test: L (high frequency).  
   - Must form a valid English word of the form S ? O T H.  

**Valid Candidate:**  
- ""SLOTH"" is the most probable word fitting the pattern:  
  - S L O T H positions: 1=S, 2=L, 3=O, 4=T, 5=H.  
- Alternatives are rare or invalid (e.g., ""SMOTH"", not a word).

**Reasoning:**  
- Guessing ""SLOTH"" tests L in position 2. If correct, it should yield all ✓. If L is absent or wrong, feedback will reveal more.

### Step-by-Step Analysis for Next Guess

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE**  
     Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
     → S is in the secret word (wrong position), R, A, I, E are absent.
     - Key: Only S exists; not in position 4.

   - **Guess 2: STOCK**  
     Feedback: S(✓), T(-), O(✓), C(x), K(x)  
     → S at position 1 (confirmed), O at position 3 (confirmed), T exists but not in position 2, C and K absent.
     - Pattern: Secret word is S _ O _ _ (positions 1 and 3 fixed).
     - T is present and must be in position 4 or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).

   - **Guess 3: SHOUT**  
     Feedback: S(✓), H(-), O(✓), U(x), T(-)  
     → S and O reconfirmed, H exists but not in position 2, U absent, T exists but not in position 5.
     - T cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3), so **T must be in position 4** (only remaining option).
     - Pattern: Updated to S _ O T _ (position 4 fixed as T).

2. **Deductions from Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, C, K, U (must avoid these).
   - **Present Letters**: 
     - S, O, T (positions fixed: 1, 3, 4).
     - H is present but not in position 2.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - The secret word pattern is S * O T * (where position 2 is unknown, position 5 unknown).
     - H must be placed somewhere; positions 1 (S), 3 (O), and 4 (T) are occupied, so **H must be in position 5** (since position 2 is invalid for H).
     - Final pattern: **S * O T H** (position 5 fixed as H).
   - **Solving Position 2**:  
     - Only position 2 is unknown; it cannot be absent letters, S, O, T, or H (since H not in position 2).  
     - Available letters for testing: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
     - We need a common English word matching S _ O T H.

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Candidate Word**: ""SLOTH"" fits the pattern:  
     - S (position 1), L (position 2), O (position 3), T (position 4), H (position 5).  
     - Tests L, which isn't in the absent list and is a common consonant.  
     - If correct, all letters match; if not, feedback on L will confirm/reject it for position 2 or reveal duplications.  
   - Alternatives (rare/scarce): Words like ""SOUTH"" violate pattern (position 3 isn't O), ""SNOTH"" invalid. ""SLOTH"" is optimal.

<guess>SLOTH</guess>",SLOTH,"We have new feedback from Guess 3: SHOUT -> S(✓) H(-) O(✓) U(x) T(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- S(✓): Position 1 is S, which we already knew and is confirmed correctly placed.
- H(-): H is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓): Position 3 is O, which we already knew.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 5.

Recall what we know so far:
- Secret word pattern: S _ O _ _ 
  (positions: 1=S, 2=unknown, 3=O, 4=unknown, 5=unknown)
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 2) and now not in position 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, T must be in position 4 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken, and 2 and 5 are eliminated).
- H is present but not in position 2.
- U is absent, so we must avoid U in future guesses.
- Previously absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U. And now U is added to absent.
- Present letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), T (position 4, deduced), H (present but position unknown, not at 2).

From the deduction, T must be at position 4. So we update our pattern:
- Secret word: S _ O T _

Now, the missing letter is at position 2 and position 5.
- Position 2 must be filled with a letter that includes H? Not necessarily directly; we know H is present but not at position 2. Therefore, H must be at position 5? Let's see:
  The word has five positions:

    Position 3: O (fixed)
    Position 4: T (deduced fixed)
    Position 5: unknown

But H is present and cannot be at position 2 or at position 1 or 3 (since they are filled). Therefore, H must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? 
We have only five positions. H cannot be at position 2, and positions 1 and 3 are taken by S and O, so H must be at position 4 or 5. But position 4 is now T, so H must be at position 5? Let's confirm.

H can be at position 4? But position 4 is T. Unless there is a duplicate? But we don't know.

In Guess 3 SHOUT, position 4 was U and it was absent (U(x)), and position 5 was T and we got T(-). Since T(-) at position 5, T is present but not at 5. Therefore, T must be at position 4 because 2 is also ruled out.

Given that, the word must have H present, and it cannot be at position 2. The only positions left are 5? Position 4 is now T, so yes, H must be at position 5? Or could there be duplicates? For example, could H be at position 4? But position 4 is T, so no, unless we have duplicate T? But T is at position 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is T, and H is present, so the only place for H is position 5? Because position 2 cannot have H.

So let's assume H must be at position 5. Therefore, the secret word would be S _ O T H ?

But we haven't tested H at position 5. Is it possible?

Alternatively, H might not be at position 5; it could be that position 2 can be H? No, because in SHOUT, H was at position 2 and got (-), meaning H is not at position 2. And position 4 is T, position 1 S, position 3 O, so the only available position for H is position 5. Therefore, the secret word must end with H? So pattern: S ? O T H

Now, what about the letter at position 2? We need a letter that has not been tested and is not absent.

Moreover, we need to confirm if H is at position 5 and what the position 2 letter is.

But for our next guess, since we think the pattern is S ? O T H and H at position 5, we should try to find a word that fits S ? O T H.

So ""SLOTH"" is a candidate. And L hasn't been tested, so it would give new information.

But note: if the secret word is ""SLOTH"", then our guess would be SHOUT previously, which had U absent and H at position 2 wrong but present. And O at position 3 correct. S correct. T at position 5 wrong, but present.

In ""SLOTH"": S at 1, L at 2, O at 3, T at 4, H at 5.

But we thought H should be at position 5? Yes.

So let me confirm: with pattern S L O T H.

For position 2: L. We haven't tested L.

If we guess ""SLOTH"", here's what we expect:
- Position 1: S(✓) (fixed)
- Position 2: L (?) 
- Position 3: O(✓) (fixed)
- Position 4: T(✓) (since we deduced T at position 4)
- Position 5: H(?) 

Since H must be at position 5, we might get H(✓) at 5.

But L might be the letter at position 2.

If L is not present, we get L(x), and then we know position 2 is something else.

But the only other possibility is that H might be duplicated? But our deduction: H is present and can only be at position 5, so unless there's a duplicate, position 2 must be a single letter.

For example, if ""SLOTH"" is not the word, what else? Say ""STOAT"" but T duplicate? S T O A T? A absent? No.

""SHOWY"" but no T, etc.

I think ""SLOTH"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to consider that in SHOUT, H was marked as (-) at position 2, meaning H is in the word but not at 2. That doesn't imply H is at another specific position, only that it exists.

Therefore, for the pattern S ? O T _, H must be at position 5 because position 4 is T, and positions 1,3 are fixed, so position 5 is the only spot left? Unless duplicates: I think we should allow for the possibility that H is at a different position? No, because all positions: pos1 S, pos3 O, pos4 T, pos5 must be H?

Therefore, the secret word must be S ? O T H.

If it's incorrect, we will get feedback on L.

If L is in the word or not.

Since L is untested, this guess covers it.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we might choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, R, N, L, etc.

One of the common starting words is ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of many letters.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular.

But note: We are allowed to use any English word. Let's go with ""CRANE"" today because it has C, R, A, N, E which are also common.

However, let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has more vowels.I'll start with a common strategy: choose a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize the information gained from the first guess. For this, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). This combination often helps identify several letters or their positions early on. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will reveal valuable clues for the next guess.

- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since we guessed S in the 4th and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must have S somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Now, for our next guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it exists) but in a different position than 4.
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E because they are not in the word.
- We want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters to try: consonants like T, N, O, L, and vowels like O, U (since A,E,I are out).

We also have to avoid R, A, I, E.

Possible words that include S:

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, let's consider putting S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

But note: we don't know which position S is in, so we can try to put it in a position we haven't tried yet.

We tried ""RAISE"" which had S in position 4.

Let's try a word with S in position 1.

Also, we shouldn't use R,A,I,E.

A candidate: ""STOMP"" - but wait, we need common letters.

""S"" at the start: possible words: SHOWY, SNOWY, but let's avoid Y if possible? But we don't know.

A better word might be ""SONGS"" but that has two S's? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since we only know one S is present, we should not assume duplicates. But ""SONGS"" would test S in position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is wrong for S, but if we put S in position 4 again, it will still be wrong? We already know S is not in position 4, so repeating it might not be efficient.

Actually, the feedback said S is in wrong position, so if we put S in position 4 again, it would still be wrong position if the correct position isn't 4. But to avoid wasting a slot, we can put S in a different position.

So for next guess, we should avoid position 4 for S and put it in one of 1,2,3,5.

Also, we need a word that contains S and other letters we haven't tried yet.

List of available letters: We can use B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding R,A,I,E).

Common among these: T, N, L, O, etc.

Let me think of words:

- S in position 1: SLATE? But A and E are out. SLATE has A and E which we know are not present. So avoid.

So we need to avoid A,E,I,R.

S in position 1: SOULS? No, duplicate S and U,L,S.

Better: ""STUNK"" - S at 1, T,U,N,K. But U and N are new. K is new.

But let's see: STUNK: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),K(5).

We know position 4 had S in first guess, but now we are putting N in position 4? We haven't tested N before.

Another idea: ""SONLY"" but Y might be less common.

Another: ""STOCK"" - S(1),T(2),O(3),C(4),K(5). This avoids A,E,I,R. Let's use that.

But O is a vowel, good to test.

But we also have feedback about S being in the word. In ""STOCK"", S is at position 1.

If we put S at position 1 and it is correct, we get ✓ for S. If not, we might get - or x, but we know S is somewhere else.

But we need to maximize information.

Another possibility: since S must be somewhere from 1,2,3,5, we can try S at position 1 and 5 simultaneously? But we have to guess one word.

What about words with S at the end? Like in position 5.

For example: ""PLOTS"" - P,L,O,T,S. S at position 5.

This tests P,L,O,T, and S at 5.

But P and L are new, O and T are common.

Similarly, ""CULTS"" - but C,U,L,T,S.

Since our first word had S at 4, and now we move it to another position to see.

But to be systematic.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains S and four other new letters.

For example: ""SCOLD"" - S(1),C(2),O(3),L(4),D(5). Avoid A,E,I,R. But L is at position 4. However, we know position 4 in the secret word is not S (from first guess) so it could be something else.

But in ""RAISE"", position 4 was S and we got wrong position, so the correct letter at position 4 is something else.

In ""SCOLD"", we put L at position 4, which might be correct or not.

But let's see which letters are covered.

Since we only have one known letter S, and it must be in position 1,2,3, or 5, I think putting S at position 1 is a good idea.

Let me go with ""STOCK"": it has S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, C at 4, K at 5.

All letters are new except S.

We avoid R,A,I,E.

If the word is ""STOCK"", it would be perfect, but we don't know.

But likely not, but we get information.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" - S(1),H(2),O(3),W(4),N(5). H and W are less common? But let's try.

I think ""STOCK"" is fine.

But let's consider that in the first guess, S was not in position 4, so if the correct position is 1, then in ""STOCK"" we get S(1) ✓. If it's position 2, we might get S(-) only if S is at position 2 but we have it at 1? We'll get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if S is at position 2, putting it at position 1 will show as wrong position.

So I'll go with ""STOCK"".

But let me write it down.

Guess: STOCK

But wait, let's ensure it's valid: STOCK is a word.

Yes.

Another option: ""SLICK"" - but L and I, but I is out. Cannot, because I is not allowed.

I not in word? Yes, we know I is not in the word.

So SLICK has I, which we know is absent? So invalid to include I? Because we know I is not in the word, so we must not use letters we know are absent? Actually, that's correct strategy. We avoid letters known absent.

Similarly, avoiding R,A,I,E.

So STOCK: S,T,O,C,K all not in R,A,I,E and are possible.

Similarly, SHOWN: S,H,O,W,N - all possible.

But I think STOCK is fine.

But let me consider: in STOCK, position 4 is C. But we already know position 4 isn't S. But we can test C there.

Since S is the only known letter, we might want to test its position.

Another word: ""SULLY"" but U,Y and L? Has L, but also duplicate L? S has to be included.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but no S. We must include S because it's the only known letter, and we want to find its position.

So we need a word that includes S.

So STOCK: S at 1, includes O, T, C, K.

Similarly, ""SKIMP"" - S at 1, K,I? I is out, cannot use.

""SCALP"" has A, which is out.

""SONIC"" has O,N,I,C? But I is out.

Avoid I.

SONIC has I? S-O-N-I-C. Yes, I is position 4? S-O-N-I-C? S(1),O(2),N(3),I(4),C(5). But I is forbidden, so we cannot use SONIC because I is not in the secret word.

Must avoid excluded letters.

So STOCK is good: S-T-O-C-K. No excluded letters.

Another: ""SMOCK"" - similar.

But I'll go with STOCK.

S at position 1.

But we don't know if position 1 is S or not.

Perhaps put S at a different position to sample.

For example, to test position 1 separately, I could put another letter at position 1 and S elsewhere.

But since we don't know, either way.

Perhaps to maximize position coverage.

In first guess, positions 1-2-3-4-5 had R-A-I-S-E all excluded except S which is wrong in 4.

So we have no info on positions 1,2,3,5 except that they are not S? No, position 4 was S and wrong, but positions 1,2,3,5 could have S if not 4.

But S is somewhere else.

Now, putting S at position 1: if S is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get - if it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S at 5, same thing.

But besides S, we test T,O,C,K, which are common.

I think ""STOCK"" is a reasonable guess.Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"", we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
- The letters R, A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

This means:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, or E in our next guess.
- S must be included in the guess but in a position other than 4th (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- We should test new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess, ""STOCK"" is chosen because:
- It includes S in the 1st position to test if S belongs there.
- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.

If S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.

<guess>STOCK</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses.

First guess ""RAISE"" feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
- This told us that S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- Also, R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Second guess ""STOCK"" feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
- S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1. This overrides the earlier feedback about position; now we know S is at position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 3 and correct.
- T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(x) means C is not in the word.
- K(x) means K is not in the word.

So from the feedback so far:

- **Known correct positions:**
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 3: O

- **Present letters but wrong position:**
  - T is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2.

- **Absent letters:**
  - R, A, I, E, C, K are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we knew S was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 1, so no issue.

The word structure is: S _ O _ _

We know T is present but not at position 2. So T must be at position 4 or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include T in position 4 or 5 to discover where it is.
- Avoid letters R, A, I, E, C, K.
- We need to choose letters for position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5) that haven't been tested and aren't absent.

Known absent letters: S is present but already placed, actually S is fixed at position 1 so no issue. But we used S and O.

Letters we haven't tested: many consonants and vowels. But vowels: A, E, I are out, so remaining vowels are O (already placed at 3, but O might not be duplicate?), U, and possibly Y.

O is at position 3 and fixed, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere? Not necessarily.

Other vowels: U, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: we need letters not in the absent list.

Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T (used but present), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But T is present and must be included.

The word is S _ O _ _

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: unknown
3: O (fixed)
4: could be T or something else?
5: could be T or other?

T is in the word and not at 2, so it must be at 4 or 5.

We should test T in one of these positions and new letters elsewhere.

For position 2, we need a letter that hasn't been tested and not absent.

Also, we should avoid using multiple absent letters.

Let me think of possible words.

Word pattern: S ? O ? ? 

With T required in positions 4 or 5.

First, option: put T at position 4.

Then the word would be S ? O T ?

Position 2 is unknown, and position 5 needs a letter.

What letters can we use? B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to get information. For example, L, N, U, M.

So possible word: ""SOLT"" ... but needs 5 letters. S ? O T _

Say ""S O L T Y"" but position 2 is missing.

Word: Position 2 must be a letter.

For example: if T is at 4, then ""S"" + letter2 + ""O"" + ""T"" + letter5.

What word exists? Like ""SPOUT"" – S P O U T? But U is a vowel, available.

SPOUT: S(1), P(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But if we put T at position 4? No, we want T at position 4? T(-) was position 2 in guess 2, so T can be at 4.

But in ""SPOUT"", U is at 4 and T at 5? Oh, I mispositioned.

If T is at position 4, then word: S ? O T ?

For example: ""S L O T S"" but duplicate S? Not necessarily duplicated.

But better to have distinct letters to test more.

Is S duplicated? We don't know; probably not, but possible.

But safe to assume no dup unless indicated.

Similarly, O at position 3, might not duplicate.

So ""S?OT?"" words: ""SILOT"" not word. ""SPOT"": but 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Common words: How about ""SHOUT"": S H O U T? Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). T is at position 5, not 4.

But we are considering T at position 4 or 5 separately.

First, suppose we put T at position 4. What words? ""S"" + X + ""O"" + ""T"" + Y.

For example: ""SCOTE"" not word. ""STOIC"" has I and C? Out. ""STOMP"" has M, P? S(1) T(2) O(3) M(4) P(5)? But T is at position 2, but T(-) in guess 2 was at position 2, so T cannot be at pos 2? Correct, T cannot be at pos 2.

If we have T at position 4, word: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:O, 4:T, 5:?

So: S ? O T ?

Examples: ""S M O T H"" – SMOTH not a word; it's SMOTE? SMOTE has E? E absent. ""S L O T H"" – SLOTH is a word: S L O T H? But TH at end? S(1), L(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). Yes, SLOTH.

But H? We haven't tested H.

Similarly, ""S P O T S"" SPOTS has S duplicate? S at 1 and 5? We don't know if duplicate exists.

But let's avoid for now.

Similarly, ""SHOTE"" has E absent.

""SWOPS"" has S twice.

Perhaps ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? But T is at position 5.

For T at position 4, ""S NOT ?"" hard.

""BESOT"" but has E absent.

Perhaps not many common words with S? O T pattern?

Another idea: put T at position 5 instead.

Then word: S ? O ? T

For example, ""S H O T T"" duplicate T? Not.

""SHOOT"" – S H O O T? Duplicate O? O is at position 3, and position 4 would be O again? Possible.

But let's see: SHOOT has O at position 3 and 4? But position 3 is O, but position 4 would be O duplicate.

We might test that.

But we want to test new letters.

Perhaps ""S O L U T"" not word.

""SPLOT"" not word.

Common words: ""SCOUT"" – S C O U T? But C is absent? C(x) from second guess, so C not in word. Cannot use C.

Second feedback: C(x), so C absent.

Similarly, K absent.

So SCOUT has C, invalid.

""SHOUT"" – S H O U T, positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. So T at 5, U at 4.

H and U untested.

Similarly, ""SCOWL"" has C, absent.

""STOOP"" – S T O O P? But T at position 2, which is forbidden? T cannot be at pos 2 because we have T(-) at pos 2 from guess 2.

In STOOP, T is at 2, which would be wrong position again? But we cannot put T at pos 2.

Similarly, ""STOUT"" has T at position 2? S T O U T? Position 2: T, which is forbidden.

So we cannot have T at position 2.

Therefore, for our guess, position 2 must not be T; T must be at 4 or 5.

Therefore, back to patterns:

Option 1: T at position 4: word S ? O T ? 

Like ""SLOTH"": S L O T H

Option 2: T at position 5: word S ? O ? T

Like ""SHOUT"": S H O U T

""SHOUT"" tests H and U, and puts T at 5.

Similarly, other words: ""SMOUT"" not word.

""GLOUT"" not common.

""TROUT"" has T at start but position 1 is S, cannot.

So ""SHOUT"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? N and U tested.

But N is common.

We also have to consider that T might be at position 4 or 5, so by guessing one, we can confirm.

Moreover, for position 2, we can use a common letter like H or N or L.

In ""SHOUT"", we get to test:

Position 1: S (should be correct, already fixed)
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: U
Position 5: T

If we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) U(?) T(?) 

If T is at position 5 and correct, we get T(✓) at 5. If not, we might know T is at position 4.

Similarly, U might be present or not.

But we also cover position 4 with U.

Another possibility: ""S O L V T"" not word.

Or ""PIOUS"" but S at end and O at position 3, but position 1 would be P? Not matching.

I think ""SHOUT"" or ""SLOTH"" are candidates.

But in ""SLOTH"", T is at position 4: S L O T H

If we guess this, and T is at position 4, we get T(✓), else if not, we might get T(-) if it's elsewhere, but we know only position 5 possible? Since position 2 forbidden and position 3 fixed.

Position 3 is O fixed, so T can only be at 4 or 5.

So if we guess SLOTH with T at 4:
- If T is at 4, we get T(✓)
- If T is at 5, we get T(-) for position 4? And feedback for position 4 wrong.

Similarly for SHOUT.

Perhaps choose one that test more common letters.

""SHOUT"" tests H, U, and T at 5.
""SLOTH"" tests L, H, and T at 4.

L and H are both useful.

Another word: ""SMITH"" has I absent? I not allowed.

""SWOOP"" has W,O,O? Duplicate O? And O fixed at 3, so position 4 O? Possible but less common.

""S Y L P H"" not word.

Perhaps ""SOUTH"": S O U T H? But O at position 3, so ""S"" + position2 + ""U"" + ""O""? No.

SOUTH: S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But in our pattern, position 3 must be O fixed, here O is at position 2? Not matching pattern.

Our pattern must have position 3 as O.

So SOUTH cannot be because position 2 would be O? No, actually if word is SOUTH, position 2 is O, but we know position 3 is O, so if O is fixed at position 3, then position 2 cannot be O? Unless duplicate.

But O might duplicate? Possible.

For example, word like ""FOOLS"" position 3 O? But let's forget.

Back to S?O? with T at end or middle.

I think ""SHOUT"" is a good choice: S H O U T

Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

This tests H at position 2, U at position 4, T at position 5.

If T is actually at position 4, we will get:
- Position 5: T might be absent or something? But T present, so if T is at 4, then position 4 T, position 5 U? U might be absent.

Similarly, vice versa.

But by guessing, we learn the position of T and whether H and U are present.

Moreover, if T is not at 5, we know it must be at 4.

Similarly, other options.

To avoid U which is less common, but vowel needed possibly.

Another word: ""SHOTT"" not word.

"" S T O P E "" has E absent and T at position 2 forbidden.

Cannot.

"" S L O P E "" E absent.

So ""SHOUT"" seems reasonable.

Similarly, ""SNOUT"" same structure: S N O U T

But N instead of H.

Both fine.

Also ""SCOUT"" has C absent, invalid.

So let's choose ""SHOUT"".

But in SHOUT, position 4 and 5: U and T.

We test both.

If T is at position 5, it will be correct. If T is at position 4, then position 5 U might be wrong if U not present.

But we will get feedback.

Similarly for H at position 2.

So I think it's a good guess.

Since position 3 O is fixed, and position 1 S fixed, we only have positions 2,4,5 to determine.

And T must be at 4 or 5.

By putting T at 5, and U at 4, we test both positions.

If U is present, we get info; if not, absent.

Similarly H at position 2.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
    - R, A, I, E are absent from the word.

- **Guess 2: STOCK** → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in position 1 (correct).  
    - O is in position 3 (correct).  
    - T is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and K are absent.  

**Current knowledge:**  
- The secret word has the pattern: S _ O _ _  
  - Position 1: S (fixed).  
  - Position 3: O (fixed).  
- T must be present but not in position 2 (since it was a wrong-position match in guess 2). Given positions 1 and 3 are occupied, T must be in position 4 or 5.  
- Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K (avoid these).  
- Untested common letters: Focus on consonants like H, L, N, U, etc., as vowels A, E, I are out (only O is confirmed, U/Y may be viable).  

**Strategy for the next guess:**  
- Must include T to determine its position (either 4 or 5).  
- Test new common letters in position 2 and the remaining positions (4 or 5) to maximize information:  
  - Position 2: Untested and not absent (e.g., H, L, N).  
  - Position 4 or 5: Untested and not absent, depending on T's placement.  
- Preferred word choice:  
  - ""SHOUT"" fits perfectly: S H O U T.  
    - Tests T in position 5 (if T is here, it should be correct; if not, T must be in position 4).  
    - Tests H in position 2, and U in position 4—both untested and common.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
- Alternative words considered (like ""SNOUT"" or ""SLOTH"") but ""SHOUT"" is prioritized for its simplicity and coverage.  

**Expected outcomes from guessing ""SHOUT"":**  
- If T is at position 5: Feedback should show T(✓).  
- If T is at position 4: Feedback may show T(-) for position 5, confirming T must be at position 4.  
- If H is in the word, feedback will indicate its position correctness or presence (✓ or -).  
- If U is in the word, feedback will similarly indicate its status.

<guess>SHOUT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: SHOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(-) O(✓) U(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have new feedback from Guess 3: SHOUT -> S(✓) H(-) O(✓) U(x) T(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- S(✓): Position 1 is S, which we already knew and is confirmed correctly placed.
- H(-): H is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓): Position 3 is O, which we already knew.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 5.

Recall what we know so far:
- Secret word pattern: S _ O _ _ 
  (positions: 1=S, 2=unknown, 3=O, 4=unknown, 5=unknown)
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 2) and now not in position 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, T must be in position 4 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken, and 2 and 5 are eliminated).
- H is present but not in position 2.
- U is absent, so we must avoid U in future guesses.
- Previously absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U. And now U is added to absent.
- Present letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), T (position 4, deduced), H (present but position unknown, not at 2).

From the deduction, T must be at position 4. So we update our pattern:
- Secret word: S _ O T _

Now, the missing letter is at position 2 and position 5.
- Position 2 must be filled with a letter that includes H? Not necessarily directly; we know H is present but not at position 2. Therefore, H must be at position 5? Let's see:
  The word has five positions: 
    Position 1: S (fixed)
    Position 2: unknown (cannot be H because H(-) at position 2)
    Position 3: O (fixed)
    Position 4: T (deduced fixed)
    Position 5: unknown

But H is present and cannot be at position 2 or at position 1 or 3 (since they are filled). Therefore, H must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? 
We have only five positions. H cannot be at position 2, and positions 1 and 3 are taken by S and O, so H must be at position 4 or 5. But position 4 is now T, so H must be at position 5? Let's confirm.

H can be at position 4? But position 4 is T. Unless there is a duplicate? But we don't know.

In Guess 3 SHOUT, position 4 was U and it was absent (U(x)), and position 5 was T and we got T(-). Since T(-) at position 5, T is present but not at 5. Therefore, T must be at position 4 because 2 is also ruled out.

Given that, the word must have H present, and it cannot be at position 2. The only positions left are 5? Position 4 is now T, so yes, H must be at position 5? Or could there be duplicates? For example, could H be at position 4? But position 4 is T, so no, unless we have duplicate T? But T is at position 4.

But in the pattern, position 4 is T, and H is present, so the only place for H is position 5? Because position 2 cannot have H.

So let's assume H must be at position 5. Therefore, the secret word would be S _ O T H ?

But we haven't tested H at position 5. Is it possible?

Alternatively, H might not be at position 5; it could be that position 2 can be H? No, because in SHOUT, H was at position 2 and got (-), meaning H is not at position 2. And position 4 is T, position 1 S, position 3 O, so the only available position for H is position 5. Therefore, the secret word must end with H? So pattern: S ? O T H

Now, what about the letter at position 2? We need a letter that has not been tested and is not absent.

Moreover, we need to confirm if H is at position 5 and what the position 2 letter is.

But for our next guess, since we think the pattern is S ? O T H and H at position 5, we should try to find a word that fits S ? O T H.

What can be at position 2? It has to be a letter not absent and not used elsewhere? We have tested S, O, T, H. Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form S * O T H where * is one of the available letters.

Common possibilities: 
- SMOTH? Not a word.
- SLOTH: S L O T H -> this is the word we considered earlier.

SLOTH is a word: S L O T H.

L is available, not absent.

Other words: SPOTH? Not word. SNOTH? Not common. SWOTH? No.

So ""SLOTH"" is a candidate. And L hasn't been tested, so it would give new information.

But note: if the secret word is ""SLOTH"", then our guess would be SHOUT previously, which had U absent and H at position 2 wrong but present. And O at position 3 correct. S correct. T at position 5 wrong, but present.

In ""SLOTH"": S at 1, L at 2, O at 3, T at 4, H at 5.

But we thought H should be at position 5? Yes.

So let me confirm: with pattern S L O T H.

For position 2: L. We haven't tested L.

If we guess ""SLOTH"", here's what we expect:
- Position 1: S(✓) (fixed)
- Position 2: L (?) 
- Position 3: O(✓) (fixed)
- Position 4: T(✓) (since we deduced T at position 4)
- Position 5: H(?) 

Since H must be at position 5, we might get H(✓) at 5.

But L might be the letter at position 2.

If L is not present, we get L(x), and then we know position 2 is something else.

But the only other possibility is that H might be duplicated? But our deduction: H is present and can only be at position 5, so unless there's a duplicate, position 2 must be a single letter.

For example, if ""SLOTH"" is not the word, what else? Say ""STOAT"" but T duplicate? S T O A T? A absent? No.

""SHOWY"" but no T, etc.

I think ""SLOTH"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to consider that in SHOUT, H was marked as (-) at position 2, meaning H is in the word but not at 2. That doesn't imply H is at another specific position, only that it exists.

Therefore, for the pattern S ? O T _, H must be at position 5 because position 4 is T, and positions 1,3 are fixed, so position 5 is the only spot left? Unless duplicates: I think we should allow for the possibility that H is at a different position? No, because all positions: pos1 S, pos3 O, pos4 T, pos5 must be H? Or pos2 could be something else and pos5 something else, but H must be somewhere.

Positions:
Pos1: S (fixed)
Pos2: unknown, cannot be H
Pos3: O (fixed)
Pos4: T (fixed, as deduced)
Pos5: must be H? Or there might be a duplicate? But T is fixed at pos4, so if H is present, it must be at pos5? Because pos2 cannot have H, and the others are occupied.

Therefore, the secret word must be S ? O T H.

So we guess ""SLOTH"" as the next word, with position 2 being L.

If it's incorrect, we will get feedback on L.

If L is in the word or not.

Since L is untested, this guess covers it.

Other possibilities? Words like ""SMOOTH"" too long? No.

""S V O T H"" not a word.

So ""SLOTH"" seems the best option.

Therefore, next guess: SLOTH

But in terms of the response format: we need to output the guess.

So I will go with ""SLOTH"".Based on cumulative feedback:

- **From Guess 1 (RAISE):**  
  - S is present (wrong position then).  
  - R, A, I, E absent.  

- **From Guess 2 (STOCK):**  
  - S, O confirmed in positions 1 and 3.  
  - T present (not position 2).  
  - C, K absent.  

- **From Guess 3 (SHOUT):**  
  - S, O reconfirmed.  
  - H present (not position 2).  
  - U absent.  
  - T present but not position 5.  

**Critical Inferences:**  
1. **Pattern:** Secret word is S _ O _ _  
   Positions:  
   - 1: S (fixed)  
   - 3: O (fixed)  
   - Position 2: Cannot be H, and cannot be any absent letter.  
   - Position 4 and 5: Unknown, but T must be present.  

2. **T's Position:**  
   - T cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3), leaving only position 4 available.  
   - **Thus, position 4 is T.**  
   - Updated pattern: S _ O T _  

3. **H's Position:**  
   - H must be present (from Guess 3) but cannot be in position 2 (same feedback).  
   - With positions 1 (S), 3 (O), 4 (T) occupied, H must be in position 5.  
   - **Thus, position 5 should be H.**  
   - Final pattern: S _ O T H  

4. **Solving Position 2:**  
   - Only position 2 remains unknown.  
   - Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U.  
   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested consonants/vowels).  
   - Common letters to test: L (high frequency).  
   - Must form a valid English word of the form S ? O T H.  

**Valid Candidate:**  
- ""SLOTH"" is the most probable word fitting the pattern:  
  - S L O T H positions: 1=S, 2=L, 3=O, 4=T, 5=H.  
- Alternatives are rare or invalid (e.g., ""SMOTH"", not a word).

**Reasoning:**  
- Guessing ""SLOTH"" tests L in position 2. If correct, it should yield all ✓. If L is absent or wrong, feedback will reveal more.

<guess>SLOTH</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis for Next Guess

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE**  
     Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
     → S is in the secret word (wrong position), R, A, I, E are absent.
     - Key: Only S exists; not in position 4.

   - **Guess 2: STOCK**  
     Feedback: S(✓), T(-), O(✓), C(x), K(x)  
     → S at position 1 (confirmed), O at position 3 (confirmed), T exists but not in position 2, C and K absent.
     - Pattern: Secret word is S _ O _ _ (positions 1 and 3 fixed).
     - T is present and must be in position 4 or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).

   - **Guess 3: SHOUT**  
     Feedback: S(✓), H(-), O(✓), U(x), T(-)  
     → S and O reconfirmed, H exists but not in position 2, U absent, T exists but not in position 5.
     - T cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3), so **T must be in position 4** (only remaining option).
     - Pattern: Updated to S _ O T _ (position 4 fixed as T).

2. **Deductions from Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, C, K, U (must avoid these).
   - **Present Letters**: 
     - S, O, T (positions fixed: 1, 3, 4).
     - H is present but not in position 2.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - The secret word pattern is S * O T * (where position 2 is unknown, position 5 unknown).
     - H must be placed somewhere; positions 1 (S), 3 (O), and 4 (T) are occupied, so **H must be in position 5** (since position 2 is invalid for H).
     - Final pattern: **S * O T H** (position 5 fixed as H).
   - **Solving Position 2**:  
     - Only position 2 is unknown; it cannot be absent letters, S, O, T, or H (since H not in position 2).  
     - Available letters for testing: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
     - We need a common English word matching S _ O T H.

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Candidate Word**: ""SLOTH"" fits the pattern:  
     - S (position 1), L (position 2), O (position 3), T (position 4), H (position 5).  
     - Tests L, which isn't in the absent list and is a common consonant.  
     - If correct, all letters match; if not, feedback on L will confirm/reject it for position 2 or reveal duplications.  
   - Alternatives (rare/scarce): Words like ""SOUTH"" violate pattern (position 3 isn't O), ""SNOTH"" invalid. ""SLOTH"" is optimal.

For this, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). This combination often helps identify several letters or their positions early on.

But we don\'t know.\n\nA better word might be ""SONGS"" but that has two S\'s? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But since we only know one S is present, we should not assume duplicates. But ""SONGS"" would test S in position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is wrong for S, but if we put S in position 4 again, it will still be wrong? We already know S is not in position 4, so repeating it might not be efficient.\n\nActually, the feedback said S is in wrong position, so if we put S in position 4 again, it would still be wrong position if the correct position isn\'t 4. But to avoid wasting a slot, we can put S in a different position.\n\nSo for next guess, we should avoid position 4 for S and put it in one of 1,2,3,5.\n\nAlso, we need a word that contains S and other letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nList of available letters: We can use B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding R,A,I,E).\n\nCommon among these: T, N, L, O, etc.\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- S in position 1: SLATE? But A and E are out. SLATE has A and E which we know are not present. So avoid.\n\nSo we need to avoid A,E,I,R.\n\nS in position 1: SOULS? No, duplicate S and U,L,S.\n\nBetter: ""STUNK"" - S at 1, T,U,N,K. But U and N are new. K is new.\n\nBut let\'s see: STUNK: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),K(5).\n\nWe know position 4 had S in first guess, but now we are putting N in position 4? We haven\'t tested N before.\n\nAnother idea: ""SONLY"" but Y might be less common.\n\nAnother: ""STOCK"" - S(1),T(2),O(3),C(4),K(5). This avoids A,E,I,R. Let\'s use that.\n\nBut O is a vowel, good to test.\n\nBut we also have feedback about S being in the word. In ""STOCK"", S is at position 1.\n\nIf we put S at position 1 and it is correct, we get ✓ for S. If not, we might get - or x, but we know S is somewhere else.\n\nBut we need to maximize information.\n\nAnother possibility: since S must be somewhere from 1,2,3,5, we can try S at position 1 and 5 simultaneously? But we have to guess one word.\n\nWhat about words with S at the end? Like in position 5.\n\nFor example: ""PLOTS"" - P,L,O,T,S. S at position 5.\n\nThis tests P,L,O,T, and S at 5.\n\nBut P and L are new, O and T are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""CULTS"" - but C,U,L,T,S.\n\nSince our first word had S at 4, and now we move it to another position to see.\n\nBut to be systematic.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that contains S and four other new letters.\n\nFor example: ""SCOLD"" - S(1),C(2),O(3),L(4),D(5). Avoid A,E,I,R. But L is at position 4. However, we know position 4 in the secret word is not S (from first guess) so it could be something else.\n\nBut in ""RAISE"", position 4 was S and we got wrong position, so the correct letter at position 4 is something else.\n\nIn ""SCOLD"", we put L at position 4, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut let\'s see which letters are covered.\n\nSince we only have one known letter S, and it must be in position 1,2,3, or 5, I think putting S at position 1 is a good idea.\n\nLet me go with ""STOCK"": it has S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, C at 4, K at 5.\n\nAll letters are new except S.\n\nWe avoid R,A,I,E.\n\nIf the word is ""STOCK"", it would be perfect, but we don\'t know.\n\nBut likely not, but we get information.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHOWN"" - S(1),H(2),O(3),W(4),N(5). H and W are less common? But let\'s try.\n\nI think ""STOCK"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s consider that in the first guess, S was not in position 4, so if the correct position is 1, then in ""STOCK"" we get S(1) ✓. If it\'s position 2, we might get S(-) only if S is at position 2 but we have it at 1? We\'ll get feedback accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if S is at position 2, putting it at position 1 will show as wrong position.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STOCK"".\n\nBut let me write it down.\n\nGuess: STOCK\n\nBut wait, let\'s ensure it\'s valid: STOCK is a word.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother option: ""SLICK"" - but L and I, but I is out. Cannot, because I is not allowed.\n\nI not in word? Yes, we know I is not in the word.\n\nSo SLICK has I, which we know is absent? So invalid to include I? Because we know I is not in the word, so we must not use letters we know are absent? Actually, that\'s correct strategy. We avoid letters known absent.\n\nSimilarly, avoiding R,A,I,E.\n\nSo STOCK: S,T,O,C,K all not in R,A,I,E and are possible.\n\nSimilarly, SHOWN: S,H,O,W,N - all possible.\n\nBut I think STOCK is fine.\n\nBut let me consider: in STOCK, position 4 is C. But we already know position 4 isn\'t S. But we can test C there.\n\nSince S is the only known letter, we might want to test its position.\n\nAnother word: ""SULLY"" but U,Y and L? Has L, but also duplicate L? S has to be included.\n\nPerhaps ""POINT"" but no S. We must include S because it\'s the only known letter, and we want to find its position.\n\nSo we need a word that includes S.\n\nSo STOCK: S at 1, includes O, T, C, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""SKIMP"" - S at 1, K,I? I is out, cannot use.\n\n""SCALP"" has A, which is out.\n\n""SONIC"" has O,N,I,C? But I is out.\n\nAvoid I.\n\nSONIC has I? S-O-N-I-C. Yes, I is position 4? S-O-N-I-C? S(1),O(2),N(3),I(4),C(5). But I is forbidden, so we cannot use SONIC because I is not in the secret word.\n\nMust avoid excluded letters.\n\nSo STOCK is good: S-T-O-C-K. No excluded letters.\n\nAnother: ""SMOCK"" - similar.\n\nBut I\'ll go with STOCK.\n\nS at position 1.\n\nBut we don\'t know if position 1 is S or not.\n\nPerhaps put S at a different position to sample.\n\nFor example, to test position 1 separately, I could put another letter at position 1 and S elsewhere.\n\nBut since we don\'t know, either way.\n\nPerhaps to maximize position coverage.\n\nIn first guess, positions 1-2-3-4-5 had R-A-I-S-E all excluded except S which is wrong in 4.\n\nSo we have no info on positions 1,2,3,5 except that they are not S? No, position 4 was S and wrong, but positions 1,2,3,5 could have S if not 4.\n\nBut S is somewhere else.\n\nNow, putting S at position 1: if S is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get - if it\'s elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, if we put S at 5, same thing.\n\nBut besides S, we test T,O,C,K, which are common.\n\nI think ""STOCK"" is a reasonable guess.Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"", we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.\n- The letters R, A, I, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nThis means:\n- We must avoid using R, A, I, or E in our next guess.\n- S must be included in the guess but in a position other than 4th (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- We should test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nFor the second guess, ""STOCK"" is chosen because:\n- It includes S in the 1st position to test if S belongs there.\n- It introduces T, O, C, and K—all common letters not yet tested—to maximize the potential for useful feedback.\n- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, I, and E.\n\nIf S is in the correct position, we expect a ✓. If not, we might get a - and learn about another position for S. Feedback on T, O, C, and K will help narrow down the possible word range.\n\n<guess>STOCK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses.\n\nFirst guess ""RAISE"" feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n- This told us that S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- Also, R, A, I, E are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess ""STOCK"" feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)\n- S(✓) means S is correct and in position 1.

But T is at position 2, but T(-) in guess 2 was at position 2, so T cannot be at pos 2? Correct, T cannot be at pos 2.\n\nIf we have T at position 4, word: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:O, 4:T, 5:?\n\nSo: S ? O T ?\n\nExamples: ""S M O T H"" – SMOTH not a word; it\'s SMOTE? SMOTE has E? E absent. ""S L O T H"" – SLOTH is a word: S L O T H? But TH at end? S(1), L(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). Yes, SLOTH.\n\nBut H? We haven\'t tested H.\n\nSimilarly, ""S P O T S"" SPOTS has S duplicate? S at 1 and 5? We don\'t know if duplicate exists.\n\nBut let\'s avoid for now.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHOTE"" has E absent.\n\n""SWOPS"" has S twice.\n\nPerhaps ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? But T is at position 5.\n\nFor T at position 4, ""S NOT ?"" hard.\n\n""BESOT"" but has E absent.\n\nPerhaps not many common words with S? O T pattern?\n\nAnother idea: put T at position 5 instead.\n\nThen word: S ? O ? T\n\nFor example, ""S H O T T"" duplicate T? Not.\n\n""SHOOT"" – S H O O T? Duplicate O? O is at position 3, and position 4 would be O again? Possible.\n\nBut let\'s see: SHOOT has O at position 3 and 4? But position 3 is O, but position 4 would be O duplicate.\n\nWe might test that.\n\nBut we want to test new letters.\n\nPerhaps ""S O L U T"" not word.\n\n""SPLOT"" not word.\n\nCommon words: ""SCOUT"" – S C O U T? But C is absent? C(x) from second guess, so C not in word. Cannot use C.\n\nSecond feedback: C(x), so C absent.\n\nSimilarly, K absent.\n\nSo SCOUT has C, invalid.\n\n""SHOUT"" – S H O U T, positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. So T at 5, U at 4.\n\nH and U untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""SCOWL"" has C, absent.\n\n""STOOP"" – S T O O P? But T at position 2, which is forbidden? T cannot be at pos 2 because we have T(-) at pos 2 from guess 2.\n\nIn STOOP, T is at 2, which would be wrong position again? But we cannot put T at pos 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""STOUT"" has T at position 2? S T O U T? Position 2: T, which is forbidden.\n\nSo we cannot have T at position 2.\n\nTherefore, for our guess, position 2 must not be T; T must be at 4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, back to patterns:\n\nOption 1: T at position 4: word S ? O T ? \n\nLike ""SLOTH"": S L O T H\n\nOption 2: T at position 5: word S ? O ? T\n\nLike ""SHOUT"": S H O U T\n\n""SHOUT"" tests H and U, and puts T at 5.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""SMOUT"" not word.\n\n""GLOUT"" not common.\n\n""TROUT"" has T at start but position 1 is S, cannot.\n\nSo ""SHOUT"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SNOUT"": S N O U T? N and U tested.\n\nBut N is common.\n\nWe also have to consider that T might be at position 4 or 5, so by guessing one, we can confirm.\n\nMoreover, for position 2, we can use a common letter like H or N or L.\n\nIn ""SHOUT"", we get to test:\n\nPosition 1: S (should be correct, already fixed)\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: O (fixed)\nPosition 4: U\nPosition 5: T\n\nIf we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) U(?) T(?) \n\nIf T is at position 5 and correct, we get T(✓) at 5. If not, we might know T is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, U might be present or not.\n\nBut we also cover position 4 with U.\n\nAnother possibility: ""S O L V T"" not word.\n\nOr ""PIOUS"" but S at end and O at position 3, but position 1 would be P? Not matching.\n\nI think ""SHOUT"" or ""SLOTH"" are candidates.\n\nBut in ""SLOTH"", T is at position 4: S L O T H\n\nIf we guess this, and T is at position 4, we get T(✓), else if not, we might get T(-) if it\'s elsewhere, but we know only position 5 possible? Since position 2 forbidden and position 3 fixed.\n\nPosition 3 is O fixed, so T can only be at 4 or 5.\n\nSo if we guess SLOTH with T at 4:\n- If T is at 4, we get T(✓)\n- If T is at 5, we get T(-) for position 4? And feedback for position 4 wrong.\n\nSimilarly for SHOUT.\n\nPerhaps choose one that test more common letters.\n\n""SHOUT"" tests H, U, and T at 5.\n""SLOTH"" tests L, H, and T at 4.\n\nL and H are both useful.\n\nAnother word: ""SMITH"" has I absent? I not allowed.\n\n""SWOOP"" has W,O,O? Duplicate O? And O fixed at 3, so position 4 O? Possible but less common.\n\n""S Y L P H"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""SOUTH"": S O U T H? But O at position 3, so ""S"" + position2 + ""U"" + ""O""? No.\n\nSOUTH: S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But in our pattern, position 3 must be O fixed, here O is at position 2? Not matching pattern.\n\nOur pattern must have position 3 as O.\n\nSo SOUTH cannot be because position 2 would be O? No, actually if word is SOUTH, position 2 is O, but we know position 3 is O, so if O is fixed at position 3, then position 2 cannot be O? Unless duplicate.\n\nBut O might duplicate? Possible.\n\nFor example, word like ""FOOLS"" position 3 O? But let\'s forget.\n\nBack to S?O? with T at end or middle.\n\nI think ""SHOUT"" is a good choice: S H O U T\n\nPositions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T\n\nThis tests H at position 2, U at position 4, T at position 5.\n\nIf T is actually at position 4, we will get:\n- Position 5: T might be absent or something? But T present, so if T is at 4, then position 4 T, position 5 U? U might be absent.\n\nSimilarly, vice versa.\n\nBut by guessing, we learn the position of T and whether H and U are present.\n\nMoreover, if T is not at 5, we know it must be at 4.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nTo avoid U which is less common, but vowel needed possibly.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOTT"" not word.\n\n"" S T O P E "" has E absent and T at position 2 forbidden.\n\nCannot.\n\n"" S L O P E "" E absent.\n\nSo ""SHOUT"" seems reasonable.\n\nSimilarly, ""SNOUT"" same structure: S N O U T\n\nBut N instead of H.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nAlso ""SCOUT"" has C absent, invalid.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SHOUT"".\n\nBut in SHOUT, position 4 and 5: U and T.\n\nWe test both.\n\nIf T is at position 5, it will be correct. If T is at position 4, then position 5 U might be wrong if U not present.\n\nBut we will get feedback.\n\nSimilarly for H at position 2.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nSince position 3 O is fixed, and position 1 S fixed, we only have positions 2,4,5 to determine.\n\nAnd T must be at 4 or 5.\n\nBy putting T at 5, and U at 4, we test both positions.\n\nIf U is present, we get info; if not, absent.\n\nSimilarly H at position 2.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SHOUT"".Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)  \n  - **Inferences:**  \n    - S is in the word but not in position 4.  \n    - R, A, I, E are absent from the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: STOCK** → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  \n  - **Inferences:**  \n    - S is in position 1 (correct).  \n    - O is in position 3 (correct).  \n    - T is in the word but not in position 2.  \n    - C and K are absent.  \n\n**Current knowledge:**  \n- The secret word has the pattern: S _ O _ _  \n  - Position 1: S (fixed).  \n  - Position 3: O (fixed).  \n- T must be present but not in position 2 (since it was a wrong-position match in guess 2). Given positions 1 and 3 are occupied, T must be in position 4 or 5.  \n- Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K (avoid these).  \n- Untested common letters: Focus on consonants like H, L, N, U, etc., as vowels A, E, I are out (only O is confirmed, U/Y may be viable).  \n\n**Strategy for the next guess:**  \n- Must include T to determine its position (either 4 or 5).  \n- Test new common letters in position 2 and the remaining positions (4 or 5) to maximize information:  \n  - Position 2: Untested and not absent (e.g., H, L, N).  \n  - Position 4 or 5: Untested and not absent, depending on T\'s placement.  \n- Preferred word choice:  \n  - ""SHOUT"" fits perfectly: S H O U T.  \n    - Tests T in position 5 (if T is here, it should be correct; if not, T must be in position 4).  \n    - Tests H in position 2, and U in position 4—both untested and common.  \n    - Avoids all absent letters.  \n- Alternative words considered (like ""SNOUT"" or ""SLOTH"") but ""SHOUT"" is prioritized for its simplicity and coverage.  \n\n**Expected outcomes from guessing ""SHOUT"":**  \n- If T is at position 5: Feedback should show T(✓).  \n- If T is at position 4: Feedback may show T(-) for position 5, confirming T must be at position 4.  \n- If H is in the word, feedback will indicate its position correctness or presence (✓ or -).  \n- If U is in the word, feedback will similarly indicate its status.\n\n<guess>SHOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: SHOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(-) O(✓) U(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have new feedback from Guess 3: SHOUT -> S(✓) H(-) O(✓) U(x) T(-)\n\nBreaking down the feedback:\n- S(✓): Position 1 is S, which we already knew and is confirmed correctly placed.\n- H(-): H is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(✓): Position 3 is O, which we already knew.\n- U(x): U is not in the word.\n- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nRecall what we know so far:\n- Secret word pattern: S _ O _ _ \n  (positions: 1=S, 2=unknown, 3=O, 4=unknown, 5=unknown)\n- T is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 2) and now not in position 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, T must be in position 4 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken, and 2 and 5 are eliminated).\n- H is present but not in position 2.\n- U is absent, so we must avoid U in future guesses.\n- Previously absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U. And now U is added to absent.\n- Present letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), T (position 4, deduced), H (present but position unknown, not at 2).\n\nFrom the deduction, T must be at position 4. So we update our pattern:\n- Secret word: S _ O T _\n\nNow, the missing letter is at position 2 and position 5.\n- Position 2 must be filled with a letter that includes H? Not necessarily directly; we know H is present but not at position 2. Therefore, H must be at position 5? Let\'s see:\n  The word has five positions: \n    Position 1: S (fixed)\n    Position 2: unknown (cannot be H because H(-) at position 2)\n    Position 3: O (fixed)\n    Position 4: T (deduced fixed)\n    Position 5: unknown\n\nBut H is present and cannot be at position 2 or at position 1 or 3 (since they are filled). Therefore, H must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? \nWe have only five positions. H cannot be at position 2, and positions 1 and 3 are taken by S and O, so H must be at position 4 or 5. But position 4 is now T, so H must be at position 5? Let\'s confirm.\n\nH can be at position 4? But position 4 is T. Unless there is a duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nIn Guess 3 SHOUT, position 4 was U and it was absent (U(x)), and position 5 was T and we got T(-). Since T(-) at position 5, T is present but not at 5. Therefore, T must be at position 4 because 2 is also ruled out.\n\nGiven that, the word must have H present, and it cannot be at position 2. The only positions left are 5? Position 4 is now T, so yes, H must be at position 5? Or could there be duplicates? For example, could H be at position 4? But position 4 is T, so no, unless we have duplicate T? But T is at position 4.\n\nBut in the pattern, position 4 is T, and H is present, so the only place for H is position 5? Because position 2 cannot have H.\n\nSo let\'s assume H must be at position 5. Therefore, the secret word would be S _ O T H ?\n\nBut we haven\'t tested H at position 5. Is it possible?\n\nAlternatively, H might not be at position 5; it could be that position 2 can be H? No, because in SHOUT, H was at position 2 and got (-), meaning H is not at position 2. And position 4 is T, position 1 S, position 3 O, so the only available position for H is position 5. Therefore, the secret word must end with H? So pattern: S ? O T H\n\nNow, what about the letter at position 2? We need a letter that has not been tested and is not absent.\n\nMoreover, we need to confirm if H is at position 5 and what the position 2 letter is.\n\nBut for our next guess, since we think the pattern is S ? O T H and H at position 5, we should try to find a word that fits S ? O T H.\n\nWhat can be at position 2? It has to be a letter not absent and not used elsewhere? We have tested S, O, T, H. Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word of the form S * O T H where * is one of the available letters.\n\nCommon possibilities: \n- SMOTH? Not a word.\n- SLOTH: S L O T H -> this is the word we considered earlier.\n\nSLOTH is a word: S L O T H.\n\nL is available, not absent.\n\nOther words: SPOTH? Not word. SNOTH? Not common. SWOTH? No.\n\nSo ""SLOTH"" is a candidate. And L hasn\'t been tested, so it would give new information.\n\nBut note: if the secret word is ""SLOTH"", then our guess would be SHOUT previously, which had U absent and H at position 2 wrong but present. And O at position 3 correct. S correct. T at position 5 wrong, but present.\n\nIn ""SLOTH"": S at 1, L at 2, O at 3, T at 4, H at 5.\n\nBut we thought H should be at position 5? Yes.\n\nSo let me confirm: with pattern S L O T H.\n\nFor position 2: L. We haven\'t tested L.\n\nIf we guess ""SLOTH"", here\'s what we expect:\n- Position 1: S(✓) (fixed)\n- Position 2: L (?) \n- Position 3: O(✓) (fixed)\n- Position 4: T(✓) (since we deduced T at position 4)\n- Position 5: H(?) \n\nSince H must be at position 5, we might get H(✓) at 5.\n\nBut L might be the letter at position 2.\n\nIf L is not present, we get L(x), and then we know position 2 is something else.\n\nBut the only other possibility is that H might be duplicated? But our deduction: H is present and can only be at position 5, so unless there\'s a duplicate, position 2 must be a single letter.\n\nFor example, if ""SLOTH"" is not the word, what else? Say ""STOAT"" but T duplicate? S T O A T? A absent? No.\n\n""SHOWY"" but no T, etc.\n\nI think ""SLOTH"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut we have to consider that in SHOUT, H was marked as (-) at position 2, meaning H is in the word but not at 2. That doesn\'t imply H is at another specific position, only that it exists.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern S ? O T _, H must be at position 5 because position 4 is T, and positions 1,3 are fixed, so position 5 is the only spot left? Unless duplicates: I think we should allow for the possibility that H is at a different position? No, because all positions: pos1 S, pos3 O, pos4 T, pos5 must be H? Or pos2 could be something else and pos5 something else, but H must be somewhere.\n\nPositions:\nPos1: S (fixed)\nPos2: unknown, cannot be H\nPos3: O (fixed)\nPos4: T (fixed, as deduced)\nPos5: must be H? Or there might be a duplicate? But T is fixed at pos4, so if H is present, it must be at pos5? Because pos2 cannot have H, and the others are occupied.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be S ? O T H.\n\nSo we guess ""SLOTH"" as the next word, with position 2 being L.\n\nIf it\'s incorrect, we will get feedback on L.\n\nIf L is in the word or not.\n\nSince L is untested, this guess covers it.\n\nOther possibilities? Words like ""SMOOTH"" too long? No.\n\n""S V O T H"" not a word.\n\nSo ""SLOTH"" seems the best option.\n\nTherefore, next guess: SLOTH\n\nBut in terms of the response format: we need to output the guess.\n\nSo I will go with ""SLOTH"".Based on cumulative feedback:\n\n- **From Guess 1 (RAISE):**  \n  - S is present (wrong position then).  \n  - R, A, I, E absent.  \n\n- **From Guess 2 (STOCK):**  \n  - S, O confirmed in positions 1 and 3.  \n  - T present (not position 2).  \n  - C, K absent.  \n\n- **From Guess 3 (SHOUT):**  \n  - S, O reconfirmed.  \n  - H present (not position 2).  \n  - U absent.  \n  - T present but not position 5.  \n\n**Critical Inferences:**  \n1. **Pattern:** Secret word is S _ O _ _  \n   Positions:  \n   - 1: S (fixed)  \n   - 3: O (fixed)  \n   - Position 2: Cannot be H, and cannot be any absent letter.  \n   - Position 4 and 5: Unknown, but T must be present.  \n\n2. **T\'s Position:**  \n   - T cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3), leaving only position 4 available.  \n   - **Thus, position 4 is T.**  \n   - Updated pattern: S _ O T _  \n\n3. **H\'s Position:**  \n   - H must be present (from Guess 3) but cannot be in position 2 (same feedback).  \n   - With positions 1 (S), 3 (O), 4 (T) occupied, H must be in position 5.  \n   - **Thus, position 5 should be H.**  \n   - Final pattern: S _ O T H  \n\n4. **Solving Position 2:**  \n   - Only position 2 remains unknown.  \n   - Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U.  \n   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested consonants/vowels).  \n   - Common letters to test: L (high frequency).  \n   - Must form a valid English word of the form S ? O T H.  \n\n**Valid Candidate:**  \n- ""SLOTH"" is the most probable word fitting the pattern:  \n  - S L O T H positions: 1=S, 2=L, 3=O, 4=T, 5=H.  \n- Alternatives are rare or invalid (e.g., ""SMOTH"", not a word).\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- Guessing ""SLOTH"" tests L in position 2.

We have the feedback for Guess 4: SLOTH -> S(✓) L(x) O(✓) T(✓) H(✓)

This means:
- S is correct at position 1 (as before).
- L is not in the word (L(x)).
- O is correct at position 3 (as before).
- T is correct at position 4 (as deduced).
- H is correct at position 5 (as deduced).

But note: L(x) indicates that L is absent from the word. However, the feedback for H is H(✓) at position 5, which is consistent with our deduction.

But the problem: we have the pattern S _ O T H, and we guessed SLOTH, which has L at position 2. But L is absent (L(x)), so position 2 is not L.

Therefore, the secret word is S ? O T H, where ? is a letter that is not L and not any of the absent letters.

We must find a letter for position 2 that is not in the absent list and forms a valid word.

Absent letters so far: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, and now L.

Also, from Guess 1,2,3,4: absent: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, L.

Present: S, O, T, H (with positions fixed except we know positions: 1:S, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H).

Position 2 is the only one missing.

We need a letter for position 2 that is not absent and not already used? But we can use duplicates? But we don't know.

The absent letters are: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, L.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form S ? O T H.

What words exist?

Common ones: 
- SMOTH? Not a word.
- SNOTH? Not a word.
- SPOTH? Not a word.
- SWOTH? No.

Less common: 
- ""Swith"" not 5 letters? S W I T H? But I is absent, and W is available.

S W I T H: has I, which is absent? I is in the absent list, so cannot.

Another: ""Scyth"" not, or ""Syth"" no.

Perhaps ""SATH"" no.

Another possibility: ""SHETH"" but H is at position 5, and position 2 H? But H is already at position 5, and we have H(✓) at 5, but if we put H at position 2, it would be duplicate? But in SHOUT, H was at position 2 and we got H(-), meaning H is present but not at 2, so it cannot be at position 2. Therefore, we cannot have duplicate H? Or we can, but H is not at position 2, so if we put H at position 2 again, it would be wrong.

But for the word, we need position 2 to be a different letter.

Available letters: let's list possible words.

""SWATH"": S W A T H? But A is absent (from Guess 1).

""STATH"" not word.

""SCATH"" has C absent.

""SKETH"" K absent.

""SLITH"" L absent and I absent.

""SMITH"" I absent.

""SNATH"" not common, but let's check: SNATH is a word? It might be a rare word for a part of a scythe, but not common.

Similarly, ""SPATH"" not word.

Perhaps ""Goth"" related, but S_GOTH? S G O T H? ""S G O T H"" is not a word.

Another idea: ""SHOTE"" but E absent.

Perhaps we missed a word.

What about ""SOUTH""? But SOUTH is S O U T H, but position 3 is O, so if we have S O U T H, then position 2 is O? But position 3 is also O? Duplicate O? But in our pattern, position 3 is O, so if position 2 is O, it would be duplicate.

But in Guess 2, we had O at position 3 and it was correct, but we don't know if O is duplicated.

In ""SOUTH"", it would be S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But our pattern requires position 3 to be O, so if we have U at position 3, it would be wrong.

So SOUTH doesn't fit the pattern.

Perhaps the word is ""S O T H with something"", but we need 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""BESOT"" but E absent.

I think we need to consider that position 2 might be a vowel? But vowels available: A,E,I,O,U are all either absent or fixed. A,E,I,U absent, O fixed at position 3. So only possible vowel is Y.

Y is available.

So words like ""SYNTH"": S Y N T H? But N is available.

SYNTH is a word, meaning a synthesizer or synthetic.

Similarly, ""SYLTH"" not word.

SYNTH: S(1) Y(2) N(3) T(4) H(5)? But position 3 must be O, not N. In SYNTH, position 3 is N, but we need position 3 to be O.

So not.

""SYOTH"" not word.

Perhaps ""SAITH"" but A and I absent.

Not.

Another: ""SOWTH"" not word.

Perhaps we have to accept ""WYVERN"" but not 5 letters.

I think I missed a common word: ""S O T H"" is not, but what about ""TROTH"" but T at start.

No.

""CLOTH"" but C absent.

""BROTH"" B R O T H? R absent.

""FROTH"" F R O T H? R absent.

""GROTH"" not common.

""PROTH"" not word.

""WROTH"" is a word? W R O T H? But R is absent.

R is absent from Guess 1.

So not.

Perhaps ""DROTH"" not word.

I think the only common word that fits is ""SLOTH"", but we guessed it and L is absent.

But there is another word: ""SMITH"" but I absent.

Perhaps we need to think of words with Y.

""STYTH"" not word.

""SPATH"" not.

Another idea: ""SHOTT"" not.

Perhaps ""SCOUTH"" not 5 letters.

I recall that ""S O T H"" might be part of ""soth"" but not 5 letters.

Perhaps the word is ""S O T H S"" but duplicate S? S at position 1 and 5? But position 5 is H, fixed.

Unless H is not fixed? But we deduced H at position 5.

But let's double-check the deduction.

From Guess 3 SHOUT: H(-) at position 2, so H is present but not at 2.

From the pattern S _ O T _, with positions 1,3,4 fixed, the only position left for H is position 5.

Therefore, it must be at position 5.

So the word is S ? O T H.

Now, what words are there?

Let me search: 

- S with: b, d, f, g, j, m, n, p, q, v, w, x, y, z

S B O T H? ""SBOTH"" not a word.

S D O T H? ""SDOTH"" not.

S F O T H? ""SFOTH"" not.

S G O T H? ""SGOTH"" not, but ""Goth"" is a word, but S G O T H is not a standard word.

S J O T H? ""SJOTH"" not.

S M O T H? ""SMOTH"" not, but ""smote"" has E.

S N O T H? ""SNOTH"" not common, but ""snath"" is a word: the handle of a scythe. S N A T H? But A is absent.

""Snath"" is S N A T H, but A is absent, so not.

S P O T H? ""SPOTH"" not.

S Q O T H? no.

S V O T H? no.

S W O T H? ""SWOTH"" not.

S X O T H? no.

S Y O T H? ""SYOTH"" not.

S Z O T H? no.

Perhaps ""S O T H"" with a letter that can be attached.

Another possibility: ""SHOAT"" but A absent and no T at 4.

I think we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter.

For example, if O is duplicated, then position 2 could be O.

So word: S O O T H? ""SOOTH"" is a word, meaning truth or reality, archaic.

SOOTH: S O O T H.

Positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H.

But position 3 is O, and position 2 is also O.

In Guess 2, we had O at position 3 and it was correct, but we didn't test position 2 for O.

In Guess 3, SHOUT had O at position 3, but position 2 was H.

So O at position 2 is possible if duplicate.

And in SOOTH, position 2 is O, position 3 is O.

Now, is O in the word twice? We don't know, but possible.

And in feedback for SOOTH, we would get:

Position 1: S(✓)

Position 2: O(?) — if O is duplicate, it might be correct or not.

But in this case, if the word is SOOTH, then position 2 O should be correct.

Also, position 3 O(✓), position 4 T(✓), position 5 H(✓).

But we have L absent in previous guess, but in SOOTH, no L, so that's fine.

Absent letters: R,A,I,E,C,K,U,L — none in SOOTH.

So SOOTH is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""SOUTH"" but position 3 would be U, not O.

Not.

Or ""SCOTh"" not.

So ""SOOTH"" seems a candidate.

But is it common? In word games, it might be accepted.

Another word: ""BOOTH"" but B O O T H, position 1 B, not S.

Not.

So for our pattern, SOOTH is a possibility.

We could guess ""SOOTH"".

But let's see if there are other options.

""TOOTH"" has T at start.

Not.

""MOOTH"" not word.

So I think ""SOOTH"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we should guess ""SOOTH"".

But in the feedback for Guess 4 SLOTH, we have L(x), so L is absent, which is consistent with SOOTH not having L.

And SOOTH has O at position 2 and 3.

So let's go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
    - R, A, I, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: STOCK** → Feedback: S(✓), T(-), O(✓), C(x), K(x)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S is in position 1 (confirmed).  
    - O is in position 3 (confirmed).  
    - T is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and K are absent.  
    - Pattern: Secret word is `S _ O _ _`.  

- **Guess 3: SHOUT** → Feedback: S(✓), H(-), O(✓), U(x), T(-)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S and O reconfirmed in positions 1 and 3.  
    - H is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - U is absent.  
    - T is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - Since T cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or 5 (from Guess 3), **T must be in position 4**.  
    - Pattern updated to `S _ O T _`.  
    - H must be in position 5 (only remaining position).  
    - Final pattern: `S _ O T H`.  

- **Guess 4: SLOTH** → Feedback: S(✓), L(x), O(✓), T(✓), H(✓)  
  - **Inferences:**  
    - S, O, T, H confirmed in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
    - L is absent.  
    - Pattern remains `S _ O T H`, with position 2 unknown.  
    - Absent letters: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, L.  
    - Position 2 must be a letter not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.  

### Deductions for Position 2
- **Available letters** (not absent and not fixed): B, D, F, G, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Word pattern**: `S ? O T H`.  
- **Possible words**:  
  - Common words like ""SLOTH"" were tested and ruled out (L absent).  
  - ""SOOTH"" is a valid English word (archaic term for ""truth"" or ""reality,"" still accepted in word games). It fits the pattern:  
    - Position 1: S  
    - Position 2: O (duplicate, but O is confirmed at position 3 and duplication is possible)  
    - Position 3: O (fixed)  
    - Position 4: T (fixed)  
    - Position 5: H (fixed)  
  - Other combinations (e.g., ""SNOTH"", ""SMOTH"") are invalid or not words.  
- **Why ""SOOTH""?**  
  - It tests the only unknown position (2) with a common vowel (O), leveraging the possibility of duplication.  
  - If correct, all positions match. If not, feedback on O in position 2 will confirm duplication or reveal new clues.  

<guess>SOOTH</guess>",SOOTH,"We have the feedback for Guess 4: SLOTH -> S(✓) L(x) O(✓) T(✓) H(✓)

This means:
- S is correct at position 1 (as before).
- L is not in the word (L(x)).
- O is correct at position 3 (as before).
- T is correct at position 4 (as deduced).
- H is correct at position 5 (as deduced).

But note: L(x) indicates that L is absent from the word. However, the feedback for H is H(✓) at position 5, which is consistent with our deduction.

But the problem: we have the pattern S _ O T H, and we guessed SLOTH, which has L at position 2. But L is absent (L(x)), so position 2 is not L.

Therefore, the secret word is S ? O T H, where ? is a letter that is not L and not any of the absent letters.

We must find a letter for position 2 that is not in the absent list and forms a valid word.

Absent letters so far: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, and now L.

Also, from Guess 1,2,3,4: absent: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, L.

Present: S, O, T, H (with positions fixed except we know positions: 1:S, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H).

Position 2 is the only one missing.

We need a letter for position 2 that is not absent and not already used? But we can use duplicates? But we don't know.

The absent letters are: R, A, I, E, C, K, U, L.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form S ? O T H.

What words exist?

Common ones: 
- SMOTH? Not a word.
- SNOTH? Not a word.
- SPOTH? Not a word.
- SWOTH? No.

Less common: 
- ""Swith"" not 5 letters? S W I T H? But I is absent, and W is available.

S W I T H: has I, which is absent? I is in the absent list, so cannot.

Another: ""Scyth"" not, or ""Syth"" no.

Perhaps ""SATH"" no.

Another possibility: ""SHETH"" but H is at position 5, and position 2 H? But H is already at position 5, and we have H(✓) at 5, but if we put H at position 2, it would be duplicate? But in SHOUT, H was at position 2 and we got H(-), meaning H is present but not at 2, so it cannot be at position 2. Therefore, we cannot have duplicate H? Or we can, but H is not at position 2, so if we put H at position 2 again, it would be wrong.

But for the word, we need position 2 to be a different letter.

Available letters: let's list possible words.

""SWATH"": S W A T H? But A is absent (from Guess 1).

""STATH"" not word.

""SCATH"" has C absent.

""SKETH"" K absent.

""SLITH"" L absent and I absent.

""SMITH"" I absent.

""SNATH"" not common, but let's check: SNATH is a word? It might be a rare word for a part of a scythe, but not common.

Similarly, ""SPATH"" not word.

Perhaps ""Goth"" related, but S_GOTH? S G O T H? ""S G O T H"" is not a word.

Another idea: ""SHOTE"" but E absent.

Perhaps we missed a word.

What about ""SOUTH""? But SOUTH is S O U T H, but position 3 is O, so if we have S O U T H, then position 2 is O? But position 3 is also O? Duplicate O? But in our pattern, position 3 is O, so if position 2 is O, it would be duplicate.

But in Guess 2, we had O at position 3 and it was correct, but we don't know if O is duplicated.

In ""SOUTH"", it would be S(1) O(2) U(3) T(4) H(5)? But our pattern requires position 3 to be O, so if we have U at position 3, it would be wrong.

So SOUTH doesn't fit the pattern.

Perhaps the word is ""S O T H with something"", but we need 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""BESOT"" but E absent.

I think we need to consider that position 2 might be a vowel? But vowels available: A,E,I,O,U are all either absent or fixed. A,E,I,U absent, O fixed at position 3. So only possible vowel is Y.

Y is available.

So words like ""SYNTH"": S Y N T H? But N is available.

SYNTH is a word, meaning a synthesizer or synthetic.

Similarly, ""SYLTH"" not word.

SYNTH: S(1) Y(2) N(3) T(4) H(5)? But position 3 must be O, not N. In SYNTH, position 3 is N, but we need position 3 to be O.

So not.

""SYOTH"" not word.

Perhaps ""SAITH"" but A and I absent.

Not.

Another: ""SOWTH"" not word.

Perhaps we have to accept ""WYVERN"" but not 5 letters.

I think I missed a common word: ""S O T H"" is not, but what about ""TROTH"" but T at start.

No.

""CLOTH"" but C absent.

""BROTH"" B R O T H? R absent.

""FROTH"" F R O T H? R absent.

""GROTH"" not common.

""PROTH"" not word.

""WROTH"" is a word? W R O T H? But R is absent.

R is absent from Guess 1.

So not.

Perhaps ""DROTH"" not word.

I think the only common word that fits is ""SLOTH"", but we guessed it and L is absent.

But there is another word: ""SMITH"" but I absent.

Perhaps we need to think of words with Y.

""STYTH"" not word.

""SPATH"" not.

Another idea: ""SHOTT"" not.

Perhaps ""SCOUTH"" not 5 letters.

I recall that ""S O T H"" might be part of ""soth"" but not 5 letters.

Perhaps the word is ""S O T H S"" but duplicate S? S at position 1 and 5? But position 5 is H, fixed.

Unless H is not fixed? But we deduced H at position 5.

But let's double-check the deduction.

From Guess 3 SHOUT: H(-) at position 2, so H is present but not at 2.

From the pattern S _ O T _, with positions 1,3,4 fixed, the only position left for H is position 5.

Therefore, it must be at position 5.

S G O T H? ""SGOTH"" not, but ""Goth"" is a word, but S G O T H is not a standard word.

S J O T H? ""SJOTH"" not.

S M O T H? ""SMOTH"" not, but ""smote"" has E.

S N O T H? ""SNOTH"" not common, but ""snath"" is a word: the handle of a scythe. S N A T H? But A is absent.

""Snath"" is S N A T H, but A is absent, so not.

S P O T H? ""SPOTH"" not.

S Q O T H? no.

S V O T H? no.

S W O T H? ""SWOTH"" not.

S X O T H? no.

S Y O T H? ""SYOTH"" not.

S Z O T H? no.

Perhaps ""S O T H"" with a letter that can be attached.

Another possibility: ""SHOAT"" but A absent and no T at 4.

I think we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter.

For example, if O is duplicated, then position 2 could be O.

So word: S O O T H? ""SOOTH"" is a word, meaning truth or reality, archaic.

SOOTH: S O O T H.

Positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H.

But position 3 is O, and position 2 is also O.

In Guess 2, we had O at position 3 and it was correct, but we didn't test position 2 for O.

In Guess 3, SHOUT had O at position 3, but position 2 was H.

So O at position 2 is possible if duplicate.

And in SOOTH, position 2 is O, position 3 is O.
