We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
4. The letter N is not in the word.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we know the first letter is C.

We must avoid using R and N in any subsequent guesses because they are not in the word.

We know that A and E are in the word, but not in the positions we tried.

In the secret word:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be A (because we had A in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not there) and also cannot be R or N (which are absent). Also, we know A is somewhere else.
- Position 3: we don't know, but it cannot be R or N.
- Position 4: we don't know, but it cannot be R or N.
- Position 5: cannot be E (because we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position) and also cannot be R or N.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain R or N.

Let's think of possible words.

We know A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our first guess and we were told it's wrong position, so E is not at 5. Similarly, A is not at 2. However, note that A could be at position 1? But position 1 is C, so A cannot be at 1. Therefore, A must be at 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But note: the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at 3,4, or 5? However, we also have E that must be in the word and not at 5. So if A is at 5, then E must be at 2,3, or 4? But we don't know.

But we also have to avoid R and N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: not A, not R, not N
- Position 3: not R, not N
- Position 4: not R, not N
- Position 5: not E, not R, not N

And the word must contain A and E.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? But position 2 is open.

Let me try to think of words that start with C and have A and E.

Possible words: 
- ""cameo"": but we have M and O which we don't know about. Also, A is in position 2? But we cannot have A in position 2 because our feedback said A is not in position 2. So ""cameo"" has A at position 2 -> invalid.

- ""cable"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? But we cannot have A at 2 -> invalid.

- ""cache"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? Again, invalid.

We need a word without A in position 2.

How about ""capex""? But is that a word? Not common.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 or 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""cease"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - E at 2: we don't know if that's allowed for E? We only know E is not at 5. E can be at 2.
  - A at 3: that's a new position for A -> possible.
  - S at 4: unknown
  - E at 5: but we know E is not at 5 -> invalid because we have E at 5.

We cannot have E at 5.

So in ""cease"", the last letter is E, which is not allowed at position 5.

Another word: ""chase"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: unknown
- A at 3: good (not position 2)
- S at 4
- E at 5: not allowed.

Same problem.

We need a word that does not have E at 5 and does not have A at 2.

How about ""cadet"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: not allowed -> invalid.

""caste"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

We need to avoid A at 2.

What about ""cause""? 
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

""clause"": 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""caste"", ""crane"" we already tried.

Another idea: ""cable"" is invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""cycle""? 
- C at 1
- Y at 2
- C at 3: but we already have C at 1? The word has two C's? 
  But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had C as correct and then R, A, N, E. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But in the feedback, we had:
- C: correct (so the first C is in the word and correct)
- R: absent
- A: present but wrong position
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position

So the secret word has at least one C (at position 1) and then A and E. It does not have R or N.

But could it have two C's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we have two of the same in the guess. In ""crane"", we only have one C, so we don't know.

But in ""cycle"", we have two C's. The first C is correct. The third C: if the secret word has only one C, then the third C in ""cycle"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

We can try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 3,4 or 5 and E in position 2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

For example:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: must be a letter that is not A, not R, not N. Let me choose a common consonant, say T, L, S, etc.
- Then A in position 3,4, or 5? But if we put A in position 3, then E can be in position 4? and position 5 must be something else.

Example: ""cater""
- C at 1
- A at 2? -> invalid.

""cater"" has A at 2 -> no.

""crate"": but R is absent? We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. ""crate"" has R -> invalid.

""cleat"":
- C at 1
- L at 2: not A, not R, not N -> allowed
- E at 3: we don't know if E can be at 3? It can because we only know E is not at 5.
- A at 4: allowed (not position 2)
- T at 5: and we don't have E at 5 -> good.

Also, no R or N.

So ""cleat"" is a candidate.

But let me check: the secret word has A and E. In ""cleat"", we have A at 4 and E at 3. We don't know if that conflicts.

We also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word but not at 2. In ""cleat"", A is at 4, which is fine.

Similarly, E was at 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position, so E must be in the word but not at 5. In ""cleat"", E is at 3, which is not 5, so that's fine.

Also, we are avoiding R and N.

So ""cleat"" seems like a valid guess.

But is ""cleat"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a piece of leather or similar material.

Another candidate: ""cheap"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: allowed
- E at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed
- P at 5: allowed

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if H and P are in the word. But that's okay.

However, we have two candidates: ""cleat"" and ""cheap"". Which one to choose?

We might want to choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

But note: we already know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""cleat"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. In ""cheap"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4 as well.

But we could also try a word that puts A and E in different positions.

For example, what if we put A at position 5? But we have to avoid E at 5? We can put A at 5 and E at 2 or 3 or 4.

Example: ""cupae""? Not a word.

""cavea""? Not common.

""comae""? Not common.

So maybe it's better to stick with more common words.

Another candidate: ""chase"" but we cannot because of E at 5.

""chafe"":
- C at 1
- H at 2
- A at 3
- F at 4
- E at 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at 5.

So we avoid E at 5.

Another candidate: ""cameo"" is invalid because of A at 2.

""cadge"": A at 2 -> invalid.

""cagey"": A at 2 -> invalid.

So let's go with ""cleat"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""cease"" but we saw that has E at 5 -> invalid.

""chest"": but does it have A? No, we must include A because we know A is in the word.

So we must include A and E.

Another candidate: ""caste"" -> A at 2 invalid.

""carte"": has R -> invalid.

""cable"" -> A at 2 invalid.

So I think ""cleat"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""plate""? But it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

Another one: ""clean"":
- C at 1
- L at 2
- E at 3
- A at 4? But wait, the word is ""clean"", which has A at 5? 
  Actually: C-L-E-A-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N.

But we know N is absent! So we cannot use N. In ""clean"", the last letter is N, which is absent -> but we are going to guess it? We can guess it, but we know N is not in the word so it will be marked as absent. But that's acceptable because we are trying to find the positions of A and E.

However, we know N is not in the word, so using it in position 5 would be a waste because it will be marked absent. But we are forced to use a 5-letter word.

But in ""clean"", we have:
- Position 4: A -> which is good (not position 2)
- Position 3: E -> good (not position 5)
- But position 5: N -> which we know is absent.

So the feedback for position 5 would be x. But we already know that.

But we are using a letter we know is absent, which doesn't give us new information about the presence of letters. However, we are trying to test the positions of A and E.

But we can avoid using known absent letters if possible.

In ""cleat"", we don't use any known absent letters (R and N). The letters in ""cleat"" are C, L, E, A, T. We know C, E, A are present (C is fixed, E and A are known to be present). L and T are new.

So ""cleat"" is better because it uses two new letters (L and T) that we don't know about, so we can get information about them.

Whereas in ""clean"", we use N which we know is absent, so we don't learn anything new about N.

Therefore, ""cleat"" is a better guess.

So I will go with ""cleat"".

But let me confirm the spelling: ""cleat"" is a valid word.

Therefore, my second guess is ""cleat"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is absent (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (-).
- N is absent (x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with C.
- It contains A and E, but A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- R and N are absent and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is currently restricted for E, so A could be in 3 or 4).
- Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 5).

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A and E (A not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Avoid R and N.
- Use new letters to gather more information (e.g., test common consonants like L, T, S).

A suitable guess is ""cleat"":
- C in position 1 (correct, as known).
- L in position 2 (new letter, not restricted).
- E in position 3 (tests a new position for E).
- A in position 4 (tests a new position for A).
- T in position 5 (new letter, and since E can't be in 5, this is safe).

This guess efficiently tests the positions of A and E while introducing new letters (L, T) for additional feedback.

<guess>cleat</guess>",cleat,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
4. The letter N is not in the word.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we know the first letter is C.

We must avoid using R and N in any subsequent guesses because they are not in the word.

We know that A and E are in the word, but not in the positions we tried.

In the secret word:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be A (because we had A in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not there) and also cannot be R or N (which are absent). Also, we know A is somewhere else.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain R or N.

Let's think of possible words.

We know A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our first guess and we were told it's wrong position, so E is not at 5. Similarly, A is not at 2. However, note that A could be at position 1? But position 1 is C, so A cannot be at 1. Therefore, A must be at 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But note: the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at 3,4, or 5? However, we also have E that must be in the word and not at 5. So if A is at 5, then E must be at 2,3, or 4? But we don't know.

But we also have to avoid R and N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: not A, not R, not N
- Position 3: not R, not N
- Position 4: not R, not N
- Position 5: not E, not R, not N

And the word must contain A and E.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? But position 2 is open.

Let me try to think of words that start with C and have A and E.

Possible words: 
- ""cameo"": but we have M and O which we don't know about. Also, A is in position 2? But we cannot have A in position 2 because our feedback said A is not in position 2. So ""cameo"" has A at position 2 -> invalid.

  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? But we cannot have A at 2 -> invalid.

- ""cache"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? Again, invalid.

We need a word without A in position 2.

How about ""capex""? But is that a word? Not common.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 or 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""cease"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - E at 2: we don't know if that's allowed for E? We only know E is not at 5. E can be at 2.
  - A at 3: that's a new position for A -> possible.
  - S at 4: unknown
  - E at 5: but we know E is not at 5 -> invalid because we have E at 5.

We cannot have E at 5.

So in ""cease"", the last letter is E, which is not allowed at position 5.

Another word: ""chase"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: unknown
- A at 3: good (not position 2)
- S at 4
- E at 5: not allowed.

Same problem.

We need a word that does not have E at 5 and does not have A at 2.

How about ""cadet"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: not allowed -> invalid.

""caste"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

We need to avoid A at 2.

What about ""cause""? 
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

""clause"": 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""caste"", ""crane"" we already tried.

Another idea: ""cable"" is invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""cycle""? 
- C at 1

But in ""cycle"", we have two C's. The first C is correct. The third C: if the secret word has only one C, then the third C in ""cycle"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

We can try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 3,4 or 5 and E in position 2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

For example:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: must be a letter that is not A, not R, not N. Let me choose a common consonant, say T, L, S, etc.
- Then A in position 3,4, or 5? But if we put A in position 3, then E can be in position 4? and position 5 must be something else.

Example: ""cater""
- C at 1
- A at 2? -> invalid.

""cater"" has A at 2 -> no.

""crate"": but R is absent? We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. ""crate"" has R -> invalid.

""cleat"":
- C at 1
- L at 2: not A, not R, not N -> allowed
- E at 3: we don't know if E can be at 3? It can because we only know E is not at 5.
- A at 4: allowed (not position 2)
- T at 5: and we don't have E at 5 -> good.

Also, no R or N.

So ""cleat"" is a candidate.

But let me check: the secret word has A and E. In ""cleat"", we have A at 4 and E at 3. We don't know if that conflicts.

We also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word but not at 2. In ""cleat"", A is at 4, which is fine.

Similarly, E was at 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position, so E must be in the word but not at 5. In ""cleat"", E is at 3, which is not 5, so that's fine.

Also, we are avoiding R and N.

So ""cleat"" seems like a valid guess.

But is ""cleat"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a piece of leather or similar material.

Another candidate: ""cheap"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: allowed
- E at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed
- P at 5: allowed

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if H and P are in the word. But that's okay.

However, we have two candidates: ""cleat"" and ""cheap"". Which one to choose?

We might want to choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

But note: we already know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""cleat"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. In ""cheap"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4 as well.

But we could also try a word that puts A and E in different positions.

For example, what if we put A at position 5? But we have to avoid E at 5? We can put A at 5 and E at 2 or 3 or 4.

Example: ""cupae""? Not a word.

""cavea""? Not common.

""comae""? Not common.

So maybe it's better to stick with more common words.

Another candidate: ""chase"" but we cannot because of E at 5.

""chafe"":
- C at 1
- H at 2
- A at 3
- F at 4
- E at 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at 5.

So we avoid E at 5.

Another candidate: ""cameo"" is invalid because of A at 2.

""cadge"": A at 2 -> invalid.

""cagey"": A at 2 -> invalid.

So let's go with ""cleat"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""cease"" but we saw that has E at 5 -> invalid.

""chest"": but does it have A? No, we must include A because we know A is in the word.

So we must include A and E.

Another candidate: ""caste"" -> A at 2 invalid.

""carte"": has R -> invalid.

""cable"" -> A at 2 invalid.

So I think ""cleat"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""plate""? But it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

Another one: ""clean"":
- C at 1
- L at 2
- E at 3
- A at 4? But wait, the word is ""clean"", which has A at 5? 
  Actually: C-L-E-A-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N.

But we know N is absent! So we cannot use N. In ""clean"", the last letter is N, which is absent -> but we are going to guess it? We can guess it, but we know N is not in the word so it will be marked as absent. But that's acceptable because we are trying to find the positions of A and E.

However, we know N is not in the word, so using it in position 5 would be a waste because it will be marked absent. But we are forced to use a 5-letter word.

But in ""clean"", we have:
- Position 4: A -> which is good (not position 2)
- Position 3: E -> good (not position 5)
- But position 5: N -> which we know is absent.

So the feedback for position 5 would be x. But we already know that.

But we are using a letter we know is absent, which doesn't give us new information about the presence of letters. However, we are trying to test the positions of A and E.

But we can avoid using known absent letters if possible.

In ""cleat"", we don't use any known absent letters (R and N). The letters in ""cleat"" are C, L, E, A, T. We know C, E, A are present (C is fixed, E and A are known to be present). L and T are new.

So ""cleat"" is better because it uses two new letters (L and T) that we don't know about, so we can get information about them.

Whereas in ""clean"", we use N which we know is absent, so we don't learn anything new about N.

Therefore, ""cleat"" is a better guess.

So I will go with ""cleat"".

But let me confirm the spelling: ""cleat"" is a valid word.

Therefore, my second guess is ""cleat"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is absent (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (-).
- N is absent (x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with C.
- It contains A and E, but A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- R and N are absent and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is currently restricted for E, so A could be in 3 or 4).
- Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 5).

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A and E (A not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Avoid R and N.
- Use new letters to gather more information (e.g., test common consonants like L, T, S).

A suitable guess is ""cleat"":
- C in position 1 (correct, as known).
- L in position 2 (new letter, not restricted).
- E in position 3 (tests a new position for E).
- A in position 4 (tests a new position for A).
- T in position 5 (new letter, and since E can't be in 5, this is safe).

This guess efficiently tests the positions of A and E while introducing new letters (L, T) for additional feedback.",Guess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CAMEO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
4. The letter N is not in the word.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we know the first letter is C.

We must avoid using R and N in any subsequent guesses because they are not in the word.

We know that A and E are in the word, but not in the positions we tried.

In the secret word:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be A (because we had A in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not there) and also cannot be R or N (which are absent). Also, we know A is somewhere else.
- Position 3: we don't know, but it cannot be R or N.
- Position 4: we don't know, but it cannot be R or N.
- Position 5: cannot be E (because we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position) and also cannot be R or N.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain R or N.

Let's think of possible words.

We know A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our first guess and we were told it's wrong position, so E is not at 5. Similarly, A is not at 2. However, note that A could be at position 1? But position 1 is C, so A cannot be at 1. Therefore, A must be at 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But note: the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at 3,4, or 5? However, we also have E that must be in the word and not at 5. So if A is at 5, then E must be at 2,3, or 4? But we don't know.

But we also have to avoid R and N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: not A, not R, not N
- Position 3: not R, not N
- Position 4: not R, not N
- Position 5: not E, not R, not N

And the word must contain A and E.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? But position 2 is open.

Let me try to think of words that start with C and have A and E.

Possible words: 
- ""cameo"": but we have M and O which we don't know about. Also, A is in position 2? But we cannot have A in position 2 because our feedback said A is not in position 2. So ""cameo"" has A at position 2 -> invalid.

- ""cable"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? But we cannot have A at 2 -> invalid.

- ""cache"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? Again, invalid.

We need a word without A in position 2.

How about ""capex""? But is that a word? Not common.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 or 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""cease"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - E at 2: we don't know if that's allowed for E? We only know E is not at 5. E can be at 2.
  - A at 3: that's a new position for A -> possible.
  - S at 4: unknown
  - E at 5: but we know E is not at 5 -> invalid because we have E at 5.

We cannot have E at 5.

So in ""cease"", the last letter is E, which is not allowed at position 5.

Another word: ""chase"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: unknown
- A at 3: good (not position 2)
- S at 4
- E at 5: not allowed.

Same problem.

We need a word that does not have E at 5 and does not have A at 2.

How about ""cadet"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: not allowed -> invalid.

""caste"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

We need to avoid A at 2.

What about ""cause""? 
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

""clause"": 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""caste"", ""crane"" we already tried.

Another idea: ""cable"" is invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""cycle""? 
- C at 1
- Y at 2
- C at 3: but we already have C at 1? The word has two C's? 
  But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had C as correct and then R, A, N, E. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But in the feedback, we had:
- C: correct (so the first C is in the word and correct)
- R: absent
- A: present but wrong position
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position

So the secret word has at least one C (at position 1) and then A and E. It does not have R or N.

But could it have two C's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we have two of the same in the guess. In ""crane"", we only have one C, so we don't know.

But in ""cycle"", we have two C's. The first C is correct. The third C: if the secret word has only one C, then the third C in ""cycle"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

We can try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 3,4 or 5 and E in position 2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

For example:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: must be a letter that is not A, not R, not N. Let me choose a common consonant, say T, L, S, etc.
- Then A in position 3,4, or 5? But if we put A in position 3, then E can be in position 4? and position 5 must be something else.

Example: ""cater""
- C at 1
- A at 2? -> invalid.

""cater"" has A at 2 -> no.

""crate"": but R is absent? We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. ""crate"" has R -> invalid.

""cleat"":
- C at 1
- L at 2: not A, not R, not N -> allowed
- E at 3: we don't know if E can be at 3? It can because we only know E is not at 5.
- A at 4: allowed (not position 2)
- T at 5: and we don't have E at 5 -> good.

Also, no R or N.

So ""cleat"" is a candidate.

But let me check: the secret word has A and E. In ""cleat"", we have A at 4 and E at 3. We don't know if that conflicts.

We also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word but not at 2. In ""cleat"", A is at 4, which is fine.

Similarly, E was at 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position, so E must be in the word but not at 5. In ""cleat"", E is at 3, which is not 5, so that's fine.

Also, we are avoiding R and N.

So ""cleat"" seems like a valid guess.

But is ""cleat"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a piece of leather or similar material.

Another candidate: ""cheap"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: allowed
- E at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed
- P at 5: allowed

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if H and P are in the word. But that's okay.

However, we have two candidates: ""cleat"" and ""cheap"". Which one to choose?

We might want to choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

But note: we already know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""cleat"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. In ""cheap"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4 as well.

But we could also try a word that puts A and E in different positions.

For example, what if we put A at position 5? But we have to avoid E at 5? We can put A at 5 and E at 2 or 3 or 4.

Example: ""cupae""? Not a word.

""cavea""? Not common.

""comae""? Not common.

So maybe it's better to stick with more common words.

Another candidate: ""chase"" but we cannot because of E at 5.

""chafe"":
- C at 1
- H at 2
- A at 3
- F at 4
- E at 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at 5.

So we avoid E at 5.

Another candidate: ""cameo"" is invalid because of A at 2.

""cadge"": A at 2 -> invalid.

""cagey"": A at 2 -> invalid.

So let's go with ""cleat"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""cease"" but we saw that has E at 5 -> invalid.

""chest"": but does it have A? No, we must include A because we know A is in the word.

So we must include A and E.

Another candidate: ""caste"" -> A at 2 invalid.

""carte"": has R -> invalid.

""cable"" -> A at 2 invalid.

So I think ""cleat"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""plate""? But it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

Another one: ""clean"":
- C at 1
- L at 2
- E at 3
- A at 4? But wait, the word is ""clean"", which has A at 5? 
  Actually: C-L-E-A-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N.

But we know N is absent! So we cannot use N. In ""clean"", the last letter is N, which is absent -> but we are going to guess it? We can guess it, but we know N is not in the word so it will be marked as absent. But that's acceptable because we are trying to find the positions of A and E.

However, we know N is not in the word, so using it in position 5 would be a waste because it will be marked absent. But we are forced to use a 5-letter word.

But in ""clean"", we have:
- Position 4: A -> which is good (not position 2)
- Position 3: E -> good (not position 5)
- But position 5: N -> which we know is absent.

So the feedback for position 5 would be x. But we already know that.

But we are using a letter we know is absent, which doesn't give us new information about the presence of letters. However, we are trying to test the positions of A and E.

But we can avoid using known absent letters if possible.

In ""cleat"", we don't use any known absent letters (R and N). The letters in ""cleat"" are C, L, E, A, T. We know C, E, A are present (C is fixed, E and A are known to be present). L and T are new.

So ""cleat"" is better because it uses two new letters (L and T) that we don't know about, so we can get information about them.

Whereas in ""clean"", we use N which we know is absent, so we don't learn anything new about N.

Therefore, ""cleat"" is a better guess.

So I will go with ""cleat"".

But let me confirm the spelling: ""cleat"" is a valid word.

Therefore, my second guess is ""cleat"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is absent (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (-).
- N is absent (x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with C.
- It contains A and E, but A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- R and N are absent and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is currently restricted for E, so A could be in 3 or 4).
- Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 5).

- L in position 2 (new letter, not restricted).
- E in position 3 (tests a new position for E).
- A in position 4 (tests a new position for A).
- T in position 5 (new letter, and since E can't be in 5, this is safe).

This guess efficiently tests the positions of A and E while introducing new letters (L, T) for additional feedback.

But if we put A in position 3, then E can be in position 4? and position 5 must be something else.\n\nExample: ""cater""\n- C at 1\n- A at 2? -> invalid.\n\n""cater"" has A at 2 -> no.\n\n""crate"": but R is absent? We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. ""crate"" has R -> invalid.\n\n""cleat"":\n- C at 1\n- L at 2: not A, not R, not N -> allowed\n- E at 3: we don\'t know if E can be at 3? It can because we only know E is not at 5.\n- A at 4: allowed (not position 2)\n- T at 5: and we don\'t have E at 5 -> good.\n\nAlso, no R or N.\n\nSo ""cleat"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me check: the secret word has A and E. In ""cleat"", we have A at 4 and E at 3. We don\'t know if that conflicts.\n\nWe also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word but not at 2. In ""cleat"", A is at 4, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, E was at 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position, so E must be in the word but not at 5. In ""cleat"", E is at 3, which is not 5, so that\'s fine.\n\nAlso, we are avoiding R and N.\n\nSo ""cleat"" seems like a valid guess.\n\nBut is ""cleat"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a piece of leather or similar material.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cheap"":\n- C at 1\n- H at 2: allowed\n- E at 3: allowed\n- A at 4: allowed\n- P at 5: allowed\n\nBut we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if H and P are in the word. But that\'s okay.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""cleat"" and ""cheap"". Which one to choose?\n\nWe might want to choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.\n\nBut note: we already know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.\n\nIn ""cleat"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. In ""cheap"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4 as well.\n\nBut we could also try a word that puts A and E in different positions.\n\nFor example, what if we put A at position 5? But we have to avoid E at 5? We can put A at 5 and E at 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nExample: ""cupae""? Not a word.\n\n""cavea""? Not common.\n\n""comae""? Not common.\n\nSo maybe it\'s better to stick with more common words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""chase"" but we cannot because of E at 5.\n\n""chafe"":\n- C at 1\n- H at 2\n- A at 3\n- F at 4\n- E at 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at 5.\n\nSo we avoid E at 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cameo"" is invalid because of A at 2.\n\n""cadge"": A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""cagey"": A at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""cleat"".\n\nBut wait, we have another candidate: ""cease"" but we saw that has E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n""chest"": but does it have A? No, we must include A because we know A is in the word.\n\nSo we must include A and E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""caste"" -> A at 2 invalid.\n\n""carte"": has R -> invalid.\n\n""cable"" -> A at 2 invalid.\n\nSo I think ""cleat"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of ""plate""? But it doesn\'t start with C.\n\nWe must start with C.\n\nAnother one: ""clean"":\n- C at 1\n- L at 2\n- E at 3\n- A at 4? But wait, the word is ""clean"", which has A at 5? \n  Actually: C-L-E-A-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N.\n\nBut we know N is absent! So we cannot use N. In ""clean"", the last letter is N, which is absent -> but we are going to guess it? We can guess it, but we know N is not in the word so it will be marked as absent. But that\'s acceptable because we are trying to find the positions of A and E.\n\nHowever, we know N is not in the word, so using it in position 5 would be a waste because it will be marked absent. But we are forced to use a 5-letter word.\n\nBut in ""clean"", we have:\n- Position 4: A -> which is good (not position 2)\n- Position 3: E -> good (not position 5)\n- But position 5: N -> which we know is absent.\n\nSo the feedback for position 5 would be x. But we already know that.\n\nBut we are using a letter we know is absent, which doesn\'t give us new information about the presence of letters. However, we are trying to test the positions of A and E.\n\nBut we can avoid using known absent letters if possible.\n\nIn ""cleat"", we don\'t use any known absent letters (R and N). The letters in ""cleat"" are C, L, E, A, T. We know C, E, A are present (C is fixed, E and A are known to be present). L and T are new.\n\nSo ""cleat"" is better because it uses two new letters (L and T) that we don\'t know about, so we can get information about them.\n\nWhereas in ""clean"", we use N which we know is absent, so we don\'t learn anything new about N.\n\nTherefore, ""cleat"" is a better guess.\n\nSo I will go with ""cleat"".\n\nBut let me confirm the spelling: ""cleat"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""cleat"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is absent (x).\n- A is present but not in position 2 (-).\n- N is absent (x).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word starts with C.\n- It contains A and E, but A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n- R and N are absent and should be avoided.\n- Possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is currently restricted for E, so A could be in 3 or 4).\n- Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4 (since it can\'t be in 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with C.\n- Must include A and E (A not in position 2, E not in position 5).\n- Avoid R and N.\n- Use new letters to gather more information (e.g., test common consonants like L, T, S).\n\nA suitable guess is ""cleat"":\n- C in position 1 (correct, as known).\n- L in position 2 (new letter, not restricted).\n- E in position 3 (tests a new position for E).\n- A in position 4 (tests a new position for A).\n- T in position 5 (new letter, and since E can\'t be in 5, this is safe).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the positions of A and E while introducing new letters (L, T) for additional feedback.\n\n<guess>cleat</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C is correct and in place. So the secret word starts with C.
- Position 2: R is not in the word (x). Also, from this, we know R is absent from the entire word.
- Position 3: A is present in the word but not in this position (so not at position 3? Wait, no: the position in the guess is position 3? Let me clarify:

Actually, in ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> ✓
- Position 2: R -> x (absent)
- Position 3: A -> - (present, but not in position 3)
- Position 4: N -> x (absent)
- Position 5: E -> - (present, but not in position 5)

So:
- Secret word: position 1 is C.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3 (because it was in position 3 of the guess and marked as wrong position).
- E is in the word, but not at position 5.
- R and N are absent.

Second guess: ""cleat"" -> Feedback: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C is correct (as we know).
- Position 2: L is absent (x). So L is not in the word.
- Position 3: E is present but not in position 3 (so E is in the word but cannot be at position 3).
- Position 4: A is present but not in position 4 (so A is in the word but cannot be at position 4).
- Position 5: T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.

Now, what we know:
- Position 1: C (fixed).
- Letters present: A, E (and C, but we already know position 1).
- Letters absent: R, N, L, T (and from the first guess, we also knew R and N were absent, now L and T added).
- Positions for A:
  - Not at position 3 (from ""crane"")
  - Not at position 4 (from ""cleat"")
  - Also, not at position 2 because in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and marked as wrong position? Wait, no: in ""crane"", position 3 had A? Wait, let me map ""crane"":
    - c ->1, r->2, a->3, n->4, e->5
    So A was at position 3 and marked as wrong position? Actually, the feedback was for position 3: A(-) meaning it's present but not in position 3. Then in ""cleat"":
    - cleat: c(1), l(2), e(3), a(4), t(5)
    - Position 3: E -> feedback (-), meaning E present but not at position 3.
    - Position 4: A -> feedback (-), meaning A present but not at position 4.

Therefore:
- A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). Also, in the first guess, A was at position 3? But we also know from the first guess that A was placed in position 3 and it was not correct, so A is not at position 3. Now with ""cleat"" we tried A at position 4 and it was wrong position, so A is not at position 4. Also, we haven't tried position 5 for A? And note: A cannot be at position 2 because it was tried in ""crane"" at position 2? Wait, no: in ""crane"", the second letter was 'r' (position 2) which was absent, but the A was at position 3. So we never tried A at position 2? Actually, we haven't placed A at position 2 in any guess. But position 2 we have tried: in first guess it was R (absent), in second guess it was L (absent), so we don't know about A at position 2? Wait, but in the first guess, the feedback for position 2 was R -> x, which doesn't say anything about A because A was in a different position. So A could theoretically be at position 2? But wait: no, because we have a constraint: in the first guess, we placed A at position 3 and got the feedback that it is present but not in position 3. But that doesn't prevent A from being in position 2? Let me clarify:

The feedback doesn't say anything directly about position 2 for A. However, note that when we placed A at position 3 and got '-' that means A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, when we placed A at position 4 (in ""cleat"") and got '-', that means A is in the word but not at position 4.

So A must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 or 4. Since position 1 is C (fixed), the only remaining positions are 2 and 5.

Therefore, A must be either at position 2 or position 5.

Similarly, for E:
- In first guess (position 5): E at position 5 and got '-' so present but not at position 5.
- In second guess (position 3): E at position 3 and got '-' so present but not at position 3.

Therefore, E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.

Since position 1 is C, E must be at position 2 or 4.

Now, let's recap:
- Secret word positions:
  - 1: C
  - 2: potential for A or E? But A or E must be placed in the remaining positions.
  - Specifically:
    - A must be at 2 or 5.
    - E must be at 2 or 4.

But note, we have two letters and three positions? No: positions 2, 4, and 5 are available? But position 4 is available for E? And we have two letters A and E to place, and we know the word contains exactly these two besides C? We don't know the word has exactly three distinct letters? It might have more.

We only know the letters present so far: C (at1), A, and E. And we've eliminated R, N, L, T. So the other two letters are unknown.

The word is 5 letters: C _ _ _ _

We know A is at either position 2 or 5, and E is at either position 2 or 4? But position 2 can't be both A and E at the same time. So:

If A is at 2, then E must be at 4? Because E cannot be at 2 if A is there? But if E is at 4, then position 5 is another letter.

If E is at 2, then A must be at 5? Because E at 2 and A cannot be at 3 or 4? Also, if E at 2, then A at 5.

Therefore, two scenarios:
1. A at position 2, E at position 4. Then position 3? Unknown, and position 5? Unknown.
2. E at position 2, A at position 5. Then position 3? Unknown, position 4? Unknown.

But wait, in scenario 1: if A is at position 2, and E is at position 4? But position 3 and 5 are open? Similarly, scenario 2: position 3 and position 4 are open.

Now, we also know that the word has two more letters? Because A and E we have already.

We need to form a word that fits one of these patterns.

Also, we have eliminated letters: R, N, L, T. And we know absent letters.

We need to choose a new guess that fits one of these patterns and avoids R,N,L,T.

For scenario 1: word pattern: C A _ E _ 
For scenario 2: word pattern: C E _ _ A 

We want a word that has neither of the absent letters and that tests between these scenarios.

But we don't know which scenario it is. So we can choose a word that fits one scenario and we get feedback accordingly.

We could also choose a word that has A at position 5 and E at position 4? But wait, E cannot be at position 4? Or can it? We know E cannot be at position 3 or 5? But we haven't tried position 4 for E? The constraints: E cannot be at positions 3 or 5? Yes? Because we tried position 3 and 5? We tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 3 in ""cleat"", and both were marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: for position 5 in ""crane"" E -> '-', meaning it is present but not in position 5? So E cannot be in position 5? And from ""cleat"", E at position 3 -> '-', meaning E cannot be in position 3. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, A must be in position 2 or 5.

Therefore, E can be in position 4? Yes, in fact, one of the scenarios above.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First scenario: C A ? E ? 

Possible words: 
- ""camel"": but L is absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cameo"": again L? No, ""cameo"" has M E O? But E is at position 4? 
  - C A M E O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:M, 4:E, 5:O. 
  But we know L is absent, but here no L? And T absent? And R,N absent? So ""cameo"" has letters: C,A,M,E,O. 
  But is O acceptable? We don't know about O.

But check absent letters: R,N,L,T are absent? We haven't used M,O so we can try.

But we also need to see if it fits: A at 2, E at 4 -> valid.

But ""cameo"" might be a word? Yes.

Second scenario: C E ? ? A 

Possible words: 
- ""ceiba"": but B and I? We don't know about B and I. And is it a word? (a type of tree)
- ""cecal"": but L is absent -> invalid? L cannot be used.

What about ""cease""? But S and E? 
- ""cease"": C E A S E? 
  Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E. 
  But A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess feedback)! 

So ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden.

Another: ""cella"": L is absent -> invalid.

""cebta""? Not a word.

We need a word that fits pattern C E ? ? A and without using absent letters.

So positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:?, 4:?, 5:A.

Must avoid letters R,N,L,T.

And A cannot be at position 3? But in this pattern, A is at position 5? So position 3 is an unknown letter? And position 4 is unknown.

Possible words: 
- ""cesta"": but S and T? T is absent -> invalid.
- ""cetra"": R and T absent -> invalid.
- ""ceiba"": I and B? Valid letters? We haven't eliminated I or B.

But ""ceiba"" is a word? (a tropical tree) -> valid? Let's assume it is.

But we have another possibility: what about ""cense""? But N is absent -> invalid? Because N is absent? In ""cense"": C E N S E -> contains N, so invalid because N is absent.

Another word: ""ceorl"": but O and R and L? Absent letters -> invalid.

So ""ceiba"" is a candidate? But we are not sure if it's common.

But maybe we can think of more common words.

What about ""cobra"": 
- Pattern: C O B R A? That's C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4)???, A(5)? But R is absent -> invalid.

Another: ""chapel""? But letter count? 6 letters.

5 letters: ""cupra""? Not common.

Perhaps scenario 1 (""ca?e?"") has more possibilities.

Scenario 1: C A ? E ? 

Words:
- ""camel"": but L at the end? Position 5: L -> absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cameo"": as before? C A M E O -> letters: C,A,M,E,O. Absent letters: R,N,L,T are not in this word? So we can try? But we don't know if M and O are present? So acceptable? But we can guess ""cameo"" if we want to test the scenario.

But wait, note that in ""cameo"", we have E at position 4? And we would get feedback: if the secret word has E at position 4? Or not.

But let's see: we need to distinguish between the two scenarios.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that fits scenario 1? Or one that fits scenario 2? Or a hybrid? But we don't have to necessarily fit a scenario? We can use a guess that doesn't follow either pattern? But we must include the known letters? Not necessarily? The rules say each guess must be a valid English word? And we should aim to get information.

We could choose a word that has A in position 5 and E in position 4? But wait, for E: can E be in position 4? Yes, because E must be at 2 or 4? So in position 4? Similarly, A must be at 2 or 5? So if we put A at position 5 and E at position 4, that's within possibility? But that's actually scenario 2? Scenario 2 has E at position 2? And A at 5? Or in our scenarios, we have:

Scenario 1: C A ? E ? (so A at2, E at4)
Scenario 2: C E ? ? A (so E at2, A at5)

But we haven't considered the possibility: could we have A at position 5 and E at position 4? That would be pattern: C _ _ E A.

For example, ""cover""? but O,V,E,R -> R absent -> invalid.

But in this pattern: 

- Position 1: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: A

Then position 2 and 3 are unknown? Wait, but also E must be present? But position 4 is E? So that's fine? And A at position 5.

But we would have pattern: C * * E A? Positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:A.

Is this consistent with the constraints? 
- A must be at 2 or 5? In this pattern, A is at 5? Yes.
- E must be at position 2 or 4? In this pattern, E is at position 4? Yes.

So this is a valid possibility: pattern C??EA.

Similarly, we could have E at position 2 and A at position? Wait, no: we already have scenario 2: C E _ _ A.

So actually, there are three possibilities? Or two? Because in pattern C??EA, we have specified positions 4 and 5 as E and A? But in scenario 2, we have E at 2 and A at 5? So different.

Let me summarize:

The possible positions for E and A:

We must place:
- E at either position 2 or position 4.
- A at either position 2 or position 5? But if both are at position 2, conflict? So:

Case 1: E at position 2? Then A must be at position 5? Because A cannot be at 3 or 4? And position 1 is taken? So A at 5? Then positions 3 and 4: unknown letters.

Case 2: E at position 4? Then A must be either at position 2 or position 5? But if A at position 2, then E at position 4? But position 2: if E is at position 4 and A at position 2? Then that's one case: C A _ E _? Where _ is position? Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:?, 4:E, 5:another letter? Or if E at position 4 and A at position 5? Then pattern: C _ _ E A.

Therefore, there are actually three possibilities:

Possibility A: E at 2, A at 5? Then word pattern: C E ? ? A

Possibility B: E at 4, A at 2? Then word pattern: C A ? E ?

Possibility C: E at 4, A at 5? Then word pattern: C ? ? E A

So three possibilities.

Therefore, we need a word that can differentially test these? Or we can guess a word that matches one of them and see the feedback.

But note: we have three cases? But we don't know which one it is.

We want to guess a word that has been used? Or not? But let's find a common word that matches one of the patterns and avoids absent letters.

But we must avoid R,N,L,T.

Possibility A: pattern C E ? ? A
- Examples: ""ceiba"" (as before) or ""cezva""? Not common.
- ""cepa"" ? 4 letters.

Finding a word with C E ? ? A: 
- ""cebra"": not common? Or ""cecal"" -> but L absent -> invalid.
- ""cesar"": has R -> invalid.
- ""cesta"": has T? T absent -> invalid.

So maybe not many common options.

Possibility B: pattern C A ? E ? 
- Examples: ""cameo"", ""camel"" (but L absent? ""camel"" ends with L -> invalid), ""caper""? But R? ""caper"" has R -> invalid.
- ""cater"" has R -> invalid.
- ""cases""? But S and E? Pattern: C A S E S? That would be: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S? Now, E at position 4? But we know E must be at 2 or 4? But in this pattern, E is at 4? Also, S we don't know about? And no R,N,L,T? So ""cases"" is possible? But ""cases"" is a valid word? Yes.

But does it have S at the end? Okay.

But let's write the pattern for ""cases"": 
C A S E S? Position1: C, position2: A, position3: S, position4: E, position5: S? But does S appear twice? That's okay? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? It is possible.

Also, we can use this.

Possibility C: pattern C ? ? E A
- Examples: ""covea""? Not common? ""cupra""? Not common.
- ""crone"": R and N absent -> invalid.
- ""chela"": L and H? L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cupea""? Not common.

Not many common words.

Therefore, we can try to go with ""cases"" as a guess? It matches possibility B: C A S E S? With E at position 4 and A at position 2.

But also, ""cases"" has S as the third and fifth letters? That's fine.

Now, is this a valid word? Yes.

But we need to see if it's a good guess? We are also testing? If we guess ""cases"", then:

If the secret word is possibility B (C A ? E ?), then in our guess, A is at 2 and E at 4? Also, S at 3 would be tested? And S at 5 tested.

If the secret word is possibility A (C E ? ? A) then in ""cases"", first letter C correct? Then A at position 2: we think it might be there? But if not, then feedback: position 2: A? If the secret word has A at position 5, then A at position 2 might be marked absent? Or present? Or wait? No: the secret word has A? So A is present? But if the secret word is possibility A, then A is at position 5? So in ""cases"", A at position 2: the secret word doesn't have A at position 2? So we get feedback for position 2: A(-) or A(x)? Actually, if A is present (which it is) but not at position 2? Then we would get A(-), meaning present but wrong position? Similarly, E at position 4: if secret has E at position 2, then position 4: wrong? Then we would get: position 4: E(-) or E(x)? Secret has E at position 2? So E is present? But not at position 4? So E at position 4 would be marked as wrong position? So overall, if we guess ""cases"", we get feedback:

- Position 1: C ✓ (as always)
- Position 2: A? If secret is possibility B (C A ...) then A✓? But if possibility A or C, then A might be in correct position? Or not?

But let's evaluate:

If secret is possibility A (C E ? ? A)? Then in ""cases"", position 2: A (guessed) vs secret position 2: E? So A is not E, but there is A in the word at position 5? So A is present? But not at position 2? So we would get A(-) (present but wrong position? Or just present? The symbol is '-' for present but wrong position? Or if it is present, we'll get '-' if not in correct position? But position 2? Secret has E, so A is not correct at position 2? But A is in the word? So A( - )

Similarly for E: if secret is possibility A, then E is at position 2? So in ""cases"", position 4: E? Secret position 4 is not E? But secret has E? So E at position 4 would be present but wrong position? So E(-)

Then position 5: S? Secret position 5 is A? So S is absent? If S is not present? Then S(x)

Then position 3: S? Secret has something at position 3? If S is present? But we don't know? It might not be, so S(x) if absent? Or if present but not at position 3, then S(-)

So the feedback would help us rule out and then we have to guess again.

But we are limited by the number of tries.

Therefore, perhaps better to choose a word that covers both scenarios? But it's hard.

Another idea: we can try to put E in position 2 and A in position 4? But wait, A cannot be in position 4? We know A cannot be in position 4? From feedback? In ""cleat"", A at position 4 was marked '-' meaning present but not in position 4? So we cannot put A at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot put E at positions 3 or 5? But we can put E at position 2 or 4? And A at position 2 or 5? But if we put E? But in a guess, we can put E at position 4 and A at position 2? Which is possibility B? Or E at position 2 and A at position 5? Possibility A? Or E at position 4 and A at position 5? Possibility C.

But in possibility C, we can try a word like ""cause""? But let's see: ""cause"" has A at position 5? Wait, ""cause"": C A U S E? Which is C A U S E? 
- Position 1: C
- 2: A? But we are considering possibility C: C ? ? E A? That doesn't match? ""cause"" would be pattern C A U S E? So E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? So ""cause"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? Because of first feedback? So we cannot guess ""cause"".

Similarly, no word can have E at position 5? Because that's not allowed? We only know E cannot be at positions 3 and 5? So at 2 or 4.

So let's go back.

We have three patterns:

Pat A: C E ? ? A  (E at2, A at5)
Pat B: C A ? E ?  (A at2, E at4)
Pat C: C ? ? E A  (E at4, A at5)

We can choose a guess that matches one? And see? For Pat C, possible words: without using R,N,L,T? So C ? ? E A? 
- ""covea"" not common.
- ""chapea"" too long.
- ""cupel""? ""cupel"" is C U P E L? But L at the end? And L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cubic""? ends with C.

Hard to find. So maybe Pat C is less likely? We can start by guessing for Pat B: ""cases""?

Or we can choose ""cameo"" for Pat B.

But ""cameo"" has letters C,A,M,E,O.

If we guess ""cameo"", then:
- In Pat A: secret is C E ? ? A? Then we can see the feedback? For example, position? Will it give us information.

But let's finalize.

We could guess ""cease"", but ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden? Because A cannot be at position 3? From the first guess? So ""cease"" is invalid? Cannot be guessed? Or we can guess? But we know it's not the word because A can't be at 3? But we don't know the word; we can guess it? But it would waste a guess.

So better not.

Therefore, let me choose ""cases"" for Pat B.

But ""cases"" uses S twice? And we don't know about S? So we can test for presence of S as well.

So guess ""cases"".

Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.

But let's see today's secret word? We don't know? But we have to guess.

Perhaps guess ""cause""? But earlier I saw that the fifth letter is E? Which is not allowed? Because E cannot be in position 5? ""cause"" -> E at position 5? That violates our knowledge? So we cannot guess words with E at position 5? Because we know it's present but not at position 5? So guessing ""cause"" would be bad? Because we intentionally put E at position 5? Which we  know is wrong? So we wouldn't do that? So avoid putting E at position 5? And avoid putting A at position 3 or 4.

Therefore, for our guess, avoid positions we know are wrong.

So go with ""cases"": it has A at position 2 (we want to test if that's correct) and E at position 4 (test if correct) and no known absent letters.

Letters in ""cases"": C,A,S,E,S? We know C, A, E are present? And S is new? If S is present, we get feedback? Or not? So the feedback will tell us.

So we guess ""cases"".

But wait, in ""cases"", the fifth letter is S? So if the secret word is pat C: C ? ? E A, then position 5: A? So in ""cases"", we are putting S there? It could be absent? Then we know S is absent and we learn that.

Also, position 3: S? Etc.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""cases"".

But to make it with only distinct letters? Not necessary.

Another option: ""capex""? Not common.

We've used many letters? Doesn't matter.

Guess ""cases"".
</think>
The feedback from the first two guesses provides the following insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 is fixed).
- **A** must be in position 2 or 5 (it cannot be in position 3 or 4 based on feedback).
- **E** must be in position 2 or 4 (it cannot be in position 3 or 5 based on feedback).
- **R**, **N**, **L**, and **T** are absent and must be avoided.
- The word must include both **A** and **E**, alongside **C**, with two other unknown letters.

Given these constraints, three possible patterns emerge:
1. **C E ? ? A** (E at position 2, A at position 5)
2. **C A ? E ?** (A at position 2, E at position 4)
3. **C ? ? E A** (E at position 4, A at position 5)

After considering common English words that fit these patterns and avoid absent letters, **cases** is selected as the next guess:
- It matches pattern 2 (**C A ? E ?**), testing A at position 2 and E at position 4.
- It uses **S** (new letters) to gather additional information without conflicting with known absent letters.
- It is a valid word that adheres to the feedback constraints.

<guess>cases</guess>",cases,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C is correct and in place. So the secret word starts with C.
- Position 2: R is not in the word (x). Also, from this, we know R is absent from the entire word.
- Position 3: A is present in the word but not in this position (so not at position 3? Wait, no: the position in the guess is position 3? Let me clarify:

Actually, in ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> ✓
- Position 2: R -> x (absent)
- Position 3: A -> - (present, but not in position 3)
- Position 4: N -> x (absent)
- Position 5: E -> - (present, but not in position 5)

So:
- Secret word: position 1 is C.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3 (because it was in position 3 of the guess and marked as wrong position).
- E is in the word, but not at position 5.
- R and N are absent.

Second guess: ""cleat"" -> Feedback: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C is correct (as we know).
- Position 2: L is absent (x). So L is not in the word.
- Position 3: E is present but not in position 3 (so E is in the word but cannot be at position 3).
- Position 4: A is present but not in position 4 (so A is in the word but cannot be at position 4).
- Position 5: T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.

Now, what we know:
- Position 1: C (fixed).
- Letters present: A, E (and C, but we already know position 1).
- Letters absent: R, N, L, T (and from the first guess, we also knew R and N were absent, now L and T added).
- Positions for A:
  - Not at position 3 (from ""crane"")
  - Not at position 4 (from ""cleat"")
  - Also, not at position 2 because in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and marked as wrong position? Wait, no: in ""crane"", position 3 had A? Wait, let me map ""crane"":
    - c ->1, r->2, a->3, n->4, e->5
    So A was at position 3 and marked as wrong position? Actually, the feedback was for position 3: A(-) meaning it's present but not in position 3. Then in ""cleat"":
    - cleat: c(1), l(2), e(3), a(4), t(5)
    - Position 3: E -> feedback (-), meaning E present but not at position 3.
    - Position 4: A -> feedback (-), meaning A present but not at position 4.

Therefore:
- A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). Also, in the first guess, A was at position 3? But we also know from the first guess that A was placed in position 3 and it was not correct, so A is not at position 3. Now with ""cleat"" we tried A at position 4 and it was wrong position, so A is not at position 4. Also, we haven't tried position 5 for A? And note: A cannot be at position 2 because it was tried in ""crane"" at position 2? Wait, no: in ""crane"", the second letter was 'r' (position 2) which was absent, but the A was at position 3. So we never tried A at position 2? Actually, we haven't placed A at position 2 in any guess. But position 2 we have tried: in first guess it was R (absent), in second guess it was L (absent), so we don't know about A at position 2? Wait, but in the first guess, the feedback for position 2 was R -> x, which doesn't say anything about A because A was in a different position. So A could theoretically be at position 2? But wait: no, because we have a constraint: in the first guess, we placed A at position 3 and got the feedback that it is present but not in position 3. But that doesn't prevent A from being in position 2? Let me clarify:

The feedback doesn't say anything directly about position 2 for A. However, note that when we placed A at position 3 and got '-' that means A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, when we placed A at position 4 (in ""cleat"") and got '-', that means A is in the word but not at position 4.

So A must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 or 4. Since position 1 is C (fixed), the only remaining positions are 2 and 5.

Therefore, A must be either at position 2 or position 5.

Similarly, for E:
- In first guess (position 5): E at position 5 and got '-' so present but not at position 5.
- In second guess (position 3): E at position 3 and got '-' so present but not at position 3.

Therefore, E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.

Since position 1 is C, E must be at position 2 or 4.

Now, let's recap:
- Secret word positions:
  - 1: C
  - 2: potential for A or E? But A or E must be placed in the remaining positions.
  - Specifically:
    - A must be at 2 or 5.
    - E must be at 2 or 4.

But note, we have two letters and three positions? No: positions 2, 4, and 5 are available? But position 4 is available for E? And we have two letters A and E to place, and we know the word contains exactly these two besides C? We don't know the word has exactly three distinct letters? It might have more.

We only know the letters present so far: C (at1), A, and E. And we've eliminated R, N, L, T. So the other two letters are unknown.

The word is 5 letters: C _ _ _ _

We know A is at either position 2 or 5, and E is at either position 2 or 4? But position 2 can't be both A and E at the same time. So:

If A is at 2, then E must be at 4? Because E cannot be at 2 if A is there? But if E is at 4, then position 5 is another letter.

If E is at 2, then A must be at 5? Because E at 2 and A cannot be at 3 or 4? Also, if E at 2, then A at 5.

Therefore, two scenarios:
1. A at position 2, E at position 4. Then position 3? Unknown, and position 5? Unknown.
2. E at position 2, A at position 5. Then position 3? Unknown, position 4? Unknown.

But wait, in scenario 1: if A is at position 2, and E is at position 4? But position 3 and 5 are open? Similarly, scenario 2: position 3 and position 4 are open.

Now, we also know that the word has two more letters? Because A and E we have already.

We need to form a word that fits one of these patterns.

Also, we have eliminated letters: R, N, L, T. And we know absent letters.

We need to choose a new guess that fits one of these patterns and avoids R,N,L,T.

For scenario 1: word pattern: C A _ E _ 
For scenario 2: word pattern: C E _ _ A 

We want a word that has neither of the absent letters and that tests between these scenarios.

But we don't know which scenario it is. So we can choose a word that fits one scenario and we get feedback accordingly.

We could also choose a word that has A at position 5 and E at position 4? But wait, E cannot be at position 4? Or can it? We know E cannot be at position 3 or 5? But we haven't tried position 4 for E? The constraints: E cannot be at positions 3 or 5? Yes? Because we tried position 3 and 5? We tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 3 in ""cleat"", and both were marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: for position 5 in ""crane"" E -> '-', meaning it is present but not in position 5? So E cannot be in position 5? And from ""cleat"", E at position 3 -> '-', meaning E cannot be in position 3. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, A must be in position 2 or 5.

Therefore, E can be in position 4? Yes, in fact, one of the scenarios above.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First scenario: C A ? E ? 

Possible words: 
- ""camel"": but L is absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cameo"": again L? No, ""cameo"" has M E O? But E is at position 4? 
  - C A M E O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:M, 4:E, 5:O. 
  But we know L is absent, but here no L? And T absent? And R,N absent? So ""cameo"" has letters: C,A,M,E,O. 
  But is O acceptable? We don't know about O.

But check absent letters: R,N,L,T are absent? We haven't used M,O so we can try.

But we also need to see if it fits: A at 2, E at 4 -> valid.

But ""cameo"" might be a word? Yes.

Second scenario: C E ? ? A 

Possible words: 
- ""ceiba"": but B and I? We don't know about B and I. And is it a word? (a type of tree)
- ""cecal"": but L is absent -> invalid? L cannot be used.

What about ""cease""? But S and E? 
- ""cease"": C E A S E? 
  Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E. 
  But A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess feedback)! 

So ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden.

Another: ""cella"": L is absent -> invalid.

""cebta""? Not a word.

We need a word that fits pattern C E ? ? A and without using absent letters.

So positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:?, 4:?, 5:A.

Must avoid letters R,N,L,T.

And A cannot be at position 3? But in this pattern, A is at position 5? So position 3 is an unknown letter? And position 4 is unknown.

Possible words: 
- ""cesta"": but S and T? T is absent -> invalid.
- ""cetra"": R and T absent -> invalid.
- ""ceiba"": I and B? Valid letters? We haven't eliminated I or B.

But ""ceiba"" is a word? (a tropical tree) -> valid? Let's assume it is.

But we have another possibility: what about ""cense""? But N is absent -> invalid? Because N is absent? In ""cense"": C E N S E -> contains N, so invalid because N is absent.

Another word: ""ceorl"": but O and R and L? Absent letters -> invalid.

So ""ceiba"" is a candidate? But we are not sure if it's common.

But maybe we can think of more common words.

What about ""cobra"": 
- Pattern: C O B R A? That's C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4)???, A(5)? But R is absent -> invalid.

Another: ""chapel""? But letter count? 6 letters.

5 letters: ""cupra""? Not common.

Perhaps scenario 1 (""ca?e?"") has more possibilities.

Scenario 1: C A ? E ? 

Words:
- ""camel"": but L at the end? Position 5: L -> absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cameo"": as before? C A M E O -> letters: C,A,M,E,O. Absent letters: R,N,L,T are not in this word? So we can try? But we don't know if M and O are present? So acceptable? But we can guess ""cameo"" if we want to test the scenario.

But wait, note that in ""cameo"", we have E at position 4? And we would get feedback: if the secret word has E at position 4? Or not.

But let's see: we need to distinguish between the two scenarios.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that fits scenario 1? Or one that fits scenario 2? Or a hybrid? But we don't have to necessarily fit a scenario? We can use a guess that doesn't follow either pattern? But we must include the known letters? Not necessarily? The rules say each guess must be a valid English word? And we should aim to get information.

We could choose a word that has A in position 5 and E in position 4? But wait, for E: can E be in position 4? Yes, because E must be at 2 or 4? So in position 4? Similarly, A must be at 2 or 5? So if we put A at position 5 and E at position 4, that's within possibility? But that's actually scenario 2? Scenario 2 has E at position 2? And A at 5? Or in our scenarios, we have:

Scenario 1: C A ? E ? (so A at2, E at4)
Scenario 2: C E ? ? A (so E at2, A at5)

But we haven't considered the possibility: could we have A at position 5 and E at position 4? That would be pattern: C _ _ E A.

For example, ""cover""? but O,V,E,R -> R absent -> invalid.

But in this pattern: 

- Position 1: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: A

Then position 2 and 3 are unknown? Wait, but also E must be present? But position 4 is E? So that's fine? And A at position 5.

But we would have pattern: C * * E A? Positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:A.

Is this consistent with the constraints? 
- A must be at 2 or 5? In this pattern, A is at 5? Yes.
- E must be at position 2 or 4? In this pattern, E is at position 4? Yes.

So this is a valid possibility: pattern C??EA.

Similarly, we could have E at position 2 and A at position? Wait, no: we already have scenario 2: C E _ _ A.

So actually, there are three possibilities? Or two? Because in pattern C??EA, we have specified positions 4 and 5 as E and A? But in scenario 2, we have E at 2 and A at 5? So different.

Let me summarize:

The possible positions for E and A:

We must place:
- E at either position 2 or position 4.
- A at either position 2 or position 5? But if both are at position 2, conflict? So:

Case 1: E at position 2? Then A must be at position 5? Because A cannot be at 3 or 4? And position 1 is taken? So A at 5? Then positions 3 and 4: unknown letters.

Case 2: E at position 4? Then A must be either at position 2 or position 5? But if A at position 2, then E at position 4? But position 2: if E is at position 4 and A at position 2? Then that's one case: C A _ E _? Where _ is position? Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:?, 4:E, 5:another letter? Or if E at position 4 and A at position 5? Then pattern: C _ _ E A.

Therefore, there are actually three possibilities:

Possibility A: E at 2, A at 5? Then word pattern: C E ? ? A

Possibility B: E at 4, A at 2? Then word pattern: C A ? E ?

Possibility C: E at 4, A at 5? Then word pattern: C ? ? E A

So three possibilities.

Therefore, we need a word that can differentially test these? Or we can guess a word that matches one of them and see the feedback.

But note: we have three cases? But we don't know which one it is.

We want to guess a word that has been used? Or not? But let's find a common word that matches one of the patterns and avoids absent letters.

But we must avoid R,N,L,T.

Possibility A: pattern C E ? ? A
- Examples: ""ceiba"" (as before) or ""cezva""? Not common.
- ""cepa"" ? 4 letters.

Finding a word with C E ? ? A: 
- ""cebra"": not common? Or ""cecal"" -> but L absent -> invalid.
- ""cesar"": has R -> invalid.
- ""cesta"": has T? T absent -> invalid.

So maybe not many common options.

Possibility B: pattern C A ? E ? 
- Examples: ""cameo"", ""camel"" (but L absent? ""camel"" ends with L -> invalid), ""caper""? But R? ""caper"" has R -> invalid.
- ""cater"" has R -> invalid.
- ""cases""? But S and E? Pattern: C A S E S? That would be: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S? Now, E at position 4? But we know E must be at 2 or 4? But in this pattern, E is at 4? Also, S we don't know about? And no R,N,L,T? So ""cases"" is possible? But ""cases"" is a valid word? Yes.

But does it have S at the end? Okay.

But let's write the pattern for ""cases"": 
C A S E S? Position1: C, position2: A, position3: S, position4: E, position5: S? But does S appear twice? That's okay? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? It is possible.

Also, we can use this.

Possibility C: pattern C ? ? E A
- Examples: ""covea""? Not common? ""cupra""? Not common.
- ""crone"": R and N absent -> invalid.
- ""chela"": L and H? L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cupea""? Not common.

Not many common words.

Therefore, we can try to go with ""cases"" as a guess? It matches possibility B: C A S E S? With E at position 4 and A at position 2.

But also, ""cases"" has S as the third and fifth letters? That's fine.

Now, is this a valid word? Yes.

But we need to see if it's a good guess? We are also testing? If we guess ""cases"", then:

If the secret word is possibility B (C A ? E ?), then in our guess, A is at 2 and E at 4? Also, S at 3 would be tested? And S at 5 tested.

If the secret word is possibility A (C E ? ? A) then in ""cases"", first letter C correct? Then A at position 2: we think it might be there? But if not, then feedback: position 2: A? If the secret word has A at position 5, then A at position 2 might be marked absent? Or present? Or wait? No: the secret word has A? So A is present? But if the secret word is possibility A, then A is at position 5? So in ""cases"", A at position 2: the secret word doesn't have A at position 2? So we get feedback for position 2: A(-) or A(x)? Actually, if A is present (which it is) but not at position 2? Then we would get A(-), meaning present but wrong position? Similarly, E at position 4: if secret has E at position 2, then position 4: wrong? Then we would get: position 4: E(-) or E(x)? Secret has E at position 2? So E is present? But not at position 4? So E at position 4 would be marked as wrong position? So overall, if we guess ""cases"", we get feedback:

- Position 1: C ✓ (as always)
- Position 2: A? If secret is possibility B (C A ...) then A✓? But if possibility A or C, then A might be in correct position? Or not?

But let's evaluate:

If secret is possibility A (C E ? ? A)? Then in ""cases"", position 2: A (guessed) vs secret position 2: E? So A is not E, but there is A in the word at position 5? So A is present? But not at position 2? So we would get A(-) (present but wrong position? Or just present? The symbol is '-' for present but wrong position? Or if it is present, we'll get '-' if not in correct position? But position 2? Secret has E, so A is not correct at position 2? But A is in the word? So A( - )

Similarly for E: if secret is possibility A, then E is at position 2? So in ""cases"", position 4: E? Secret position 4 is not E? But secret has E? So E at position 4 would be present but wrong position? So E(-)

Then position 5: S? Secret position 5 is A? So S is absent? If S is not present? Then S(x)

Then position 3: S? Secret has something at position 3? If S is present? But we don't know? It might not be, so S(x) if absent? Or if present but not at position 3, then S(-)

So the feedback would help us rule out and then we have to guess again.

But we are limited by the number of tries.

Therefore, perhaps better to choose a word that covers both scenarios? But it's hard.

Another idea: we can try to put E in position 2 and A in position 4? But wait, A cannot be in position 4? We know A cannot be in position 4? From feedback? In ""cleat"", A at position 4 was marked '-' meaning present but not in position 4? So we cannot put A at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot put E at positions 3 or 5? But we can put E at position 2 or 4? And A at position 2 or 5? But if we put E? But in a guess, we can put E at position 4 and A at position 2? Which is possibility B? Or E at position 2 and A at position 5? Possibility A? Or E at position 4 and A at position 5? Possibility C.

But in possibility C, we can try a word like ""cause""? But let's see: ""cause"" has A at position 5? Wait, ""cause"": C A U S E? Which is C A U S E? 
- Position 1: C
- 2: A? But we are considering possibility C: C ? ? E A? That doesn't match? ""cause"" would be pattern C A U S E? So E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? So ""cause"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? Because of first feedback? So we cannot guess ""cause"".

Similarly, no word can have E at position 5? Because that's not allowed? We only know E cannot be at positions 3 and 5? So at 2 or 4.

So let's go back.

We have three patterns:

Pat A: C E ? ? A  (E at2, A at5)
Pat B: C A ? E ?  (A at2, E at4)
Pat C: C ? ? E A  (E at4, A at5)

We can choose a guess that matches one? And see? For Pat C, possible words: without using R,N,L,T? So C ? ? E A? 
- ""covea"" not common.
- ""chapea"" too long.
- ""cupel""? ""cupel"" is C U P E L? But L at the end? And L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cubic""? ends with C.

Hard to find. So maybe Pat C is less likely? We can start by guessing for Pat B: ""cases""?

Or we can choose ""cameo"" for Pat B.

But ""cameo"" has letters C,A,M,E,O.

If we guess ""cameo"", then:
- In Pat A: secret is C E ? ? A? Then we can see the feedback? For example, position? Will it give us information.

But let's finalize.

We could guess ""cease"", but ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden? Because A cannot be at position 3? From the first guess? So ""cease"" is invalid? Cannot be guessed? Or we can guess? But we know it's not the word because A can't be at 3? But we don't know the word; we can guess it? But it would waste a guess.

So better not.

Therefore, let me choose ""cases"" for Pat B.

But ""cases"" uses S twice? And we don't know about S? So we can test for presence of S as well.

So guess ""cases"".

Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.

But let's see today's secret word? We don't know? But we have to guess.

Perhaps guess ""cause""? But earlier I saw that the fifth letter is E? Which is not allowed? Because E cannot be in position 5? ""cause"" -> E at position 5? That violates our knowledge? So we cannot guess words with E at position 5? Because we know it's present but not at position 5? So guessing ""cause"" would be bad? Because we intentionally put E at position 5? Which we  know is wrong? So we wouldn't do that? So avoid putting E at position 5? And avoid putting A at position 3 or 4.

Therefore, for our guess, avoid positions we know are wrong.

So go with ""cases"": it has A at position 2 (we want to test if that's correct) and E at position 4 (test if correct) and no known absent letters.

Letters in ""cases"": C,A,S,E,S? We know C, A, E are present? And S is new? If S is present, we get feedback? Or not? So the feedback will tell us.

So we guess ""cases"".

But wait, in ""cases"", the fifth letter is S? So if the secret word is pat C: C ? ? E A, then position 5: A? So in ""cases"", we are putting S there? It could be absent? Then we know S is absent and we learn that.

Also, position 3: S? Etc.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""cases"".

But to make it with only distinct letters? Not necessary.

Another option: ""capex""? Not common.

We've used many letters? Doesn't matter.

Guess ""cases"".The feedback from the first two guesses provides the following insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 is fixed).
- **A** must be in position 2 or 5 (it cannot be in position 3 or 4 based on feedback).
- **E** must be in position 2 or 4 (it cannot be in position 3 or 5 based on feedback).
- **R**, **N**, **L**, and **T** are absent and must be avoided.
- The word must include both **A** and **E**, alongside **C**, with two other unknown letters.

Given these constraints, three possible patterns emerge:
1. **C E ? ? A** (E at position 2, A at position 5)
2. **C A ? E ?** (A at position 2, E at position 4)
3. **C ? ? E A** (E at position 4, A at position 5)

After considering common English words that fit these patterns and avoid absent letters, **cases** is selected as the next guess:
- It matches pattern 2 (**C A ? E ?**), testing A at position 2 and E at position 4.
- It uses **S** (new letters) to gather additional information without conflicting with known absent letters.
- It is a valid word that adheres to the feedback constraints.",Guess 3: cases -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) S(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,CAMEO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
4. The letter N is not in the word.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we know the first letter is C.

We must avoid using R and N in any subsequent guesses because they are not in the word.

We know that A and E are in the word, but not in the positions we tried.

In the secret word:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be A (because we had A in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not there) and also cannot be R or N (which are absent). Also, we know A is somewhere else.
- Position 3: we don't know, but it cannot be R or N.
- Position 4: we don't know, but it cannot be R or N.
- Position 5: cannot be E (because we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position) and also cannot be R or N.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does not contain R or N.

Let's think of possible words.

We know A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our first guess and we were told it's wrong position, so E is not at 5. Similarly, A is not at 2. However, note that A could be at position 1? But position 1 is C, so A cannot be at 1. Therefore, A must be at 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But note: the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at 3,4, or 5? However, we also have E that must be in the word and not at 5. So if A is at 5, then E must be at 2,3, or 4? But we don't know.

But we also have to avoid R and N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: not A, not R, not N
- Position 3: not R, not N
- Position 4: not R, not N
- Position 5: not E, not R, not N

And the word must contain A and E.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? But position 2 is open.

Let me try to think of words that start with C and have A and E.

Possible words: 
- ""cameo"": but we have M and O which we don't know about. Also, A is in position 2? But we cannot have A in position 2 because our feedback said A is not in position 2. So ""cameo"" has A at position 2 -> invalid.

- ""cable"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? But we cannot have A at 2 -> invalid.

- ""cache"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - A at 2? Again, invalid.

We need a word without A in position 2.

How about ""capex""? But is that a word? Not common.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 or 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""cease"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - E at 2: we don't know if that's allowed for E? We only know E is not at 5. E can be at 2.
  - A at 3: that's a new position for A -> possible.
  - S at 4: unknown
  - E at 5: but we know E is not at 5 -> invalid because we have E at 5.

We cannot have E at 5.

So in ""cease"", the last letter is E, which is not allowed at position 5.

Another word: ""chase"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: unknown
- A at 3: good (not position 2)
- S at 4
- E at 5: not allowed.

Same problem.

We need a word that does not have E at 5 and does not have A at 2.

How about ""cadet"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: not allowed -> invalid.

""caste"":
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

We need to avoid A at 2.

What about ""cause""? 
- C at 1
- A at 2: invalid.

""clause"": 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""caste"", ""crane"" we already tried.

Another idea: ""cable"" is invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""cycle""? 
- C at 1
- Y at 2
- C at 3: but we already have C at 1? The word has two C's? 
  But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had C as correct and then R, A, N, E. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But in the feedback, we had:
- C: correct (so the first C is in the word and correct)
- R: absent
- A: present but wrong position
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position

So the secret word has at least one C (at position 1) and then A and E. It does not have R or N.

But could it have two C's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we have two of the same in the guess. In ""crane"", we only have one C, so we don't know.

But in ""cycle"", we have two C's. The first C is correct. The third C: if the secret word has only one C, then the third C in ""cycle"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

We can try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 3,4 or 5 and E in position 2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

For example:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: must be a letter that is not A, not R, not N. Let me choose a common consonant, say T, L, S, etc.
- Then A in position 3,4, or 5? But if we put A in position 3, then E can be in position 4? and position 5 must be something else.

Example: ""cater""
- C at 1
- A at 2? -> invalid.

""cater"" has A at 2 -> no.

""crate"": but R is absent? We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. ""crate"" has R -> invalid.

""cleat"":
- C at 1
- L at 2: not A, not R, not N -> allowed
- E at 3: we don't know if E can be at 3? It can because we only know E is not at 5.
- A at 4: allowed (not position 2)
- T at 5: and we don't have E at 5 -> good.

Also, no R or N.

So ""cleat"" is a candidate.

But let me check: the secret word has A and E. In ""cleat"", we have A at 4 and E at 3. We don't know if that conflicts.

We also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word but not at 2. In ""cleat"", A is at 4, which is fine.

Similarly, E was at 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position, so E must be in the word but not at 5. In ""cleat"", E is at 3, which is not 5, so that's fine.

Also, we are avoiding R and N.

So ""cleat"" seems like a valid guess.

But is ""cleat"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a piece of leather or similar material.

Another candidate: ""cheap"":
- C at 1
- H at 2: allowed
- E at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed
- P at 5: allowed

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if H and P are in the word. But that's okay.

However, we have two candidates: ""cleat"" and ""cheap"". Which one to choose?

We might want to choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

But note: we already know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""cleat"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. In ""cheap"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4 as well.

But we could also try a word that puts A and E in different positions.

For example, what if we put A at position 5? But we have to avoid E at 5? We can put A at 5 and E at 2 or 3 or 4.

Example: ""cupae""? Not a word.

""cavea""? Not common.

""comae""? Not common.

So maybe it's better to stick with more common words.

Another candidate: ""chase"" but we cannot because of E at 5.

""chafe"":
- C at 1
- H at 2
- A at 3
- F at 4
- E at 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at 5.

So we avoid E at 5.

Another candidate: ""cameo"" is invalid because of A at 2.

""cadge"": A at 2 -> invalid.

""cagey"": A at 2 -> invalid.

So let's go with ""cleat"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""cease"" but we saw that has E at 5 -> invalid.

""chest"": but does it have A? No, we must include A because we know A is in the word.

So we must include A and E.

Another candidate: ""caste"" -> A at 2 invalid.

""carte"": has R -> invalid.

""cable"" -> A at 2 invalid.

So I think ""cleat"" is a good choice.

But let me think of ""plate""? But it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

Another one: ""clean"":
- C at 1
- L at 2
- E at 3
- A at 4? But wait, the word is ""clean"", which has A at 5? 
  Actually: C-L-E-A-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N.

But we know N is absent! So we cannot use N. In ""clean"", the last letter is N, which is absent -> but we are going to guess it? We can guess it, but we know N is not in the word so it will be marked as absent. But that's acceptable because we are trying to find the positions of A and E.

However, we know N is not in the word, so using it in position 5 would be a waste because it will be marked absent. But we are forced to use a 5-letter word.

But in ""clean"", we have:
- Position 4: A -> which is good (not position 2)
- Position 3: E -> good (not position 5)
- But position 5: N -> which we know is absent.

So the feedback for position 5 would be x. But we already know that.

But we are using a letter we know is absent, which doesn't give us new information about the presence of letters. However, we are trying to test the positions of A and E.

But we can avoid using known absent letters if possible.

In ""cleat"", we don't use any known absent letters (R and N). The letters in ""cleat"" are C, L, E, A, T. We know C, E, A are present (C is fixed, E and A are known to be present). L and T are new.

So ""cleat"" is better because it uses two new letters (L and T) that we don't know about, so we can get information about them.

Whereas in ""clean"", we use N which we know is absent, so we don't learn anything new about N.

Therefore, ""cleat"" is a better guess.

So I will go with ""cleat"".

But let me confirm the spelling: ""cleat"" is a valid word.

Therefore, my second guess is ""cleat"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is absent (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (-).
- N is absent (x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with C.
- It contains A and E, but A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- R and N are absent and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is currently restricted for E, so A could be in 3 or 4).
- Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 5).

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include A and E (A not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Avoid R and N.
- Use new letters to gather more information (e.g., test common consonants like L, T, S).

A suitable guess is ""cleat"":
- C in position 1 (correct, as known).
- L in position 2 (new letter, not restricted).
- E in position 3 (tests a new position for E).
- A in position 4 (tests a new position for A).
- T in position 5 (new letter, and since E can't be in 5, this is safe).

This guess efficiently tests the positions of A and E while introducing new letters (L, T) for additional feedback.

<guess>cleat</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C is correct and in place. So the secret word starts with C.
- Position 2: R is not in the word (x). Also, from this, we know R is absent from the entire word.
- Position 3: A is present in the word but not in this position (so not at position 3? Wait, no: the position in the guess is position 3? Let me clarify:

Actually, in ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> ✓
- Position 2: R -> x (absent)
- Position 3: A -> - (present, but not in position 3)
- Position 4: N -> x (absent)
- Position 5: E -> - (present, but not in position 5)

So:
- Secret word: position 1 is C.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3 (because it was in position 3 of the guess and marked as wrong position).
- E is in the word, but not at position 5.
- R and N are absent.

Second guess: ""cleat"" -> Feedback: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C is correct (as we know).
- Position 2: L is absent (x). So L is not in the word.
- Position 3: E is present but not in position 3 (so E is in the word but cannot be at position 3).
- Position 4: A is present but not in position 4 (so A is in the word but cannot be at position 4).
- Position 5: T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.

Now, what we know:
- Position 1: C (fixed).
- Letters present: A, E (and C, but we already know position 1).
- Letters absent: R, N, L, T (and from the first guess, we also knew R and N were absent, now L and T added).
- Positions for A:
  - Not at position 3 (from ""crane"")
  - Not at position 4 (from ""cleat"")
  - Also, not at position 2 because in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and marked as wrong position? Wait, no: in ""crane"", position 3 had A? Wait, let me map ""crane"":
    - c ->1, r->2, a->3, n->4, e->5
    So A was at position 3 and marked as wrong position? Actually, the feedback was for position 3: A(-) meaning it's present but not in position 3. Then in ""cleat"":
    - cleat: c(1), l(2), e(3), a(4), t(5)
    - Position 3: E -> feedback (-), meaning E present but not at position 3.
    - Position 4: A -> feedback (-), meaning A present but not at position 4.

Therefore:
- A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). Also, in the first guess, A was at position 3? But we also know from the first guess that A was placed in position 3 and it was not correct, so A is not at position 3. Now with ""cleat"" we tried A at position 4 and it was wrong position, so A is not at position 4. Also, we haven't tried position 5 for A? And note: A cannot be at position 2 because it was tried in ""crane"" at position 2? Wait, no: in ""crane"", the second letter was 'r' (position 2) which was absent, but the A was at position 3. So we never tried A at position 2? Actually, we haven't placed A at position 2 in any guess. But position 2 we have tried: in first guess it was R (absent), in second guess it was L (absent), so we don't know about A at position 2? Wait, but in the first guess, the feedback for position 2 was R -> x, which doesn't say anything about A because A was in a different position. So A could theoretically be at position 2? But wait: no, because we have a constraint: in the first guess, we placed A at position 3 and got the feedback that it is present but not in position 3. But that doesn't prevent A from being in position 2? Let me clarify:

The feedback doesn't say anything directly about position 2 for A. However, note that when we placed A at position 3 and got '-' that means A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, when we placed A at position 4 (in ""cleat"") and got '-', that means A is in the word but not at position 4.

So A must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 or 4. Since position 1 is C (fixed), the only remaining positions are 2 and 5.

Therefore, A must be either at position 2 or position 5.

Similarly, for E:
- In first guess (position 5): E at position 5 and got '-' so present but not at position 5.
- In second guess (position 3): E at position 3 and got '-' so present but not at position 3.

Therefore, E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.

Since position 1 is C, E must be at position 2 or 4.

Now, let's recap:
- Secret word positions:
  - 1: C
  - 2: potential for A or E? But A or E must be placed in the remaining positions.
  - Specifically:
    - A must be at 2 or 5.
    - E must be at 2 or 4.

But note, we have two letters and three positions? No: positions 2, 4, and 5 are available? But position 4 is available for E? And we have two letters A and E to place, and we know the word contains exactly these two besides C? We don't know the word has exactly three distinct letters? It might have more.

We only know the letters present so far: C (at1), A, and E. And we've eliminated R, N, L, T. So the other two letters are unknown.

The word is 5 letters: C _ _ _ _

We know A is at either position 2 or 5, and E is at either position 2 or 4? But position 2 can't be both A and E at the same time. So:

If A is at 2, then E must be at 4? Because E cannot be at 2 if A is there? But if E is at 4, then position 5 is another letter.

If E is at 2, then A must be at 5? Because E at 2 and A cannot be at 3 or 4? Also, if E at 2, then A at 5.

Therefore, two scenarios:
1. A at position 2, E at position 4. Then position 3? Unknown, and position 5? Unknown.
2. E at position 2, A at position 5. Then position 3? Unknown, position 4? Unknown.

But wait, in scenario 1: if A is at position 2, and E is at position 4? But position 3 and 5 are open? Similarly, scenario 2: position 3 and position 4 are open.

Now, we also know that the word has two more letters? Because A and E we have already.

We need to form a word that fits one of these patterns.

Also, we have eliminated letters: R, N, L, T. And we know absent letters.

We need to choose a new guess that fits one of these patterns and avoids R,N,L,T.

For scenario 1: word pattern: C A _ E _ 
For scenario 2: word pattern: C E _ _ A 

We want a word that has neither of the absent letters and that tests between these scenarios.

But we don't know which scenario it is. So we can choose a word that fits one scenario and we get feedback accordingly.

We could also choose a word that has A at position 5 and E at position 4? But wait, E cannot be at position 4? Or can it? We know E cannot be at position 3 or 5? But we haven't tried position 4 for E? The constraints: E cannot be at positions 3 or 5? Yes? Because we tried position 3 and 5? We tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 3 in ""cleat"", and both were marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: for position 5 in ""crane"" E -> '-', meaning it is present but not in position 5? So E cannot be in position 5? And from ""cleat"", E at position 3 -> '-', meaning E cannot be in position 3. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, A must be in position 2 or 5.

Therefore, E can be in position 4? Yes, in fact, one of the scenarios above.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First scenario: C A ? E ? 

Possible words: 
- ""camel"": but L is absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cameo"": again L? No, ""cameo"" has M E O? But E is at position 4? 
  - C A M E O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:M, 4:E, 5:O. 
  But we know L is absent, but here no L? And T absent? And R,N absent? So ""cameo"" has letters: C,A,M,E,O. 
  But is O acceptable? We don't know about O.

But check absent letters: R,N,L,T are absent? We haven't used M,O so we can try.

But we also need to see if it fits: A at 2, E at 4 -> valid.

But ""cameo"" might be a word? Yes.

Second scenario: C E ? ? A 

Possible words: 
- ""ceiba"": but B and I? We don't know about B and I. And is it a word? (a type of tree)
- ""cecal"": but L is absent -> invalid? L cannot be used.

What about ""cease""? But S and E? 
- ""cease"": C E A S E? 
  Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E. 
  But A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess feedback)! 

So ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden.

Another: ""cella"": L is absent -> invalid.

""cebta""? Not a word.

We need a word that fits pattern C E ? ? A and without using absent letters.

So positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:?, 4:?, 5:A.

Must avoid letters R,N,L,T.

And A cannot be at position 3? But in this pattern, A is at position 5? So position 3 is an unknown letter? And position 4 is unknown.

Possible words: 
- ""cesta"": but S and T? T is absent -> invalid.
- ""cetra"": R and T absent -> invalid.
- ""ceiba"": I and B? Valid letters? We haven't eliminated I or B.

But ""ceiba"" is a word? (a tropical tree) -> valid? Let's assume it is.

But we have another possibility: what about ""cense""? But N is absent -> invalid? Because N is absent? In ""cense"": C E N S E -> contains N, so invalid because N is absent.

Another word: ""ceorl"": but O and R and L? Absent letters -> invalid.

So ""ceiba"" is a candidate? But we are not sure if it's common.

But maybe we can think of more common words.

What about ""cobra"": 
- Pattern: C O B R A? That's C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4)???, A(5)? But R is absent -> invalid.

Another: ""chapel""? But letter count? 6 letters.

5 letters: ""cupra""? Not common.

Perhaps scenario 1 (""ca?e?"") has more possibilities.

Scenario 1: C A ? E ? 

Words:
- ""camel"": but L at the end? Position 5: L -> absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cameo"": as before? C A M E O -> letters: C,A,M,E,O. Absent letters: R,N,L,T are not in this word? So we can try? But we don't know if M and O are present? So acceptable? But we can guess ""cameo"" if we want to test the scenario.

But wait, note that in ""cameo"", we have E at position 4? And we would get feedback: if the secret word has E at position 4? Or not.

But let's see: we need to distinguish between the two scenarios.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that fits scenario 1? Or one that fits scenario 2? Or a hybrid? But we don't have to necessarily fit a scenario? We can use a guess that doesn't follow either pattern? But we must include the known letters? Not necessarily? The rules say each guess must be a valid English word? And we should aim to get information.

We could choose a word that has A in position 5 and E in position 4? But wait, for E: can E be in position 4? Yes, because E must be at 2 or 4? So in position 4? Similarly, A must be at 2 or 5? So if we put A at position 5 and E at position 4, that's within possibility? But that's actually scenario 2? Scenario 2 has E at position 2? And A at 5? Or in our scenarios, we have:

Scenario 1: C A ? E ? (so A at2, E at4)
Scenario 2: C E ? ? A (so E at2, A at5)

But we haven't considered the possibility: could we have A at position 5 and E at position 4? That would be pattern: C _ _ E A.

For example, ""cover""? but O,V,E,R -> R absent -> invalid.

But in this pattern: 

- Position 1: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: A

Then position 2 and 3 are unknown? Wait, but also E must be present? But position 4 is E? So that's fine? And A at position 5.

But we would have pattern: C * * E A? Positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:A.

Is this consistent with the constraints? 
- A must be at 2 or 5? In this pattern, A is at 5? Yes.
- E must be at position 2 or 4? In this pattern, E is at position 4? Yes.

So this is a valid possibility: pattern C??EA.

Similarly, we could have E at position 2 and A at position? Wait, no: we already have scenario 2: C E _ _ A.

So actually, there are three possibilities? Or two? Because in pattern C??EA, we have specified positions 4 and 5 as E and A? But in scenario 2, we have E at 2 and A at 5? So different.

Let me summarize:

The possible positions for E and A:

We must place:
- E at either position 2 or position 4.
- A at either position 2 or position 5? But if both are at position 2, conflict? So:

Case 1: E at position 2? Then A must be at position 5? Because A cannot be at 3 or 4? And position 1 is taken? So A at 5? Then positions 3 and 4: unknown letters.

Case 2: E at position 4? Then A must be either at position 2 or position 5? But if A at position 2, then E at position 4? But position 2: if E is at position 4 and A at position 2? Then that's one case: C A _ E _? Where _ is position? Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:?, 4:E, 5:another letter? Or if E at position 4 and A at position 5? Then pattern: C _ _ E A.

Therefore, there are actually three possibilities:

Possibility A: E at 2, A at 5? Then word pattern: C E ? ? A

Possibility B: E at 4, A at 2? Then word pattern: C A ? E ?

Possibility C: E at 4, A at 5? Then word pattern: C ? ? E A

So three possibilities.

Therefore, we need a word that can differentially test these? Or we can guess a word that matches one of them and see the feedback.

But note: we have three cases? But we don't know which one it is.

We want to guess a word that has been used? Or not? But let's find a common word that matches one of the patterns and avoids absent letters.

But we must avoid R,N,L,T.

Possibility A: pattern C E ? ? A
- Examples: ""ceiba"" (as before) or ""cezva""? Not common.
- ""cepa"" ? 4 letters.

Finding a word with C E ? ? A: 
- ""cebra"": not common? Or ""cecal"" -> but L absent -> invalid.
- ""cesar"": has R -> invalid.
- ""cesta"": has T? T absent -> invalid.

So maybe not many common options.

Possibility B: pattern C A ? E ? 
- Examples: ""cameo"", ""camel"" (but L absent? ""camel"" ends with L -> invalid), ""caper""? But R? ""caper"" has R -> invalid.
- ""cater"" has R -> invalid.
- ""cases""? But S and E? Pattern: C A S E S? That would be: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S? Now, E at position 4? But we know E must be at 2 or 4? But in this pattern, E is at 4? Also, S we don't know about? And no R,N,L,T? So ""cases"" is possible? But ""cases"" is a valid word? Yes.

But does it have S at the end? Okay.

But let's write the pattern for ""cases"": 
C A S E S? Position1: C, position2: A, position3: S, position4: E, position5: S? But does S appear twice? That's okay? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? It is possible.

Also, we can use this.

Possibility C: pattern C ? ? E A
- Examples: ""covea""? Not common? ""cupra""? Not common.
- ""crone"": R and N absent -> invalid.
- ""chela"": L and H? L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cupea""? Not common.

Not many common words.

Therefore, we can try to go with ""cases"" as a guess? It matches possibility B: C A S E S? With E at position 4 and A at position 2.

But also, ""cases"" has S as the third and fifth letters? That's fine.

Now, is this a valid word? Yes.

But we need to see if it's a good guess? We are also testing? If we guess ""cases"", then:

If the secret word is possibility B (C A ? E ?), then in our guess, A is at 2 and E at 4? Also, S at 3 would be tested? And S at 5 tested.

If the secret word is possibility A (C E ? ? A) then in ""cases"", first letter C correct? Then A at position 2: we think it might be there? But if not, then feedback: position 2: A? If the secret word has A at position 5, then A at position 2 might be marked absent? Or present? Or wait? No: the secret word has A? So A is present? But if the secret word is possibility A, then A is at position 5? So in ""cases"", A at position 2: the secret word doesn't have A at position 2? So we get feedback for position 2: A(-) or A(x)? Actually, if A is present (which it is) but not at position 2? Then we would get A(-), meaning present but wrong position? Similarly, E at position 4: if secret has E at position 2, then position 4: wrong? Then we would get: position 4: E(-) or E(x)? Secret has E at position 2? So E is present? But not at position 4? So E at position 4 would be marked as wrong position? So overall, if we guess ""cases"", we get feedback:

- Position 1: C ✓ (as always)
- Position 2: A? If secret is possibility B (C A ...) then A✓? But if possibility A or C, then A might be in correct position? Or not?

But let's evaluate:

If secret is possibility A (C E ? ? A)? Then in ""cases"", position 2: A (guessed) vs secret position 2: E? So A is not E, but there is A in the word at position 5? So A is present? But not at position 2? So we would get A(-) (present but wrong position? Or just present? The symbol is '-' for present but wrong position? Or if it is present, we'll get '-' if not in correct position? But position 2? Secret has E, so A is not correct at position 2? But A is in the word? So A( - )

Similarly for E: if secret is possibility A, then E is at position 2? So in ""cases"", position 4: E? Secret position 4 is not E? But secret has E? So E at position 4 would be present but wrong position? So E(-)

Then position 5: S? Secret position 5 is A? So S is absent? If S is not present? Then S(x)

Then position 3: S? Secret has something at position 3? If S is present? But we don't know? It might not be, so S(x) if absent? Or if present but not at position 3, then S(-)

So the feedback would help us rule out and then we have to guess again.

But we are limited by the number of tries.

Therefore, perhaps better to choose a word that covers both scenarios? But it's hard.

Another idea: we can try to put E in position 2 and A in position 4? But wait, A cannot be in position 4? We know A cannot be in position 4? From feedback? In ""cleat"", A at position 4 was marked '-' meaning present but not in position 4? So we cannot put A at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot put E at positions 3 or 5? But we can put E at position 2 or 4? And A at position 2 or 5? But if we put E? But in a guess, we can put E at position 4 and A at position 2? Which is possibility B? Or E at position 2 and A at position 5? Possibility A? Or E at position 4 and A at position 5? Possibility C.

But in possibility C, we can try a word like ""cause""? But let's see: ""cause"" has A at position 5? Wait, ""cause"": C A U S E? Which is C A U S E? 
- Position 1: C
- 2: A? But we are considering possibility C: C ? ? E A? That doesn't match? ""cause"" would be pattern C A U S E? So E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? So ""cause"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? Because of first feedback? So we cannot guess ""cause"".

Similarly, no word can have E at position 5? Because that's not allowed? We only know E cannot be at positions 3 and 5? So at 2 or 4.

So let's go back.

We have three patterns:

Pat A: C E ? ? A  (E at2, A at5)
Pat B: C A ? E ?  (A at2, E at4)
Pat C: C ? ? E A  (E at4, A at5)

We can choose a guess that matches one? And see? For Pat C, possible words: without using R,N,L,T? So C ? ? E A? 
- ""covea"" not common.
- ""chapea"" too long.
- ""cupel""? ""cupel"" is C U P E L? But L at the end? And L is absent -> invalid.
- ""cubic""? ends with C.

Hard to find. So maybe Pat C is less likely? We can start by guessing for Pat B: ""cases""?

Or we can choose ""cameo"" for Pat B.

But ""cameo"" has letters C,A,M,E,O.

If we guess ""cameo"", then:
- In Pat A: secret is C E ? ? A? Then we can see the feedback? For example, position? Will it give us information.

But let's finalize.

We could guess ""cease"", but ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden? Because A cannot be at position 3? From the first guess? So ""cease"" is invalid? Cannot be guessed? Or we can guess? But we know it's not the word because A can't be at 3? But we don't know the word; we can guess it? But it would waste a guess.

So better not.

Therefore, let me choose ""cases"" for Pat B.

But ""cases"" uses S twice? And we don't know about S? So we can test for presence of S as well.

So guess ""cases"".

Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.

But let's see today's secret word? We don't know? But we have to guess.

Perhaps guess ""cause""? But earlier I saw that the fifth letter is E? Which is not allowed? Because E cannot be in position 5? ""cause"" -> E at position 5? That violates our knowledge? So we cannot guess words with E at position 5? Because we know it's present but not at position 5? So guessing ""cause"" would be bad? Because we intentionally put E at position 5? Which we  know is wrong? So we wouldn't do that? So avoid putting E at position 5? And avoid putting A at position 3 or 4.

Therefore, for our guess, avoid positions we know are wrong.

So go with ""cases"": it has A at position 2 (we want to test if that's correct) and E at position 4 (test if correct) and no known absent letters.

Letters in ""cases"": C,A,S,E,S? We know C, A, E are present? And S is new? If S is present, we get feedback? Or not? So the feedback will tell us.

So we guess ""cases"".

But wait, in ""cases"", the fifth letter is S? So if the secret word is pat C: C ? ? E A, then position 5: A? So in ""cases"", we are putting S there? It could be absent? Then we know S is absent and we learn that.

Also, position 3: S? Etc.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""cases"".

But to make it with only distinct letters? Not necessary.

Another option: ""capex""? Not common.

We've used many letters? Doesn't matter.

Guess ""cases"".The feedback from the first two guesses provides the following insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 is fixed).
- **A** must be in position 2 or 5 (it cannot be in position 3 or 4 based on feedback).
- **E** must be in position 2 or 4 (it cannot be in position 3 or 5 based on feedback).
- **R**, **N**, **L**, and **T** are absent and must be avoided.
- The word must include both **A** and **E**, alongside **C**, with two other unknown letters.

Given these constraints, three possible patterns emerge:
1. **C E ? ? A** (E at position 2, A at position 5)
2. **C A ? E ?** (A at position 2, E at position 4)
3. **C ? ? E A** (E at position 4, A at position 5)

After considering common English words that fit these patterns and avoid absent letters, **cases** is selected as the next guess:
- It matches pattern 2 (**C A ? E ?**), testing A at position 2 and E at position 4.
- It uses **S** (new letters) to gather additional information without conflicting with known absent letters.
- It is a valid word that adheres to the feedback constraints.

But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our first guess and we were told it\'s wrong position, so E is not at 5. Similarly, A is not at 2. However, note that A could be at position 1? But position 1 is C, so A cannot be at 1. Therefore, A must be at 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut note: the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at 3,4, or 5? However, we also have E that must be in the word and not at 5. So if A is at 5, then E must be at 2,3, or 4? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we also have to avoid R and N.\n\nLet me list the constraints:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: not A, not R, not N\n- Position 3: not R, not N\n- Position 4: not R, not N\n- Position 5: not E, not R, not N\n\nAnd the word must contain A and E.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? But position 2 is open.\n\nLet me try to think of words that start with C and have A and E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""cameo"": but we have M and O which we don\'t know about. Also, A is in position 2? But we cannot have A in position 2 because our feedback said A is not in position 2. So ""cameo"" has A at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n- ""cable"": \n  - C at 1 (good)\n  - A at 2? But we cannot have A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n- ""cache"": \n  - C at 1 (good)\n  - A at 2? Again, invalid.\n\nWe need a word without A in position 2.\n\nHow about ""capex""? But is that a word? Not common.\n\nLet me think of words with A in position 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- ""cease"": \n  - C at 1 (good)\n  - E at 2: we don\'t know if that\'s allowed for E? We only know E is not at 5. E can be at 2.\n  - A at 3: that\'s a new position for A -> possible.\n  - S at 4: unknown\n  - E at 5: but we know E is not at 5 -> invalid because we have E at 5.\n\nWe cannot have E at 5.\n\nSo in ""cease"", the last letter is E, which is not allowed at position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""chase"":\n- C at 1\n- H at 2: unknown\n- A at 3: good (not position 2)\n- S at 4\n- E at 5: not allowed.\n\nSame problem.\n\nWe need a word that does not have E at 5 and does not have A at 2.\n\nHow about ""cadet"":\n- C at 1\n- A at 2: not allowed -> invalid.\n\n""caste"":\n- C at 1\n- A at 2: invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid A at 2.\n\nWhat about ""cause""? \n- C at 1\n- A at 2: invalid.\n\n""clause"": 6 letters? No, 6 letters.\n\n5-letter words: ""caste"", ""crane"" we already tried.\n\nAnother idea: ""cable"" is invalid because of A at 2.\n\nHow about ""cycle""? \n- C at 1\n- Y at 2\n- C at 3: but we already have C at 1? The word has two C\'s? \n  But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had C as correct and then R, A, N, E. We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\nBut in the feedback, we had:\n- C: correct (so the first C is in the word and correct)\n- R: absent\n- A: present but wrong position\n- N: absent\n- E: present but wrong position\n\nSo the secret word has at least one C (at position 1) and then A and E. It does not have R or N.\n\nBut could it have two C\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters unless we have two of the same in the guess. In ""crane"", we only have one C, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""cycle"", we have two C\'s. The first C is correct. The third C: if the secret word has only one C, then the third C in ""cycle"" would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have A in position 3,4 or 5 and E in position 2,3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: must be a letter that is not A, not R, not N. Let me choose a common consonant, say T, L, S, etc.\n- Then A in position 3,4, or 5? But if we put A in position 3, then E can be in position 4? and position 5 must be something else.\n\nExample: ""cater""\n- C at 1\n- A at 2? -> invalid.\n\n""cater"" has A at 2 -> no.\n\n""crate"": but R is absent? We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. ""crate"" has R -> invalid.\n\n""cleat"":\n- C at 1\n- L at 2: not A, not R, not N -> allowed\n- E at 3: we don\'t know if E can be at 3? It can because we only know E is not at 5.\n- A at 4: allowed (not position 2)\n- T at 5: and we don\'t have E at 5 -> good.\n\nAlso, no R or N.\n\nSo ""cleat"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me check: the secret word has A and E. In ""cleat"", we have A at 4 and E at 3. We don\'t know if that conflicts.\n\nWe also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word but not at 2. In ""cleat"", A is at 4, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, E was at 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position, so E must be in the word but not at 5. In ""cleat"", E is at 3, which is not 5, so that\'s fine.\n\nAlso, we are avoiding R and N.\n\nSo ""cleat"" seems like a valid guess.\n\nBut is ""cleat"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a piece of leather or similar material.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cheap"":\n- C at 1\n- H at 2: allowed\n- E at 3: allowed\n- A at 4: allowed\n- P at 5: allowed\n\nBut we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if H and P are in the word. But that\'s okay.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""cleat"" and ""cheap"". Which one to choose?\n\nWe might want to choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.\n\nBut note: we already know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.\n\nIn ""cleat"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. In ""cheap"", we are putting E at 3 and A at 4 as well.\n\nBut we could also try a word that puts A and E in different positions.\n\nFor example, what if we put A at position 5? But we have to avoid E at 5? We can put A at 5 and E at 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nExample: ""cupae""? Not a word.\n\n""cavea""? Not common.\n\n""comae""? Not common.\n\nSo maybe it\'s better to stick with more common words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""chase"" but we cannot because of E at 5.\n\n""chafe"":\n- C at 1\n- H at 2\n- A at 3\n- F at 4\n- E at 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at 5.\n\nSo we avoid E at 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cameo"" is invalid because of A at 2.\n\n""cadge"": A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""cagey"": A at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""cleat"".\n\nBut wait, we have another candidate: ""cease"" but we saw that has E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n""chest"": but does it have A? No, we must include A because we know A is in the word.\n\nSo we must include A and E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""caste"" -> A at 2 invalid.\n\n""carte"": has R -> invalid.\n\n""cable"" -> A at 2 invalid.\n\nSo I think ""cleat"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of ""plate""? But it doesn\'t start with C.\n\nWe must start with C.\n\nAnother one: ""clean"":\n- C at 1\n- L at 2\n- E at 3\n- A at 4? But wait, the word is ""clean"", which has A at 5? \n  Actually: C-L-E-A-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N.\n\nBut we know N is absent! So we cannot use N. In ""clean"", the last letter is N, which is absent -> but we are going to guess it? We can guess it, but we know N is not in the word so it will be marked as absent. But that\'s acceptable because we are trying to find the positions of A and E.\n\nHowever, we know N is not in the word, so using it in position 5 would be a waste because it will be marked absent. But we are forced to use a 5-letter word.\n\nBut in ""clean"", we have:\n- Position 4: A -> which is good (not position 2)\n- Position 3: E -> good (not position 5)\n- But position 5: N -> which we know is absent.\n\nSo the feedback for position 5 would be x. But we already know that.\n\nBut we are using a letter we know is absent, which doesn\'t give us new information about the presence of letters. However, we are trying to test the positions of A and E.\n\nBut we can avoid using known absent letters if possible.\n\nIn ""cleat"", we don\'t use any known absent letters (R and N). The letters in ""cleat"" are C, L, E, A, T. We know C, E, A are present (C is fixed, E and A are known to be present). L and T are new.\n\nSo ""cleat"" is better because it uses two new letters (L and T) that we don\'t know about, so we can get information about them.\n\nWhereas in ""clean"", we use N which we know is absent, so we don\'t learn anything new about N.\n\nTherefore, ""cleat"" is a better guess.\n\nSo I will go with ""cleat"".\n\nBut let me confirm the spelling: ""cleat"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""cleat"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is absent (x).\n- A is present but not in position 2 (-).\n- N is absent (x).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word starts with C.\n- It contains A and E, but A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n- R and N are absent and should be avoided.\n- Possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is currently restricted for E, so A could be in 3 or 4).\n- Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4 (since it can\'t be in 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with C.\n- Must include A and E (A not in position 2, E not in position 5).\n- Avoid R and N.\n- Use new letters to gather more information (e.g., test common consonants like L, T, S).\n\nA suitable guess is ""cleat"":\n- C in position 1 (correct, as known).\n- L in position 2 (new letter, not restricted).\n- E in position 3 (tests a new position for E).\n- A in position 4 (tests a new position for A).\n- T in position 5 (new letter, and since E can\'t be in 5, this is safe).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the positions of A and E while introducing new letters (L, T) for additional feedback.\n\n<guess>cleat</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- Position 1: C is correct and in place. So the secret word starts with C.\n- Position 2: R is not in the word (x). Also, from this, we know R is absent from the entire word.\n- Position 3: A is present in the word but not in this position (so not at position 3? Wait, no: the position in the guess is position 3? Let me clarify:\n\nActually, in ""crane"":\n- Position 1: C -> ✓\n- Position 2: R -> x (absent)\n- Position 3: A -> - (present, but not in position 3)\n- Position 4: N -> x (absent)\n- Position 5: E -> - (present, but not in position 5)\n\nSo:\n- Secret word: position 1 is C.\n- A is in the word, but not at position 3 (because it was in position 3 of the guess and marked as wrong position).\n- E is in the word, but not at position 5.\n- R and N are absent.\n\nSecond guess: ""cleat"" -> Feedback: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)\nInterpretation:\n- Position 1: C is correct (as we know).\n- Position 2: L is absent (x). So L is not in the word.\n- Position 3: E is present but not in position 3 (so E is in the word but cannot be at position 3).\n- Position 4: A is present but not in position 4 (so A is in the word but cannot be at position 4).\n- Position 5: T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.\n\nNow, what we know:\n- Position 1: C (fixed).\n- Letters present: A, E (and C, but we already know position 1).\n- Letters absent: R, N, L, T (and from the first guess, we also knew R and N were absent, now L and T added).\n- Positions for A:\n  - Not at position 3 (from ""crane"")\n  - Not at position 4 (from ""cleat"")\n  - Also, not at position 2 because in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and marked as wrong position? Wait, no: in ""crane"", position 3 had A? Wait, let me map ""crane"":\n    - c ->1, r->2, a->3, n->4, e->5\n    So A was at position 3 and marked as wrong position? Actually, the feedback was for position 3: A(-) meaning it\'s present but not in position 3. Then in ""cleat"":\n    - cleat: c(1), l(2), e(3), a(4), t(5)\n    - Position 3: E -> feedback (-), meaning E present but not at position 3.\n    - Position 4: A -> feedback (-), meaning A present but not at position 4.\n\nTherefore:\n- A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess). Also, in the first guess, A was at position 3? But we also know from the first guess that A was placed in position 3 and it was not correct, so A is not at position 3. Now with ""cleat"" we tried A at position 4 and it was wrong position, so A is not at position 4. Also, we haven\'t tried position 5 for A? And note: A cannot be at position 2 because it was tried in ""crane"" at position 2? Wait, no: in ""crane"", the second letter was \'r\' (position 2) which was absent, but the A was at position 3. So we never tried A at position 2? Actually, we haven\'t placed A at position 2 in any guess. But position 2 we have tried: in first guess it was R (absent), in second guess it was L (absent), so we don\'t know about A at position 2? Wait, but in the first guess, the feedback for position 2 was R -> x, which doesn\'t say anything about A because A was in a different position. So A could theoretically be at position 2? But wait: no, because we have a constraint: in the first guess, we placed A at position 3 and got the feedback that it is present but not in position 3. But that doesn\'t prevent A from being in position 2? Let me clarify:\n\nThe feedback doesn\'t say anything directly about position 2 for A. However, note that when we placed A at position 3 and got \'-\' that means A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, when we placed A at position 4 (in ""cleat"") and got \'-\', that means A is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nSo A must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 or 4. Since position 1 is C (fixed), the only remaining positions are 2 and 5.\n\nTherefore, A must be either at position 2 or position 5.\n\nSimilarly, for E:\n- In first guess (position 5): E at position 5 and got \'-\' so present but not at position 5.\n- In second guess (position 3): E at position 3 and got \'-\' so present but not at position 3.\n\nTherefore, E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.\n\nSince position 1 is C, E must be at position 2 or 4.\n\nNow, let\'s recap:\n- Secret word positions:\n  - 1: C\n  - 2: potential for A or E? But A or E must be placed in the remaining positions.\n  - Specifically:\n    - A must be at 2 or 5.\n    - E must be at 2 or 4.\n\nBut note, we have two letters and three positions? No: positions 2, 4, and 5 are available? But position 4 is available for E? And we have two letters A and E to place, and we know the word contains exactly these two besides C? We don\'t know the word has exactly three distinct letters? It might have more.\n\nWe only know the letters present so far: C (at1), A, and E. And we\'ve eliminated R, N, L, T. So the other two letters are unknown.\n\nThe word is 5 letters: C _ _ _ _\n\nWe know A is at either position 2 or 5, and E is at either position 2 or 4? But position 2 can\'t be both A and E at the same time. So:\n\nIf A is at 2, then E must be at 4? Because E cannot be at 2 if A is there? But if E is at 4, then position 5 is another letter.\n\nIf E is at 2, then A must be at 5? Because E at 2 and A cannot be at 3 or 4? Also, if E at 2, then A at 5.\n\nTherefore, two scenarios:\n1. A at position 2, E at position 4. Then position 3? Unknown, and position 5? Unknown.\n2. E at position 2, A at position 5. Then position 3? Unknown, position 4? Unknown.\n\nBut wait, in scenario 1: if A is at position 2, and E is at position 4? But position 3 and 5 are open? Similarly, scenario 2: position 3 and position 4 are open.\n\nNow, we also know that the word has two more letters? Because A and E we have already.\n\nWe need to form a word that fits one of these patterns.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated letters: R, N, L, T. And we know absent letters.\n\nWe need to choose a new guess that fits one of these patterns and avoids R,N,L,T.\n\nFor scenario 1: word pattern: C A _ E _ \nFor scenario 2: word pattern: C E _ _ A \n\nWe want a word that has neither of the absent letters and that tests between these scenarios.\n\nBut we don\'t know which scenario it is. So we can choose a word that fits one scenario and we get feedback accordingly.\n\nWe could also choose a word that has A at position 5 and E at position 4? But wait, E cannot be at position 4? Or can it? We know E cannot be at position 3 or 5? But we haven\'t tried position 4 for E? The constraints: E cannot be at positions 3 or 5? Yes? Because we tried position 3 and 5? We tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 3 in ""cleat"", and both were marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: for position 5 in ""crane"" E -> \'-\', meaning it is present but not in position 5? So E cannot be in position 5? And from ""cleat"", E at position 3 -> \'-\', meaning E cannot be in position 3. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, A must be in position 2 or 5.\n\nTherefore, E can be in position 4? Yes, in fact, one of the scenarios above.\n\nNow, let\'s think of actual words.\n\nFirst scenario: C A ? E ? \n\nPossible words: \n- ""camel"": but L is absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.\n- ""cameo"": again L? No, ""cameo"" has M E O? But E is at position 4? \n  - C A M E O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:M, 4:E, 5:O. \n  But we know L is absent, but here no L? And T absent? And R,N absent? So ""cameo"" has letters: C,A,M,E,O. \n  But is O acceptable? We don\'t know about O.\n\nBut check absent letters: R,N,L,T are absent? We haven\'t used M,O so we can try.\n\nBut we also need to see if it fits: A at 2, E at 4 -> valid.\n\nBut ""cameo"" might be a word? Yes.\n\nSecond scenario: C E ? ? A \n\nPossible words: \n- ""ceiba"": but B and I? We don\'t know about B and I. And is it a word? (a type of tree)\n- ""cecal"": but L is absent -> invalid? L cannot be used.\n\nWhat about ""cease""? But S and E? \n- ""cease"": C E A S E? \n  Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E. \n  But A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess feedback)! \n\nSo ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden.\n\nAnother: ""cella"": L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""cebta""? Not a word.\n\nWe need a word that fits pattern C E ? ? A and without using absent letters.\n\nSo positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:?, 4:?, 5:A.\n\nMust avoid letters R,N,L,T.\n\nAnd A cannot be at position 3? But in this pattern, A is at position 5? So position 3 is an unknown letter? And position 4 is unknown.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""cesta"": but S and T? T is absent -> invalid.\n- ""cetra"": R and T absent -> invalid.\n- ""ceiba"": I and B? Valid letters? We haven\'t eliminated I or B.\n\nBut ""ceiba"" is a word? (a tropical tree) -> valid? Let\'s assume it is.\n\nBut we have another possibility: what about ""cense""? But N is absent -> invalid? Because N is absent? In ""cense"": C E N S E -> contains N, so invalid because N is absent.\n\nAnother word: ""ceorl"": but O and R and L? Absent letters -> invalid.\n\nSo ""ceiba"" is a candidate? But we are not sure if it\'s common.\n\nBut maybe we can think of more common words.\n\nWhat about ""cobra"": \n- Pattern: C O B R A? That\'s C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4)???, A(5)? But R is absent -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""chapel""? But letter count? 6 letters.\n\n5 letters: ""cupra""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps scenario 1 (""ca?e?"") has more possibilities.\n\nScenario 1: C A ? E ? \n\nWords:\n- ""camel"": but L at the end? Position 5: L -> absent? We know L is absent -> invalid.\n- ""cameo"": as before? C A M E O -> letters: C,A,M,E,O. Absent letters: R,N,L,T are not in this word? So we can try? But we don\'t know if M and O are present? So acceptable? But we can guess ""cameo"" if we want to test the scenario.\n\nBut wait, note that in ""cameo"", we have E at position 4? And we would get feedback: if the secret word has E at position 4? Or not.\n\nBut let\'s see: we need to distinguish between the two scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that fits scenario 1? Or one that fits scenario 2? Or a hybrid? But we don\'t have to necessarily fit a scenario? We can use a guess that doesn\'t follow either pattern? But we must include the known letters? Not necessarily? The rules say each guess must be a valid English word? And we should aim to get information.\n\nWe could choose a word that has A in position 5 and E in position 4? But wait, for E: can E be in position 4? Yes, because E must be at 2 or 4? So in position 4? Similarly, A must be at 2 or 5? So if we put A at position 5 and E at position 4, that\'s within possibility? But that\'s actually scenario 2? Scenario 2 has E at position 2? And A at 5? Or in our scenarios, we have:\n\nScenario 1: C A ? E ? (so A at2, E at4)\nScenario 2: C E ? ? A (so E at2, A at5)\n\nBut we haven\'t considered the possibility: could we have A at position 5 and E at position 4? That would be pattern: C _ _ E A.\n\nFor example, ""cover""? but O,V,E,R -> R absent -> invalid.\n\nBut in this pattern: \n\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: A\n\nThen position 2 and 3 are unknown? Wait, but also E must be present? But position 4 is E? So that\'s fine? And A at position 5.\n\nBut we would have pattern: C * * E A? Positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:A.\n\nIs this consistent with the constraints? \n- A must be at 2 or 5? In this pattern, A is at 5? Yes.\n- E must be at position 2 or 4? In this pattern, E is at position 4? Yes.\n\nSo this is a valid possibility: pattern C??EA.\n\nSimilarly, we could have E at position 2 and A at position? Wait, no: we already have scenario 2: C E _ _ A.\n\nSo actually, there are three possibilities? Or two? Because in pattern C??EA, we have specified positions 4 and 5 as E and A? But in scenario 2, we have E at 2 and A at 5? So different.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nThe possible positions for E and A:\n\nWe must place:\n- E at either position 2 or position 4.\n- A at either position 2 or position 5? But if both are at position 2, conflict? So:\n\nCase 1: E at position 2? Then A must be at position 5? Because A cannot be at 3 or 4? And position 1 is taken? So A at 5? Then positions 3 and 4: unknown letters.\n\nCase 2: E at position 4? Then A must be either at position 2 or position 5? But if A at position 2, then E at position 4? But position 2: if E is at position 4 and A at position 2? Then that\'s one case: C A _ E _? Where _ is position? Wait, positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:?, 4:E, 5:another letter? Or if E at position 4 and A at position 5? Then pattern: C _ _ E A.\n\nTherefore, there are actually three possibilities:\n\nPossibility A: E at 2, A at 5? Then word pattern: C E ? ? A\n\nPossibility B: E at 4, A at 2? Then word pattern: C A ? E ?\n\nPossibility C: E at 4, A at 5? Then word pattern: C ? ? E A\n\nSo three possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that can differentially test these? Or we can guess a word that matches one of them and see the feedback.\n\nBut note: we have three cases? But we don\'t know which one it is.\n\nWe want to guess a word that has been used? Or not? But let\'s find a common word that matches one of the patterns and avoids absent letters.\n\nBut we must avoid R,N,L,T.\n\nPossibility A: pattern C E ? ? A\n- Examples: ""ceiba"" (as before) or ""cezva""? Not common.\n- ""cepa"" ? 4 letters.\n\nFinding a word with C E ? ? A: \n- ""cebra"": not common? Or ""cecal"" -> but L absent -> invalid.\n- ""cesar"": has R -> invalid.\n- ""cesta"": has T? T absent -> invalid.\n\nSo maybe not many common options.\n\nPossibility B: pattern C A ? E ? \n- Examples: ""cameo"", ""camel"" (but L absent? ""camel"" ends with L -> invalid), ""caper""? But R? ""caper"" has R -> invalid.\n- ""cater"" has R -> invalid.\n- ""cases""? But S and E? Pattern: C A S E S? That would be: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S? Now, E at position 4? But we know E must be at 2 or 4? But in this pattern, E is at 4? Also, S we don\'t know about? And no R,N,L,T? So ""cases"" is possible? But ""cases"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut does it have S at the end? Okay.\n\nBut let\'s write the pattern for ""cases"": \nC A S E S? Position1: C, position2: A, position3: S, position4: E, position5: S? But does S appear twice? That\'s okay? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? It is possible.\n\nAlso, we can use this.\n\nPossibility C: pattern C ? ? E A\n- Examples: ""covea""? Not common? ""cupra""? Not common.\n- ""crone"": R and N absent -> invalid.\n- ""chela"": L and H? L is absent -> invalid.\n- ""cupea""? Not common.\n\nNot many common words.\n\nTherefore, we can try to go with ""cases"" as a guess? It matches possibility B: C A S E S? With E at position 4 and A at position 2.\n\nBut also, ""cases"" has S as the third and fifth letters? That\'s fine.\n\nNow, is this a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we need to see if it\'s a good guess? We are also testing? If we guess ""cases"", then:\n\nIf the secret word is possibility B (C A ? E ?), then in our guess, A is at 2 and E at 4? Also, S at 3 would be tested? And S at 5 tested.\n\nIf the secret word is possibility A (C E ? ? A) then in ""cases"", first letter C correct? Then A at position 2: we think it might be there? But if not, then feedback: position 2: A? If the secret word has A at position 5, then A at position 2 might be marked absent? Or present? Or wait? No: the secret word has A? So A is present? But if the secret word is possibility A, then A is at position 5? So in ""cases"", A at position 2: the secret word doesn\'t have A at position 2? So we get feedback for position 2: A(-) or A(x)? Actually, if A is present (which it is) but not at position 2? Then we would get A(-), meaning present but wrong position? Similarly, E at position 4: if secret has E at position 2, then position 4: wrong? Then we would get: position 4: E(-) or E(x)? Secret has E at position 2? So E is present? But not at position 4? So E at position 4 would be marked as wrong position? So overall, if we guess ""cases"", we get feedback:\n\n- Position 1: C ✓ (as always)\n- Position 2: A? If secret is possibility B (C A ...) then A✓? But if possibility A or C, then A might be in correct position? Or not?\n\nBut let\'s evaluate:\n\nIf secret is possibility A (C E ? ? A)? Then in ""cases"", position 2: A (guessed) vs secret position 2: E? So A is not E, but there is A in the word at position 5? So A is present? But not at position 2? So we would get A(-) (present but wrong position? Or just present? The symbol is \'-\' for present but wrong position? Or if it is present, we\'ll get \'-\' if not in correct position? But position 2? Secret has E, so A is not correct at position 2? But A is in the word? So A( - )\n\nSimilarly for E: if secret is possibility A, then E is at position 2? So in ""cases"", position 4: E? Secret position 4 is not E? But secret has E? So E at position 4 would be present but wrong position? So E(-)\n\nThen position 5: S? Secret position 5 is A? So S is absent? If S is not present? Then S(x)\n\nThen position 3: S? Secret has something at position 3? If S is present? But we don\'t know? It might not be, so S(x) if absent? Or if present but not at position 3, then S(-)\n\nSo the feedback would help us rule out and then we have to guess again.\n\nBut we are limited by the number of tries.\n\nTherefore, perhaps better to choose a word that covers both scenarios? But it\'s hard.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to put E in position 2 and A in position 4? But wait, A cannot be in position 4? We know A cannot be in position 4? From feedback? In ""cleat"", A at position 4 was marked \'-\' meaning present but not in position 4? So we cannot put A at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put E at positions 3 or 5? But we can put E at position 2 or 4? And A at position 2 or 5? But if we put E? But in a guess, we can put E at position 4 and A at position 2? Which is possibility B? Or E at position 2 and A at position 5? Possibility A? Or E at position 4 and A at position 5? Possibility C.\n\nBut in possibility C, we can try a word like ""cause""? But let\'s see: ""cause"" has A at position 5? Wait, ""cause"": C A U S E? Which is C A U S E? \n- Position 1: C\n- 2: A? But we are considering possibility C: C ? ? E A? That doesn\'t match? ""cause"" would be pattern C A U S E? So E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? So ""cause"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? Because of first feedback? So we cannot guess ""cause"".\n\nSimilarly, no word can have E at position 5? Because that\'s not allowed? We only know E cannot be at positions 3 and 5? So at 2 or 4.\n\nSo let\'s go back.\n\nWe have three patterns:\n\nPat A: C E ? ? A  (E at2, A at5)\nPat B: C A ? E ?  (A at2, E at4)\nPat C: C ? ? E A  (E at4, A at5)\n\nWe can choose a guess that matches one? And see? For Pat C, possible words: without using R,N,L,T? So C ? ? E A? \n- ""covea"" not common.\n- ""chapea"" too long.\n- ""cupel""? ""cupel"" is C U P E L? But L at the end? And L is absent -> invalid.\n- ""cubic""? ends with C.\n\nHard to find. So maybe Pat C is less likely? We can start by guessing for Pat B: ""cases""?\n\nOr we can choose ""cameo"" for Pat B.\n\nBut ""cameo"" has letters C,A,M,E,O.\n\nIf we guess ""cameo"", then:\n- In Pat A: secret is C E ? ? A? Then we can see the feedback? For example, position? Will it give us information.\n\nBut let\'s finalize.\n\nWe could guess ""cease"", but ""cease"" has A at position 3 which is forbidden? Because A cannot be at position 3? From the first guess? So ""cease"" is invalid? Cannot be guessed? Or we can guess? But we know it\'s not the word because A can\'t be at 3? But we don\'t know the word; we can guess it? But it would waste a guess.\n\nSo better not.\n\nTherefore, let me choose ""cases"" for Pat B.\n\nBut ""cases"" uses S twice? And we don\'t know about S? So we can test for presence of S as well.\n\nSo guess ""cases"".\n\nThen, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut let\'s see today\'s secret word? We don\'t know? But we have to guess.\n\nPerhaps guess ""cause""? But earlier I saw that the fifth letter is E? Which is not allowed? Because E cannot be in position 5? ""cause"" -> E at position 5? That violates our knowledge? So we cannot guess words with E at position 5? Because we know it\'s present but not at position 5? So guessing ""cause"" would be bad? Because we intentionally put E at position 5? Which we  know is wrong? So we wouldn\'t do that? So avoid putting E at position 5? And avoid putting A at position 3 or 4.\n\nTherefore, for our guess, avoid positions we know are wrong.\n\nSo go with ""cases"": it has A at position 2 (we want to test if that\'s correct) and E at position 4 (test if correct) and no known absent letters.\n\nLetters in ""cases"": C,A,S,E,S? We know C, A, E are present? And S is new? If S is present, we get feedback? Or not? So the feedback will tell us.\n\nSo we guess ""cases"".\n\nBut wait, in ""cases"", the fifth letter is S? So if the secret word is pat C: C ? ? E A, then position 5: A? So in ""cases"", we are putting S there? It could be absent? Then we know S is absent and we learn that.\n\nAlso, position 3: S? Etc.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""cases"".\n\nBut to make it with only distinct letters? Not necessary.\n\nAnother option: ""capex""? Not common.\n\nWe\'ve used many letters? Doesn\'t matter.\n\nGuess ""cases"".The feedback from the first two guesses provides the following insights:\n- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 is fixed).\n- **A** must be in position 2 or 5 (it cannot be in position 3 or 4 based on feedback).\n- **E** must be in position 2 or 4 (it cannot be in position 3 or 5 based on feedback).\n- **R**, **N**, **L**, and **T** are absent and must be avoided.\n- The word must include both **A** and **E**, alongside **C**, with two other unknown letters.\n\nGiven these constraints, three possible patterns emerge:\n1. **C E ? ?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is absent.
- A is present but not in position 3 (since A was in position 3 of ""crane"").
- N is absent.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct in position 1 (already known).
- L is absent.
- E is present but not in position 3 (since E was in position 3 of ""cleat"").
- A is present but not in position 4 (since A was in position 4 of ""cleat"").
- T is absent.

Guess 3: cases -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) S(x) E(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2? But wait: the word ""cases"" is spelled: C-A-S-E-S. So positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S.
Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) S(x) E(✓) S(x)
Interpretation:
- Position 1: C ✓ (expected)
- Position 2: A ✓ -> so A is not only present but correctly placed at position 2.
- Position 3: S x -> S is absent from the word.
- Position 4: E ✓ -> E is not only present but correctly placed at position 4.
- Position 5: S x -> S is absent? But we already know from position 3 that S is absent? And indeed, both are x.

Now, what do we know?
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: A (fixed? Yes, because feedback shows ✓ for A at position 2)
- Position 4: E (fixed? Yes, ✓ for E at position 4)

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C A ? E ?

The missing letters:
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

Also, we know:
- R, N, L, T are absent (from previous feedback).
- S is absent? From the latest feedback? Yes, because S at position 3 and position 5 both got x? So S is entirely absent from the word.

Moreover, we know that the word must contain exactly the letters: C (pos1), A (pos2), E (pos4), and two more letters at positions 3 and 5? That are not R,N,L,T,S? And also not duplicate? But duplicate is possible? Though we don't have information about duplicates.

We also know that the word has 5 letters? So positions 3 and 5 must be two letters? They could be the same? Or different.

Now, from the first guess: we had E present but not at position 5? And from the second guess: A present but not at position 4? But now we know A is at position 2 and E at position 4.

Therefore, for positions 3 and 5: we need unknown letters? Let me denote position 3 as X and position 5 as Y? Then the word is C A X E Y, where X and Y are letters? And X and Y are not in the list of absent letters: R,N,L,T,S.

Also, X and Y must be such that the entire word is a valid English word.

What words fit the pattern ""CA_E_""?

We can list common words:
- ""cable"": but L is absent? L is known to be absent? So no.
- ""cache"": C A C H E? Then Y becomes H? Position 5: H? But ""cache"" is C A C H E -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:C, 4:H? Wait, no: we have position 4: E? So ""cache"" has position 4: H? Not E? So not matching.

The pattern is C A ? E ? so: C A _ E _ 

Examples of valid word? 
- ""camel"": but L? And S issue? But L is absent? So no? ""camel"" ends with L.
- ""cameo"": C A M E O? This fits: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:M, 4:E, 5:O.
- ""capes"": but S? S is absent? And ""capes"" ends with S? So S cannot be in the word? Thus invalid.
- ""capes"" has CAPES: C at1, A at2, P at3, E at4, S at5? But S is absent? So position 5:S would be marked absent? But we know S is absent? So the word can have S? No, because we were told S is absent? So the secret word does not contain S? So any word containing S would be invalid? Therefore, we cannot guess ""capes"" anyway.

So ""cameo"": C A M E O? Letters: C,A,M,E,O? Are these letters possible? We know R,N,L,T,S absent? So M and O we haven't seen? So they should be possible? Unless we have more constraints? We don't have constraints on them.

Moreover, the word must be English word: ""cameo"" is fine? Meaning a small role.

Another word: ""cadet"": C A D E T? But T is absent? T is known absent? So position 5:T would be invalid? Because T absent? Thus ""cadet"" contains T? Not allowed.

Similarly, ""cajet""? Not a word.

""cared"": R? R absent? No.

""cased"": S? S absent? No.

""cavel"": L? L absent? No.

Therefore, ""cameo"" seems a candidate? Also, ""capek""? Not common? Or ""carle""? R and L absent? No.

Other: ""caben""? N absent? No.

So the best choice might be ""cameo"".

But what about ""caned""? N? N absent? Also, D? Position 5:D? But N absent? So no.

""caked"": K and D? Possible? But is ""caked"" a word? Yes? Meaning covered with cake? But pattern: C A K E D? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:D? It fits.

And letters: K and D, both not known to be absent? We have not used R,N,L,T,S? So K and D are unknown? So valid letters.

Therefore, ""caked"" is also a candidate.

But let's list all possibilities?

Common words: 
- ""cameo""
- ""caked""
- ""capek"" (if we accept it? But it's a surname? Not common)
- ""cabes""? S? Absent? No.
- ""cades""? S and D? S absent? No.
- ""caneh""? N absent? No.
- ""caped"": D? Possible? But ""caped"" means? It might be ""caped"" as in wear a cape? But ""caped"" has C A P E D? Yes? But S? Not included? But we can try? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:P, 4:E, 5:D? Yes, and no S? So valid? And P and D?

""caped"": but word meaning? It's valid? Yes, as in superhero with cape? Or wearing a cape? Even if not, we can guess? Because it's a valid word? That's acceptable? Or not? Well, let's consider.

But ""caped"" uses D? Which we don't know about? But not absent letters? So okay.

But we also have ""cameo"" and ""caked"".

Now, which one to choose? We might want to go with a word that has common letters? But it doesn't matter? Because we only have positions 3 and 5 unknown? And we are going to guess anyway.

But note: we have 3 unknown? Only 2 letters? Positions 3 and 5? So if we guess ""cameo"", let's see the outcome:

If the secret is ""cameo"", we get all correct? If not? Then we get feedback? For example, if it's ""caked"", then we get C(✓), A(✓), M vs K? Etc.

But let's do systematically.

Also, remember that in the first guess, we had A at position 3? Which was marked as present but wrong? But how can A be present and not at position 3? But now we have A fixed at position 2? So what was going on? Actually, we have A at position 2? And in the first guess, we had A at position 3? So if the secret has A at position 2? Then when we guessed ""crane"" with A at position 3? The feedback would be that A is present but not at position 3? Which matches? So fine.

Therefore, I propose to guess ""cameo"" because it is a common word? But ""caked"" is also common? But let's not forget other words? Like ""caper""? R? R absent? No.

Another word: ""caved"": C A V E D? But what? V? D? Yes? Valid.

But let's not overcomplicate? We might need to guess between the candidates? But we have only one guess? No, we have tries left? But we should pick one? And we can pick one.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has letters we haven't tried? But in this case? Both positions 3 and 5 are unknown? And we don't know what letters have been used besides absent ones? So let's go with ""cameo"".

But is there a word that fits the pattern? Yes? Then guess it.

But let's look at the feedback for guess 3? We have positions 3 and 5: both S got x? And S is absent? So the word doesn't contain S.

Therefore, pattern ""CA_E_"" with missing two letters? Not being R,N,L,T,S? And not duplicate? Or can be duplicate? But we haven't seen duplicates? So we assume non-duplicate for now? Or not? It could be.

For example, ""babes""? But not starting with C.

Our pattern: distinct possible? Yes.

So ""cameo"", ""caked"", ""caved"", etc.

But ""caved"": C A V E D? Position5:D? Valid? Yes.

But let's consider all? We might want to guess to be informative? But since the only positions not fixed are 3 and 5? And we have to pick letters? We can pick one? And if wrong? We get feedback? Then we can guess next? But we have few tries left.

But I think: guess ""cameo"" ? It uses M and O? Or ""caked"" uses K and D? Etc.

Perhaps common letters? But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""cable""? But L? L absent? No? ""cable"" has L? Absent? Cannot.

""cadet""? T? T absent? Cannot.

So I think ""cameo"" is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: ""cameo"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Guess 1 (crane):** C is in position 1 (✓), A is in the word but not position 3 (-), E is in the word but not position 5 (-), and R/N are absent (x).
- **Guess 2 (cleat):** C is in position 1 (✓), E is in the word but not position 3 (-), A is in the word but not position 4 (-), and L/T are absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (cases):** C is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 2 (✓), E is in position 4 (✓), and S is absent (x/x).

### Key Insights:
1. The word starts with **C**, has **A** in position **2**, and **E** in position **4** (fixed positions).  
   Pattern: **C A _ E _**
2. Absent letters: **R, N, L, T, S** (must be avoided).
3. Position 3 and 5 are unknown and must be letters not in the absent list. Possible words include:
   - **cameo**: C A M E O
   - **caked**: C A K E D
   - **caped**: C A P E D
   - **cavel** (invalid due to L) or **cakes** (invalid due to S) are excluded.
4. Given the constraints, **cameo** is a valid English word that:
   - Fits the pattern ""C A _ E _"".
   - Uses **M** and **O** (new, untested letters).
   - Avoids all absent letters.

### Next Guess:
We guess **cameo** to test the pattern. If correct, it will confirm the word; if not, feedback on **M** and **O** will help narrow down Position 3 and 5 further.

<guess>cameo</guess>",cameo,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)

- Position 4: E ✓ -> E is not only present but correctly placed at position 4.

Now, what do we know?
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: A (fixed? Yes, because feedback shows ✓ for A at position 2)
- Position 4: E (fixed? Yes, ✓ for E at position 4)

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C A ? E ?

The missing letters:
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

Also, we know:
- R, N, L, T are absent (from previous feedback).
- S is absent? From the latest feedback? Yes, because S at position 3 and position 5 both got x? So S is entirely absent from the word.

The pattern is C A ? E ? so: C A _ E _ 

Examples of valid word? 
- ""camel"": but L? And S issue? But L is absent? So no? ""camel"" ends with L.

""caked"": K and D? Possible? But is ""caked"" a word? Yes? Meaning covered with cake? But pattern: C A K E D? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:D? It fits.
