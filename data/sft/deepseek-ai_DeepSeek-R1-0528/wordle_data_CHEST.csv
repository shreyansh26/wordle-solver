We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a 5-letter English word.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct position) meaning the secret word starts with 'C'
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- The letters 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter 'E' is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since in ""CRANE"" it was at the fifth and got ""-"").

So, the secret word is of the form: C _ _ _ _ 
And it contains the letter 'E', but not in the 5th position. Also, it does not contain R, A, N.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word starting with 'C', containing 'E' (but not at the end), and avoiding R, A, N.

Given that, what words are possible?
Let's think of common words starting with C and having E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

We must avoid positions that have R, A, N eliminated.

Let me brainstorm some words:
- ""CHOSE"": but we don't know about H, O, S yet. However, note that E is in the 5th position? We need E not in 5th. This would put E in 5th, so not allowed for E placement? No, wait: we can use it, but E would be in 5th which is the same position as before? But we know E is not in 5th. So we cannot put E at the end. So words ending in E are out? Actually, no: the feedback only said that E is in the word but not in the 5th position, but it could be in other positions? Wait, in the feedback, we only know that the E we placed at the 5th was wrong. So E must be somewhere in positions 1-4? But position 1 is C, so E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4? Or could it be in 5th? No, the feedback for E was ""-"" meaning not at that position. So E is not in 5th? So E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? Yes.

Therefore, the word must have E at index 1, 2, or 3? Actually, positions: index 0 is C, then positions 1,2,3,4. We have E in the word, but not in position 4 (which was the fifth letter, index 4). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So our word pattern: C _ _ _ _ , with E in one of the positions 1,2,3, and no R, A, N.

Also, since we have eliminated three letters (R, A, N), we should use other common letters.

Let me list some words:

Possible words with E in position 1,2, or 3:

- Position 1 (second letter): e.g., CE??
  - ""CELEB"" - not 5 letters? ""CEILS"", ""CELLO"", ""CELTS"", ""CENTS"", etc. But avoid letters we know: we don't know if L, I, S, etc. are in or not?

Alternatively, consider words with E in the third position: e.g., C_ _ E_ ... but we must have two letters before E? Actually, the positions: 
Index0: C, index1: ?, index2: ?, index3: E? or index1: E, index2: ?, index3:?, etc.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters to get more information.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Idea: ""CHEST"" - but H,E,S,T. However, we have E: if we put E in position 2 (index1) and the secret word's E is not there, we might get feedback. But also, note: we know E is in the word, so we can put it in positions 1,2,3 to test.

But we have to avoid the fifth position for E? Or we can put E anywhere? We can put E in the fifth position again if we want? But since we know E is not in the fifth, that would be redundant? Actually, we should avoid putting E in position 5 because we know it's wrong. So better to put it in 1,2, or 3.

So for ""CHEST"": 
- C at start: good.
- H in pos1? 
- E in pos2? 
- S in pos3?
- T in pos4?

But if the secret word has E in position 1 or 3, we might get information.

But let me check: is ""CHEST"" valid? And does it avoid R,A,N? Yes, no R,A,N.

But E is in position 2? That's index1? Wait: indices: 
0: 'C'
1: 'H'
2: 'E'
3: 'S'
4: 'T'

So E is at index2 (third letter). This is okay because we are testing a position that is not 4.

Alternatively, what about ""CHEAP""? But avoid A? Yes, because A is eliminated (feedback for A was 'x', so not in the word). So cannot use A.

Similarly, ""CRANE"" had A and we were told A is not in the word.

So I must avoid A.

Similarly, cannot use R or N.

So ""CHEST"" seems fine.

But I think we can do better: we need to test more vowels? We know the word has E but we haven't considered other vowels? We know that the word doesn't have A. And we haven't checked about O, U, I? We could try to include other vowels.

Note: we used A in the first guess and it was absent. So the word may have O, U, I?

Perhaps include O, U, I for testing?

An alternative starting word: ""COULD""? But avoids A and R,N? and we have E to place? Does it have E? No, ""COULD"" does not have E. But we know the word has E? Because we got ""-"" for E? So we must include E? Otherwise we cannot get information about E? Actually, we don't have to, but to confirm E's position we should probably include it? Or we can skip it to test other letters? But if we skip E, then if the word doesn't have E we would get 'x'... but we already know it has E? Because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word? Yes, so we know E is definitely in the word. So if we don't include E in the guess, we will see a 'x' for E? But we know it's present. So it's better to include E to find its position.

Therefore, we should use E somewhere in position 1,2, or 3.

So second guess should be a word: C, then with E at one of positions 1,2,3, and avoiding R,A,N. Also, try to use common letters we haven't tested: e.g., we haven't tested H, O, L, T, S, U, I, etc.

Try ""CHOSE"": 
- C at 0
- H at 1
- O at 2
- S at 3
- E at 4 → but E is at the 5th position? Index 4: which is the fifth letter. But we know E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at index4? Because we already know it's not there? Therefore, we should not put E at the end.

So ""CHOSE"" has E at the end, which is position 5? So we cannot do that? Actually, we can, but we expect that position to be wrong? But that doesn't help us find the correct E position? In fact, we would get '-' again for E? Or if another letter? But wait: if we put E at index4, and the word has E elsewhere, we would get '-'? But if the word doesn't have E? We know it does? So we would get '-' for E again? Which doesn't help? So better to put E in a new position to test.

Therefore, avoid placing E at index4 (the fifth letter). Place it at index1,2, or 3.

So possible: ""CELTS"", ""CENTS"", ""CHEEP"" not a word? ""CHEEK""? ""CHEEK"": C at 0, H at1, E at2, E at3? But two E's? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? Possibly. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? We have to account for that? Actually, the feedback: for duplicate letters, it's tricky? But let's see: if the word has one E, and we guess two E's: one might be -, the other x? We don't know? So better to avoid duplication? Unless necessary.

Alternative: ""CLUES"" - but has S at the end? And E at index3? So: 
0: C
1: L
2: U
3: E
4: S

This has E at index3 (fourth letter), so position 4? No: indices start at 0. So position: 1st letter:0, 2nd:1, 3rd:2, 4th:3, 5th:4? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 is the fifth letter.

So ""CLUES"": E at index3? That's the fourth letter? So we would put E in position 4? Then if the secret word has E in the fourth position? But from feedback, we know E is not in the fifth, but it could be anywhere else? Including the fourth? Wait, no: the feedback only said that E was not in the fifth position? So E could be in positions 1,2,3? Or positions 1,2,3,4? Position 4 is the fourth position? The positions: 
Position 1: index0? We have C there? So we can't? Position 2: index1? Position 3: index2? Position 4: index3? Position 5: index4.

We are told E is not at position 5 (index4)? So it could be at positions 2,3,4? Or position 1? But position1? Wait: position1? The first position? Wouldn't that be index0? But C is there? So E cannot be at position1? Because position1 is occupied by C? So the E must be in position 2, 3, or 4? Meaning indices 1,2, or 3? Yes.

Therefore, in ""CLUES"": if we put E at index3 (the fourth position? indices: 0:C, 1:L, 2:U, 3:E, 4:S? So index3 is the fourth position? Correct? Then S is at the fifth? So E is at position 4? So if we put E at index3 (fourth position) and the true E is at position 2 or 3, we would get '-' or 'x'? But we want to test a new position? So we could put it anywhere in 1,2,3? Meaning indices 1,2,3? So we can try: index1, index2, or index3.

I think a good candidate is ""CLIME"": but avoid M? We don't know. ""CLIME"": C, L, I, M, E? Then E at the fifth position? Index4? But we need to avoid that? So no.

What about ""CEDEI""? Not a word? Perhaps ""CESTI""? Not common.

I think ""COILS"" but no E? We must include E? So we have to have E in position 1,2, or 3.

Try ""CHOLE""? Not a common word? ""CHOLE"" might not be valid? ""CHUTE""? C,H,U,T,E? But E is at the end? Position5? Index4: fifth letter. So we avoid that? So we need to put E earlier.

So how about ""CHEWS""? C,H,E,W,S? Positions: 0:C, 1:H, 2:E, 3:W, 4:S? So E is at index2 (third letter)? That's good? We avoid E at the end? And avoid R,A,N? And W and S are new.

""CHEST"": 0:C, 1:H, 2:E, 3:S, 4:T? S and T? That's good.

Another option: ""CUBES"": C,U,B,E,S? E at index3? Positions: 0:C, 1:U, 2:B, 3:E, 4:S? E at the fourth position? So index3? And S at the end? That's possible.

Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" are valid? Then which one? Let's choose by commonality: ""CHEST"" is common? And uses more common letters? H, E, S, T.

We also have ""CLOSE"" but C,L,O,S,E? And E is at the end? Index4? Which is fifth? So avoid? Then ""CLOS"" ... not possible? ""CLOSE"" has E at the end? So no? Unless we don't mind? But better not?

So between ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"": both avoid R,A,N? Both have E? And E is in the middle? In ""CHEST"": index2 is E? This is position3? And in ""CUBES"": E is at position4? Which we don't know? And we haven't eliminated that? But I think both are acceptable? However, we also care about new letters? Let me count: 

With ""CHEST"": we test H, E, S, T? All of which we haven't tested? And in positions? We have tested C? So testing H at position1, E at position2? But E we already know? But we are testing its position? Similarly, S and T? We haven't tested.

Similarly, ""CUBES"": tests U, B, E, S? We haven't tested U or B? And also S? 

So perhaps ""CHEST"" is better because S and T are common? We might get information? Also, we used E and S? And T? 

Actually, the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that C is at start? And E is present? The letters R,A,N are out? So let's choose ""CHEST"".

But note: the original feedback: E was in the original word? So in ""CHEST"", if E is at the correct position (index2), it would be ✓? Else, if it is in the word but elsewhere? Then we can cross? 

However, since we don't know the exact position? We are guessing.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CHEST"".

So second guess: CHEST.

But just to confirm: the word must be 5 letters? Yes? And English? Yes.

Therefore, the guess: CHEST.

Format: <guess>chest</guess>

But note: the response format: after thinking, we output in <guess> tags.

So:

<guess>chest</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for the guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is definitely ""C"" (correct position).
- ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" are **not** in the secret word.
- ""E"" is in the secret word, but **not in the fifth position**.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"".
- ""E"" must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4 (i.e., indices 1, 2, or 3).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" cannot be used.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Including ""E"" but avoiding the fifth position (index 4).
- Using common letters not yet tested (no ""R"", ""A"", ""N"") to maximize information gain. Untested letters include consonants like ""H"", ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", and vowels like ""O"", ""U"", ""I"".
- Avoiding redundant placements (e.g., not placing ""E"" in the same position if possible).

A strong candidate is ""chest"":
- Starts with ""C"", satisfying the known first letter.
- Places ""E"" in the third position (index 2), testing a possible spot for ""E"".
- Introduces new letters: ""H"", ""S"", and ""T"".
- Avoids excluded letters (""R"", ""A"", ""N"") and avoids placing ""E"" at the end.

Other options like ""cubes"" or ""clues"" were considered, but ""chest"" uses more common letters (e.g., ""H"", ""S"", ""T"" are highly frequent in English).

Given this reasoning, the next guess is ""chest"".

<guess>chest</guess>",chest,"We are given the feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct position) meaning the secret word starts with 'C'
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)

- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- The letters 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.

In fact, we would get '-' again for E? Or if another letter? But wait: if we put E at index4, and the word has E elsewhere, we would get '-'? But if the word doesn't have E? We know it does? So we would get '-' for E again? Which doesn't help? So better to put E in a new position to test.

Therefore, avoid placing E at index4 (the fifth letter). Place it at index1,2, or 3.

So possible: ""CELTS"", ""CENTS"", ""CHEEP"" not a word? ""CHEEK""? ""CHEEK"": C at 0, H at1, E at2, E at3? But two E's? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? Possibly. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? We have to account for that? Actually, the feedback: for duplicate letters, it's tricky? But let's see: if the word has one E, and we guess two E's: one might be -, the other x? We don't know? So better to avoid duplication? Unless necessary.

Alternative: ""CLUES"" - but has S at the end? And E at index3? So: 
0: C
1: L
2: U
3: E
4: S

This has E at index3 (fourth letter), so position 4? No: indices start at 0. So position: 1st letter:0, 2nd:1, 3rd:2, 4th:3, 5th:4? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 is the fifth letter.

So ""CLUES"": E at index3? That's the fourth letter? So we would put E in position 4? Then if the secret word has E in the fourth position? But from feedback, we know E is not in the fifth, but it could be anywhere else? Including the fourth? Wait, no: the feedback only said that E was not in the fifth position? So E could be in positions 1,2,3? Or positions 1,2,3,4? Position 4 is the fourth position? The positions: 
Position 1: index0? We have C there? So we can't? Position 2: index1? Position 3: index2? Position 4: index3? Position 5: index4.

We are told E is not at position 5 (index4)? So it could be at positions 2,3,4? Or position 1? But position1? Wait: position1? The first position? Wouldn't that be index0? But C is there? So E cannot be at position1? Because position1 is occupied by C? So the E must be in position 2, 3, or 4? Meaning indices 1,2, or 3? Yes.

Therefore, in ""CLUES"": if we put E at index3 (the fourth position? indices: 0:C, 1:L, 2:U, 3:E, 4:S? So index3 is the fourth position? Correct? Then S is at the fifth? So E is at position 4? So if we put E at index3 (fourth position) and the true E is at position 2 or 3, we would get '-' or 'x'? But we want to test a new position? So we could put it anywhere in 1,2,3? Meaning indices 1,2,3? So we can try: index1, index2, or index3.

I think a good candidate is ""CLIME"": but avoid M? We don't know. ""CLIME"": C, L, I, M, E? Then E at the fifth position? Index4? But we need to avoid that? So no.

What about ""CEDEI""? Not a word? Perhaps ""CESTI""? Not common.

I think ""COILS"" but no E? We must include E? So we have to have E in position 1,2, or 3.

Try ""CHOLE""? Not a common word? ""CHOLE"" might not be valid? ""CHUTE""? C,H,U,T,E? But E is at the end? Position5? Index4: fifth letter. So we avoid that? So we need to put E earlier.

So how about ""CHEWS""? C,H,E,W,S? Positions: 0:C, 1:H, 2:E, 3:W, 4:S? So E is at index2 (third letter)? That's good? We avoid E at the end? And avoid R,A,N? And W and S are new.

""CHEST"": 0:C, 1:H, 2:E, 3:S, 4:T? S and T? That's good.

Another option: ""CUBES"": C,U,B,E,S? E at index3? Positions: 0:C, 1:U, 2:B, 3:E, 4:S? E at the fourth position? So index3? And S at the end? That's possible.

Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" are valid? Then which one? Let's choose by commonality: ""CHEST"" is common? And uses more common letters? H, E, S, T.

We also have ""CLOSE"" but C,L,O,S,E? And E is at the end? Index4? Which is fifth? So avoid? Then ""CLOS"" ... not possible? ""CLOSE"" has E at the end? So no? Unless we don't mind? But better not?

So between ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"": both avoid R,A,N? Both have E? And E is in the middle? In ""CHEST"": index2 is E? This is position3? And in ""CUBES"": E is at position4? Which we don't know? And we haven't eliminated that? But I think both are acceptable? However, we also care about new letters? Let me count: 

With ""CHEST"": we test H, E, S, T? All of which we haven't tested? And in positions? We have tested C? So testing H at position1, E at position2? But E we already know? But we are testing its position? Similarly, S and T? We haven't tested.

Similarly, ""CUBES"": tests U, B, E, S? We haven't tested U or B? And also S? 

So perhaps ""CHEST"" is better because S and T are common? We might get information? Also, we used E and S? And T? 

Actually, the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that C is at start? And E is present? The letters R,A,N are out? So let's choose ""CHEST"".

But note: the original feedback: E was in the original word? So in ""CHEST"", if E is at the correct position (index2), it would be ✓? Else, if it is in the word but elsewhere? Then we can cross? 

However, since we don't know the exact position? We are guessing.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CHEST"".

So second guess: CHEST.

But just to confirm: the word must be 5 letters? Yes? And English? Yes.

Therefore, the guess: CHEST.

Format: <guess>chest</guess>

But note: the response format: after thinking, we output in <guess> tags.

So:

<guess>chest</guess>Based on the previous feedback for the guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is definitely ""C"" (correct position).
- ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" are **not** in the secret word.
- ""E"" is in the secret word, but **not in the fifth position**.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"".
- ""E"" must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4 (i.e., indices 1, 2, or 3).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" cannot be used.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Including ""E"" but avoiding the fifth position (index 4).
- Using common letters not yet tested (no ""R"", ""A"", ""N"") to maximize information gain. Untested letters include consonants like ""H"", ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", and vowels like ""O"", ""U"", ""I"".
- Avoiding redundant placements (e.g., not placing ""E"" in the same position if possible).

A strong candidate is ""chest"":
- Starts with ""C"", satisfying the known first letter.
- Places ""E"" in the third position (index 2), testing a possible spot for ""E"".
- Introduces new letters: ""H"", ""S"", and ""T"".
- Avoids excluded letters (""R"", ""A"", ""N"") and avoids placing ""E"" at the end.

Other options like ""cubes"" or ""clues"" were considered, but ""chest"" uses more common letters (e.g., ""H"", ""S"", ""T"" are highly frequent in English).

Given this reasoning, the next guess is ""chest"".",Guess 2: chest -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
