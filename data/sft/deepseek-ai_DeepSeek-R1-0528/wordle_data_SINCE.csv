We are just starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes at least two vowels and three consonants.

 One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E.
 It includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). Also, all letters are distinct.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one? But let's stick to ""CRANE"" for now.

 So, I will guess ""CRANE"".

I'm starting the game with no prior clues, so I need a strategic first guess that maximizes information. A strong opening word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E)
- Common consonants (like R, S, N)
- All unique letters to increase coverage
- High-frequency letters in English 5-letter words

Based on this, I'll use ""CRANE"" as it satisfies these criteria:
- Contains 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (C, R, N)
- Features top-tier letters (R, A, S-family sound with C)
- Tests positions across the word
- Rated as a top starter by word game analysts

We have feedback from the first guess: ""CRANE"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
 Let's break down the feedback:
 - E is correct and in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - C is in the word but not in position 1. So C is somewhere else in the word.
 - N is in the word but not in position 4. So N is somewhere but not at the end (since E is at the end).
 - R and A are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Must have E at the fifth position: _ _ _ _ E
   - Contains C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (and also not in position 5, since that's E).
   - Does NOT contain R or A.

 Now, we have to make a second guess that:
   - Is a valid 5-letter word ending with E.
   - Contains C and N (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know where).
   - Avoids R and A, and also we can reuse letters if necessary but note the feedback for each position.

 However, note that in the first guess:
   Position 1: C (wrong position) -> so the word has a C but not at start.
   Position 4: N (wrong position) -> so N is present but not at position 4.

 Since E is fixed at the end, let's list possible positions for C and N in the first three positions (positions 2,3,4) but note: N cannot be at position 4? 
 Feedback for position 4 was N(-) meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So N could be at position 2 or 3? But wait, position 4 was the fourth letter, so N is in the word but not in position 4.

 Also, we have only two known letters: C and N, and E at the end. So there are two more unknown letters.

 Our next guess should try to place C and N in possible positions and also try to uncover other common letters.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain C and N, without R or A.

 Possible positions:
   C can be at position 2, 3, or 4? But note: position 4 is currently occupied by N in our first guess, but we know N isn't at 4. So in the new guess, we want to try C in different positions and N in different positions.

 However, we must avoid using R and A.

 Example words ending with E that contain C and N?

 Let me brainstorm: 
   ""NICHE"" -> ends with E. Contains N, C. No R or A. Let's check positions:
        N at 1, I at 2, C at 3, H at 4, E at 5.
   But note: our first guess had C at 1 (which was wrong) and N at 4 (wrong). So for NICHE: 
        N is at position 1 (we don't know if that's allowed because we haven't tested N at 1? We only know N is in the word but not at 4. It could be at 1,2,3 or even 5? But position 5 is E so N cannot be at 5.
        Actually, positions: 1,2,3 are free for C and N (and also 4 might be for C? But N cannot be at 4).

 However, we don't know if N can be at 1? Let's see: the first guess only said R and A are absent, but didn't say anything about N at 1 because in our first guess N was at 4.

 So trying N at position 1 in the second guess is allowed? But note the feedback: for the first guess, position 1 was C(-), meaning C is not at 1 and also that C is present. It doesn't restrict N at position 1 because in the first word N was at 4.

 So ""NICHE"" seems viable.

 Another word: ""INVCE""? Not a word. How about ""PIECE""? But that has two E's? And we only have one E at the end? And the double E? Also, we haven't used I? But P is new.

 However, ""PIECE"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But we have E at position 5 so that matches, but then we are also putting an E at position 3? And that might be wrong? Because we don't know about other E's.

 Also, note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But the feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicate markings? But the rules didn't say anything about duplicate letters. However, Wordle does allow duplicate letters? Actually, in the rules above: feedback by letter? Let me reread.

 The feedback marks each letter individually. So if there is a duplicate letter, and one is in the correct position and the other isn't, it marks accordingly? But in our case, we haven't encountered a duplicate.

 To be safe, let's avoid duplicates unless necessary? But we can use them? Actually, the secret word might have duplicates? But let's assume for now that we pick words without duplicates to maximize information.

 Since ""PIECE"" has two E's, it might complicate? But what if the secret word has two E's? We don't know. So better to stick to words with distinct letters? But that may not be possible? 

 However, we must have C and N. Let me search for words ending with E that contain C and N and no duplicate letters? And exclude A, R.

 Some options:

   NICHE: N, I, C, H, E -> distinct.
   CINCH: ends with H? Not E.
   CONE? only 4 letters? We need 5 letter words.
   PRINCE? ends with E? P,R,I,N,C,E -> but wait, it has 6 letters? No, ""PRINCE"" is 6? Actually, let's think: 
        We need 5-letter words: 
        Possible: MINCE (M,I,N,C,E) -> ends with E? Yes. But M is new? Avoid A and R. But MINCE: 
            M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). 
        Also, ""OUNCE"" (O,U,N,C,E) -> ends with E? Yes: O(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). But U is vowel we haven't tested? 

   However, note: MINCE: 
        We know E is at 5: so E(5) is correct.
        We need to check: 
          C in MINCE is at position 4? But in the first guess, we tried N at position 4 and it was wrong? But that doesn't mean C can't be at position 4. Position 4 is a new letter for that position.

   But what about the positions for C? In MINCE, C is at position 4? That's fine because the feedback for the first guess only said C is in the word but not at position 1, but we haven't tested position 4 for C? So it might be at 4? Similarly, N in MINCE is at position 3? We know N isn't at position 4, but position 3 is new.

   Now, let's see: which one is better? 

   We also need to consider: our goal is to cover more commonly used letters? Since we haven't used vowels? We have used E (fixed at end) and A (absent) and now we can test I, O, U? 

   Also, we must avoid A and R.

   With NICHE: letters tested: C (known), N (known), E (known), and new letters: I, H. Also, we'll test N at position 1? But note the first word had C at 1? But now N at 1.

   With MINCE: new letters: M, I.

   Another word: ""CLEAN"" -> but wait, ends with N? No, must end with E. 

   Also, note: ""SCENE""? But has two E's? S,C,E,N,E -> duplicate E? and we don't know if there is another E? So let's avoid that.

   Another: ""CONIC""? doesn't end with E? 

   ""PIECE"" we discarded because of two E's.

   So between NICHE and MINCE? Which one? 

   Note: MINCE uses M and I? Both common letters? And NICHE uses I and H? H is less common? 

   Also, in MINCE, we place C at position 4? We know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? But that doesn't prohibit C at 4? 

   However, in MINCE, we also put N at position 3? And that might be okay? 

   Let me try to list the possibilities for C and N:

   The secret word: _ _ _ _ E
   We know the word has C and N.
   C cannot be at 1? So it must be at 2,3, or 4? But if it's at 4? Then the word: ... C E
   N cannot be at 4? So N at 1,2, or 3? 

   So in MINCE: 
        Guess: M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5)
        We are testing: 
          M at 1? 
          I at 2? 
          N at 3? 
          C at 4? 
        And E at 5 fixed.

   But note: the first feedback had N at 4 wrong? That doesn't relate to testing N at 3 here? 

   Similarly, NICHE: 
        Guess: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5)
        Testing: 
          N at 1? 
          I at 2? 
          C at 3? 
          H at 4? 

   So both options seem okay? 

   Let me think if there's a word that might cover more letters? For example, not only testing C and N at different positions but also introducing more common consonants? 

   The letters we haven't used: 
        We have used: C, R (absent), A (absent), N, E (fixed at end). 
        So absent: R, A.
        We know about: C, N, E.

        The new word should include C and N? Because we know they are in? Or can we skip one to test other letters? 
        Remember: we have two known letters (C, N) and one fixed (E at end). So we have two unknown letters. But we must include C and N? Yes? Because we know they are present? 

        However, we might test a letter we've already confirmed? But we don't know their positions? So including C and N helps to pinpoint.

   Therefore, I'll choose ""MINCE"" because it uses common letters M and I? But note MINCE has I (vowel) and M (consonant). Similarly, NICHE uses I and H? And H is less common than M? 

   But let me check: M is the 15th most common letter? H is the 12th? Actually, H is more common than M? 

   Frequency in English words: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M,H,G,B,F,Y,W,K,V,X,Z,J,Q -> so H is less common than M? Wait, let me see:

   Rank (by frequency in English): 
        E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z

   So H is more common than M? H is 8th, M is 14th? 

   But also, I is 5th? So both words use I? 

   MINCE: M (14th) but not as common as H? Wait, no, H is 8th? So NICHE has H? Which is more common? 

   Actually, for the purpose of uncovering letters, I want to test more common letters? Because they are more likely to be in the word? 

   Therefore, including both I and H (in NICHE) might be better? Because H is more common than M? 

   Also, note that the word must end with E? And not have A or R? So common letters left: I, O, U, L, S, T, etc.

   Alternatively: what about ""SCONE""? But ends with E? Actually, ""SCONE"" is pronounced differently? But it's a word? Yes? And S is very common? However, ""SCONE"" has O? But note: we haven't tested O? And it avoids A and R? Letters: S, C, O, N, E? Ends with E? 

   So ""SCONE"": 
        S(1), C(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)

   But wait, the feedback for the first guess: N at position 4 was marked as '-' meaning present but not at position 4? So if the word was ""SCONE"", we have N at position 4? And that would be incorrect? Because we know N cannot be at position 4? 

   So ""SCONE"" would have N at 4? Which we know is wrong? So we cannot use that? 

   How about ""SINCE"": S, I, N, C, E? Ends with E? And positions: 
        S(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5)

   This also includes S? Which is common. Also, avoids A and R? And has no duplicates? 

   Now, let's check against the feedback constraints:

        For N: we cannot have N at position 4? In SINCE, N is at position 3? which is okay? 
        For C: we cannot have C at position 1? In SINCE, C is at position 4? which we haven't tested? 

   Also, SINCE: 
        We are testing S at position 1? 
        I at position 2? 
        N at position 3? 
        C at position 4? 

   And we know E at 5 is fixed? 

   This seems good? 

   Also, compare to MINCE: MINCE uses M? But S is more common (7th) than M (14th)? 

   So what about SINCE? 

   SINCE: S, I, N, C, E -> distinct and avoids A, R.

   So I think SINCE is a better choice? 

   But wait, we are testing C at position 4? And in the first guess, we tested N at position 4? That was wrong? But testing C at position 4? That might be okay? 

   However, if the secret word has N at position 1,2,3? And C at 2,3, or 4? But position 4 for C? Might be correct? 

   So SINCE seems a strong candidate? 

   Another: ""OUNCE""? O, U, N, C, E -> positions: O(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5)? Also avoids A, R? But U is a vowel? And less common? 

   And we haven't tested U? But O is also vowel? 

   Since we haven't tested any vowels except E (and A absent), we might want to test I or O? 

   SINCE uses I? Which is a common vowel? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""SINCE"".

   But note: we are in second guess? We can learn more from this guess.

   Alternatively, let me think if there are words that put C and N at positions we haven't eliminated? Specifically, C cannot be at 1? N cannot be at 4? 

   In SINCE: 
        C at 4 -> we haven't tested position 4 for C? So it might be possible? And N at 3 -> we haven't tested position 3? 

   We could try putting C at position 2? But SINCE doesn't do that? 

   For example, ""CHINE""? C at position 1 again? But C cannot be at 1? Because first guess had C at 1 and it was wrong? So any word that starts with C would be invalid? 

   Or ""INCLE""? Not a word? 

   ""NICHE"": N at 1, which is okay? And C at 3? which we haven't tested? 

   But SINCE uses S which is common? 

   Given the above, I choose ""SINCE"".

   But note: SINCE uses S? We don't know about S? So if S is in the word? Then we can get feedback? 

   So to cover S? Which is very common? 

   That's good? 

   Therefore, second guess: SINCE.

   So the guess is: S I N C E

   Format: <guess>SINCE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (CRANE):
- E is correctly placed at position 5 (**✓**), so the secret word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E
- C is present but not in position 1 (**-**), so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- N is present but not in position 4 (**-**)
- R and A are absent (**x**), so they can be excluded

For the second guess:
- Prioritize words ending in E
- Include C and N (since they must be somewhere in the word)
- Avoid A and R
- Test common letters and new positions to narrow down possibilities, focusing on consonants like S and vowel I
- ""SINCE"" fits: S at 1 (tests new common consonant), I at 2 (tests common vowel), N at 3 (tests against position 4 constraint), C at 4 (new position for C), E fixed at 5

<guess>SINCE</guess>",SINCE,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""CRANE"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
 Let's break down the feedback:
 - E is correct and in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - C is in the word but not in position 1. So C is somewhere else in the word.
 - N is in the word but not in position 4. So N is somewhere but not at the end (since E is at the end).
 - R and A are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Must have E at the fifth position: _ _ _ _ E
   - Contains C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (and also not in position 5, since that's E).
   - Does NOT contain R or A.

 Now, we have to make a second guess that:
   - Is a valid 5-letter word ending with E.
   - Contains C and N (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know where).
   - Avoids R and A, and also we can reuse letters if necessary but note the feedback for each position.

 However, note that in the first guess:
   Position 1: C (wrong position) -> so the word has a C but not at start.
   Position 4: N (wrong position) -> so N is present but not at position 4.

 Since E is fixed at the end, let's list possible positions for C and N in the first three positions (positions 2,3,4) but note: N cannot be at position 4? 
 Feedback for position 4 was N(-) meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So N could be at position 2 or 3? But wait, position 4 was the fourth letter, so N is in the word but not in position 4.

 Also, we have only two known letters: C and N, and E at the end. So there are two more unknown letters.

 Our next guess should try to place C and N in possible positions and also try to uncover other common letters.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain C and N, without R or A.

 Possible positions:
   C can be at position 2, 3, or 4? But note: position 4 is currently occupied by N in our first guess, but we know N isn't at 4. So in the new guess, we want to try C in different positions and N in different positions.

 However, we must avoid using R and A.

 Example words ending with E that contain C and N?

 Let me brainstorm: 
   ""NICHE"" -> ends with E. Contains N, C. No R or A. Let's check positions:
        N at 1, I at 2, C at 3, H at 4, E at 5.
   But note: our first guess had C at 1 (which was wrong) and N at 4 (wrong). So for NICHE: 
        N is at position 1 (we don't know if that's allowed because we haven't tested N at 1? We only know N is in the word but not at 4. It could be at 1,2,3 or even 5? But position 5 is E so N cannot be at 5.
        Actually, positions: 1,2,3 are free for C and N (and also 4 might be for C? But N cannot be at 4).

 However, we don't know if N can be at 1? Let's see: the first guess only said R and A are absent, but didn't say anything about N at 1 because in our first guess N was at 4.

 So trying N at position 1 in the second guess is allowed? But note the feedback: for the first guess, position 1 was C(-), meaning C is not at 1 and also that C is present. It doesn't restrict N at position 1 because in the first word N was at 4.

 So ""NICHE"" seems viable.

 Another word: ""INVCE""? Not a word. How about ""PIECE""? But that has two E's? And we only have one E at the end? And the double E? Also, we haven't used I? But P is new.

 However, ""PIECE"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But we have E at position 5 so that matches, but then we are also putting an E at position 3? And that might be wrong? Because we don't know about other E's.

 Also, note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But the feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicate markings? But the rules didn't say anything about duplicate letters. However, Wordle does allow duplicate letters? Actually, in the rules above: feedback by letter? Let me reread.

 The feedback marks each letter individually. So if there is a duplicate letter, and one is in the correct position and the other isn't, it marks accordingly? But in our case, we haven't encountered a duplicate.

 To be safe, let's avoid duplicates unless necessary? But we can use them? Actually, the secret word might have duplicates? But let's assume for now that we pick words without duplicates to maximize information.

 Since ""PIECE"" has two E's, it might complicate? But what if the secret word has two E's? We don't know. So better to stick to words with distinct letters? But that may not be possible? 

 However, we must have C and N. Let me search for words ending with E that contain C and N and no duplicate letters? And exclude A, R.

 Some options:

   NICHE: N, I, C, H, E -> distinct.
   CINCH: ends with H? Not E.
   CONE? only 4 letters? We need 5 letter words.
   PRINCE? ends with E? P,R,I,N,C,E -> but wait, it has 6 letters? No, ""PRINCE"" is 6? Actually, let's think: 
        We need 5-letter words: 
        Possible: MINCE (M,I,N,C,E) -> ends with E? Yes. But M is new? Avoid A and R. But MINCE: 
            M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). 
        Also, ""OUNCE"" (O,U,N,C,E) -> ends with E? Yes: O(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). But U is vowel we haven't tested? 

   However, note: MINCE: 
        We know E is at 5: so E(5) is correct.
        We need to check: 
          C in MINCE is at position 4? But in the first guess, we tried N at position 4 and it was wrong? But that doesn't mean C can't be at position 4. Position 4 is a new letter for that position.

   But what about the positions for C? In MINCE, C is at position 4? That's fine because the feedback for the first guess only said C is in the word but not at position 1, but we haven't tested position 4 for C? So it might be at 4? Similarly, N in MINCE is at position 3? We know N isn't at position 4, but position 3 is new.

   Now, let's see: which one is better? 

   We also need to consider: our goal is to cover more commonly used letters? Since we haven't used vowels? We have used E (fixed at end) and A (absent) and now we can test I, O, U? 

   Also, we must avoid A and R.

   With NICHE: letters tested: C (known), N (known), E (known), and new letters: I, H. Also, we'll test N at position 1? But note the first word had C at 1? But now N at 1.

   With MINCE: new letters: M, I.

   Another word: ""CLEAN"" -> but wait, ends with N? No, must end with E. 

   Also, note: ""SCENE""? But has two E's? S,C,E,N,E -> duplicate E? and we don't know if there is another E? So let's avoid that.

   Another: ""CONIC""? doesn't end with E? 

   ""PIECE"" we discarded because of two E's.

   So between NICHE and MINCE? Which one? 

   Note: MINCE uses M and I? Both common letters? And NICHE uses I and H? H is less common? 

   Also, in MINCE, we place C at position 4? We know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? But that doesn't prohibit C at 4? 

   However, in MINCE, we also put N at position 3? And that might be okay? 

   Let me try to list the possibilities for C and N:

   The secret word: _ _ _ _ E
   We know the word has C and N.
   C cannot be at 1? So it must be at 2,3, or 4? But if it's at 4? Then the word: ... C E
   N cannot be at 4? So N at 1,2, or 3? 

   So in MINCE: 
        Guess: M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5)
        We are testing: 
          M at 1? 
          I at 2? 
          N at 3? 
          C at 4? 
        And E at 5 fixed.

   But note: the first feedback had N at 4 wrong? That doesn't relate to testing N at 3 here? 

   Similarly, NICHE: 
        Guess: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5)
        Testing: 
          N at 1? 
          I at 2? 
          C at 3? 
          H at 4? 

   So both options seem okay? 

   Let me think if there's a word that might cover more letters? For example, not only testing C and N at different positions but also introducing more common consonants? 

   The letters we haven't used: 
        We have used: C, R (absent), A (absent), N, E (fixed at end). 
        So absent: R, A.
        We know about: C, N, E.

        The new word should include C and N? Because we know they are in? Or can we skip one to test other letters? 
        Remember: we have two known letters (C, N) and one fixed (E at end). So we have two unknown letters. But we must include C and N? Yes? Because we know they are present? 

        However, we might test a letter we've already confirmed? But we don't know their positions? So including C and N helps to pinpoint.

   Therefore, I'll choose ""MINCE"" because it uses common letters M and I? But note MINCE has I (vowel) and M (consonant). Similarly, NICHE uses I and H? And H is less common than M? 

   But let me check: M is the 15th most common letter? H is the 12th? Actually, H is more common than M? 

   Frequency in English words: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M,H,G,B,F,Y,W,K,V,X,Z,J,Q -> so H is less common than M? Wait, let me see:

   Rank (by frequency in English): 
        E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z

   So H is more common than M? H is 8th, M is 14th? 

   But also, I is 5th? So both words use I? 

   MINCE: M (14th) but not as common as H? Wait, no, H is 8th? So NICHE has H? Which is more common? 

   Actually, for the purpose of uncovering letters, I want to test more common letters? Because they are more likely to be in the word? 

   Therefore, including both I and H (in NICHE) might be better? Because H is more common than M? 

   Also, note that the word must end with E? And not have A or R? So common letters left: I, O, U, L, S, T, etc.

   Alternatively: what about ""SCONE""? But ends with E? Actually, ""SCONE"" is pronounced differently? But it's a word? Yes? And S is very common? However, ""SCONE"" has O? But note: we haven't tested O? And it avoids A and R? Letters: S, C, O, N, E? Ends with E? 

   So ""SCONE"": 
        S(1), C(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)

   But wait, the feedback for the first guess: N at position 4 was marked as '-' meaning present but not at position 4? So if the word was ""SCONE"", we have N at position 4? And that would be incorrect? Because we know N cannot be at position 4? 

   So ""SCONE"" would have N at 4? Which we know is wrong? So we cannot use that? 

   How about ""SINCE"": S, I, N, C, E? Ends with E? And positions: 
        S(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5)

   This also includes S? Which is common. Also, avoids A and R? And has no duplicates? 

   Now, let's check against the feedback constraints:

        For N: we cannot have N at position 4? In SINCE, N is at position 3? which is okay? 
        For C: we cannot have C at position 1? In SINCE, C is at position 4? which we haven't tested? 

   Also, SINCE: 
        We are testing S at position 1? 
        I at position 2? 
        N at position 3? 
        C at position 4? 

   And we know E at 5 is fixed? 

   This seems good? 

   Also, compare to MINCE: MINCE uses M? But S is more common (7th) than M (14th)? 

   So what about SINCE? 

   SINCE: S, I, N, C, E -> distinct and avoids A, R.

   So I think SINCE is a better choice? 

   But wait, we are testing C at position 4? And in the first guess, we tested N at position 4? That was wrong? But testing C at position 4? That might be okay? 

   However, if the secret word has N at position 1,2,3? And C at 2,3, or 4? But position 4 for C? Might be correct? 

   So SINCE seems a strong candidate? 

   Another: ""OUNCE""? O, U, N, C, E -> positions: O(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5)? Also avoids A, R? But U is a vowel? And less common? 

   And we haven't tested U? But O is also vowel? 

   Since we haven't tested any vowels except E (and A absent), we might want to test I or O? 

   SINCE uses I? Which is a common vowel? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""SINCE"".

   But note: we are in second guess? We can learn more from this guess.

   Alternatively, let me think if there are words that put C and N at positions we haven't eliminated? Specifically, C cannot be at 1? N cannot be at 4? 

   In SINCE: 
        C at 4 -> we haven't tested position 4 for C? So it might be possible? And N at 3 -> we haven't tested position 3? 

   We could try putting C at position 2? But SINCE doesn't do that? 

   For example, ""CHINE""? C at position 1 again? But C cannot be at 1? Because first guess had C at 1 and it was wrong? So any word that starts with C would be invalid? 

   Or ""INCLE""? Not a word? 

   ""NICHE"": N at 1, which is okay? And C at 3? which we haven't tested? 

   But SINCE uses S which is common? 

   Given the above, I choose ""SINCE"".

   But note: SINCE uses S? We don't know about S? So if S is in the word? Then we can get feedback? 

   So to cover S? Which is very common? 

   That's good? 

   Therefore, second guess: SINCE.

   So the guess is: S I N C E

   Format: <guess>SINCE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess (CRANE):
- E is correctly placed at position 5 (**✓**), so the secret word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E
- C is present but not in position 1 (**-**), so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- N is present but not in position 4 (**-**)
- R and A are absent (**x**), so they can be excluded

For the second guess:
- Prioritize words ending in E
- Include C and N (since they must be somewhere in the word)
- Avoid A and R
- Test common letters and new positions to narrow down possibilities, focusing on consonants like S and vowel I
- ""SINCE"" fits: S at 1 (tests new common consonant), I at 2 (tests common vowel), N at 3 (tests against position 4 constraint), C at 4 (new position for C), E fixed at 5",Guess 2: SINCE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) N(✓) C(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
