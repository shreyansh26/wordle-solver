We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: - -> R is in the word but in the wrong position
- A: ✓ -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since it's the second letter in the guess? But note: positions matter)
- N: x -> not in the secret word
- E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position

Let's break down the positions:
In ""crane"", the positions are:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

Feedback:
- A is correct and in the right position -> so in the secret word, the third letter is A? Because in the guess, A is at position 3.

But note: the example in the instructions had feedback for each position relative to the guess.

So, from the feedback:
- Position 3: A is correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word has 'A' as the third letter.
- R is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word but not at position 2).
- E is present but not at position 5.
- C and N are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A.
- The secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not C and N).

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes R and E, but not C and N.
- Avoids C and N entirely since they are not in the word.

Also, we must not use letters that are known to be absent: C and N.

Possible strategies:
- Try to place R and E in new positions to figure out their correct spots.
- We also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and E is not at position 5.

But note: the positions in the next guess must account for this.

Let me think of words that have:
- Third letter A
- Contain R and E
- Do not contain C or N.

Also, since we have only one correct letter so far (A at position 3), we want to test other letters.

We can also consider common letters to cover more.

Possible words:
- What about ""TARES""? 
  - T at position 1, A at 3 (required), R at 2? But in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R at position 2? Actually, it might be that R is at position 2 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 2. So we can try R at a different position.

Wait, the feedback for R was at position 2: it's in the word but not at that position. So we must try R at a position other than 2.

Similarly, E must not be at position 5.

So for the next guess:
- Third letter must be A.
- R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A, so R can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 3 is A, so E can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Also note that E and R are both to be included.

Let me try to list words:

Another idea: use a word that includes E and R and has A at the third position.

Examples:
- ""PARSE"": P, A (third? Let's check: P-A-R-S-E? No: P (1), A (2) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not right.

We need A at position 3.

So the word pattern: _ _ A _ _

With R and E in the remaining positions (and avoiding C and N).

Also, we have two other letters to choose.

Possible words:
- ""BEARD"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> contains E and R. But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 4. This might be acceptable? Also, we haven't tested B and D.

But we might also try to use more common consonants.

Another word: ""TEARY"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but E is at position 2 and R at 4.

But we don't know if E or R can be at these positions.

Alternatively, ""FRAME"": F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). However, in this word:
- R is at position 2 -> but in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position? That doesn't mean R cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would also be marked as ""-"", unless the correct position is 2? But that's not possible because the feedback said it's not at position 2. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""FRAME"", R is at position 2 -> that's exactly the position we must avoid. So invalid.

Similarly, E is at position 5, but the feedback said E is not at position 5? Actually: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in the guess.

So ""FR"" won't work because of R at 2 and E at 5? Actually, both problems.

So we need a word that:
- Has A at position 3.
- Includes R and E.
- R is not at position 2? Actually, we can test R at other positions. But note: we don't know if R might be at position 1, 4, or 5? And E must be at position 1, 2, or 4? (avoiding position 5 and also position 3 which is taken by A).

Let me think of words:

- ""MEATY"": M, E, A, T, Y -> but E is at position 2 and we're including E, but we don't have R? We need R.

- ""RATED"": R at 1, A at 3? Wait: R(1), A(2), T(3)? No, A must be at 3. So we need a word like: 
- _ _ A _ _

With R and E somewhere else.

Possible words:
- ""READY"": R(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but E is at 2 and R at 1? Also E at 5? No, E is at 2. And R at 1. Is that okay?
  - But we need to avoid E at 5? Actually, in this word we don't have E at position 5, so that's fine.
  - Also R is at 1, which wasn't tried before? So it's okay.

But does it avoid C and N? Yes.

However, this word has 'Y' which is less common? Maybe better to use a more common word.

Another word: ""BEARS"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). 
- E at 2? Valid because we don't know if it's E's position? Actually, the feedback for E was from position 5 in the first word, but here it's at 2. So it might be correct or incorrect, we don't know yet.

But note: we must not reuse letters that are known to be absent: C and N are absent, and we are avoiding them.

But ""BEARS"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A -> correct
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This seems good because:
- It has A at position 3.
- It includes R (at position 4) and E (at position 2).
- We avoid C and N.
- Also, R is not at position 2 (it's at 4) -> okay.

Wait, we also have E at position 2: but the feedback from the first word doesn't say anything about position 2? We only know that E is present and not at position 5.

Similarly, we know R is present and not at position 2 (from the first guess). So by putting R at 4 and E at 2, we are testing new positions.

Alternatively, we can try ""EARTH"": E(1), A(2) -> wait, but we need A at position 3, so that doesn't work.

Another word: ""TEARS"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5) -> similar to ""BEARS"".

Maybe ""PEARL"": P(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), L(5).

But then we have L, which might be okay.

However, we want to maximize new information. We have five unknown positions.

But we know the secret word has A in the middle, and contains R and E. And the unknown positions: 1,2,4,5.

Also, the secret word does not contain: C and N (and any letters that might be excluded? Only C and N so far).

So let's go with a word that uses common letters: T, S, L, etc.

I think ""BEARS"" or ""TEARS"" are good.

But let's check ""TEARS"": T, E, A, R, S.

This covers T, E, A, R, S. The S is new and common.

So I'll go with ""TEARS"".

But wait: we have E at position 2. Before E was at position 5 and it was wrong, but position 2 isn't tested? And R at position 4: before R was at position 2 and it was wrong?

So yes.

We are testing E at position 2 now.

Also, we are testing T and S.

So it seems a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEARS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is absent (x) → eliminate C.  
- R is present but misplaced (-) → R is in the word, not at position 2.  
- A is correct and in position (✓) → A must be at position 3.  
- N is absent (x) → eliminate N.  
- E is present but misplaced (-) → E is in the word, not at position 5.  

Key constraints for the next guess:  
- Must have 'A' at position 3.  
- Must include 'R' and 'E' (since both are present in the secret word).  
- 'R' cannot be at position 2 (from feedback).  
- 'E' cannot be at position 5 (from feedback).  
- Must avoid C and N (absent letters).  

Strategy: Guess a word that tests 'R' and 'E' in new positions while covering new common letters. ""TEARS"" fits well:  
- Positions: T (1), E (2), A (3), R (4), S (5).  
  - Puts 'A' at 3 (required).  
  - Puts 'E' at 2 (untested position) and 'R' at 4 (avoiding position 2).  
  - Avoids C and N.  
- Tests new letters: T and S, maximizing information.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: - -> R is in the word but in the wrong position
- A: ✓ -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since it's the second letter in the guess? But note: positions matter)
- N: x -> not in the secret word
- E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position

Let's break down the positions:
In ""crane"", the positions are:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

Feedback:
- A is correct and in the right position -> so in the secret word, the third letter is A? Because in the guess, A is at position 3.

But note: the example in the instructions had feedback for each position relative to the guess.

So, from the feedback:
- Position 3: A is correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word has 'A' as the third letter.
- R is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word but not at position 2).
- E is present but not at position 5.
- C and N are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A.
- The secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not C and N).

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes R and E, but not C and N.
- Avoids C and N entirely since they are not in the word.

Also, we must not use letters that are known to be absent: C and N.

Possible strategies:
- Try to place R and E in new positions to figure out their correct spots.
- We also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and E is not at position 5.

But note: the positions in the next guess must account for this.

Let me think of words that have:
- Third letter A
- Contain R and E
- Do not contain C or N.

Also, since we have only one correct letter so far (A at position 3), we want to test other letters.

We can also consider common letters to cover more.

Possible words:
- What about ""TARES""? 
  - T at position 1, A at 3 (required), R at 2? But in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R at position 2? Actually, it might be that R is at position 2 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 2. So we can try R at a different position.

Wait, the feedback for R was at position 2: it's in the word but not at that position. So we must try R at a position other than 2.

Similarly, E must not be at position 5.

So for the next guess:
- Third letter must be A.
- R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A, so R can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 3 is A, so E can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Also note that E and R are both to be included.

Let me try to list words:

Another idea: use a word that includes E and R and has A at the third position.

Examples:
- ""PARSE"": P, A (third? Let's check: P-A-R-S-E? No: P (1), A (2) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not right.

We need A at position 3.

So the word pattern: _ _ A _ _

With R and E in the remaining positions (and avoiding C and N).

Also, we have two other letters to choose.

Possible words:
- ""BEARD"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> contains E and R. But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 4. This might be acceptable? Also, we haven't tested B and D.

But we might also try to use more common consonants.

Another word: ""TEARY"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but E is at position 2 and R at 4.

But we don't know if E or R can be at these positions.

Alternatively, ""FRAME"": F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). However, in this word:
- R is at position 2 -> but in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position? That doesn't mean R cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would also be marked as ""-"", unless the correct position is 2? But that's not possible because the feedback said it's not at position 2. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""FRAME"", R is at position 2 -> that's exactly the position we must avoid. So invalid.

Similarly, E is at position 5, but the feedback said E is not at position 5? Actually: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in the guess.

So ""FR"" won't work because of R at 2 and E at 5? Actually, both problems.

So we need a word that:
- Has A at position 3.
- Includes R and E.
- R is not at position 2? Actually, we can test R at other positions. But note: we don't know if R might be at position 1, 4, or 5? And E must be at position 1, 2, or 4? (avoiding position 5 and also position 3 which is taken by A).

Let me think of words:

- ""MEATY"": M, E, A, T, Y -> but E is at position 2 and we're including E, but we don't have R? We need R.

- ""RATED"": R at 1, A at 3? Wait: R(1), A(2), T(3)? No, A must be at 3. So we need a word like: 
- _ _ A _ _

With R and E somewhere else.

Possible words:
- ""READY"": R(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but E is at 2 and R at 1? Also E at 5? No, E is at 2. And R at 1. Is that okay?
  - But we need to avoid E at 5? Actually, in this word we don't have E at position 5, so that's fine.
  - Also R is at 1, which wasn't tried before? So it's okay.

But does it avoid C and N? Yes.

However, this word has 'Y' which is less common? Maybe better to use a more common word.

Another word: ""BEARS"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). 
- E at 2? Valid because we don't know if it's E's position? Actually, the feedback for E was from position 5 in the first word, but here it's at 2. So it might be correct or incorrect, we don't know yet.

But note: we must not reuse letters that are known to be absent: C and N are absent, and we are avoiding them.

But ""BEARS"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A -> correct
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This seems good because:
- It has A at position 3.
- It includes R (at position 4) and E (at position 2).
- We avoid C and N.
- Also, R is not at position 2 (it's at 4) -> okay.

Wait, we also have E at position 2: but the feedback from the first word doesn't say anything about position 2? We only know that E is present and not at position 5.

Similarly, we know R is present and not at position 2 (from the first guess). So by putting R at 4 and E at 2, we are testing new positions.

Alternatively, we can try ""EARTH"": E(1), A(2) -> wait, but we need A at position 3, so that doesn't work.

Another word: ""TEARS"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5) -> similar to ""BEARS"".

Maybe ""PEARL"": P(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), L(5).

But then we have L, which might be okay.

However, we want to maximize new information. We have five unknown positions.

But we know the secret word has A in the middle, and contains R and E. And the unknown positions: 1,2,4,5.

Also, the secret word does not contain: C and N (and any letters that might be excluded? Only C and N so far).

So let's go with a word that uses common letters: T, S, L, etc.

I think ""BEARS"" or ""TEARS"" are good.

But let's check ""TEARS"": T, E, A, R, S.

This covers T, E, A, R, S. The S is new and common.

So I'll go with ""TEARS"".

But wait: we have E at position 2. Before E was at position 5 and it was wrong, but position 2 isn't tested? And R at position 4: before R was at position 2 and it was wrong?

So yes.

We are testing E at position 2 now.

Also, we are testing T and S.

So it seems a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEARS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is absent (x) → eliminate C.  
- R is present but misplaced (-) → R is in the word, not at position 2.  
- A is correct and in position (✓) → A must be at position 3.  
- N is absent (x) → eliminate N.  
- E is present but misplaced (-) → E is in the word, not at position 5.  

Key constraints for the next guess:  
- Must have 'A' at position 3.  
- Must include 'R' and 'E' (since both are present in the secret word).  
- 'R' cannot be at position 2 (from feedback).  
- 'E' cannot be at position 5 (from feedback).  
- Must avoid C and N (absent letters).  

Strategy: Guess a word that tests 'R' and 'E' in new positions while covering new common letters. ""TEARS"" fits well:  
- Positions: T (1), E (2), A (3), R (4), S (5).  
  - Puts 'A' at 3 (required).  
  - Puts 'E' at 2 (untested position) and 'R' at 4 (avoiding position 2).  
  - Avoids C and N.  
- Tests new letters: T and S, maximizing information.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but wrong position) → so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but wrong position) → so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""tears""
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → so the second letter is E
- A: ✓ (correct position) → third letter is A (already known)
- R: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is R
- S: x (absent)

Now, combining the information:

From Guess 2:
- Position 2: E is correct → secret word has E at position 2.
- Position 3: A is correct → already known.
- Position 4: R is correct → secret word has R at position 4.

Also, from Guess 1, we knew that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4) and E was present but not at position 5 (now we know it's at position 2).

We also know:
- C, N, T, S are absent (from both guesses: C and N from first, T and S from second).

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R

And we know the word contains E, A, R at these positions.

Now, what about positions 1 and 5?

We know that the secret word has E at position 2, so the E in the first guess (which was at position 5) was misplaced, which is consistent because now we know E is at 2.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S})
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S}, and also note that E was misplaced at position 5 in the first guess, but that doesn't mean position 5 can't be E? Actually, we know E is at position 2, so position 5 cannot be E because the word has only one E? Not necessarily, Wordle words can have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far. However, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. But if the word had two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 5, then the feedback for the first guess would have shown E as correct at position 5? But it didn't, it showed as misplaced. So that implies that the E at position 5 in the first guess is the same E that is at position 2? Therefore, the secret word has only one E. Similarly, for R: in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked as misplaced, but now we know it's at position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have seen a different feedback? But in the second guess, R at position 4 is correct, so if there were another R, we might have seen it? But we didn't, so probably only one R.

But to be safe, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, without evidence of repetition, we can assume no repetition for now.

So, the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have no duplicates in the feedback.

Therefore, for position 5, it cannot be E (because E is already at position 2 and we assume no repetition) and also cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be E (because position 2 is E), and cannot be A, R (because they are at 3 and 4) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 5 from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But note: we know the word has E, A, R, and two more letters.

We also know that the first guess had E and it was misplaced at position 5, but that doesn't add new constraint because we now know E is at 2.

Now, what about the first guess: we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, but now we know R is at 4, so that's consistent.

We need to find words that fit: _ E A R _

With the first and last positions being letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S}? But wait, A, E, R are in the word but already placed, so the other two letters must be different.

So the available letters are: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But we must consider that the word might have other letters that are common.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""PEARL"": but P is not excluded? We haven't seen P. But in ""PEARL"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, L at 5. But we have S excluded? L is not excluded. However, we have to check if P and L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the excluded list.

But wait, in the second guess we used ""tears"", which had S at the end and it was absent, so S is excluded. Similarly, T is excluded.

But P and L are not excluded.

However, ""PEARL"" has L at position 5. Is that acceptable? Yes.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was misplaced, but that doesn't affect L.

Another word: ""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, T at 5. But T is excluded (from second guess: T was absent). So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""BEARD"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.

""BEARD"" is a word.

""LEARN"": L at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N is excluded (from first guess: N absent). So no.

""GEARS"": G at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5. But S is excluded.

""WEARY"": W at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Y is not excluded.

So possible words: ""BEARD"", ""PEARL"", ""WEARY"", etc.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. We want to maximize information? Or just solve it?

Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to guess the word.

But we have two positions: 1 and 5.

We can choose a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can think: what letters are likely?

But note: we have no information about position 1 and 5, so we need to test.

However, we can choose a word that might be the answer.

Let me list common words that fit the pattern:

- BEARD
- PEARL
- WEAR? But that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- HEARD: H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.
- LEAR? 4 letters.
- GEAR? 4 letters.
- YEARN: Y at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N excluded.
- DEARY: D at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Not common, but valid? Or ""DEAR"" is common, but with Y? ""DEARY"" might be archaic.

More common: ""HEART"" but T excluded.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. But then position 4 is D, but we know position 4 must be R? So no, that doesn't work.

We have position 4 fixed as R.

So only words with E at 2, A at 3, R at 4.

So: _ E A R _

Possible: 
- BEAR? 4 letters, so not.
- BEARD: B, E, A, R, D
- PEARL: P, E, A, R, L
- HEARD: H, E, A, R, D
- WEARY: W, E, A, R, Y
- GEAR? 4 letters.

Also, ""FEARS"": but F at 1, and S at 5? S excluded.

""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5? S excluded.

""REARM"": R at 1, but R is already at position 4? So if we use R at position 1, that would be a repeated letter. But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In the feedback, we haven't seen any repetition. But it's possible.

For example, if the word is ""REARM"", then positions: R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5). But then the first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""REARM"", there is an R at position 1 and 4. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, it should be marked as present (because R is in the word) but not at position 2. Then in the second guess ""tears"", we have R at position 4 which is correct. But also, if we had R at position 1 in the secret word, then in the second guess we didn't have a letter at position 1 to test R? So we don't know.

But in the second guess, we had T at position 1, which was absent, so if the secret word had R at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. But we don't have evidence for or against repetition.

However, to be safe, we should consider words without repetition first, since we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

So let's assume no repetition for now.

Therefore, the word must have distinct letters.

So for position 1, it cannot be E, A, R (because they are already used) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E, A, R, and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So available letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- BEARD: B and D
- PEARL: P and L
- HEARD: H and D
- WEARY: W and Y

We can choose one that uses common letters.

But note: we have no information about these letters, so we might as well guess a word that is common.

""BEARD"" is a common word.

But let's see if we can get more information? Since we have three letters fixed, we might solve it in this guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are common and might appear in many words, but since we are down to two positions, it's better to guess a candidate.

I think ""BEARD"" is a good candidate.

But we have ""HEARD"" as well.

Another one: ""GEAR?"" no.

""LEARN"" but N excluded.

""PEARL"" is also common.

But let's consider: in the first guess, we had no information about the first and last letters.

We can also think about the feedback: in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (absent), position 5 was E (misplaced). Now we know E is at 2.

So for position 5, it must be a letter that is not E, and not the excluded ones.

Similarly for position 1.

I think we should guess ""BEARD"".

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel in position 5? But not necessary.

I think ""BEARD"" is fine.

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another common word: ""WEIRD""? But that has I at position 3? No, position 3 is A, so not.

So I'll go with ""BEARD"".

But let's check the letters: B, E, A, R, D.

B and D are not excluded.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BEARD"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position), N (absent), E (present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - The secret word has 'A' at position 3.  
    - 'R' and 'E' are in the word, but not at positions 2 or 5, respectively.  
    - 'C' and 'N' are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""tears""** → Feedback: T (absent), E (correct position), A (correct position), R (correct position), S (absent).  
  - This reveals:  
    - 'E' is at position 2.  
    - 'A' is at position 3 (already known).  
    - 'R' is at position 4.  
    - 'T' and 'S' are absent.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: E  
  - Position 3: A  
  - Position 4: R  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Available positions**: Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S} (since A, E, R are already placed and we assume no repeated letters based on feedback).  
- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _`.  
- Common 5-letter words fitting this pattern include ""BEARD"", ""HEARD"", ""PEARL"", and ""WEARY"".  
- ""BEARD"" is chosen because:  
  - It uses common letters (B and D) that are not excluded.  
  - It tests a plausible candidate word efficiently, as we have 3 letters confirmed and only positions 1 and 5 unknown.  
- If ""BEARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., by confirming or ruling out B and D).

<guess>beard</guess>",beard,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but wrong position) → so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but wrong position) → so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""tears""
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → so the second letter is E
- A: ✓ (correct position) → third letter is A (already known)
- R: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is R
- S: x (absent)

Now, combining the information:

From Guess 2:
- Position 2: E is correct → secret word has E at position 2.
- Position 3: A is correct → already known.
- Position 4: R is correct → secret word has R at position 4.

Also, from Guess 1, we knew that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4) and E was present but not at position 5 (now we know it's at position 2).

We also know:
- C, N, T, S are absent (from both guesses: C and N from first, T and S from second).

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R

And we know the word contains E, A, R at these positions.

Now, what about positions 1 and 5?

We know that the secret word has E at position 2, so the E in the first guess (which was at position 5) was misplaced, which is consistent because now we know E is at 2.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S})
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S}, and also note that E was misplaced at position 5 in the first guess, but that doesn't mean position 5 can't be E? Actually, we know E is at position 2, so position 5 cannot be E because the word has only one E? Not necessarily, Wordle words can have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far. However, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. But if the word had two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 5, then the feedback for the first guess would have shown E as correct at position 5? But it didn't, it showed as misplaced. So that implies that the E at position 5 in the first guess is the same E that is at position 2? Therefore, the secret word has only one E. Similarly, for R: in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked as misplaced, but now we know it's at position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have seen a different feedback? But in the second guess, R at position 4 is correct, so if there were another R, we might have seen it? But we didn't, so probably only one R.

But to be safe, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, without evidence of repetition, we can assume no repetition for now.

So, the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have no duplicates in the feedback.

Therefore, for position 5, it cannot be E (because E is already at position 2 and we assume no repetition) and also cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be E (because position 2 is E), and cannot be A, R (because they are at 3 and 4) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 5 from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But note: we know the word has E, A, R, and two more letters.

We also know that the first guess had E and it was misplaced at position 5, but that doesn't add new constraint because we now know E is at 2.

Now, what about the first guess: we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, but now we know R is at 4, so that's consistent.

We need to find words that fit: _ E A R _

With the first and last positions being letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S}? But wait, A, E, R are in the word but already placed, so the other two letters must be different.

So the available letters are: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But we must consider that the word might have other letters that are common.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""PEARL"": but P is not excluded? We haven't seen P. But in ""PEARL"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, L at 5. But we have S excluded? L is not excluded. However, we have to check if P and L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the excluded list.

But wait, in the second guess we used ""tears"", which had S at the end and it was absent, so S is excluded. Similarly, T is excluded.

But P and L are not excluded.

However, ""PEARL"" has L at position 5. Is that acceptable? Yes.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was misplaced, but that doesn't affect L.

Another word: ""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, T at 5. But T is excluded (from second guess: T was absent). So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""BEARD"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.

""BEARD"" is a word.

""LEARN"": L at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N is excluded (from first guess: N absent). So no.

""GEARS"": G at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5. But S is excluded.

""WEARY"": W at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Y is not excluded.

So possible words: ""BEARD"", ""PEARL"", ""WEARY"", etc.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. We want to maximize information? Or just solve it?

Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to guess the word.

But we have two positions: 1 and 5.

We can choose a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can think: what letters are likely?

But note: we have no information about position 1 and 5, so we need to test.

Let me list common words that fit the pattern:

- LEAR? 4 letters.
- GEAR? 4 letters.
- YEARN: Y at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N excluded.
- DEARY: D at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Not common, but valid? Or ""DEAR"" is common, but with Y? ""DEARY"" might be archaic.

More common: ""HEART"" but T excluded.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. But then position 4 is D, but we know position 4 must be R? So no, that doesn't work.

We have position 4 fixed as R.

So only words with E at 2, A at 3, R at 4.

So: _ E A R _

Possible: 
- BEAR? 4 letters, so not.
- BEARD: B, E, A, R, D
- PEARL: P, E, A, R, L
- HEARD: H, E, A, R, D
- WEARY: W, E, A, R, Y
- GEAR? 4 letters.

Also, ""FEARS"": but F at 1, and S at 5? S excluded.

""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5? S excluded.

""REARM"": R at 1, but R is already at position 4? So if we use R at position 1, that would be a repeated letter. But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In the feedback, we haven't seen any repetition. But it's possible.

For example, if the word is ""REARM"", then positions: R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5). But then the first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""REARM"", there is an R at position 1 and 4. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, it should be marked as present (because R is in the word) but not at position 2. Then in the second guess ""tears"", we have R at position 4 which is correct. But also, if we had R at position 1 in the secret word, then in the second guess we didn't have a letter at position 1 to test R? So we don't know.

But in the second guess, we had T at position 1, which was absent, so if the secret word had R at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. But we don't have evidence for or against repetition.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E, A, R, and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So available letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- BEARD: B and D
- PEARL: P and L
- HEARD: H and D
- WEARY: W and Y

We can choose one that uses common letters.

But note: we have no information about these letters, so we might as well guess a word that is common.

""BEARD"" is a common word.

But let's see if we can get more information? Since we have three letters fixed, we might solve it in this guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are common and might appear in many words, but since we are down to two positions, it's better to guess a candidate.

I think ""BEARD"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""GEAR?"" no.

""LEARN"" but N excluded.

""PEARL"" is also common.

But let's consider: in the first guess, we had no information about the first and last letters.

We can also think about the feedback: in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (absent), position 5 was E (misplaced). Now we know E is at 2.

So for position 5, it must be a letter that is not E, and not the excluded ones.

Similarly for position 1.

I think we should guess ""BEARD"".

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel in position 5? But not necessary.

I think ""BEARD"" is fine.

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another common word: ""WEIRD""? But that has I at position 3? No, position 3 is A, so not.

So I'll go with ""BEARD"".

But let's check the letters: B, E, A, R, D.

B and D are not excluded.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BEARD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position), N (absent), E (present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - The secret word has 'A' at position 3.  
    - 'R' and 'E' are in the word, but not at positions 2 or 5, respectively.  
    - 'C' and 'N' are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""tears""** → Feedback: T (absent), E (correct position), A (correct position), R (correct position), S (absent).  
  - This reveals:  
    - 'E' is at position 2.  
    - 'A' is at position 3 (already known).  
    - 'R' is at position 4.  
    - 'T' and 'S' are absent.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Fixed positions**:

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: - -> R is in the word but in the wrong position
- A: ✓ -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since it's the second letter in the guess? But note: positions matter)
- N: x -> not in the secret word
- E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position

Let's break down the positions:
In ""crane"", the positions are:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

Feedback:
- A is correct and in the right position -> so in the secret word, the third letter is A? Because in the guess, A is at position 3.

But note: the example in the instructions had feedback for each position relative to the guess.

So, from the feedback:
- Position 3: A is correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word has 'A' as the third letter.
- R is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word but not at position 2).
- E is present but not at position 5.
- C and N are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A.
- The secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not C and N).

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes R and E, but not C and N.
- Avoids C and N entirely since they are not in the word.

Also, we must not use letters that are known to be absent: C and N.

Possible strategies:
- Try to place R and E in new positions to figure out their correct spots.
- We also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and E is not at position 5.

But note: the positions in the next guess must account for this.

Let me think of words that have:
- Third letter A
- Contain R and E
- Do not contain C or N.

Also, since we have only one correct letter so far (A at position 3), we want to test other letters.

We can also consider common letters to cover more.

Possible words:
- What about ""TARES""? 
  - T at position 1, A at 3 (required), R at 2? But in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R at position 2? Actually, it might be that R is at position 2 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 2. So we can try R at a different position.

Wait, the feedback for R was at position 2: it's in the word but not at that position. So we must try R at a position other than 2.

Similarly, E must not be at position 5.

So for the next guess:
- Third letter must be A.
- R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A, so R can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 3 is A, so E can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Also note that E and R are both to be included.

Let me try to list words:

Another idea: use a word that includes E and R and has A at the third position.

Examples:
- ""PARSE"": P, A (third? Let's check: P-A-R-S-E? No: P (1), A (2) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not right.

We need A at position 3.

So the word pattern: _ _ A _ _

With R and E in the remaining positions (and avoiding C and N).

Also, we have two other letters to choose.

Possible words:
- ""BEARD"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> contains E and R. But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 4. This might be acceptable? Also, we haven't tested B and D.

But we might also try to use more common consonants.

Another word: ""TEARY"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but E is at position 2 and R at 4.

But we don't know if E or R can be at these positions.

Alternatively, ""FRAME"": F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). However, in this word:
- R is at position 2 -> but in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position? That doesn't mean R cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would also be marked as ""-"", unless the correct position is 2? But that's not possible because the feedback said it's not at position 2. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""FRAME"", R is at position 2 -> that's exactly the position we must avoid. So invalid.

Similarly, E is at position 5, but the feedback said E is not at position 5? Actually: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in the guess.

So ""FR"" won't work because of R at 2 and E at 5? Actually, both problems.

So we need a word that:
- Has A at position 3.
- Includes R and E.
- R is not at position 2? Actually, we can test R at other positions. But note: we don't know if R might be at position 1, 4, or 5? And E must be at position 1, 2, or 4? (avoiding position 5 and also position 3 which is taken by A).

Let me think of words:

- ""MEATY"": M, E, A, T, Y -> but E is at position 2 and we're including E, but we don't have R? We need R.

- ""RATED"": R at 1, A at 3? Wait: R(1), A(2), T(3)? No, A must be at 3. So we need a word like: 
- _ _ A _ _

With R and E somewhere else.

Possible words:
- ""READY"": R(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but E is at 2 and R at 1? Also E at 5? No, E is at 2. And R at 1. Is that okay?
  - But we need to avoid E at 5? Actually, in this word we don't have E at position 5, so that's fine.
  - Also R is at 1, which wasn't tried before? So it's okay.

But does it avoid C and N? Yes.

However, this word has 'Y' which is less common? Maybe better to use a more common word.

Another word: ""BEARS"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). 
- E at 2? Valid because we don't know if it's E's position? Actually, the feedback for E was from position 5 in the first word, but here it's at 2. So it might be correct or incorrect, we don't know yet.

But note: we must not reuse letters that are known to be absent: C and N are absent, and we are avoiding them.

But ""BEARS"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A -> correct
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This seems good because:
- It has A at position 3.
- It includes R (at position 4) and E (at position 2).
- We avoid C and N.
- Also, R is not at position 2 (it's at 4) -> okay.

Wait, we also have E at position 2: but the feedback from the first word doesn't say anything about position 2? We only know that E is present and not at position 5.

Similarly, we know R is present and not at position 2 (from the first guess). So by putting R at 4 and E at 2, we are testing new positions.

Alternatively, we can try ""EARTH"": E(1), A(2) -> wait, but we need A at position 3, so that doesn't work.

Another word: ""TEARS"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5) -> similar to ""BEARS"".

Maybe ""PEARL"": P(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), L(5).

But then we have L, which might be okay.

However, we want to maximize new information. We have five unknown positions.

But we know the secret word has A in the middle, and contains R and E. And the unknown positions: 1,2,4,5.

Also, the secret word does not contain: C and N (and any letters that might be excluded? Only C and N so far).

So let's go with a word that uses common letters: T, S, L, etc.

I think ""BEARS"" or ""TEARS"" are good.

But let's check ""TEARS"": T, E, A, R, S.

This covers T, E, A, R, S. The S is new and common.

So I'll go with ""TEARS"".

But wait: we have E at position 2. Before E was at position 5 and it was wrong, but position 2 isn't tested? And R at position 4: before R was at position 2 and it was wrong?

So yes.

We are testing E at position 2 now.

Also, we are testing T and S.

So it seems a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEARS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is absent (x) → eliminate C.  
- R is present but misplaced (-) → R is in the word, not at position 2.  
- A is correct and in position (✓) → A must be at position 3.  
- N is absent (x) → eliminate N.  
- E is present but misplaced (-) → E is in the word, not at position 5.  

Key constraints for the next guess:  
- Must have 'A' at position 3.  
- Must include 'R' and 'E' (since both are present in the secret word).  
- 'R' cannot be at position 2 (from feedback).  
- 'E' cannot be at position 5 (from feedback).  
- Must avoid C and N (absent letters).  

Strategy: Guess a word that tests 'R' and 'E' in new positions while covering new common letters. ""TEARS"" fits well:  
- Positions: T (1), E (2), A (3), R (4), S (5).  
  - Puts 'A' at 3 (required).  
  - Puts 'E' at 2 (untested position) and 'R' at 4 (avoiding position 2).  
  - Avoids C and N.  
- Tests new letters: T and S, maximizing information.

<guess>tears</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but wrong position) → so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but wrong position) → so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""tears""
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → so the second letter is E
- A: ✓ (correct position) → third letter is A (already known)
- R: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is R
- S: x (absent)

Now, combining the information:

From Guess 2:
- Position 2: E is correct → secret word has E at position 2.
- Position 3: A is correct → already known.
- Position 4: R is correct → secret word has R at position 4.

Also, from Guess 1, we knew that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4) and E was present but not at position 5 (now we know it's at position 2).

We also know:
- C, N, T, S are absent (from both guesses: C and N from first, T and S from second).

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R

And we know the word contains E, A, R at these positions.

Now, what about positions 1 and 5?

We know that the secret word has E at position 2, so the E in the first guess (which was at position 5) was misplaced, which is consistent because now we know E is at 2.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S})
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S}, and also note that E was misplaced at position 5 in the first guess, but that doesn't mean position 5 can't be E? Actually, we know E is at position 2, so position 5 cannot be E because the word has only one E? Not necessarily, Wordle words can have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far. However, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. But if the word had two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 5, then the feedback for the first guess would have shown E as correct at position 5? But it didn't, it showed as misplaced. So that implies that the E at position 5 in the first guess is the same E that is at position 2? Therefore, the secret word has only one E. Similarly, for R: in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked as misplaced, but now we know it's at position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have seen a different feedback? But in the second guess, R at position 4 is correct, so if there were another R, we might have seen it? But we didn't, so probably only one R.

But to be safe, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, without evidence of repetition, we can assume no repetition for now.

So, the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have no duplicates in the feedback.

Therefore, for position 5, it cannot be E (because E is already at position 2 and we assume no repetition) and also cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be E (because position 2 is E), and cannot be A, R (because they are at 3 and 4) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 5 from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But note: we know the word has E, A, R, and two more letters.

We also know that the first guess had E and it was misplaced at position 5, but that doesn't add new constraint because we now know E is at 2.

Now, what about the first guess: we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, but now we know R is at 4, so that's consistent.

We need to find words that fit: _ E A R _

With the first and last positions being letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S}? But wait, A, E, R are in the word but already placed, so the other two letters must be different.

So the available letters are: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But we must consider that the word might have other letters that are common.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""PEARL"": but P is not excluded? We haven't seen P. But in ""PEARL"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, L at 5. But we have S excluded? L is not excluded. However, we have to check if P and L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the excluded list.

But wait, in the second guess we used ""tears"", which had S at the end and it was absent, so S is excluded. Similarly, T is excluded.

But P and L are not excluded.

However, ""PEARL"" has L at position 5. Is that acceptable? Yes.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was misplaced, but that doesn't affect L.

Another word: ""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, T at 5. But T is excluded (from second guess: T was absent). So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""BEARD"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.

""BEARD"" is a word.

""LEARN"": L at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N is excluded (from first guess: N absent). So no.

""GEARS"": G at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5. But S is excluded.

""WEARY"": W at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Y is not excluded.

So possible words: ""BEARD"", ""PEARL"", ""WEARY"", etc.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. We want to maximize information? Or just solve it?

Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to guess the word.

But we have two positions: 1 and 5.

We can choose a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can think: what letters are likely?

But note: we have no information about position 1 and 5, so we need to test.

However, we can choose a word that might be the answer.

Let me list common words that fit the pattern:

- BEARD
- PEARL
- WEAR? But that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- HEARD: H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.
- LEAR? 4 letters.
- GEAR? 4 letters.
- YEARN: Y at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N excluded.
- DEARY: D at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Not common, but valid? Or ""DEAR"" is common, but with Y? ""DEARY"" might be archaic.

More common: ""HEART"" but T excluded.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. But then position 4 is D, but we know position 4 must be R? So no, that doesn't work.

We have position 4 fixed as R.

So only words with E at 2, A at 3, R at 4.

So: _ E A R _

Possible: 
- BEAR? 4 letters, so not.
- BEARD: B, E, A, R, D
- PEARL: P, E, A, R, L
- HEARD: H, E, A, R, D
- WEARY: W, E, A, R, Y
- GEAR? 4 letters.

Also, ""FEARS"": but F at 1, and S at 5? S excluded.

""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5? S excluded.

""REARM"": R at 1, but R is already at position 4? So if we use R at position 1, that would be a repeated letter. But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In the feedback, we haven't seen any repetition. But it's possible.

For example, if the word is ""REARM"", then positions: R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5). But then the first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""REARM"", there is an R at position 1 and 4. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, it should be marked as present (because R is in the word) but not at position 2. Then in the second guess ""tears"", we have R at position 4 which is correct. But also, if we had R at position 1 in the secret word, then in the second guess we didn't have a letter at position 1 to test R? So we don't know.

But in the second guess, we had T at position 1, which was absent, so if the secret word had R at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. But we don't have evidence for or against repetition.

However, to be safe, we should consider words without repetition first, since we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

So let's assume no repetition for now.

Therefore, the word must have distinct letters.

So for position 1, it cannot be E, A, R (because they are already used) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E, A, R, and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So available letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- BEARD: B and D
- PEARL: P and L
- HEARD: H and D
- WEARY: W and Y

We can choose one that uses common letters.

But note: we have no information about these letters, so we might as well guess a word that is common.

""BEARD"" is a common word.

But let's see if we can get more information? Since we have three letters fixed, we might solve it in this guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are common and might appear in many words, but since we are down to two positions, it's better to guess a candidate.

I think ""BEARD"" is a good candidate.

But we have ""HEARD"" as well.

Another one: ""GEAR?"" no.

""LEARN"" but N excluded.

""PEARL"" is also common.

But let's consider: in the first guess, we had no information about the first and last letters.

We can also think about the feedback: in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (absent), position 5 was E (misplaced). Now we know E is at 2.

So for position 5, it must be a letter that is not E, and not the excluded ones.

Similarly for position 1.

I think we should guess ""BEARD"".

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel in position 5? But not necessary.

I think ""BEARD"" is fine.

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another common word: ""WEIRD""? But that has I at position 3? No, position 3 is A, so not.

So I'll go with ""BEARD"".

But let's check the letters: B, E, A, R, D.

B and D are not excluded.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BEARD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position), N (absent), E (present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - The secret word has 'A' at position 3.  
    - 'R' and 'E' are in the word, but not at positions 2 or 5, respectively.  
    - 'C' and 'N' are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""tears""** → Feedback: T (absent), E (correct position), A (correct position), R (correct position), S (absent).  
  - This reveals:  
    - 'E' is at position 2.  
    - 'A' is at position 3 (already known).  
    - 'R' is at position 4.  
    - 'T' and 'S' are absent.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: E  
  - Position 3: A  
  - Position 4: R  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Available positions**: Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S} (since A, E, R are already placed and we assume no repeated letters based on feedback).  
- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _`.  
- Common 5-letter words fitting this pattern include ""BEARD"", ""HEARD"", ""PEARL"", and ""WEARY"".  
- ""BEARD"" is chosen because:  
  - It uses common letters (B and D) that are not excluded.  
  - It tests a plausible candidate word efficiently, as we have 3 letters confirmed and only positions 1 and 5 unknown.  
- If ""BEARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., by confirming or ruling out B and D).

Maybe better to use a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""BEARS"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). \n- E at 2? Valid because we don\'t know if it\'s E\'s position? Actually, the feedback for E was from position 5 in the first word, but here it\'s at 2. So it might be correct or incorrect, we don\'t know yet.\n\nBut note: we must not reuse letters that are known to be absent: C and N are absent, and we are avoiding them.\n\nBut ""BEARS"": \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: A -> correct\n- Position 4: R\n- Position 5: S\n\nThis seems good because:\n- It has A at position 3.\n- It includes R (at position 4) and E (at position 2).\n- We avoid C and N.\n- Also, R is not at position 2 (it\'s at 4) -> okay.\n\nWait, we also have E at position 2: but the feedback from the first word doesn\'t say anything about position 2? We only know that E is present and not at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we know R is present and not at position 2 (from the first guess). So by putting R at 4 and E at 2, we are testing new positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""EARTH"": E(1), A(2) -> wait, but we need A at position 3, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother word: ""TEARS"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5) -> similar to ""BEARS"".\n\nMaybe ""PEARL"": P(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), L(5).\n\nBut then we have L, which might be okay.\n\nHowever, we want to maximize new information. We have five unknown positions.\n\nBut we know the secret word has A in the middle, and contains R and E. And the unknown positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nAlso, the secret word does not contain: C and N (and any letters that might be excluded? Only C and N so far).\n\nSo let\'s go with a word that uses common letters: T, S, L, etc.\n\nI think ""BEARS"" or ""TEARS"" are good.\n\nBut let\'s check ""TEARS"": T, E, A, R, S.\n\nThis covers T, E, A, R, S. The S is new and common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TEARS"".\n\nBut wait: we have E at position 2. Before E was at position 5 and it was wrong, but position 2 isn\'t tested? And R at position 4: before R was at position 2 and it was wrong?\n\nSo yes.\n\nWe are testing E at position 2 now.\n\nAlso, we are testing T and S.\n\nSo it seems a good guess.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""TEARS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C is absent (x) → eliminate C.  \n- R is present but misplaced (-) → R is in the word, not at position 2.  \n- A is correct and in position (✓) → A must be at position 3.  \n- N is absent (x) → eliminate N.  \n- E is present but misplaced (-) → E is in the word, not at position 5.  \n\nKey constraints for the next guess:  \n- Must have \'A\' at position 3.  \n- Must include \'R\' and \'E\' (since both are present in the secret word).  \n- \'R\' cannot be at position 2 (from feedback).  \n- \'E\' cannot be at position 5 (from feedback).  \n- Must avoid C and N (absent letters).  \n\nStrategy: Guess a word that tests \'R\' and \'E\' in new positions while covering new common letters. ""TEARS"" fits well:  \n- Positions: T (1), E (2), A (3), R (4), S (5).  \n  - Puts \'A\' at 3 (required).  \n  - Puts \'E\' at 2 (untested position) and \'R\' at 4 (avoiding position 2).  \n  - Avoids C and N.  \n- Tests new letters: T and S, maximizing information.\n\n<guess>tears</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present, but wrong position) → so R is in the word, not at position 2\n- A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but wrong position) → so E is in the word, not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""tears""\n- T: x (absent)\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → so the second letter is E\n- A: ✓ (correct position) → third letter is A (already known)\n- R: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is R\n- S: x (absent)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n- Position 2: E is correct → secret word has E at position 2.\n- Position 3: A is correct → already known.\n- Position 4: R is correct → secret word has R at position 4.\n\nAlso, from Guess 1, we knew that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we know it\'s at position 4) and E was present but not at position 5 (now we know it\'s at position 2).\n\nWe also know:\n- C, N, T, S are absent (from both guesses: C and N from first, T and S from second).\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: R\n\nAnd we know the word contains E, A, R at these positions.\n\nNow, what about positions 1 and 5?\n\nWe know that the secret word has E at position 2, so the E in the first guess (which was at position 5) was misplaced, which is consistent because now we know E is at 2.\n\nAlso, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, N, T, S.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that has:\n- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S})\n- Position 2: E (fixed)\n- Position 3: A (fixed)\n- Position 4: R (fixed)\n- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S}, and also note that E was misplaced at position 5 in the first guess, but that doesn\'t mean position 5 can\'t be E? Actually, we know E is at position 2, so position 5 cannot be E because the word has only one E? Not necessarily, Wordle words can have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we don\'t have any indication of repeated letters so far. However, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. But if the word had two E\'s, one at position 2 and one at position 5, then the feedback for the first guess would have shown E as correct at position 5? But it didn\'t, it showed as misplaced. So that implies that the E at position 5 in the first guess is the same E that is at position 2? Therefore, the secret word has only one E. Similarly, for R: in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked as misplaced, but now we know it\'s at position 4. So if there were two R\'s, we might have seen a different feedback? But in the second guess, R at position 4 is correct, so if there were another R, we might have seen it? But we didn\'t, so probably only one R.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, without evidence of repetition, we can assume no repetition for now.\n\nSo, the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have no duplicates in the feedback.\n\nTherefore, for position 5, it cannot be E (because E is already at position 2 and we assume no repetition) and also cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 cannot be E (because position 2 is E), and cannot be A, R (because they are at 3 and 4) and cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSo we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 5 from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, N, R, T, S.\n\nBut note: we know the word has E, A, R, and two more letters.\n\nWe also know that the first guess had E and it was misplaced at position 5, but that doesn\'t add new constraint because we now know E is at 2.\n\nNow, what about the first guess: we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, but now we know R is at 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nWe need to find words that fit: _ E A R _\n\nWith the first and last positions being letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S}? But wait, A, E, R are in the word but already placed, so the other two letters must be different.\n\nSo the available letters are: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, T, S.\n\nBut we must consider that the word might have other letters that are common.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""PEARL"": but P is not excluded? We haven\'t seen P. But in ""PEARL"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, L at 5. But we have S excluded? L is not excluded. However, we have to check if P and L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the excluded list.\n\nBut wait, in the second guess we used ""tears"", which had S at the end and it was absent, so S is excluded. Similarly, T is excluded.\n\nBut P and L are not excluded.\n\nHowever, ""PEARL"" has L at position 5. Is that acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was misplaced, but that doesn\'t affect L.\n\nAnother word: ""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, T at 5. But T is excluded (from second guess: T was absent). So we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEARD"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.\n\n""BEARD"" is a word.\n\n""LEARN"": L at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N is excluded (from first guess: N absent). So no.\n\n""GEARS"": G at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5. But S is excluded.\n\n""WEARY"": W at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Y is not excluded.\n\nSo possible words: ""BEARD"", ""PEARL"", ""WEARY"", etc.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. We want to maximize information? Or just solve it?\n\nSince we have three letters fixed, we can try to guess the word.\n\nBut we have two positions: 1 and 5.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: what letters are likely?\n\nBut note: we have no information about position 1 and 5, so we need to test.\n\nHowever, we can choose a word that might be the answer.\n\nLet me list common words that fit the pattern:\n\n- BEARD\n- PEARL\n- WEAR? But that\'s 4 letters, we need 5.\n- HEARD: H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.\n- LEAR? 4 letters.\n- GEAR? 4 letters.\n- YEARN: Y at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N excluded.\n- DEARY: D at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Not common, but valid? Or ""DEAR"" is common, but with Y? ""DEARY"" might be archaic.\n\nMore common: ""HEART"" but T excluded.\n\n""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. But then position 4 is D, but we know position 4 must be R? So no, that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe have position 4 fixed as R.\n\nSo only words with E at 2, A at 3, R at 4.\n\nSo: _ E A R _\n\nPossible: \n- BEAR? 4 letters, so not.\n- BEARD: B, E, A, R, D\n- PEARL: P, E, A, R, L\n- HEARD: H, E, A, R, D\n- WEARY: W, E, A, R, Y\n- GEAR? 4 letters.\n\nAlso, ""FEARS"": but F at 1, and S at 5? S excluded.\n\n""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5? S excluded.\n\n""REARM"": R at 1, but R is already at position 4? So if we use R at position 1, that would be a repeated letter. But we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? In the feedback, we haven\'t seen any repetition. But it\'s possible.\n\nFor example, if the word is ""REARM"", then positions: R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5). But then the first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""REARM"", there is an R at position 1 and 4. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, it should be marked as present (because R is in the word) but not at position 2. Then in the second guess ""tears"", we have R at position 4 which is correct. But also, if we had R at position 1 in the secret word, then in the second guess we didn\'t have a letter at position 1 to test R? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut in the second guess, we had T at position 1, which was absent, so if the secret word had R at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. But we don\'t have evidence for or against repetition.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should consider words without repetition first, since we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback.\n\nSo let\'s assume no repetition for now.\n\nTherefore, the word must have distinct letters.\n\nSo for position 1, it cannot be E, A, R (because they are already used) and cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 cannot be E, A, R, and cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSo available letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- BEARD: B and D\n- PEARL: P and L\n- HEARD: H and D\n- WEARY: W and Y\n\nWe can choose one that uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we have no information about these letters, so we might as well guess a word that is common.\n\n""BEARD"" is a common word.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can get more information? Since we have three letters fixed, we might solve it in this guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are common and might appear in many words, but since we are down to two positions, it\'s better to guess a candidate.\n\nI think ""BEARD"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we have ""HEARD"" as well.\n\nAnother one: ""GEAR?"" no.\n\n""LEARN"" but N excluded.\n\n""PEARL"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: in the first guess, we had no information about the first and last letters.\n\nWe can also think about the feedback: in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (absent), position 5 was E (misplaced). Now we know E is at 2.\n\nSo for position 5, it must be a letter that is not E, and not the excluded ones.\n\nSimilarly for position 1.\n\nI think we should guess ""BEARD"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more common.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel in position 5? But not necessary.\n\nI think ""BEARD"" is fine.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""WEIRD""? But that has I at position 3? No, position 3 is A, so not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BEARD"".\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: B, E, A, R, D.\n\nB and D are not excluded.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""BEARD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position), N (absent), E (present but wrong position).  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - The secret word has \'A\' at position 3.  \n    - \'R\' and \'E\' are in the word, but not at positions 2 or 5, respectively.  \n    - \'C\' and \'N\' are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""tears""** → Feedback: T (absent), E (correct position), A (correct position), R (correct position), S (absent).  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - \'E\' is at position 2.  \n    - \'A\' is at position 3 (already known).  \n    - \'R\' is at position 4.  \n    - \'T\' and \'S\' are absent.  \n\n### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:\n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Position 2: E  \n  - Position 3: A  \n  - Position 4: R  \n- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Available positions**: Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S} (since A, E, R are already placed and we assume no repeated letters based on feedback).  \n- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _`.  \n- Common 5-letter words fitting this pattern include ""BEARD"", ""HEARD"", ""PEARL"", and ""WEARY"".  \n- ""BEARD"" is chosen because:  \n  - It uses common letters (B and D) that are not excluded.  \n  - It tests a plausible candidate word efficiently, as we have 3 letters confirmed and only positions 1 and 5 unknown.  \n- If ""BEARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., by confirming or ruling out B and D).\n\n<guess>beard</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beard -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>

Summary of known information:

  (positions: 2=E, 3=A, 4=R)

- Confirmed absent letters: C, N, T, S, B, D

- Therefore, the first and last positions must be filled with letters not in {C, N, T, S, B, D} and also not A, E, R (since these are already placed and we have no indication of duplicates; feedback consistency suggests no duplicates).

Available letters for position 1 and 5: any letter except A, C, N, T, S, E, R, B, D. That leaves: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, they must form a valid English word matching the pattern _ E A R _

Given the pattern, common candidates include:
- ""HEAR?"" → ""HEART"" is invalid since T is excluded. ""HEARD"" was guessed already (D absent). 
- ""PEARL"": P at 1, L at 5 → both new letters.
- ""LEARN"": L at 1, N at 5 → but N is absent, so invalid.
- ""WEAR?"" → ""WEARY"" (W at 1, Y at 5), ""WEARS"" (S absent → invalid).
- ""GEAR?"" → ""GEARS"" (S absent) or ""GEAR"" + letter? Not obvious.
- ""YEARN"": Y at 1, N at 5 → N absent → invalid.
- ""REARM"": repeats R? We avoid duplicates due to no evidence.

Reviewing common 5-letter words ending with R:

- ""PEARL"" → P, L valid (not excluded).
- ""WEARY"" → W, Y valid.
- ""FEA??"" → No word ""FEARL"", etc.
- ""HEAR?"" → Only ""HEARD"" or ""HEART"" (both invalid now).
- ""JEARS?"" → Not common.
- ""LEAR?"" → ""LEARN"" (invalid N).

Thus, the top candidates are ""PEARL"" and ""WEARY"".

We need to choose one to test. Since both use untried letters, either can provide information.

- ""PEARL"": Tests P at position 1 and L at position 5.
- ""WEARY"": Tests W at position 1 and Y at position 5.

Both are valid guesses. Since we have eliminated many consonants, either could be the answer.

I'll select ""WEARY"" because W and Y are less common than P and L? Or equivalently, but to be systematic, let's note that we have only 3 guesses left.

Alternatively, we could consider ""HEART"" but T is excluded → invalid.

Another word: ""MEARY"" isn't standard; ""MEAD"" not fitting. 

So between ""PEARL"" and ""WEARY"", let me choose ""WEARY"" as it introduces newer letters? But P is also new.

But both are fine. Random choice? Or based on frequency? 

""WEAR"" as a root word might be more common, but both are valid. 

I'll go with ""WEARY"".

But note: ""PEARL"" is also common and must be considered. However, since ""BEARD"" was wrong, and ""WEARY"" has a chance.

Actually, the secret word might be ""PEARL"". So we cannot ignore. 

But since we have to guess one, let's pick ""PEARL"" to test P and L.

Then next guess can cover others.

But if we guess correctly, we win.

Given we don't know, let's choose ""PEARL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Secret word pattern**: The word must be in the form `_ E A R _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed: position 2 = E, 3 = A, 4 = R).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, B, D (from feedback: all marked as absent in previous guesses). Therefore, positions 1 and 5 must use letters not in this list.
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 5**: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, E, R, and absent letters).
- **Possible word candidates**: Common 5-letter words fitting `_ E A R _` include ""PEARL"" (P at 1, L at 5), ""WEARY"" (W at 1, Y at 5), and ""HEARS"" (H at 1, S at 5—but S is absent, so invalid). ""PEARL"" is prioritized as it tests two new common letters (P and L), both unused and not excluded.

### Reasoning:
- The guess ""PEARL"":
  - Position 1: P (new letter, not excluded).
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not excluded).
  - If correct, it wins; if wrong, feedback will confirm/reject P and L, narrowing the possibilities significantly for the next guess (e.g., moving to ""WEARY"" if P/L are absent).

This guess maximizes efficiency with 4/6 tries used.

- **Possible word candidates**: Common 5-letter words fitting `_ E A R _` include ""PEARL"" (P at 1, L at 5), ""WEARY"" (W at 1, Y at 5), and ""HEARS"" (H at 1, S at 5—but S is absent, so invalid). ""PEARL"" is prioritized as it tests two new common letters (P and L), both unused and not excluded.

### Reasoning:
- The guess ""PEARL"":
  - Position 1: P (new letter, not excluded).
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not excluded).
  - If correct, it wins; if wrong, feedback will confirm/reject P and L, narrowing the possibilities significantly for the next guess (e.g., moving to ""WEARY"" if P/L are absent).

This guess maximizes efficiency with 4/6 tries used.",Guess 4: pearl -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) L(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,WEARY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: - -> R is in the word but in the wrong position
- A: ✓ -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since it's the second letter in the guess? But note: positions matter)
- N: x -> not in the secret word
- E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position

Let's break down the positions:
In ""crane"", the positions are:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

Feedback:
- A is correct and in the right position -> so in the secret word, the third letter is A? Because in the guess, A is at position 3.

But note: the example in the instructions had feedback for each position relative to the guess.

So, from the feedback:
- Position 3: A is correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word has 'A' as the third letter.
- R is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word but not at position 2).
- E is present but not at position 5.
- C and N are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A.
- The secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not C and N).

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes R and E, but not C and N.
- Avoids C and N entirely since they are not in the word.

Also, we must not use letters that are known to be absent: C and N.

Possible strategies:
- Try to place R and E in new positions to figure out their correct spots.
- We also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and E is not at position 5.

But note: the positions in the next guess must account for this.

Let me think of words that have:
- Third letter A
- Contain R and E
- Do not contain C or N.

Also, since we have only one correct letter so far (A at position 3), we want to test other letters.

We can also consider common letters to cover more.

Possible words:
- What about ""TARES""? 
  - T at position 1, A at 3 (required), R at 2? But in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R at position 2? Actually, it might be that R is at position 2 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 2. So we can try R at a different position.

Wait, the feedback for R was at position 2: it's in the word but not at that position. So we must try R at a position other than 2.

Similarly, E must not be at position 5.

So for the next guess:
- Third letter must be A.
- R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A, so R can be at 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 3 is A, so E can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Also note that E and R are both to be included.

Let me try to list words:

Another idea: use a word that includes E and R and has A at the third position.

Examples:
- ""PARSE"": P, A (third? Let's check: P-A-R-S-E? No: P (1), A (2) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not right.

We need A at position 3.

So the word pattern: _ _ A _ _

With R and E in the remaining positions (and avoiding C and N).

Also, we have two other letters to choose.

Possible words:
- ""BEARD"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> contains E and R. But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 4. This might be acceptable? Also, we haven't tested B and D.

But we might also try to use more common consonants.

Another word: ""TEARY"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but E is at position 2 and R at 4.

But we don't know if E or R can be at these positions.

Alternatively, ""FRAME"": F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). However, in this word:
- R is at position 2 -> but in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position? That doesn't mean R cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would also be marked as ""-"", unless the correct position is 2? But that's not possible because the feedback said it's not at position 2. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""FRAME"", R is at position 2 -> that's exactly the position we must avoid. So invalid.

Similarly, E is at position 5, but the feedback said E is not at position 5? Actually: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in the guess.

So ""FR"" won't work because of R at 2 and E at 5? Actually, both problems.

So we need a word that:
- Has A at position 3.
- Includes R and E.
- R is not at position 2? Actually, we can test R at other positions. But note: we don't know if R might be at position 1, 4, or 5? And E must be at position 1, 2, or 4? (avoiding position 5 and also position 3 which is taken by A).

Let me think of words:

- ""MEATY"": M, E, A, T, Y -> but E is at position 2 and we're including E, but we don't have R? We need R.

- ""RATED"": R at 1, A at 3? Wait: R(1), A(2), T(3)? No, A must be at 3. So we need a word like: 
- _ _ A _ _

With R and E somewhere else.

Possible words:
- ""READY"": R(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but E is at 2 and R at 1? Also E at 5? No, E is at 2. And R at 1. Is that okay?
  - But we need to avoid E at 5? Actually, in this word we don't have E at position 5, so that's fine.
  - Also R is at 1, which wasn't tried before? So it's okay.

But does it avoid C and N? Yes.

However, this word has 'Y' which is less common? Maybe better to use a more common word.

Another word: ""BEARS"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). 
- E at 2? Valid because we don't know if it's E's position? Actually, the feedback for E was from position 5 in the first word, but here it's at 2. So it might be correct or incorrect, we don't know yet.

But note: we must not reuse letters that are known to be absent: C and N are absent, and we are avoiding them.

But ""BEARS"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A -> correct
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This seems good because:
- It has A at position 3.
- It includes R (at position 4) and E (at position 2).
- We avoid C and N.
- Also, R is not at position 2 (it's at 4) -> okay.

Wait, we also have E at position 2: but the feedback from the first word doesn't say anything about position 2? We only know that E is present and not at position 5.

Similarly, we know R is present and not at position 2 (from the first guess). So by putting R at 4 and E at 2, we are testing new positions.

Alternatively, we can try ""EARTH"": E(1), A(2) -> wait, but we need A at position 3, so that doesn't work.

Another word: ""TEARS"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5) -> similar to ""BEARS"".

Maybe ""PEARL"": P(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), L(5).

But then we have L, which might be okay.

However, we want to maximize new information. We have five unknown positions.

But we know the secret word has A in the middle, and contains R and E. And the unknown positions: 1,2,4,5.

Also, the secret word does not contain: C and N (and any letters that might be excluded? Only C and N so far).

So let's go with a word that uses common letters: T, S, L, etc.

I think ""BEARS"" or ""TEARS"" are good.

But let's check ""TEARS"": T, E, A, R, S.

This covers T, E, A, R, S. The S is new and common.

So I'll go with ""TEARS"".

But wait: we have E at position 2. Before E was at position 5 and it was wrong, but position 2 isn't tested? And R at position 4: before R was at position 2 and it was wrong?

So yes.

We are testing E at position 2 now.

Also, we are testing T and S.

So it seems a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEARS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is absent (x) → eliminate C.  
- R is present but misplaced (-) → R is in the word, not at position 2.  
- A is correct and in position (✓) → A must be at position 3.  
- N is absent (x) → eliminate N.  
- E is present but misplaced (-) → E is in the word, not at position 5.  

Key constraints for the next guess:  
- Must have 'A' at position 3.  
- Must include 'R' and 'E' (since both are present in the secret word).  
- 'R' cannot be at position 2 (from feedback).  
- 'E' cannot be at position 5 (from feedback).  
- Must avoid C and N (absent letters).  

Strategy: Guess a word that tests 'R' and 'E' in new positions while covering new common letters. ""TEARS"" fits well:  
- Positions: T (1), E (2), A (3), R (4), S (5).  
  - Puts 'A' at 3 (required).  
  - Puts 'E' at 2 (untested position) and 'R' at 4 (avoiding position 2).  
  - Avoids C and N.  
- Tests new letters: T and S, maximizing information.

<guess>tears</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but wrong position) → so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but wrong position) → so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""tears""
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → so the second letter is E
- A: ✓ (correct position) → third letter is A (already known)
- R: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is R
- S: x (absent)

Now, combining the information:

From Guess 2:
- Position 2: E is correct → secret word has E at position 2.
- Position 3: A is correct → already known.
- Position 4: R is correct → secret word has R at position 4.

Also, from Guess 1, we knew that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4) and E was present but not at position 5 (now we know it's at position 2).

We also know:
- C, N, T, S are absent (from both guesses: C and N from first, T and S from second).

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R

And we know the word contains E, A, R at these positions.

Now, what about positions 1 and 5?

We know that the secret word has E at position 2, so the E in the first guess (which was at position 5) was misplaced, which is consistent because now we know E is at 2.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S})
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S}, and also note that E was misplaced at position 5 in the first guess, but that doesn't mean position 5 can't be E? Actually, we know E is at position 2, so position 5 cannot be E because the word has only one E? Not necessarily, Wordle words can have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far. However, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. But if the word had two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 5, then the feedback for the first guess would have shown E as correct at position 5? But it didn't, it showed as misplaced. So that implies that the E at position 5 in the first guess is the same E that is at position 2? Therefore, the secret word has only one E. Similarly, for R: in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked as misplaced, but now we know it's at position 4. So if there were two R's, we might have seen a different feedback? But in the second guess, R at position 4 is correct, so if there were another R, we might have seen it? But we didn't, so probably only one R.

But to be safe, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, without evidence of repetition, we can assume no repetition for now.

So, the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have no duplicates in the feedback.

Therefore, for position 5, it cannot be E (because E is already at position 2 and we assume no repetition) and also cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be E (because position 2 is E), and cannot be A, R (because they are at 3 and 4) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 5 from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But note: we know the word has E, A, R, and two more letters.

We also know that the first guess had E and it was misplaced at position 5, but that doesn't add new constraint because we now know E is at 2.

Now, what about the first guess: we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, but now we know R is at 4, so that's consistent.

We need to find words that fit: _ E A R _

With the first and last positions being letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S}? But wait, A, E, R are in the word but already placed, so the other two letters must be different.

So the available letters are: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, T, S.

But we must consider that the word might have other letters that are common.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""PEARL"": but P is not excluded? We haven't seen P. But in ""PEARL"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, L at 5. But we have S excluded? L is not excluded. However, we have to check if P and L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the excluded list.

But wait, in the second guess we used ""tears"", which had S at the end and it was absent, so S is excluded. Similarly, T is excluded.

But P and L are not excluded.

However, ""PEARL"" has L at position 5. Is that acceptable? Yes.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was misplaced, but that doesn't affect L.

Another word: ""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, T at 5. But T is excluded (from second guess: T was absent). So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""BEARD"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.

""BEARD"" is a word.

""LEARN"": L at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N is excluded (from first guess: N absent). So no.

""GEARS"": G at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5. But S is excluded.

""WEARY"": W at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Y is not excluded.

So possible words: ""BEARD"", ""PEARL"", ""WEARY"", etc.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. We want to maximize information? Or just solve it?

Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to guess the word.

But we have two positions: 1 and 5.

We can choose a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can think: what letters are likely?

But note: we have no information about position 1 and 5, so we need to test.

However, we can choose a word that might be the answer.

Let me list common words that fit the pattern:

- BEARD
- PEARL
- WEAR? But that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- HEARD: H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.
- LEAR? 4 letters.
- GEAR? 4 letters.
- YEARN: Y at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N excluded.
- DEARY: D at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Not common, but valid? Or ""DEAR"" is common, but with Y? ""DEARY"" might be archaic.

More common: ""HEART"" but T excluded.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. But then position 4 is D, but we know position 4 must be R? So no, that doesn't work.

We have position 4 fixed as R.

So only words with E at 2, A at 3, R at 4.

So: _ E A R _

Possible: 
- BEAR? 4 letters, so not.
- BEARD: B, E, A, R, D
- PEARL: P, E, A, R, L
- HEARD: H, E, A, R, D
- WEARY: W, E, A, R, Y
- GEAR? 4 letters.

Also, ""FEARS"": but F at 1, and S at 5? S excluded.

""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5? S excluded.

""REARM"": R at 1, but R is already at position 4? So if we use R at position 1, that would be a repeated letter. But we don't know if repetition is allowed? In the feedback, we haven't seen any repetition. But it's possible.

For example, if the word is ""REARM"", then positions: R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5). But then the first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""REARM"", there is an R at position 1 and 4. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, it should be marked as present (because R is in the word) but not at position 2. Then in the second guess ""tears"", we have R at position 4 which is correct. But also, if we had R at position 1 in the secret word, then in the second guess we didn't have a letter at position 1 to test R? So we don't know.

But in the second guess, we had T at position 1, which was absent, so if the secret word had R at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. But we don't have evidence for or against repetition.

However, to be safe, we should consider words without repetition first, since we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

So let's assume no repetition for now.

Therefore, the word must have distinct letters.

So for position 1, it cannot be E, A, R (because they are already used) and cannot be C, N, T, S.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E, A, R, and cannot be C, N, T, S.

So available letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- BEARD: B and D
- PEARL: P and L
- HEARD: H and D
- WEARY: W and Y

We can choose one that uses common letters.

But note: we have no information about these letters, so we might as well guess a word that is common.

""BEARD"" is a common word.

But let's see if we can get more information? Since we have three letters fixed, we might solve it in this guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are common and might appear in many words, but since we are down to two positions, it's better to guess a candidate.

I think ""BEARD"" is a good candidate.

But we have ""HEARD"" as well.

Another one: ""GEAR?"" no.

""LEARN"" but N excluded.

""PEARL"" is also common.

But let's consider: in the first guess, we had no information about the first and last letters.

We can also think about the feedback: in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (absent), position 5 was E (misplaced). Now we know E is at 2.

So for position 5, it must be a letter that is not E, and not the excluded ones.

Similarly for position 1.

I think we should guess ""BEARD"".

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel in position 5? But not necessary.

I think ""BEARD"" is fine.

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another common word: ""WEIRD""? But that has I at position 3? No, position 3 is A, so not.

So I'll go with ""BEARD"".

But let's check the letters: B, E, A, R, D.

B and D are not excluded.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BEARD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position), N (absent), E (present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - The secret word has 'A' at position 3.  
    - 'R' and 'E' are in the word, but not at positions 2 or 5, respectively.  
    - 'C' and 'N' are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""tears""** → Feedback: T (absent), E (correct position), A (correct position), R (correct position), S (absent).  
  - This reveals:  
    - 'E' is at position 2.  
    - 'A' is at position 3 (already known).  
    - 'R' is at position 4.  
    - 'T' and 'S' are absent.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: E  
  - Position 3: A  
  - Position 4: R  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Available positions**: Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S} (since A, E, R are already placed and we assume no repeated letters based on feedback).  
- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _`.  
- Common 5-letter words fitting this pattern include ""BEARD"", ""HEARD"", ""PEARL"", and ""WEARY"".  
- ""BEARD"" is chosen because:  
  - It uses common letters (B and D) that are not excluded.  
  - It tests a plausible candidate word efficiently, as we have 3 letters confirmed and only positions 1 and 5 unknown.  
- If ""BEARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., by confirming or ruling out B and D).

Available letters for position 1 and 5: any letter except A, C, N, T, S, E, R, B, D. That leaves: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, they must form a valid English word matching the pattern _ E A R _

Given the pattern, common candidates include:
- ""HEAR?"" → ""HEART"" is invalid since T is excluded. ""HEARD"" was guessed already (D absent). 
- ""PEARL"": P at 1, L at 5 → both new letters.
- ""LEARN"": L at 1, N at 5 → but N is absent, so invalid.
- ""WEAR?"" → ""WEARY"" (W at 1, Y at 5), ""WEARS"" (S absent → invalid).
- ""GEAR?"" → ""GEARS"" (S absent) or ""GEAR"" + letter? Not obvious.
- ""YEARN"": Y at 1, N at 5 → N absent → invalid.
- ""REARM"": repeats R? We avoid duplicates due to no evidence.

Reviewing common 5-letter words ending with R:

- ""PEARL"" → P, L valid (not excluded).
- ""WEARY"" → W, Y valid.
- ""FEA??"" → No word ""FEARL"", etc.
- ""HEAR?"" → Only ""HEARD"" or ""HEART"" (both invalid now).
- ""JEARS?"" → Not common.
- ""LEAR?"" → ""LEARN"" (invalid N).

Thus, the top candidates are ""PEARL"" and ""WEARY"".

We need to choose one to test. Since both use untried letters, either can provide information.

- ""PEARL"": Tests P at position 1 and L at position 5.
- ""WEARY"": Tests W at position 1 and Y at position 5.

Both are valid guesses. Since we have eliminated many consonants, either could be the answer.

I'll select ""WEARY"" because W and Y are less common than P and L? Or equivalently, but to be systematic, let's note that we have only 3 guesses left.

Alternatively, we could consider ""HEART"" but T is excluded → invalid.

Another word: ""MEARY"" isn't standard; ""MEAD"" not fitting. 

So between ""PEARL"" and ""WEARY"", let me choose ""WEARY"" as it introduces newer letters? But P is also new.

But both are fine. Random choice? Or based on frequency? 

""WEAR"" as a root word might be more common, but both are valid. 

I'll go with ""WEARY"".

But note: ""PEARL"" is also common and must be considered. However, since ""BEARD"" was wrong, and ""WEARY"" has a chance.

Actually, the secret word might be ""PEARL"". So we cannot ignore. 

But since we have to guess one, let's pick ""PEARL"" to test P and L.

Then next guess can cover others.

But if we guess correctly, we win.

Given we don't know, let's choose ""PEARL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Secret word pattern**: The word must be in the form `_ E A R _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed: position 2 = E, 3 = A, 4 = R).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, B, D (from feedback: all marked as absent in previous guesses). Therefore, positions 1 and 5 must use letters not in this list.
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 5**: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, E, R, and absent letters).
- **Possible word candidates**: Common 5-letter words fitting `_ E A R _` include ""PEARL"" (P at 1, L at 5), ""WEARY"" (W at 1, Y at 5), and ""HEARS"" (H at 1, S at 5—but S is absent, so invalid). ""PEARL"" is prioritized as it tests two new common letters (P and L), both unused and not excluded.

### Reasoning:
- The guess ""PEARL"":
  - Position 1: P (new letter, not excluded).
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not excluded).
  - If correct, it wins; if wrong, feedback will confirm/reject P and L, narrowing the possibilities significantly for the next guess (e.g., moving to ""WEARY"" if P/L are absent).

This guess maximizes efficiency with 4/6 tries used.

Because in the guess, A is at position 3.\n\nBut note: the example in the instructions had feedback for each position relative to the guess.\n\nSo, from the feedback:\n- Position 3: A is correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word has \'A\' as the third letter.\n- R is present but in the wrong position (so it\'s in the word but not at position 2).\n- E is present but not at position 5.\n- C and N are absent.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The third letter of the secret word is A.\n- The secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not C and N).\n\nWe need to guess a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has \'A\' in the third position.\n- Includes R and E, but not C and N.\n- Avoids C and N entirely since they are not in the word.\n\nAlso, we must not use letters that are known to be absent: C and N.\n\nPossible strategies:\n- Try to place R and E in new positions to figure out their correct spots.\n- We also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and E is not at position 5.\n\nBut note: the positions in the next guess must account for this.\n\nLet me think of words that have:\n- Third letter A\n- Contain R and E\n- Do not contain C or N.\n\nAlso, since we have only one correct letter so far (A at position 3), we want to test other letters.\n\nWe can also consider common letters to cover more.\n\nPossible words:\n- What about ""TARES""? \n  - T at position 1, A at 3 (required), R at 2? But in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R at position 2? Actually, it might be that R is at position 2 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not at position 2. So we can try R at a different position.\n\nWait, the feedback for R was at position 2: it\'s in the word but not at that position. So we must try R at a position other than 2.\n\nSimilarly, E must not be at position 5.\n\nSo for the next guess:\n- Third letter must be A.\n- R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A, so R can be at 1, 4, or 5.\n- E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 3 is A, so E can be at 1, 2, or 4.\n\nAlso note that E and R are both to be included.\n\nLet me try to list words:\n\nAnother idea: use a word that includes E and R and has A at the third position.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PARSE"": P, A (third? Let\'s check: P-A-R-S-E? No: P (1), A (2) -> but we need A at position 3. So that\'s not right.\n\nWe need A at position 3.\n\nSo the word pattern: _ _ A _ _\n\nWith R and E in the remaining positions (and avoiding C and N).\n\nAlso, we have two other letters to choose.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BEARD"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> contains E and R. But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 4. This might be acceptable? Also, we haven\'t tested B and D.\n\nBut we might also try to use more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""TEARY"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but E is at position 2 and R at 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E or R can be at these positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""FRAME"": F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). However, in this word:\n- R is at position 2 -> but in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position? That doesn\'t mean R cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would also be marked as ""-"", unless the correct position is 2? But that\'s not possible because the feedback said it\'s not at position 2. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, in ""FRAME"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s exactly the position we must avoid. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, E is at position 5, but the feedback said E is not at position 5? Actually: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid E at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in the guess.\n\nSo ""FR"" won\'t work because of R at 2 and E at 5? Actually, both problems.\n\nSo we need a word that:\n- Has A at position 3.\n- Includes R and E.\n- R is not at position 2? Actually, we can test R at other positions. But note: we don\'t know if R might be at position 1, 4, or 5? And E must be at position 1, 2, or 4? (avoiding position 5 and also position 3 which is taken by A).\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- ""MEATY"": M, E, A, T, Y -> but E is at position 2 and we\'re including E, but we don\'t have R? We need R.\n\n- ""RATED"": R at 1, A at 3? Wait: R(1), A(2), T(3)? No, A must be at 3. So we need a word like: \n- _ _ A _ _\n\nWith R and E somewhere else.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""READY"": R(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but E is at 2 and R at 1? Also E at 5? No, E is at 2. And R at 1. Is that okay?\n  - But we need to avoid E at 5? Actually, in this word we don\'t have E at position 5, so that\'s fine.\n  - Also R is at 1, which wasn\'t tried before? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut does it avoid C and N? Yes.\n\nHowever, this word has \'Y\' which is less common? Maybe better to use a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""BEARS"": B(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). \n- E at 2? Valid because we don\'t know if it\'s E\'s position? Actually, the feedback for E was from position 5 in the first word, but here it\'s at 2. So it might be correct or incorrect, we don\'t know yet.\n\nBut note: we must not reuse letters that are known to be absent: C and N are absent, and we are avoiding them.\n\nBut ""BEARS"": \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: A -> correct\n- Position 4: R\n- Position 5: S\n\nThis seems good because:\n- It has A at position 3.\n- It includes R (at position 4) and E (at position 2).\n- We avoid C and N.\n- Also, R is not at position 2 (it\'s at 4) -> okay.\n\nWait, we also have E at position 2: but the feedback from the first word doesn\'t say anything about position 2? We only know that E is present and not at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we know R is present and not at position 2 (from the first guess). So by putting R at 4 and E at 2, we are testing new positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""EARTH"": E(1), A(2) -> wait, but we need A at position 3, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother word: ""TEARS"": T(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), S(5) -> similar to ""BEARS"".\n\nMaybe ""PEARL"": P(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), L(5).\n\nBut then we have L, which might be okay.\n\nHowever, we want to maximize new information. We have five unknown positions.\n\nBut we know the secret word has A in the middle, and contains R and E. And the unknown positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nAlso, the secret word does not contain: C and N (and any letters that might be excluded? Only C and N so far).\n\nSo let\'s go with a word that uses common letters: T, S, L, etc.\n\nI think ""BEARS"" or ""TEARS"" are good.\n\nBut let\'s check ""TEARS"": T, E, A, R, S.\n\nThis covers T, E, A, R, S. The S is new and common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TEARS"".\n\nBut wait: we have E at position 2. Before E was at position 5 and it was wrong, but position 2 isn\'t tested? And R at position 4: before R was at position 2 and it was wrong?\n\nSo yes.\n\nWe are testing E at position 2 now.\n\nAlso, we are testing T and S.\n\nSo it seems a good guess.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""TEARS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C is absent (x) → eliminate C.  \n- R is present but misplaced (-) → R is in the word, not at position 2.  \n- A is correct and in position (✓) → A must be at position 3.  \n- N is absent (x) → eliminate N.  \n- E is present but misplaced (-) → E is in the word, not at position 5.  \n\nKey constraints for the next guess:  \n- Must have \'A\' at position 3.  \n- Must include \'R\' and \'E\' (since both are present in the secret word).  \n- \'R\' cannot be at position 2 (from feedback).  \n- \'E\' cannot be at position 5 (from feedback).  \n- Must avoid C and N (absent letters).  \n\nStrategy: Guess a word that tests \'R\' and \'E\' in new positions while covering new common letters. ""TEARS"" fits well:  \n- Positions: T (1), E (2), A (3), R (4), S (5).  \n  - Puts \'A\' at 3 (required).  \n  - Puts \'E\' at 2 (untested position) and \'R\' at 4 (avoiding position 2).  \n  - Avoids C and N.  \n- Tests new letters: T and S, maximizing information.\n\n<guess>tears</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present, but wrong position) → so R is in the word, not at position 2\n- A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but wrong position) → so E is in the word, not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""tears""\n- T: x (absent)\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → so the second letter is E\n- A: ✓ (correct position) → third letter is A (already known)\n- R: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is R\n- S: x (absent)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n- Position 2: E is correct → secret word has E at position 2.\n- Position 3: A is correct → already known.\n- Position 4: R is correct → secret word has R at position 4.\n\nAlso, from Guess 1, we knew that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we know it\'s at position 4) and E was present but not at position 5 (now we know it\'s at position 2).\n\nWe also know:\n- C, N, T, S are absent (from both guesses: C and N from first, T and S from second).\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: R\n\nAnd we know the word contains E, A, R at these positions.\n\nNow, what about positions 1 and 5?\n\nWe know that the secret word has E at position 2, so the E in the first guess (which was at position 5) was misplaced, which is consistent because now we know E is at 2.\n\nAlso, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, N, T, S.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that has:\n- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S})\n- Position 2: E (fixed)\n- Position 3: A (fixed)\n- Position 4: R (fixed)\n- Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S}, and also note that E was misplaced at position 5 in the first guess, but that doesn\'t mean position 5 can\'t be E? Actually, we know E is at position 2, so position 5 cannot be E because the word has only one E? Not necessarily, Wordle words can have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we don\'t have any indication of repeated letters so far. However, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. But if the word had two E\'s, one at position 2 and one at position 5, then the feedback for the first guess would have shown E as correct at position 5? But it didn\'t, it showed as misplaced. So that implies that the E at position 5 in the first guess is the same E that is at position 2? Therefore, the secret word has only one E. Similarly, for R: in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked as misplaced, but now we know it\'s at position 4. So if there were two R\'s, we might have seen a different feedback? But in the second guess, R at position 4 is correct, so if there were another R, we might have seen it? But we didn\'t, so probably only one R.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, without evidence of repetition, we can assume no repetition for now.\n\nSo, the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have no duplicates in the feedback.\n\nTherefore, for position 5, it cannot be E (because E is already at position 2 and we assume no repetition) and also cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 cannot be E (because position 2 is E), and cannot be A, R (because they are at 3 and 4) and cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSo we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 5 from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, N, R, T, S.\n\nBut note: we know the word has E, A, R, and two more letters.\n\nWe also know that the first guess had E and it was misplaced at position 5, but that doesn\'t add new constraint because we now know E is at 2.\n\nNow, what about the first guess: we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, but now we know R is at 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nWe need to find words that fit: _ E A R _\n\nWith the first and last positions being letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S}? But wait, A, E, R are in the word but already placed, so the other two letters must be different.\n\nSo the available letters are: all letters except A, C, E, N, R, T, S.\n\nBut we must consider that the word might have other letters that are common.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""PEARL"": but P is not excluded? We haven\'t seen P. But in ""PEARL"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, L at 5. But we have S excluded? L is not excluded. However, we have to check if P and L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the excluded list.\n\nBut wait, in the second guess we used ""tears"", which had S at the end and it was absent, so S is excluded. Similarly, T is excluded.\n\nBut P and L are not excluded.\n\nHowever, ""PEARL"" has L at position 5. Is that acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was misplaced, but that doesn\'t affect L.\n\nAnother word: ""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, T at 5. But T is excluded (from second guess: T was absent). So we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEARD"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.\n\n""BEARD"" is a word.\n\n""LEARN"": L at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N is excluded (from first guess: N absent). So no.\n\n""GEARS"": G at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5. But S is excluded.\n\n""WEARY"": W at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Y is not excluded.\n\nSo possible words: ""BEARD"", ""PEARL"", ""WEARY"", etc.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. We want to maximize information? Or just solve it?\n\nSince we have three letters fixed, we can try to guess the word.\n\nBut we have two positions: 1 and 5.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: what letters are likely?\n\nBut note: we have no information about position 1 and 5, so we need to test.\n\nHowever, we can choose a word that might be the answer.\n\nLet me list common words that fit the pattern:\n\n- BEARD\n- PEARL\n- WEAR? But that\'s 4 letters, we need 5.\n- HEARD: H at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, D at 5. D is not excluded.\n- LEAR? 4 letters.\n- GEAR? 4 letters.\n- YEARN: Y at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, N at 5. But N excluded.\n- DEARY: D at 1, E at 2, A at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Not common, but valid? Or ""DEAR"" is common, but with Y? ""DEARY"" might be archaic.\n\nMore common: ""HEART"" but T excluded.\n\n""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. But then position 4 is D, but we know position 4 must be R? So no, that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe have position 4 fixed as R.\n\nSo only words with E at 2, A at 3, R at 4.\n\nSo: _ E A R _\n\nPossible: \n- BEAR? 4 letters, so not.\n- BEARD: B, E, A, R, D\n- PEARL: P, E, A, R, L\n- HEARD: H, E, A, R, D\n- WEARY: W, E, A, R, Y\n- GEAR? 4 letters.\n\nAlso, ""FEARS"": but F at 1, and S at 5? S excluded.\n\n""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5? S excluded.\n\n""REARM"": R at 1, but R is already at position 4? So if we use R at position 1, that would be a repeated letter. But we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? In the feedback, we haven\'t seen any repetition. But it\'s possible.\n\nFor example, if the word is ""REARM"", then positions: R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5). But then the first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""REARM"", there is an R at position 1 and 4. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, it should be marked as present (because R is in the word) but not at position 2. Then in the second guess ""tears"", we have R at position 4 which is correct. But also, if we had R at position 1 in the secret word, then in the second guess we didn\'t have a letter at position 1 to test R? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut in the second guess, we had T at position 1, which was absent, so if the secret word had R at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. But we don\'t have evidence for or against repetition.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should consider words without repetition first, since we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback.\n\nSo let\'s assume no repetition for now.\n\nTherefore, the word must have distinct letters.\n\nSo for position 1, it cannot be E, A, R (because they are already used) and cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 cannot be E, A, R, and cannot be C, N, T, S.\n\nSo available letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- BEARD: B and D\n- PEARL: P and L\n- HEARD: H and D\n- WEARY: W and Y\n\nWe can choose one that uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we have no information about these letters, so we might as well guess a word that is common.\n\n""BEARD"" is a common word.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can get more information? Since we have three letters fixed, we might solve it in this guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are common and might appear in many words, but since we are down to two positions, it\'s better to guess a candidate.\n\nI think ""BEARD"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we have ""HEARD"" as well.\n\nAnother one: ""GEAR?"" no.\n\n""LEARN"" but N excluded.\n\n""PEARL"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: in the first guess, we had no information about the first and last letters.\n\nWe can also think about the feedback: in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (absent), position 5 was E (misplaced). Now we know E is at 2.\n\nSo for position 5, it must be a letter that is not E, and not the excluded ones.\n\nSimilarly for position 1.\n\nI think we should guess ""BEARD"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more common.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel in position 5? But not necessary.\n\nI think ""BEARD"" is fine.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""WEIRD""? But that has I at position 3? No, position 3 is A, so not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BEARD"".\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: B, E, A, R, D.\n\nB and D are not excluded.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""BEARD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (correct position), N (absent), E (present but wrong position).  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - The secret word has \'A\' at position 3.  \n    - \'R\' and \'E\' are in the word, but not at positions 2 or 5, respectively.  \n    - \'C\' and \'N\' are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""tears""** → Feedback: T (absent), E (correct position), A (correct position), R (correct position), S (absent).  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - \'E\' is at position 2.  \n    - \'A\' is at position 3 (already known).  \n    - \'R\' is at position 4.  \n    - \'T\' and \'S\' are absent.  \n\n### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:\n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Position 2: E  \n  - Position 3: A  \n  - Position 4: R  \n- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Available positions**: Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {A, C, E, N, R, T, S} (since A, E, R are already placed and we assume no repeated letters based on feedback).  \n- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _`.  \n- Common 5-letter words fitting this pattern include ""BEARD"", ""HEARD"", ""PEARL"", and ""WEARY"".  \n- ""BEARD"" is chosen because:  \n  - It uses common letters (B and D) that are not excluded.  \n  - It tests a plausible candidate word efficiently, as we have 3 letters confirmed and only positions 1 and 5 unknown.  \n- If ""BEARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., by confirming or ruling out B and D).\n\n<guess>beard</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beard -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present but not at position 2 (-)\n- A: correct at position 3 (✓)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but not at position 5 (-)\n\nGuess 2: ""tears""\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: correct at position 2 (✓)  → Secret word position 2 is E\n- A: correct at position 3 (✓)  → Secret word position 3 is A\n- R: correct at position 4 (✓)  → Secret word position 4 is R\n- S: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: ""beard""\n- B: absent (x)\n- E: correct at position 2 (✓)  → Already knew\n- A: correct at position 3 (✓)  → Already knew\n- R: correct at position 4 (✓)  → Already knew\n- D: absent (x)\n\nSummary of known information:\n- Secret word must be in the form: _ E A R _ \n  (positions: 2=E, 3=A, 4=R)\n\n- Confirmed absent letters: C, N, T, S, B, D\n\n- Therefore, the first and last positions must be filled with letters not in {C, N, T, S, B, D} and also not A, E, R (since these are already placed and we have no indication of duplicates; feedback consistency suggests no duplicates).\n\nAvailable letters for position 1 and 5: any letter except A, C, N, T, S, E, R, B, D.

Or based on frequency? \n\n""WEAR"" as a root word might be more common, but both are valid. \n\nI\'ll go with ""WEARY"".\n\nBut note: ""PEARL"" is also common and must be considered. However, since ""BEARD"" was wrong, and ""WEARY"" has a chance.\n\nActually, the secret word might be ""PEARL"". So we cannot ignore. \n\nBut since we have to guess one, let\'s pick ""PEARL"" to test P and L.\n\nThen next guess can cover others.\n\nBut if we guess correctly, we win.\n\nGiven we don\'t know, let\'s choose ""PEARL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- **Secret word pattern**: The word must be in the form `_ E A R _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed: position 2 = E, 3 = A, 4 = R).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, B, D (from feedback: all marked as absent in previous guesses). Therefore, positions 1 and 5 must use letters not in this list.\n- **Available letters for positions 1 and 5**: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, E, R, and absent letters).\n- **Possible word candidates**: Common 5-letter words fitting `_ E A R _` include ""PEARL"" (P at 1, L at 5), ""WEARY"" (W at 1, Y at 5), and ""HEARS"" (H at 1, S at 5—but S is absent, so invalid). ""PEARL"" is prioritized as it tests two new common letters (P and L), both unused and not excluded.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The guess ""PEARL"":\n  - Position 1: P (new letter, not excluded).\n  - Position 5: L (new letter, not excluded).\n  - If correct, it wins; if wrong, feedback will confirm/reject P and L, narrowing the possibilities significantly for the next guess (e.g., moving to ""WEARY"" if P/L are absent).\n\nThis guess maximizes efficiency with 4/6 tries used.\n\n<guess>pearl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tears -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beard -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: pearl -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from all guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not at position 2
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""tears""
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → position 2 is E
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A (confirmed)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 4 is R
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""beard""
- B: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → position 2 is E (confirmed)
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A (confirmed)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 4 is R (confirmed)
- D: absent (x)

Guess 4: ""pearl""
- P: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → position 2 is E (confirmed)
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A (confirmed)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 4 is R (confirmed)
- L: absent (x)

Now, we know the secret word has:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- The first and fifth positions are unknown, but we know the letters that are absent.

Absent letters: C, N, T, S, B, D, P, L (from the feedback above).

Also, from the first guess, we know that E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with E being at position 2.

The secret word pattern is: _ E A R _

We need to fill the first and last positions with letters that are not absent and not A, E, R (since they are already placed and we have no evidence of duplicates).

So, absent letters: C, N, T, S, B, D, P, L.

Therefore, the available letters for position 1 and 5 are: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form _ E A R _

Common words that fit this pattern and use the available letters:

- ""WEARY"": W at 1, Y at 5 → W and Y are available.
- ""HEARD"": H at 1, D at 5 → but D is absent (from guess 3), so invalid.
- ""HEART"": H at 1, T at 5 → T is absent (from guess 2), invalid.
- ""GEAR?"" → ""GEARS"" has S (absent) and ""GEAR"" is 4 letters. ""GEAR"" with a different ending? ""GEAR"" is not 5 letters.
- ""YEARN"": Y at 1, N at 5 → N is absent, invalid.
- ""FEARS"": F at 1, S at 5 → S is absent, invalid.
- ""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5 → S absent, invalid.
- ""MEALS"": M at 1, S at 5 → S absent, invalid.
- ""WEALS"": W at 1, S at 5 → S absent, invalid.
- ""REALM"": R at 1, M at 5 → but R is already at position 4? And we are avoiding duplicates. Also, R at position 1 would be a repeat? But we don't know for sure. However, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. If the word had R at position 1 and 4, then the R at position 2 in the first guess would still be marked as present (since there is an R) but not at position 2. But in the second guess, we have R at position 4 and it was correct. We haven't tested position 1 for R. But we have T at position 1 in guess 2 which was absent, so if R were at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. However, we have no evidence of a duplicate R. But it's possible.

But let's first try without duplicates.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""WEARY"": W at 1, Y at 5 → both available.
- ""WEALD"": W at 1, D at 5 → D is absent, invalid.
- ""HEAR?"" → no common 5-letter words with H at 1 and available at 5? ""HEARS"" has S, invalid. ""HEART"" has T, invalid. ""HEARD"" has D, invalid.
- ""JEARS"": not a word.
- ""LEARN"": L at 1, N at 5 → both absent? L is absent from guess 4, and N from guess 1, so invalid.
- ""MEANY"": not common? ""MEAN"" is 4 letters. ""MEANY"" is not standard.
- ""PEARL"" we already tried, P and L absent.
- ""REARM"": R at 1, M at 5 → but R at 1 would be a duplicate? And we haven't tested R at 1. But R is already in the word at position 4. So if we allow duplicates, then ""REARM"" is a word. But let's see if it fits the feedback.

If the secret word is ""REARM"":
- First guess ""crane"": 
  - C: absent → correct.
  - R at position 2: in ""REARM"", there is R at position 1 and 4. So R is present, but not at position 2 → so the feedback for R should be present but wrong position (-) → matches.
  - A at position 3: in ""REARM"", position 3 is A? R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5) → yes, so A is correct (✓) → matches.
  - N: absent → correct.
  - E at position 5: in ""crane"", E is at position 5. In ""REARM"", E is at position 2, so E is present but not at position 5 → so feedback should be (-) → matches.

Second guess ""tears"":
- T at 1: absent → in ""REARM"", no T → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- S at 5: absent → correct.

Third guess ""beard"":
- B at 1: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- D at 5: absent → in ""REARM"", no D → correct.

Fourth guess ""pearl"":
- P at 1: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- L at 5: absent → in ""REARM"", no L → correct.

So ""REARM"" fits all the feedback so far.

But is ""REARM"" a valid Wordle word? Wordle uses a list of common words, and ""REARM"" is a word (meaning to arm again).

Alternatively, without duplicates, we have ""WEARY"".

But ""WEARY"" also fits the pattern and the absent letters.

Let's check ""WEARY"" against the feedback:

First guess ""crane"":
- C: absent → correct.
- R at 2: in ""WEARY"", R is at position 4, so present but not at 2 → (-) → matches.
- A at 3: in ""WEARY"", position 3 is A → (✓) → matches.
- N: absent → correct.
- E at 5: in ""crane"", E at 5. In ""WEARY"", E is at position 2, so present but not at 5 → (-) → matches.

Second guess ""tears"":
- T: absent → in ""WEARY"", no T → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- S at 5: absent → in ""WEARY"", no S → correct.

Third guess ""beard"":
- B: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- D at 5: absent → in ""WEARY"", no D → correct.

Fourth guess ""pearl"":
- P: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- L at 5: absent → in ""WEARY"", no L → correct.

So both ""REARM"" and ""WEARY"" fit the feedback.

But we have two possibilities? How to distinguish?

We need to guess one.

We also have other possibilities? For example, ""HEART"" is invalid because T is absent. ""GEAR"" not 5 letters. ""YEARN"" N absent.

What about ""WEALD""? But D is absent.

""MEALY""? M at 1, Y at 5? But ""MEALY"" is a word (resembling meal), and it has E at 2? No: M(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5). But we need R at position 4? In ""MEALY"", position 4 is L, not R. So invalid.

Similarly, ""WEARY"" has R at 4.

Another word: ""FEARS"" but S absent.

So the only two common words are ""WEARY"" and ""REARM"".

But ""REARM"" has duplicate R, which we haven't tested for.

We can try to guess ""WEARY"" to test for W and Y.

If we guess ""WEARY"" and it's not the word, then we know it must be ""REARM"" or another word? But what other words?

Another possibility: ""HEARS"" but S absent.

""KEEN"" not fitting.

""JEARS"" not a word.

""ZEARS"" not a word.

So likely between ""WEARY"" and ""REARM"".

We can try ""WEARY"" because it doesn't have duplicates and is more common? Or ""REARM"" might be less common.

But in Wordle, both might be acceptable.

Since we have two guesses left (guess 5 and 6), we can try one.

I think ""WEARY"" is a more common word, so we can try that.

But let's see the previous guesses: we have tested many consonants, and W and Y are still available.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters that might help distinguish, but since we have only two candidates, we can guess one.

I'll go with ""WEARY"".

But if we guess ""WEARY"" and it's wrong, then the word must be ""REARM"".

Similarly, if we guess ""REARM"" and it's wrong, then ""WEARY"".

But we have to make a choice.

Since ""REARM"" has a duplicate R, and we haven't seen evidence of duplicates, but it's possible, I think ""WEARY"" is a safer first choice.

So let's guess ""WEARY"".Based on the feedback and process of elimination:

- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _` (positions 2, 3, 4 fixed as E, A, R).
- Absent letters: B, C, D, L, N, P, S, T (from previous feedback).
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- After evaluating common words, two candidates remain:  
  - **WEARY** (W at position 1, Y at position 5)  
  - **REARM** (R at position 1, M at position 5 — but this would require a duplicate R, which is possible but less likely without prior evidence).  
- ""WEARY"" is prioritized because:  
  - It uses entirely new letters (W and Y) not tested before.  
  - It avoids assuming duplicate letters (no prior feedback suggests duplicates).  
  - It is a common word.  
- If ""WEARY"" is incorrect, the only other plausible candidate is ""REARM"", which can be guessed next.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Correct Position Letters**:
     - Position 2: **E** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
     - Position 3: **A** (confirmed in all guesses).
     - Position 4: **R** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, T, S, B, D, P, L (marked ""x"" in feedback).
   - **Pattern**: The secret word must be `_ E A R _` (positions 1 and 5 are unknown).
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 1 cannot be E, A, R, or any absent letter.
     - Position 5 cannot be E, A, R, or any absent letter.
     - No duplicate letters (feedback consistency suggests no repeats).

2. **Possible Letters for Positions 1 and 5**:
   - Excluded letters (absent or placed): A, B, C, D, E, L, N, P, R, S, T.
   - **Available letters**: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Valid Word Candidates**:
   - Common 5-letter words fitting `_ E A R _`:
     - **WEARY** (W at 1, Y at 5): Uses available letters, common word.
     - **REARM** (R at 1, M at 5): Requires duplicate R (no evidence for duplicates, less likely).
     - Other options like ""HEAR*"" (e.g., HEART/HEARD) are invalid due to absent letters (T/D).
     - ""PEARL"" was already guessed and ruled out.

4. **Why ""WEARY""?**:
   - Tests **W** (new letter) at position 1 and **Y** (new letter) at position 5.
   - Maximizes information: If correct, solves the puzzle; if incorrect, confirms W/Y are absent, leaving ""REARM"" as the only plausible candidate.
   - More common than ""REARM"" and avoids assuming duplicates.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - If ""WEARY"" is wrong, the answer must be ""REARM"" (guess in next try).

<guess>weary</guess>",weary,"We have the following feedback from all guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not at position 2
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""tears""
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → position 2 is E
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A (confirmed)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 4 is R

Guess 3: ""beard""
- B: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → position 2 is E (confirmed)
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A (confirmed)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 4 is R (confirmed)
- D: absent (x)

Guess 4: ""pearl""
- P: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → position 2 is E (confirmed)
- A: correct position (✓) → position 3 is A (confirmed)
- R: correct position (✓) → position 4 is R (confirmed)
- L: absent (x)

Now, we know the secret word has:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- The first and fifth positions are unknown, but we know the letters that are absent.

Absent letters: C, N, T, S, B, D, P, L (from the feedback above).

Also, from the first guess, we know that E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with E being at position 2.

The secret word pattern is: _ E A R _

We need to fill the first and last positions with letters that are not absent and not A, E, R (since they are already placed and we have no evidence of duplicates).

So, absent letters: C, N, T, S, B, D, P, L.

Therefore, the available letters for position 1 and 5 are: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form _ E A R _

Common words that fit this pattern and use the available letters:

- ""WEARY"": W at 1, Y at 5 → W and Y are available.
- ""HEARD"": H at 1, D at 5 → but D is absent (from guess 3), so invalid.
- ""HEART"": H at 1, T at 5 → T is absent (from guess 2), invalid.
- ""GEAR?"" → ""GEARS"" has S (absent) and ""GEAR"" is 4 letters. ""GEAR"" with a different ending? ""GEAR"" is not 5 letters.
- ""YEARN"": Y at 1, N at 5 → N is absent, invalid.
- ""FEARS"": F at 1, S at 5 → S is absent, invalid.
- ""KEARS"": K at 1, S at 5 → S absent, invalid.
- ""MEALS"": M at 1, S at 5 → S absent, invalid.
- ""WEALS"": W at 1, S at 5 → S absent, invalid.
- ""REALM"": R at 1, M at 5 → but R is already at position 4? And we are avoiding duplicates. Also, R at position 1 would be a repeat? But we don't know for sure. However, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. If the word had R at position 1 and 4, then the R at position 2 in the first guess would still be marked as present (since there is an R) but not at position 2. But in the second guess, we have R at position 4 and it was correct. We haven't tested position 1 for R. But we have T at position 1 in guess 2 which was absent, so if R were at position 1, then T would be absent, which is consistent. However, we have no evidence of a duplicate R. But it's possible.

But let's first try without duplicates.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""WEARY"": W at 1, Y at 5 → both available.
- ""WEALD"": W at 1, D at 5 → D is absent, invalid.
- ""HEAR?"" → no common 5-letter words with H at 1 and available at 5? ""HEARS"" has S, invalid. ""HEART"" has T, invalid. ""HEARD"" has D, invalid.
- ""JEARS"": not a word.
- ""LEARN"": L at 1, N at 5 → both absent? L is absent from guess 4, and N from guess 1, so invalid.
- ""MEANY"": not common? ""MEAN"" is 4 letters. ""MEANY"" is not standard.
- ""PEARL"" we already tried, P and L absent.
- ""REARM"": R at 1, M at 5 → but R at 1 would be a duplicate? And we haven't tested R at 1. But R is already in the word at position 4. So if we allow duplicates, then ""REARM"" is a word. But let's see if it fits the feedback.

If the secret word is ""REARM"":
- First guess ""crane"": 
  - C: absent → correct.
  - R at position 2: in ""REARM"", there is R at position 1 and 4. So R is present, but not at position 2 → so the feedback for R should be present but wrong position (-) → matches.
  - A at position 3: in ""REARM"", position 3 is A? R(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), M(5) → yes, so A is correct (✓) → matches.
  - N: absent → correct.
  - E at position 5: in ""crane"", E is at position 5. In ""REARM"", E is at position 2, so E is present but not at position 5 → so feedback should be (-) → matches.

Second guess ""tears"":
- T at 1: absent → in ""REARM"", no T → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- S at 5: absent → correct.

Third guess ""beard"":
- B at 1: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- D at 5: absent → in ""REARM"", no D → correct.

Fourth guess ""pearl"":
- P at 1: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- L at 5: absent → in ""REARM"", no L → correct.

So ""REARM"" fits all the feedback so far.

But is ""REARM"" a valid Wordle word? Wordle uses a list of common words, and ""REARM"" is a word (meaning to arm again).

Alternatively, without duplicates, we have ""WEARY"".

But ""WEARY"" also fits the pattern and the absent letters.

Let's check ""WEARY"" against the feedback:

First guess ""crane"":
- C: absent → correct.
- R at 2: in ""WEARY"", R is at position 4, so present but not at 2 → (-) → matches.
- A at 3: in ""WEARY"", position 3 is A → (✓) → matches.
- N: absent → correct.
- E at 5: in ""crane"", E at 5. In ""WEARY"", E is at position 2, so present but not at 5 → (-) → matches.

Second guess ""tears"":
- T: absent → in ""WEARY"", no T → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- S at 5: absent → in ""WEARY"", no S → correct.

Third guess ""beard"":
- B: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- D at 5: absent → in ""WEARY"", no D → correct.

Fourth guess ""pearl"":
- P: absent → correct.
- E at 2: correct → matches.
- A at 3: correct → matches.
- R at 4: correct → matches.
- L at 5: absent → in ""WEARY"", no L → correct.

So both ""REARM"" and ""WEARY"" fit the feedback.

But we have two possibilities? How to distinguish?

We need to guess one.

We also have other possibilities? For example, ""HEART"" is invalid because T is absent. ""GEAR"" not 5 letters. ""YEARN"" N absent.

What about ""WEALD""? But D is absent.

""MEALY""? M at 1, Y at 5? But ""MEALY"" is a word (resembling meal), and it has E at 2? No: M(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5). But we need R at position 4? In ""MEALY"", position 4 is L, not R. So invalid.

Similarly, ""WEARY"" has R at 4.

Another word: ""FEARS"" but S absent.

So the only two common words are ""WEARY"" and ""REARM"".

But ""REARM"" has duplicate R, which we haven't tested for.

We can try to guess ""WEARY"" to test for W and Y.

If we guess ""WEARY"" and it's not the word, then we know it must be ""REARM"" or another word? But what other words?

Another possibility: ""HEARS"" but S absent.

""KEEN"" not fitting.

""JEARS"" not a word.

""ZEARS"" not a word.

So likely between ""WEARY"" and ""REARM"".

We can try ""WEARY"" because it doesn't have duplicates and is more common? Or ""REARM"" might be less common.

But in Wordle, both might be acceptable.

Since we have two guesses left (guess 5 and 6), we can try one.

I think ""WEARY"" is a more common word, so we can try that.

But let's see the previous guesses: we have tested many consonants, and W and Y are still available.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters that might help distinguish, but since we have only two candidates, we can guess one.

I'll go with ""WEARY"".

But if we guess ""WEARY"" and it's wrong, then the word must be ""REARM"".

Similarly, if we guess ""REARM"" and it's wrong, then ""WEARY"".

But we have to make a choice.

Since ""REARM"" has a duplicate R, and we haven't seen evidence of duplicates, but it's possible, I think ""WEARY"" is a safer first choice.

So let's guess ""WEARY"".Based on the feedback and process of elimination:

- The secret word pattern is `_ E A R _` (positions 2, 3, 4 fixed as E, A, R).
- Absent letters: B, C, D, L, N, P, S, T (from previous feedback).
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- After evaluating common words, two candidates remain:  
  - **WEARY** (W at position 1, Y at position 5)  
  - **REARM** (R at position 1, M at position 5 — but this would require a duplicate R, which is possible but less likely without prior evidence).  
- ""WEARY"" is prioritized because:  
  - It uses entirely new letters (W and Y) not tested before.  
  - It avoids assuming duplicate letters (no prior feedback suggests duplicates).  
  - It is a common word.  
- If ""WEARY"" is incorrect, the only other plausible candidate is ""REARM"", which can be guessed next.

<guess>weary</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Correct Position Letters**:
     - Position 2: **E** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
     - Position 3: **A** (confirmed in all guesses).
     - Position 4: **R** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, T, S, B, D, P, L (marked ""x"" in feedback).
   - **Pattern**: The secret word must be `_ E A R _` (positions 1 and 5 are unknown).
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 1 cannot be E, A, R, or any absent letter.
     - Position 5 cannot be E, A, R, or any absent letter.
     - No duplicate letters (feedback consistency suggests no repeats).

2. **Possible Letters for Positions 1 and 5**:
   - Excluded letters (absent or placed): A, B, C, D, E, L, N, P, R, S, T.
   - **Available letters**: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Valid Word Candidates**:
   - Common 5-letter words fitting `_ E A R _`:
     - **WEARY** (W at 1, Y at 5): Uses available letters, common word.
     - **REARM** (R at 1, M at 5): Requires duplicate R (no evidence for duplicates, less likely).
     - Other options like ""HEAR*"" (e.g., HEART/HEARD) are invalid due to absent letters (T/D).
     - ""PEARL"" was already guessed and ruled out.

4. **Why ""WEARY""?**:
   - Tests **W** (new letter) at position 1 and **Y** (new letter) at position 5.
   - Maximizes information: If correct, solves the puzzle; if incorrect, confirms W/Y are absent, leaving ""REARM"" as the only plausible candidate.
   - More common than ""REARM"" and avoids assuming duplicates.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - If ""WEARY"" is wrong, the answer must be ""REARM"" (guess in next try).",Guess 5: weary -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
