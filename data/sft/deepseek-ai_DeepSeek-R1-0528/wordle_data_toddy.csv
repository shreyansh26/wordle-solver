We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information. Ideally, we use a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words are ones that have often occurring letters in English and avoid repeated letters.
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me consider:
 - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E — these are fairly common. It doesn't have repeated letters.
 - Also, ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E — also common letters.

 How about ""RAISE""? It has R, A, I, S, E — also common.

 Since both are good, I can pick one arbitrarily. Let me pick ""CRANE"".

 But note: The instructions don't reveal the word list. So we have to stick to valid English words.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as an initial guess.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: CRANE

 Let me output it in the required format.
</think>
For the first guess, I need to pick a word that maximizes information gathering. A good starting word should include commonly used vowels and consonants to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or their positions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:

- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are among the most frequently used letters.
- The consonants (C, R, N) are also common in English 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing for efficient testing of five different characters.
- It has been statistically proven to be a strong opener in word games.

This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly, regardless of the feedback.

We are making our second guess. We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked as 'x', meaning none of them are in the secret word.

 Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are in the secret word, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Our next guess should also be a 5-letter English word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We must choose a word with other common letters. Let's list common letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}:
 Vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are already excluded)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 We can aim for a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters: e.g., S, T, L, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded set? (excluded are C,R,A,N,E) — so S, L, O, T, H are allowed.

 Alternatively, consider other words:
 - ""POUCH"": but P, O, U, C, H — C is excluded! We cannot use C. So invalid.
 - ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. This is a valid word.

 However, ""SLOTH"" seems better because it has common letters: S, T are very common.

 Another common starting word is ""QUERY"", but that has Q (rare), U, E (excluded), R (excluded), Y — so not good.

 How about ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S? No C,R,A,N,E.

 But note: We are looking for a word without the excluded letters.

 Other possibilities: ""SPILT"", ""STOMP"", ""GUSTY"", etc.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover new common letters.

 ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be too obscure.

 A good word: ""MOIST"" — M, O, I, S, T — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. It uses common letters.

 How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.

 I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.

 However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.

 Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.

 Considering frequency of letters:
 After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".

Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters. For the next guess:

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.  
   → Must avoid using any of these letters in the next guess.
   
2. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Choose a valid 5-letter English word using only **untested letters** to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, M, P, Y, H, B, U).  
   - Aim for high-frequency consonants and vowels: **S**, **T**, **O**, and **I** are among the most common untested letters.  

3. **Word selection**:  
   - Ideal options include words like **MOIST** (letters: M, O, I, S, T) or **POULT** (P, O, U, L, T).  
   - **MOIST** is particularly strong because:  
     → It covers four high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and one vowel (O, I), ensuring broad coverage.  
     → All letters are distinct and untested, minimizing redundancy.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - **MOIST** efficiently tests new letters while adhering to feedback constraints.

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:\n\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are among the most frequently used letters.\n- The consonants (C, R, N) are also common in English 5-letter words.\n- All letters are distinct, allowing for efficient testing of five different characters.\n- It has been statistically proven to be a strong opener in word games.\n\nThis choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly, regardless of the feedback.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are making our second guess. We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked as \'x\', meaning none of them are in the secret word.\n\n Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are in the secret word, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.\n\n Our next guess should also be a 5-letter English word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n We must choose a word with other common letters. Let\'s list common letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}:\n Vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are already excluded)\n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.\n\n We can aim for a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters: e.g., S, T, L, etc.\n\n A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but let\'s check: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded set? (excluded are C,R,A,N,E) — so S, L, O, T, H are allowed.\n\n Alternatively, consider other words:\n - ""POUCH"": but P, O, U, C, H — C is excluded! We cannot use C. So invalid.\n - ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. This is a valid word.\n\n However, ""SLOTH"" seems better because it has common letters: S, T are very common.\n\n Another common starting word is ""QUERY"", but that has Q (rare), U, E (excluded), R (excluded), Y — so not good.\n\n How about ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S? No C,R,A,N,E.\n\n But note: We are looking for a word without the excluded letters.\n\n Other possibilities: ""SPILT"", ""STOMP"", ""GUSTY"", etc.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to cover new common letters.\n\n ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be too obscure.\n\n A good word: ""MOIST"" — M, O, I, S, T — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. It uses common letters.\n\n How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.\n\n I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.\n\n However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.\n\n Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.\n\n Considering frequency of letters:\n After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.\n\n Let\'s go with ""MOIST"".\n\n Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".\n\n Output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters. For the next guess:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.  \n   → Must avoid using any of these letters in the next guess.\n   \n2. **Strategy for next guess**:  \n   - Choose a valid 5-letter English word using only **untested letters** to maximize information.  \n   - Prioritize common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, M, P, Y, H, B, U).  \n   - Aim for high-frequency consonants and vowels: **S**, **T**, **O**, and **I** are among the most common untested letters.  \n\n3. **Word selection**:  \n   - Ideal options include words like **MOIST** (letters: M, O, I, S, T) or **POULT** (P, O, U, L, T).  \n   - **MOIST** is particularly strong because:  \n     → It covers four high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and one vowel (O, I), ensuring broad coverage.  \n     → All letters are distinct and untested, minimizing redundancy.  \n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   - **MOIST** efficiently tests new letters while adhering to feedback constraints.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

So, from MOIST:
- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).
- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.
- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).

The remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _
  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.
  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.

- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.
  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.

But note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.

But in our next guess, we can try to test for that.

Alternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _
Example: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.

However, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Possible words:

- T at position 1: T O _ _ _
  Options: 
    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.
    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.
    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)
    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.
    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)
    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)
    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)
    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.

  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.

- T at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Options:
    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.
    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
    FOTCH -> not a word.
    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.
    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.
    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.
    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.
    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.
    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.
    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.
    WOTHY -> not a word.
    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.

  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.

- T at position 4: _ O _ T _
  Options:
    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.
    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.
    DOUTY -> not a word.
    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.
    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.
    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.
    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.
    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.
    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.
    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.
    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.
    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.
    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.
    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.

  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.

Now, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

Also, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.

Let's list the candidate words we have:

- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.
- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.
- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.
- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.

We want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.

Among the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.

We also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.

Common letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).

H and L are more common than F and G.

So HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).

HOTLY has H and L, which are very common.

Also, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.

Similarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.

We don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

We have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.

We haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.

In HOTLY, we test T at position 3.

In TOUGH, we test T at position 1.

In LOFTY, we test T at position 4.

In POUTY, we test T at position 4.

We might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.

All our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.

So let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.

Alternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.

But H is common to both.

We can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.

In all our candidates, T is not at position 5.

Now, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.

Similarly, TOUGH is valid.

But note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:

- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.
- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.

All good.

I think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.

Alternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.

Another word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).

So HOTLY is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.

BOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.

GOTHY? Not a word.

So HOTLY seems good.

We could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.

But HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.

In English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... 

But we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.

So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Most common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.

So L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.

HOTLY has H, L, Y.

LOFTY has L, F, Y.

POUTY has P, U, Y.

TOUGH has U, G, H.

All are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.

Also, Y is less common, but it's included.

Another word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.

In DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.

Similarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.

So DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.

Another word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.

HOTLY seems fine.

But let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with HOTLY.

Therefore, the third guess is HOTLY.

Output: <guess>HOTLY</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Feedback:  
  - M✗ (absent),  
  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  
  - I✗ (absent),  
  - S✗ (absent),  
  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
  → **Confirmed**:  
    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  
    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  

### Current Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  
- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  

### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**
- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Why HOTLY?**  
  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  
  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.  

<guess>HOTLY</guess>",HOTLY,"We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

So, from MOIST:
- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).
- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.
- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).

The remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _
  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.
  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.

- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.
  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.

But note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.

But in our next guess, we can try to test for that.

Alternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _
Example: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.

However, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Possible words:

- T at position 1: T O _ _ _
  Options: 
    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.
    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.
    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)
    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.
    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)
    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)
    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)
    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.

  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.

- T at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Options:
    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.
    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
    FOTCH -> not a word.
    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.
    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.
    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.
    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.
    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.
    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.
    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.
    WOTHY -> not a word.
    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.

  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.

- T at position 4: _ O _ T _
  Options:
    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.
    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.
    DOUTY -> not a word.
    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.
    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.
    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.
    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.
    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.
    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.
    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.
    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.
    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.
    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.
    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.

  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.

Now, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

Also, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.

Let's list the candidate words we have:

- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.
- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.
- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.
- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.

We want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.

Among the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.

We also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.

Common letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).

H and L are more common than F and G.

So HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).

HOTLY has H and L, which are very common.

Also, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.

Similarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.

We don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

We have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.

We haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.

In HOTLY, we test T at position 3.

In TOUGH, we test T at position 1.

In LOFTY, we test T at position 4.

In POUTY, we test T at position 4.

We might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.

All our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.

So let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.

Alternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.

But H is common to both.

We can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.

In all our candidates, T is not at position 5.

Now, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.

Similarly, TOUGH is valid.

But note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:

- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.
- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.

All good.

I think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.

Alternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.

Another word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).

So HOTLY is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.

BOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.

GOTHY? Not a word.

So HOTLY seems good.

We could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.

But HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.

In English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... 

But we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.

So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Most common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.

So L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.

HOTLY has H, L, Y.

LOFTY has L, F, Y.

POUTY has P, U, Y.

TOUGH has U, G, H.

All are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.

Also, Y is less common, but it's included.

Another word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.

In DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.

Similarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.

So DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.

Another word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.

HOTLY seems fine.

But let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with HOTLY.

Therefore, the third guess is HOTLY.

Output: <guess>HOTLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Feedback:  
  - M✗ (absent),  
  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  
  - I✗ (absent),  
  - S✗ (absent),  
  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
  → **Confirmed**:  
    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  
    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  

### Current Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  
- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  

### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**
- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Why HOTLY?**  
  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  
  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.",Guess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information. Ideally, we use a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words are ones that have often occurring letters in English and avoid repeated letters.
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me consider:
 - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E — these are fairly common. It doesn't have repeated letters.
 - Also, ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E — also common letters.

 How about ""RAISE""? It has R, A, I, S, E — also common.

 Since both are good, I can pick one arbitrarily. Let me pick ""CRANE"".

 But note: The instructions don't reveal the word list. So we have to stick to valid English words.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as an initial guess.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: CRANE

 Let me output it in the required format.For the first guess, I need to pick a word that maximizes information gathering. A good starting word should include commonly used vowels and consonants to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or their positions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:

- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are among the most frequently used letters.
- The consonants (C, R, N) are also common in English 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing for efficient testing of five different characters.
- It has been statistically proven to be a strong opener in word games.

This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly, regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making our second guess. We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked as 'x', meaning none of them are in the secret word.

 Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are in the secret word, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Our next guess should also be a 5-letter English word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We must choose a word with other common letters. Let's list common letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}:
 Vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are already excluded)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 We can aim for a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters: e.g., S, T, L, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded set? (excluded are C,R,A,N,E) — so S, L, O, T, H are allowed.

 Alternatively, consider other words:
 - ""POUCH"": but P, O, U, C, H — C is excluded! We cannot use C. So invalid.
 - ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. This is a valid word.

 However, ""SLOTH"" seems better because it has common letters: S, T are very common.

 Another common starting word is ""QUERY"", but that has Q (rare), U, E (excluded), R (excluded), Y — so not good.

 How about ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S? No C,R,A,N,E.

 But note: We are looking for a word without the excluded letters.

 Other possibilities: ""SPILT"", ""STOMP"", ""GUSTY"", etc.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover new common letters.

 ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be too obscure.

 A good word: ""MOIST"" — M, O, I, S, T — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. It uses common letters.

 How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.

 I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.

 However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.

 Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.

 Considering frequency of letters:
 After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".

 Output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters. For the next guess:

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.  
   → Must avoid using any of these letters in the next guess.
   
2. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Choose a valid 5-letter English word using only **untested letters** to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, M, P, Y, H, B, U).  
   - Aim for high-frequency consonants and vowels: **S**, **T**, **O**, and **I** are among the most common untested letters.  

3. **Word selection**:  
   - Ideal options include words like **MOIST** (letters: M, O, I, S, T) or **POULT** (P, O, U, L, T).  
   - **MOIST** is particularly strong because:  
     → It covers four high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and one vowel (O, I), ensuring broad coverage.  
     → All letters are distinct and untested, minimizing redundancy.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - **MOIST** efficiently tests new letters while adhering to feedback constraints.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

So, from MOIST:
- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).
- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.
- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).

The remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _
  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.
  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.

- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.
  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.

But note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.

But in our next guess, we can try to test for that.

Alternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _
Example: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.

However, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Possible words:

- T at position 1: T O _ _ _
  Options: 
    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.
    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.
    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)
    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.
    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)
    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)
    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)
    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.

  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.

- T at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Options:
    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.
    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
    FOTCH -> not a word.
    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.
    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.
    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.
    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.
    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.
    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.
    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.
    WOTHY -> not a word.
    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.

  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.

- T at position 4: _ O _ T _
  Options:
    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.
    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.
    DOUTY -> not a word.
    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.
    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.
    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.
    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.
    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.
    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.
    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.
    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.
    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.
    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.
    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.

  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.

Now, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

Also, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.

Let's list the candidate words we have:

- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.
- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.
- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.
- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.

We want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.

Among the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.

We also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.

Common letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).

H and L are more common than F and G.

So HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).

HOTLY has H and L, which are very common.

Also, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.

Similarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.

We don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

We have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.

We haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.

In HOTLY, we test T at position 3.

In TOUGH, we test T at position 1.

In LOFTY, we test T at position 4.

In POUTY, we test T at position 4.

We might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.

All our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.

So let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.

Alternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.

But H is common to both.

We can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.

In all our candidates, T is not at position 5.

Now, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.

Similarly, TOUGH is valid.

But note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:

- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.
- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.

All good.

I think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.

Alternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.

Another word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).

So HOTLY is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.

BOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.

GOTHY? Not a word.

So HOTLY seems good.

We could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.

But HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.

In English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... 

But we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.

So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Most common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.

So L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.

HOTLY has H, L, Y.

LOFTY has L, F, Y.

POUTY has P, U, Y.

TOUGH has U, G, H.

All are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.

Also, Y is less common, but it's included.

Another word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.

In DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.

Similarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.

So DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.

Another word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.

HOTLY seems fine.

But let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with HOTLY.

Therefore, the third guess is HOTLY.

Output: <guess>HOTLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Feedback:  
  - M✗ (absent),  
  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  
  - I✗ (absent),  
  - S✗ (absent),  
  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
  → **Confirmed**:  
    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  
    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  

### Current Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  
- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  

### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**
- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Why HOTLY?**  
  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  
  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.

TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.\n\n- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _\n  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.\n  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.\n  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.\n\nBut note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.\n\nBut in our next guess, we can try to test for that.\n\nAlternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _\nExample: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.\n\nHowever, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- T at position 1: T O _ _ _\n  Options: \n    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)\n    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid?

We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.\n\nAlso, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.\n\nLet's list the candidate words we have:\n\n- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.\n- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.\n- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.\n- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.\n- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.\n\nWe want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.\n\nAmong the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.\n\nWe also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.\n\nCommon letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).\n\nH and L are more common than F and G.\n\nSo HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).\n\nHOTLY has H and L, which are very common.\n\nAlso, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.\n\nSimilarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.\n\nWe don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.\n\nBut note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.\n\nWe have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.\n\nIn HOTLY, we test T at position 3.\n\nIn TOUGH, we test T at position 1.\n\nIn LOFTY, we test T at position 4.\n\nIn POUTY, we test T at position 4.\n\nWe might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.\n\nAll our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.\n\nSo let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.\n\nAlternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.\n\nBut H is common to both.\n\nWe can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.\n\nIn all our candidates, T is not at position 5.\n\nNow, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.\n\nSimilarly, TOUGH is valid.\n\nBut note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:\n\n- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.\n- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.\n\nAnother word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.\n\nSimilarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).\n\nSo HOTLY is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.\n\nBOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.\n\nGOTHY? Not a word.\n\nSo HOTLY seems good.\n\nWe could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.\n\nBut HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.\n\nIn English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... \n\nBut we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.\n\nSo excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nMost common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.\n\nSo L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.\n\nHOTLY has H, L, Y.\n\nLOFTY has L, F, Y.\n\nPOUTY has P, U, Y.\n\nTOUGH has U, G, H.\n\nAll are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.\n\nAlso, Y is less common, but it's included.\n\nAnother word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.\n\nIn DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.\n\nSo DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.\n\nAnother word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.\n\nHOTLY seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo I'll go with HOTLY.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is HOTLY.\n\nOutput: <guess>HOTLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  \n  → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  \n- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Feedback:  \n  - M✗ (absent),  \n  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  \n  - I✗ (absent),  \n  - S✗ (absent),  \n  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  \n  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  \n  → **Confirmed**:  \n    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  \n    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  \n\n### Current Constraints:\n1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  \n2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  \n3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  \n4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  \n- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  \n- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  \n\n### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**\n- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  \n- **Why HOTLY?**  \n  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  \n  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.\n\n<guess>HOTLY</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3? In HOTLY, T is at position 3, and it's marked as present but wrong position, meaning that T is in the word but not at position 3. So T is not at position 3 either.)
- L: absent
- Y: correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY) and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1 and 4, T must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, we have more absent letters: H and L are absent, so we add them to the exclusion list.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T is present, but we are not sure of its position, and O and Y are fixed at positions 2 and 5).

The secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

T must be at position 1 or 4.

We need to form a word that:
- First character: either T or something else (if T is at position 4, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Third character: a letter from the available set (since T cannot be at position 3, and we don't know if it's at 1 or 4, so position 3 must be a new letter unless T is at 1 and then position 3 is not T)
- Fourth character: if T is not at position 4, then it must be a new letter, but if T is at position 4, then we put T there.

But note: we have to include T in the word because it's present.

So two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1 -> word: T O _ _ Y
Case 2: T at position 4 -> word: _ O _ T Y

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: T at position 1 -> T O _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with available letters (from B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z) and avoid excluded letters.

Possible words:
- TOXIC? But C and I are excluded -> invalid.
- TOUGH? But G and H: H is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? C and H excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY? T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated? And Y is at position 5, which is correct. But we have F at position 3 and 4? TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y. But F is repeated. Also, is TOFFY a word? It might be a proper noun or rare, but let's consider. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for more information.
- TOPPY? T, O, P, P, Y -> P repeated -> not ideal.
- TOUZY? Not a common word.
- TOWZY? Similarly, rare.
- TOYON? But O at position 2 and then O again? T, O, Y, O, N? But N is excluded, and also pattern is T O _ _ Y, so third and fourth must be filled. TOYON: T, O, Y, O, N -> but Y is at position 3? We need position 5 to be Y, but in TOYON, position 5 is N. So not matching pattern.

We need the word to end with Y, so last letter is Y.

So T O ? ? Y

Possible:
- TODAY? T, O, D, A, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? Invalid.
- TOUGH? Invalid (H excluded).
- TOLLY? T, O, L, L, Y -> but L is excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated. But F is available. Is TOFFY valid? It means covered with toffee or something, but it's an adjective. We can consider.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> U and Z are available. Is TOUZY a word? It might be an alternate spelling of tousy, meaning disheveled. But let's see if it's accepted.
- TOWNY: T, O, W, N, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
- TOYON: doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TOUZY? T, O, U, Z, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:Z, 5:Y. This seems possible if TOUZY is accepted.

But let's check if there are better options.

Case 2: T at position 4 -> _ O _ T Y

Pattern: ? O ? T Y

Position 1 and 3 to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- BOTTY? B, O, T, T, Y -> but T repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, B is available. But BOTTY might not be common; it's informal for bottom.
- COTTY? C excluded -> invalid.
- DOTTY: D, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. D and Y available. DOTTY is a valid word.
- FOTTY? Not a word.
- GOTTY? Not a word.
- JOTTY? J, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. JOTTY might be a word (a type of pier), but rare.
- POTTED? 6 letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. POTTY is valid.
- PUTTY: P, U, T, T, Y -> T repeated. PUTTY is valid.
- WATTY? W, A, T, T, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

But all these have repeated T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But in previous feedback, we only had one T indicated, but it could be that there are two. However, to avoid repetition, we might prefer a word without repetition if possible.

Is there a word with T at position 4 and no repeated T? For example, with distinct letters.

- DOUTY? Not a word.
- FOUTY? Not a word.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> no repeated letters. POUTY is a valid word (sulky). And it fits: position 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.
- BOUTY? Not a word.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> valid (relating to gout). Pattern: G O U T Y.
- WOUTY? Not a word.

So possible words for case 2: POUTY, GOUTY, and also the repeated T words like DOTTY, POTTY, PUTTY.

Now, we need to choose a guess. We have two cases for T position.

We can choose a word that tests one of the cases and also introduces new letters.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we need to be efficient.

We know that T is either at position 1 or 4.

If we choose a word with T at position 1, we can test that case. Similarly for position 4.

But we also have to consider the feedback from the new guess.

Let's list the candidate words:

For T at position 1:
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only test F and nothing else for positions 3 and 4. Not ideal.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> tests U and Z, which are new. But Z is rare. And TOUZY might not be in the word list.

For T at position 4:
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P and U, both new and common.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> tests G and U.

We also have the word from case 2 without repetition: POUTY and GOUTY.

POUTY and GOUTY are both valid and test two new letters each.

But in POUTY, we have U at position 3, and in GOUTY, U at position 3 as well.

We also have to consider that Y is fixed at position 5, so we don't get new info about Y.

Now, which one to choose?

We can also consider if there is a word that tests position 1 with a new letter and has T at position 4.

For example, in case 2, we have POUTY: position 1 is P, which is new.

Similarly, GOUTY: position 1 is G, new.

But we don't have a word for case 1 that is common and tests two new letters without repetition. TOUZY is marginal.

Another word for case 1: TOWDY? Not a word.

TOWZY: variant of TOUSY, same as TOUZY.

Perhaps we should go with POUTY or GOUTY.

But note: in the previous guess, we had HOTLY which had T at position 3 and it was wrong, so T is not at 3.

Now, if we choose POUTY, which has T at position 4, we are testing that T is at position 4.

If it is, then we might get T correct, and also we test P and U.

If not, then T must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, we test that.

But we have to make a guess.

Since POUTY is a common word, let's consider it.

But we also have the feedback from HOTLY: Y is correct at position 5, so we know that.

Another thing: in POUTY, the pattern is P O U T Y.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then in POUTY, T would be correct, and we get feedback accordingly.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that.

Moreover, we test P and U.

Similarly, GOUTY tests G and U.

Which is better? P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But let's see the available letters.

We have to avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common ones: P, U, D, F, G, B, etc.

POUTY: tests P and U.

GOUTY: tests G and U.

Both test U, so the difference is P vs G.

P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But we also have to consider that if T is at position 1, then POUTY would have T at position 4 which is wrong, so we get T marked as present but wrong position (since it's in the word but not at 4, and we know it must be at 1).

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, like TOUZY, we test U and Z.

But Z is rare, so not ideal.

Another word for case 1: TUPIK? Not 5 letters.

TOYON? Not matching pattern.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't assume T position but includes T and the fixed O and Y.

But we have to include T, and we know it's at 1 or 4.

We can choose a word that has T at position 1 and new letters, or at position 4.

But TOUZY is not great.

What about DOUBT? But T at position 5, which we know is wrong, so we avoid.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T at position 4 and also tests new letters, like POUTY.

But let's see if there is a word with T at position 1 and common letters.

TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only learn about F, and if F is present or not. But since repeated, if F is present, we might not know how many, etc. Not efficient.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z. W is common, Z is rare. But TOWZY might not be in the word list.

I think POUTY is a safer choice.

Moreover, POUTY was considered earlier as a candidate.

So I'll go with POUTY.

Therefore, the fourth guess is POUTY.

But let's confirm the pattern: P O U T Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.

Yes.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then T will be correct, and we get feedback on P and U.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that, and we get feedback on P and U.

Either way, we learn about P and U.

And we have two guesses left.

So it's acceptable.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:
     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:
     - H✗, L✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).
     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (now only positions 1 or 4 possible).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y` (O at position 2, Y at position 5).
   - **T position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be at 3 or 5).
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L (avoid these).
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **T must be included** in the guess (since it is confirmed present).

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Goal**: Test the two possible positions for T (1 or 4) while maximizing new letter coverage.
   - **Prioritize**:
     - Testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, U, D, F, G).
     - Avoiding repeated letters to gather more information.
   - **Candidate words**:
     - **T at position 1**: Words like `T O _ _ Y` (e.g., TOFFY, TOUZY). However, TOFFY has repeated F, reducing information, and TOUZY uses rare letters (Z).
     - **T at position 4**: Words like `_ O _ T Y` (e.g., POUTY, GOUTY). POUTY (P, O, U, T, Y) is ideal:
       - Tests T at position 4 (a possible location).
       - Introduces **P** and **U** (high-frequency untested letters).
       - All letters distinct, maximizing information.
   - **Why POUTY?**:
     - If T is at position 4, feedback will confirm its position.
     - If T is not at position 4, it must be at position 1 (narrowing options for future guesses).
     - Feedback on P and U will help identify their presence/absence, significantly reducing possibilities.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   POUTY efficiently tests the critical T position while probing new common letters, aligning with the goal of narrowing down the solution space.

<guess>POUTY</guess>",POUTY,"We are on the fourth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3? In HOTLY, T is at position 3, and it's marked as present but wrong position, meaning that T is in the word but not at position 3. So T is not at position 3 either.)
- L: absent
- Y: correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY) and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1 and 4, T must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, we have more absent letters: H and L are absent, so we add them to the exclusion list.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T is present, but we are not sure of its position, and O and Y are fixed at positions 2 and 5).

The secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

T must be at position 1 or 4.

We need to form a word that:
- First character: either T or something else (if T is at position 4, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Third character: a letter from the available set (since T cannot be at position 3, and we don't know if it's at 1 or 4, so position 3 must be a new letter unless T is at 1 and then position 3 is not T)
- Fourth character: if T is not at position 4, then it must be a new letter, but if T is at position 4, then we put T there.

But note: we have to include T in the word because it's present.

So two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1 -> word: T O _ _ Y
Case 2: T at position 4 -> word: _ O _ T Y

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: T at position 1 -> T O _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with available letters (from B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z) and avoid excluded letters.

Possible words:
- TOXIC? But C and I are excluded -> invalid.
- TOUGH? But G and H: H is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? C and H excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY? T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated? And Y is at position 5, which is correct. But we have F at position 3 and 4? TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y. But F is repeated. Also, is TOFFY a word? It might be a proper noun or rare, but let's consider. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for more information.
- TOPPY? T, O, P, P, Y -> P repeated -> not ideal.
- TOUZY? Not a common word.
- TOWZY? Similarly, rare.
- TOYON? But O at position 2 and then O again? T, O, Y, O, N? But N is excluded, and also pattern is T O _ _ Y, so third and fourth must be filled. TOYON: T, O, Y, O, N -> but Y is at position 3? We need position 5 to be Y, but in TOYON, position 5 is N. So not matching pattern.

We need the word to end with Y, so last letter is Y.

So T O ? ? Y

Possible:
- TODAY? T, O, D, A, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? Invalid.
- TOUGH? Invalid (H excluded).
- TOLLY? T, O, L, L, Y -> but L is excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated. But F is available. Is TOFFY valid? It means covered with toffee or something, but it's an adjective. We can consider.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> U and Z are available. Is TOUZY a word? It might be an alternate spelling of tousy, meaning disheveled. But let's see if it's accepted.
- TOWNY: T, O, W, N, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
- TOYON: doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TOUZY? T, O, U, Z, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:Z, 5:Y. This seems possible if TOUZY is accepted.

But let's check if there are better options.

Case 2: T at position 4 -> _ O _ T Y

Pattern: ? O ? T Y

Position 1 and 3 to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- BOTTY? B, O, T, T, Y -> but T repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, B is available. But BOTTY might not be common; it's informal for bottom.
- COTTY? C excluded -> invalid.
- DOTTY: D, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. D and Y available. DOTTY is a valid word.
- FOTTY? Not a word.
- GOTTY? Not a word.
- JOTTY? J, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. JOTTY might be a word (a type of pier), but rare.
- POTTED? 6 letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. POTTY is valid.
- PUTTY: P, U, T, T, Y -> T repeated. PUTTY is valid.
- WATTY? W, A, T, T, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

But all these have repeated T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But in previous feedback, we only had one T indicated, but it could be that there are two. However, to avoid repetition, we might prefer a word without repetition if possible.

Is there a word with T at position 4 and no repeated T? For example, with distinct letters.

- DOUTY? Not a word.
- FOUTY? Not a word.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> no repeated letters. POUTY is a valid word (sulky). And it fits: position 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.
- BOUTY? Not a word.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> valid (relating to gout). Pattern: G O U T Y.
- WOUTY? Not a word.

So possible words for case 2: POUTY, GOUTY, and also the repeated T words like DOTTY, POTTY, PUTTY.

Now, we need to choose a guess. We have two cases for T position.

We can choose a word that tests one of the cases and also introduces new letters.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we need to be efficient.

We know that T is either at position 1 or 4.

If we choose a word with T at position 1, we can test that case. Similarly for position 4.

But we also have to consider the feedback from the new guess.

Let's list the candidate words:

For T at position 1:
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only test F and nothing else for positions 3 and 4. Not ideal.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> tests U and Z, which are new. But Z is rare. And TOUZY might not be in the word list.

For T at position 4:
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P and U, both new and common.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> tests G and U.

We also have the word from case 2 without repetition: POUTY and GOUTY.

POUTY and GOUTY are both valid and test two new letters each.

But in POUTY, we have U at position 3, and in GOUTY, U at position 3 as well.

We also have to consider that Y is fixed at position 5, so we don't get new info about Y.

Now, which one to choose?

We can also consider if there is a word that tests position 1 with a new letter and has T at position 4.

For example, in case 2, we have POUTY: position 1 is P, which is new.

Similarly, GOUTY: position 1 is G, new.

But we don't have a word for case 1 that is common and tests two new letters without repetition. TOUZY is marginal.

Another word for case 1: TOWDY? Not a word.

TOWZY: variant of TOUSY, same as TOUZY.

Perhaps we should go with POUTY or GOUTY.

But note: in the previous guess, we had HOTLY which had T at position 3 and it was wrong, so T is not at 3.

Now, if we choose POUTY, which has T at position 4, we are testing that T is at position 4.

If it is, then we might get T correct, and also we test P and U.

If not, then T must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, we test that.

But we have to make a guess.

Since POUTY is a common word, let's consider it.

But we also have the feedback from HOTLY: Y is correct at position 5, so we know that.

Another thing: in POUTY, the pattern is P O U T Y.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then in POUTY, T would be correct, and we get feedback accordingly.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that.

Moreover, we test P and U.

Similarly, GOUTY tests G and U.

Which is better? P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But let's see the available letters.

We have to avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common ones: P, U, D, F, G, B, etc.

POUTY: tests P and U.

GOUTY: tests G and U.

Both test U, so the difference is P vs G.

P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But we also have to consider that if T is at position 1, then POUTY would have T at position 4 which is wrong, so we get T marked as present but wrong position (since it's in the word but not at 4, and we know it must be at 1).

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, like TOUZY, we test U and Z.

But Z is rare, so not ideal.

Another word for case 1: TUPIK? Not 5 letters.

TOYON? Not matching pattern.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't assume T position but includes T and the fixed O and Y.

But we have to include T, and we know it's at 1 or 4.

We can choose a word that has T at position 1 and new letters, or at position 4.

But TOUZY is not great.

What about DOUBT? But T at position 5, which we know is wrong, so we avoid.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T at position 4 and also tests new letters, like POUTY.

But let's see if there is a word with T at position 1 and common letters.

TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only learn about F, and if F is present or not. But since repeated, if F is present, we might not know how many, etc. Not efficient.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z. W is common, Z is rare. But TOWZY might not be in the word list.

I think POUTY is a safer choice.

Moreover, POUTY was considered earlier as a candidate.

So I'll go with POUTY.

Therefore, the fourth guess is POUTY.

But let's confirm the pattern: P O U T Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.

Yes.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then T will be correct, and we get feedback on P and U.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that, and we get feedback on P and U.

Either way, we learn about P and U.

And we have two guesses left.

So it's acceptable.

<guess>POUTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:
     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:
     - H✗, L✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).
     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (now only positions 1 or 4 possible).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y` (O at position 2, Y at position 5).
   - **T position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be at 3 or 5).
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L (avoid these).
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **T must be included** in the guess (since it is confirmed present).

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Goal**: Test the two possible positions for T (1 or 4) while maximizing new letter coverage.
   - **Prioritize**:
     - Testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, U, D, F, G).
     - Avoiding repeated letters to gather more information.
   - **Candidate words**:
     - **T at position 1**: Words like `T O _ _ Y` (e.g., TOFFY, TOUZY). However, TOFFY has repeated F, reducing information, and TOUZY uses rare letters (Z).
     - **T at position 4**: Words like `_ O _ T Y` (e.g., POUTY, GOUTY). POUTY (P, O, U, T, Y) is ideal:
       - Tests T at position 4 (a possible location).
       - Introduces **P** and **U** (high-frequency untested letters).
       - All letters distinct, maximizing information.
   - **Why POUTY?**:
     - If T is at position 4, feedback will confirm its position.
     - If T is not at position 4, it must be at position 1 (narrowing options for future guesses).
     - Feedback on P and U will help identify their presence/absence, significantly reducing possibilities.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   POUTY efficiently tests the critical T position while probing new common letters, aligning with the goal of narrowing down the solution space.",Guess 4: POUTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information. Ideally, we use a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words are ones that have often occurring letters in English and avoid repeated letters.
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me consider:
 - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E — these are fairly common. It doesn't have repeated letters.
 - Also, ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E — also common letters.

 How about ""RAISE""? It has R, A, I, S, E — also common.

 Since both are good, I can pick one arbitrarily. Let me pick ""CRANE"".

 But note: The instructions don't reveal the word list. So we have to stick to valid English words.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as an initial guess.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: CRANE

 Let me output it in the required format.For the first guess, I need to pick a word that maximizes information gathering. A good starting word should include commonly used vowels and consonants to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or their positions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:

- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are among the most frequently used letters.
- The consonants (C, R, N) are also common in English 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing for efficient testing of five different characters.
- It has been statistically proven to be a strong opener in word games.

This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly, regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making our second guess. We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked as 'x', meaning none of them are in the secret word.

 Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are in the secret word, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Our next guess should also be a 5-letter English word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We must choose a word with other common letters. Let's list common letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}:
 Vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are already excluded)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 We can aim for a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters: e.g., S, T, L, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded set? (excluded are C,R,A,N,E) — so S, L, O, T, H are allowed.

 Alternatively, consider other words:
 - ""POUCH"": but P, O, U, C, H — C is excluded! We cannot use C. So invalid.
 - ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. This is a valid word.

 However, ""SLOTH"" seems better because it has common letters: S, T are very common.

 Another common starting word is ""QUERY"", but that has Q (rare), U, E (excluded), R (excluded), Y — so not good.

 How about ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S? No C,R,A,N,E.

 But note: We are looking for a word without the excluded letters.

 Other possibilities: ""SPILT"", ""STOMP"", ""GUSTY"", etc.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover new common letters.

 ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be too obscure.

 A good word: ""MOIST"" — M, O, I, S, T — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. It uses common letters.

 How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.

 I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.

 However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.

 Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.

 Considering frequency of letters:
 After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".

 Output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters. For the next guess:

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.  
   → Must avoid using any of these letters in the next guess.
   
2. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Choose a valid 5-letter English word using only **untested letters** to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, M, P, Y, H, B, U).  
   - Aim for high-frequency consonants and vowels: **S**, **T**, **O**, and **I** are among the most common untested letters.  

3. **Word selection**:  
   - Ideal options include words like **MOIST** (letters: M, O, I, S, T) or **POULT** (P, O, U, L, T).  
   - **MOIST** is particularly strong because:  
     → It covers four high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and one vowel (O, I), ensuring broad coverage.  
     → All letters are distinct and untested, minimizing redundancy.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - **MOIST** efficiently tests new letters while adhering to feedback constraints.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

So, from MOIST:
- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).
- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.
- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).

The remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _
  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.
  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.

- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.
  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.

But note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.

But in our next guess, we can try to test for that.

Alternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _
Example: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.

However, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Possible words:

- T at position 1: T O _ _ _
  Options: 
    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.
    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.
    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)
    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.
    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)
    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)
    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)
    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.

  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.

- T at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Options:
    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.
    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
    FOTCH -> not a word.
    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.
    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.
    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.
    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.
    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.
    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.
    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.
    WOTHY -> not a word.
    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.

  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.

- T at position 4: _ O _ T _
  Options:
    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.
    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.
    DOUTY -> not a word.
    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.
    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.
    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.
    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.
    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.
    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.
    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.
    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.
    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.
    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.
    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.

  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.

Now, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

Also, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.

Let's list the candidate words we have:

- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.
- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.
- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.
- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.

We want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.

Among the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.

We also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.

Common letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).

H and L are more common than F and G.

So HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).

HOTLY has H and L, which are very common.

Also, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.

Similarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.

We don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

We have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.

We haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.

In HOTLY, we test T at position 3.

In TOUGH, we test T at position 1.

In LOFTY, we test T at position 4.

In POUTY, we test T at position 4.

We might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.

All our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.

So let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.

Alternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.

But H is common to both.

We can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.

In all our candidates, T is not at position 5.

Now, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.

Similarly, TOUGH is valid.

But note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:

- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.
- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.

All good.

I think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.

Alternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.

Another word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).

So HOTLY is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.

BOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.

GOTHY? Not a word.

So HOTLY seems good.

We could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.

But HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.

In English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... 

But we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.

So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Most common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.

So L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.

HOTLY has H, L, Y.

LOFTY has L, F, Y.

POUTY has P, U, Y.

TOUGH has U, G, H.

All are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.

Also, Y is less common, but it's included.

Another word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.

In DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.

Similarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.

So DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.

Another word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.

HOTLY seems fine.

But let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with HOTLY.

Therefore, the third guess is HOTLY.

Output: <guess>HOTLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Feedback:  
  - M✗ (absent),  
  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  
  - I✗ (absent),  
  - S✗ (absent),  
  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
  → **Confirmed**:  
    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  
    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  

### Current Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  
- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  

### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**
- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Why HOTLY?**  
  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  
  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.

<guess>HOTLY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
Guess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the fourth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3? In HOTLY, T is at position 3, and it's marked as present but wrong position, meaning that T is in the word but not at position 3. So T is not at position 3 either.)
- L: absent
- Y: correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY) and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1 and 4, T must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, we have more absent letters: H and L are absent, so we add them to the exclusion list.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T is present, but we are not sure of its position, and O and Y are fixed at positions 2 and 5).

The secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

T must be at position 1 or 4.

We need to form a word that:
- First character: either T or something else (if T is at position 4, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Third character: a letter from the available set (since T cannot be at position 3, and we don't know if it's at 1 or 4, so position 3 must be a new letter unless T is at 1 and then position 3 is not T)
- Fourth character: if T is not at position 4, then it must be a new letter, but if T is at position 4, then we put T there.

But note: we have to include T in the word because it's present.

So two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1 -> word: T O _ _ Y
Case 2: T at position 4 -> word: _ O _ T Y

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: T at position 1 -> T O _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with available letters (from B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z) and avoid excluded letters.

Possible words:
- TOXIC? But C and I are excluded -> invalid.
- TOUGH? But G and H: H is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? C and H excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY? T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated? And Y is at position 5, which is correct. But we have F at position 3 and 4? TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y. But F is repeated. Also, is TOFFY a word? It might be a proper noun or rare, but let's consider. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for more information.
- TOPPY? T, O, P, P, Y -> P repeated -> not ideal.
- TOUZY? Not a common word.
- TOWZY? Similarly, rare.
- TOYON? But O at position 2 and then O again? T, O, Y, O, N? But N is excluded, and also pattern is T O _ _ Y, so third and fourth must be filled. TOYON: T, O, Y, O, N -> but Y is at position 3? We need position 5 to be Y, but in TOYON, position 5 is N. So not matching pattern.

We need the word to end with Y, so last letter is Y.

So T O ? ? Y

Possible:
- TODAY? T, O, D, A, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? Invalid.
- TOUGH? Invalid (H excluded).
- TOLLY? T, O, L, L, Y -> but L is excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated. But F is available. Is TOFFY valid? It means covered with toffee or something, but it's an adjective. We can consider.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> U and Z are available. Is TOUZY a word? It might be an alternate spelling of tousy, meaning disheveled. But let's see if it's accepted.
- TOWNY: T, O, W, N, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
- TOYON: doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TOUZY? T, O, U, Z, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:Z, 5:Y. This seems possible if TOUZY is accepted.

But let's check if there are better options.

Case 2: T at position 4 -> _ O _ T Y

Pattern: ? O ? T Y

Position 1 and 3 to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- BOTTY? B, O, T, T, Y -> but T repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, B is available. But BOTTY might not be common; it's informal for bottom.
- COTTY? C excluded -> invalid.
- DOTTY: D, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. D and Y available. DOTTY is a valid word.
- FOTTY? Not a word.
- GOTTY? Not a word.
- JOTTY? J, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. JOTTY might be a word (a type of pier), but rare.
- POTTED? 6 letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. POTTY is valid.
- PUTTY: P, U, T, T, Y -> T repeated. PUTTY is valid.
- WATTY? W, A, T, T, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

But all these have repeated T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But in previous feedback, we only had one T indicated, but it could be that there are two. However, to avoid repetition, we might prefer a word without repetition if possible.

Is there a word with T at position 4 and no repeated T? For example, with distinct letters.

- DOUTY? Not a word.
- FOUTY? Not a word.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> no repeated letters. POUTY is a valid word (sulky). And it fits: position 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.
- BOUTY? Not a word.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> valid (relating to gout). Pattern: G O U T Y.
- WOUTY? Not a word.

So possible words for case 2: POUTY, GOUTY, and also the repeated T words like DOTTY, POTTY, PUTTY.

Now, we need to choose a guess. We have two cases for T position.

We can choose a word that tests one of the cases and also introduces new letters.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we need to be efficient.

We know that T is either at position 1 or 4.

If we choose a word with T at position 1, we can test that case. Similarly for position 4.

But we also have to consider the feedback from the new guess.

Let's list the candidate words:

For T at position 1:
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only test F and nothing else for positions 3 and 4. Not ideal.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> tests U and Z, which are new. But Z is rare. And TOUZY might not be in the word list.

For T at position 4:
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P and U, both new and common.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> tests G and U.

We also have the word from case 2 without repetition: POUTY and GOUTY.

POUTY and GOUTY are both valid and test two new letters each.

But in POUTY, we have U at position 3, and in GOUTY, U at position 3 as well.

We also have to consider that Y is fixed at position 5, so we don't get new info about Y.

Now, which one to choose?

We can also consider if there is a word that tests position 1 with a new letter and has T at position 4.

For example, in case 2, we have POUTY: position 1 is P, which is new.

Similarly, GOUTY: position 1 is G, new.

But we don't have a word for case 1 that is common and tests two new letters without repetition. TOUZY is marginal.

Another word for case 1: TOWDY? Not a word.

TOWZY: variant of TOUSY, same as TOUZY.

Perhaps we should go with POUTY or GOUTY.

But note: in the previous guess, we had HOTLY which had T at position 3 and it was wrong, so T is not at 3.

Now, if we choose POUTY, which has T at position 4, we are testing that T is at position 4.

If it is, then we might get T correct, and also we test P and U.

If not, then T must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, we test that.

But we have to make a guess.

Since POUTY is a common word, let's consider it.

But we also have the feedback from HOTLY: Y is correct at position 5, so we know that.

Another thing: in POUTY, the pattern is P O U T Y.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then in POUTY, T would be correct, and we get feedback accordingly.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that.

Moreover, we test P and U.

Similarly, GOUTY tests G and U.

Which is better? P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But let's see the available letters.

We have to avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common ones: P, U, D, F, G, B, etc.

POUTY: tests P and U.

GOUTY: tests G and U.

Both test U, so the difference is P vs G.

P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But we also have to consider that if T is at position 1, then POUTY would have T at position 4 which is wrong, so we get T marked as present but wrong position (since it's in the word but not at 4, and we know it must be at 1).

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, like TOUZY, we test U and Z.

But Z is rare, so not ideal.

Another word for case 1: TUPIK? Not 5 letters.

TOYON? Not matching pattern.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't assume T position but includes T and the fixed O and Y.

But we have to include T, and we know it's at 1 or 4.

We can choose a word that has T at position 1 and new letters, or at position 4.

But TOUZY is not great.

What about DOUBT? But T at position 5, which we know is wrong, so we avoid.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T at position 4 and also tests new letters, like POUTY.

But let's see if there is a word with T at position 1 and common letters.

TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only learn about F, and if F is present or not. But since repeated, if F is present, we might not know how many, etc. Not efficient.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z. W is common, Z is rare. But TOWZY might not be in the word list.

I think POUTY is a safer choice.

Moreover, POUTY was considered earlier as a candidate.

So I'll go with POUTY.

Therefore, the fourth guess is POUTY.

But let's confirm the pattern: P O U T Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.

Yes.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then T will be correct, and we get feedback on P and U.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that, and we get feedback on P and U.

Either way, we learn about P and U.

And we have two guesses left.

So it's acceptable.

<guess>POUTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:
     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:
     - H✗, L✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).
     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (now only positions 1 or 4 possible).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y` (O at position 2, Y at position 5).
   - **T position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be at 3 or 5).
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L (avoid these).
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **T must be included** in the guess (since it is confirmed present).

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Goal**: Test the two possible positions for T (1 or 4) while maximizing new letter coverage.
   - **Prioritize**:
     - Testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, U, D, F, G).
     - Avoiding repeated letters to gather more information.
   - **Candidate words**:
     - **T at position 1**: Words like `T O _ _ Y` (e.g., TOFFY, TOUZY). However, TOFFY has repeated F, reducing information, and TOUZY uses rare letters (Z).
     - **T at position 4**: Words like `_ O _ T Y` (e.g., POUTY, GOUTY). POUTY (P, O, U, T, Y) is ideal:
       - Tests T at position 4 (a possible location).
       - Introduces **P** and **U** (high-frequency untested letters).
       - All letters distinct, maximizing information.
   - **Why POUTY?**:
     - If T is at position 4, feedback will confirm its position.
     - If T is not at position 4, it must be at position 1 (narrowing options for future guesses).
     - Feedback on P and U will help identify their presence/absence, significantly reducing possibilities.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   POUTY efficiently tests the critical T position while probing new common letters, aligning with the goal of narrowing down the solution space.

This is a valid word.\n\n However, ""SLOTH"" seems better because it has common letters: S, T are very common.\n\n Another common starting word is ""QUERY"", but that has Q (rare), U, E (excluded), R (excluded), Y — so not good.\n\n How about ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S? No C,R,A,N,E.\n\n But note: We are looking for a word without the excluded letters.\n\n Other possibilities: ""SPILT"", ""STOMP"", ""GUSTY"", etc.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to cover new common letters.\n\n ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be too obscure.\n\n A good word: ""MOIST"" — M, O, I, S, T — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. It uses common letters.\n\n How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.\n\n I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.\n\n However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.\n\n Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.\n\n Considering frequency of letters:\n After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.\n\n Let\'s go with ""MOIST"".\n\n Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".\n\n Output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters. For the next guess:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.  \n   → Must avoid using any of these letters in the next guess.\n   \n2. **Strategy for next guess**:  \n   - Choose a valid 5-letter English word using only **untested letters** to maximize information.  \n   - Prioritize common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, M, P, Y, H, B, U).  \n   - Aim for high-frequency consonants and vowels: **S**, **T**, **O**, and **I** are among the most common untested letters.  \n\n3. **Word selection**:  \n   - Ideal options include words like **MOIST** (letters: M, O, I, S, T) or **POULT** (P, O, U, L, T).  \n   - **MOIST** is particularly strong because:  \n     → It covers four high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and one vowel (O, I), ensuring broad coverage.  \n     → All letters are distinct and untested, minimizing redundancy.  \n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   - **MOIST** efficiently tests new letters while adhering to feedback constraints.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nGuess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)\n\nThis means:\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).\n- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).\n- M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nSo, from MOIST:\n- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.\n- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).\n- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.\n- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nAlso, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).\n\nThe remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.\n\nSo the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _\n\nWe know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Second letter is O.\n- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).\n- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.\n\nLet's think of words that fit this pattern.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _\n  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.\n  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.\n  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.\n\n- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _\n  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.\n  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.\n  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.\n\nBut note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.\n\nBut in our next guess, we can try to test for that.\n\nAlternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _\nExample: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.\n\nHowever, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- T at position 1: T O _ _ _\n  Options: \n    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)\n    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.\n    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.\n    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)\n    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.\n    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)\n    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)\n    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)\n    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.\n\n  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.\n\n- T at position 3: _ O T _ _\n  Options:\n    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)\n    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.\n    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n    FOTCH -> not a word.\n    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.\n    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.\n    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.\n    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.\n    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.\n    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.\n    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.\n    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.\n    WOTHY -> not a word.\n    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.\n\n  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.\n\n- T at position 4: _ O _ T _\n  Options:\n    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.\n    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.\n    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.\n    DOUTY -> not a word.\n    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.\n    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.\n    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.\n    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.\n    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.\n    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.\n    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.\n    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.\n    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.\n    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.\n    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.\n\n  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.\n\nNow, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.\n\nAlso, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.\n\nLet's list the candidate words we have:\n\n- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.\n- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.\n- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.\n- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.\n- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.\n\nWe want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.\n\nAmong the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.\n\nWe also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.\n\nCommon letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).\n\nH and L are more common than F and G.\n\nSo HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).\n\nHOTLY has H and L, which are very common.\n\nAlso, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.\n\nSimilarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.\n\nWe don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.\n\nBut note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.\n\nWe have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.\n\nIn HOTLY, we test T at position 3.\n\nIn TOUGH, we test T at position 1.\n\nIn LOFTY, we test T at position 4.\n\nIn POUTY, we test T at position 4.\n\nWe might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.\n\nAll our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.\n\nSo let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.\n\nAlternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.\n\nBut H is common to both.\n\nWe can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.\n\nIn all our candidates, T is not at position 5.\n\nNow, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.\n\nSimilarly, TOUGH is valid.\n\nBut note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:\n\n- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.\n- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.\n\nAnother word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.\n\nSimilarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).\n\nSo HOTLY is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.\n\nBOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.\n\nGOTHY? Not a word.\n\nSo HOTLY seems good.\n\nWe could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.\n\nBut HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.\n\nIn English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... \n\nBut we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.\n\nSo excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nMost common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.\n\nSo L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.\n\nHOTLY has H, L, Y.\n\nLOFTY has L, F, Y.\n\nPOUTY has P, U, Y.\n\nTOUGH has U, G, H.\n\nAll are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.\n\nAlso, Y is less common, but it's included.\n\nAnother word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.\n\nIn DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.\n\nSo DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.\n\nAnother word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.\n\nHOTLY seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo I'll go with HOTLY.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is HOTLY.\n\nOutput: <guess>HOTLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  \n  → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  \n- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Feedback:  \n  - M✗ (absent),  \n  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  \n  - I✗ (absent),  \n  - S✗ (absent),  \n  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  \n  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  \n  → **Confirmed**:  \n    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  \n    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  \n\n### Current Constraints:\n1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  \n2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  \n3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  \n4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  \n- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  \n- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  \n\n### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**\n- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  \n- **Why HOTLY?**  \n  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  \n  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.\n\n<guess>HOTLY</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""We are on the fourth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.\n\n**Summary of information:**\n\nFrom Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (MOIST):\n- M, I, S: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2)\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 3 (HOTLY):\n- H: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3? In HOTLY, T is at position 3, and it's marked as present but wrong position, meaning that T is in the word but not at position 3. So T is not at position 3 either.)\n- L: absent\n- Y: correct position (position 5)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y\n- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY) and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1 and 4, T must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have more absent letters: H and L are absent, so we add them to the exclusion list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T is present, but we are not sure of its position, and O and Y are fixed at positions 2 and 5).\n\nThe secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y\n\nT must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n- First character: either T or something else (if T is at position 4, then position 1 is a new letter)\n- Third character: a letter from the available set (since T cannot be at position 3, and we don't know if it's at 1 or 4, so position 3 must be a new letter unless T is at 1 and then position 3 is not T)\n- Fourth character: if T is not at position 4, then it must be a new letter, but if T is at position 4, then we put T there.\n\nBut note: we have to include T in the word because it's present.\n\nSo two cases:\n\nCase 1: T at position 1 -> word: T O _ _ Y\nCase 2: T at position 4 -> word: _ O _ T Y\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nLet's list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, Case 1: T at position 1 -> T O _ _ Y\n\nWe need to fill positions 3 and 4 with available letters (from B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z) and avoid excluded letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- TOXIC? But C and I are excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUGH? But G and H: H is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUCH? C and H excluded -> invalid.\n- TOFFY? T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated? And Y is at position 5, which is correct. But we have F at position 3 and 4? TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y. But F is repeated. Also, is TOFFY a word? It might be a proper noun or rare, but let's consider. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for more information.\n- TOPPY? T, O, P, P, Y -> P repeated -> not ideal.\n- TOUZY? Not a common word.\n- TOWZY? Similarly, rare.\n- TOYON? But O at position 2 and then O again? T, O, Y, O, N? But N is excluded, and also pattern is T O _ _ Y, so third and fourth must be filled. TOYON: T, O, Y, O, N -> but Y is at position 3? We need position 5 to be Y, but in TOYON, position 5 is N. So not matching pattern.\n\nWe need the word to end with Y, so last letter is Y.\n\nSo T O ? ? Y\n\nPossible:\n- TODAY? T, O, D, A, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUCH? Invalid.\n- TOUGH? Invalid (H excluded).\n- TOLLY? T, O, L, L, Y -> but L is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated. But F is available. Is TOFFY valid? It means covered with toffee or something, but it's an adjective. We can consider.\n- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> U and Z are available. Is TOUZY a word? It might be an alternate spelling of tousy, meaning disheveled. But let's see if it's accepted.\n- TOWNY: T, O, W, N, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.\n- TOYON: doesn't fit pattern.\n\nAnother one: TOUZY? T, O, U, Z, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:Z, 5:Y. This seems possible if TOUZY is accepted.\n\nBut let's check if there are better options.\n\nCase 2: T at position 4 -> _ O _ T Y\n\nPattern: ? O ? T Y\n\nPosition 1 and 3 to be filled with available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BOTTY? B, O, T, T, Y -> but T repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, B is available. But BOTTY might not be common; it's informal for bottom.\n- COTTY? C excluded -> invalid.\n- DOTTY: D, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. D and Y available. DOTTY is a valid word.\n- FOTTY? Not a word.\n- GOTTY? Not a word.\n- JOTTY? J, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. JOTTY might be a word (a type of pier), but rare.\n- POTTED? 6 letters.\n- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. POTTY is valid.\n- PUTTY: P, U, T, T, Y -> T repeated. PUTTY is valid.\n- WATTY? W, A, T, T, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\nBut all these have repeated T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But in previous feedback, we only had one T indicated, but it could be that there are two. However, to avoid repetition, we might prefer a word without repetition if possible.\n\nIs there a word with T at position 4 and no repeated T? For example, with distinct letters.\n\n- DOUTY? Not a word.\n- FOUTY? Not a word.\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> no repeated letters. POUTY is a valid word (sulky). And it fits: position 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.\n- BOUTY? Not a word.\n- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> valid (relating to gout). Pattern: G O U T Y.\n- WOUTY? Not a word.\n\nSo possible words for case 2: POUTY, GOUTY, and also the repeated T words like DOTTY, POTTY, PUTTY.\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess. We have two cases for T position.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests one of the cases and also introduces new letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we need to be efficient.\n\nWe know that T is either at position 1 or 4.\n\nIf we choose a word with T at position 1, we can test that case. Similarly for position 4.\n\nBut we also have to consider the feedback from the new guess.\n\nLet's list the candidate words:\n\nFor T at position 1:\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only test F and nothing else for positions 3 and 4. Not ideal.\n- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> tests U and Z, which are new. But Z is rare. And TOUZY might not be in the word list.\n\nFor T at position 4:\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P and U, both new and common.\n- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> tests G and U.\n\nWe also have the word from case 2 without repetition: POUTY and GOUTY.\n\nPOUTY and GOUTY are both valid and test two new letters each.\n\nBut in POUTY, we have U at position 3, and in GOUTY, U at position 3 as well.\n\nWe also have to consider that Y is fixed at position 5, so we don't get new info about Y.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider if there is a word that tests position 1 with a new letter and has T at position 4.\n\nFor example, in case 2, we have POUTY: position 1 is P, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, GOUTY: position 1 is G, new.\n\nBut we don't have a word for case 1 that is common and tests two new letters without repetition. TOUZY is marginal.\n\nAnother word for case 1: TOWDY? Not a word.\n\nTOWZY: variant of TOUSY, same as TOUZY.\n\nPerhaps we should go with POUTY or GOUTY.\n\nBut note: in the previous guess, we had HOTLY which had T at position 3 and it was wrong, so T is not at 3.\n\nNow, if we choose POUTY, which has T at position 4, we are testing that T is at position 4.\n\nIf it is, then we might get T correct, and also we test P and U.\n\nIf not, then T must be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, we test that.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nSince POUTY is a common word, let's consider it.\n\nBut we also have the feedback from HOTLY: Y is correct at position 5, so we know that.\n\nAnother thing: in POUTY, the pattern is P O U T Y.\n\nIf the secret word has T at position 4, then in POUTY, T would be correct, and we get feedback accordingly.\n\nIf not, then T is at position 1, and we know that.\n\nMoreover, we test P and U.\n\nSimilarly, GOUTY tests G and U.\n\nWhich is better? P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.\n\nBut let's see the available letters.\n\nWe have to avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L.\n\nAvailable: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.\n\nCommon ones: P, U, D, F, G, B, etc.\n\nPOUTY: tests P and U.\n\nGOUTY: tests G and U.\n\nBoth test U, so the difference is P vs G.\n\nP is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.\n\nBut we also have to consider that if T is at position 1, then POUTY would have T at position 4 which is wrong, so we get T marked as present but wrong position (since it's in the word but not at 4, and we know it must be at 1).\n\nSimilarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, like TOUZY, we test U and Z.\n\nBut Z is rare, so not ideal.\n\nAnother word for case 1: TUPIK? Not 5 letters.\n\nTOYON? Not matching pattern.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that doesn't assume T position but includes T and the fixed O and Y.\n\nBut we have to include T, and we know it's at 1 or 4.\n\nWe can choose a word that has T at position 1 and new letters, or at position 4.\n\nBut TOUZY is not great.\n\nWhat about DOUBT? But T at position 5, which we know is wrong, so we avoid.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T at position 4 and also tests new letters, like POUTY.\n\nBut let's see if there is a word with T at position 1 and common letters.\n\nTOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only learn about F, and if F is present or not. But since repeated, if F is present, we might not know how many, etc. Not efficient.\n\nTOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z. W is common, Z is rare. But TOWZY might not be in the word list.\n\nI think POUTY is a safer choice.\n\nMoreover, POUTY was considered earlier as a candidate.\n\nSo I'll go with POUTY.\n\nTherefore, the fourth guess is POUTY.\n\nBut let's confirm the pattern: P O U T Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\nYes.\n\nIf the secret word has T at position 4, then T will be correct, and we get feedback on P and U.\n\nIf not, then T is at position 1, and we know that, and we get feedback on P and U.\n\nEither way, we learn about P and U.\n\nAnd we have two guesses left.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\n<guess>POUTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Feedback Summary**:\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  \n     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.\n   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:\n     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).\n     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).\n     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).\n     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  \n     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).\n   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:\n     - H✗, L✗ (absent).\n     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).\n     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).\n     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).\n     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  \n     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (now only positions 1 or 4 possible).\n\n2. **Current Constraints**:\n   - **Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y` (O at position 2, Y at position 5).\n   - **T position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be at 3 or 5).\n   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L (avoid these).\n   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n   - **T must be included** in the guess (since it is confirmed present).\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:\n   - **Goal**: Test the two possible positions for T (1 or 4) while maximizing new letter coverage.\n   - **Prioritize**:\n     - Testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, U, D, F, G).\n     - Avoiding repeated letters to gather more information.\n   - **Candidate words**:\n     - **T at position 1**: Words like `T O _ _ Y` (e.g., TOFFY, TOUZY).

We are on the fifth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H, L: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3)
- Y: correct position (position 5)

From Guess 4 (POUTY):
- P, U: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 4)
- Y: correct position (position 5) [already known]

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY), not at position 4 (from POUTY), and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1, and we have only position 1 left, T must be at position 1.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: Y
- T is present but not at 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, T must be at position 1.

So the secret word must start with T, then O, then ?, then ?, then Y. Pattern: T O ? ? Y

Additionally, we have absent letters: from all guesses, absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.

So excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T, O, Y are present, but O and Y are fixed, and T is now fixed at position 1).

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two letters from the available set.

The word is T O _ _ Y

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

Possible words:

- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated. And F is available. Is TOFFY valid? Yes, meaning like covered with toffee or sweet.
- TOGAY? Not a word.
- TOGAE? But E is excluded -> invalid.
- TOKAY: T, O, K, A, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.
- TOMBY? M excluded -> invalid.
- TONKY? N excluded -> invalid.
- TOPPY? P excluded -> invalid.
- TORGY? R excluded -> invalid.
- TOUZY? U excluded -> invalid.
- TOWDY? W, D, Y -> T, O, W, D, Y? But we need two letters for positions 3 and 4. TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y. W and D are available. Is TOWDY a word? It might be a surname or rare, but let's see.
- TOYON? O at position 2 and then Y at position 3? But we need position 5 to be Y, so not matching.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated.
- TOXIN? X, I, N -> I and N excluded -> invalid.
- TOZED? Not a word.

Another one: TOWZY? T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z available. TOWZY is a variant of TOUSY, meaning disheveled. But might be accepted.

But let's list all possible:

- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y
- TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y
- TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y
- TOGGY? Not a word.
- TOVBY? Not a word.
- TOXIC? C and I excluded.
- JOWLY? But J at position 1? No, pattern is T O _ _ Y.

We need the word to start with T and O.

Another word: TODDY? T, O, D, D, Y -> D repeated. But D is available. TODDY is a word (a drink). Pattern: T O D D Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So it fits.

Similarly, DOGGY? But doesn't start with T.

So possible words: TOFFY, TOWDY, TOWZY, TODDY.

But TODDY has repeated D, TOFFY has repeated F.

TOWDY and TOWZY have distinct letters.

TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> tests W and D.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> tests W and Z.

Since Z is less common, TOWDY might be better.

But we need to choose one.

We have two positions to fill, and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We can test two of them.

In TOWDY, we test W and D.

In TOFFY, we test F (but repeated, so only one new letter effectively).

In TODDY, we test D (repeated).

So TOWDY is better because it tests two distinct new letters: W and D.

Similarly, TOWZY tests W and Z, but Z is rare.

So TOWDY is preferable.

Is TOWDY a valid word? It might be a surname or a rare word, but let's assume it's acceptable. Alternatively, we can check if there are more common words.

Another word: TOUGH? But U and H excluded -> invalid.

GODLY? Doesn't start with T.

BOWDY? Not a word.

Perhaps TOXIC is invalid.

Another possibility: TOYED? E excluded.

So TOWDY seems a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word like TOVAY? Not a word.

TOWZY is also possible.

But D is more common than Z, so TOWDY might be better for testing.

We have only two guesses left, so we need to make progress.

Since we know the pattern is T O ? ? Y, and we have to fill two letters, we can choose TOWDY.

If TOWDY is not the word, we get feedback on W and D.

Similarly, we could choose TOFFY, but with repeated F, if F is present, we don't know if it's one or two, but since we have only one spot, it might be confusing.

For example, if we guess TOFFY and the secret word has one F, then the feedback might show one F as present and one as absent? But in Wordle-style feedback, for repeated letters, it can be tricky.

But to avoid complexity, we should prefer distinct letters.

Therefore, TOWDY is a good choice.

But let me confirm: TOWDY is a word? It can be a variant of ""towdie"" or a surname, but it might not be in the word list. We need a common word.

Another word: TODDY is more common, but it has repeated D.

TOFFY is also common.

But in TODDY, we have repeated D, so if the secret word has only one D, we might get mixed feedback.

For example, if the secret word has D at position 3 but not 4, then in TODDY, position 3 D might be correct or present, and position 4 D absent.

But it's messy.

Similarly for TOFFY.

So to maximize information, we should use distinct letters.

Is there a word with distinct available letters?

For example, T O W D Y -> TOWDY, as above.

T O G D Y? Not a word.

T O B D Y? Not a word.

T O F G Y? TOFGY? Not a word.

T O W B Y? TOWBY? Not a word.

T O K A Y? A excluded.

So TOWDY might be the best we have.

Another one: TOVEX? Not 5 letters ending with Y.

Perhaps we can use a word like TYPAL, but doesn't start with T O.

I think TOWDY is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess TOWDY, and the secret word is, say, TODDY, then we get feedback: T(✓), O(✓), W(x), D(-), Y(✓) or something, but we don't know.

But we have to choose.

Perhaps TOFFY is more common.

TOFFY is a valid word, meaning a type of candy.

But it has repeated F.

To avoid repetition, let's go with TOWDY.

But I found another word: TOADY? T, O, A, D, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

So I think TOWDY is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, the fifth guess is TOWDY.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (✗).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:
     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:
     - H✗, L✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).
     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (positions 1 or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 4 (POUTY)**:
     - P✗, U✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 4**).
     - Y✓ (confirmed at position 5).
     → **Eliminated letters**: P, U.  
     → **Inferred**: T cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5 → **T must be at position 1**.  
     → **Full pattern**: `T O _ _ Y`.

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `T O _ _ Y` (T at position 1, O at 2, Y at 5).
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U (avoid these).
   - **Available letters for positions 3–4**: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Focus on testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., D, F, W, G) in positions 3 and 4.
     - Prioritize words with **distinct new letters** to maximize information.
     - Avoid eliminated letters and repeated characters.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - **Candidate words** fitting `T O _ _ Y`:
     - `TOWDY` (T, O, W, D, Y): Tests W (position 3) and D (position 4), both high-frequency and untested.
     - `TOFFY` (T, O, F, F, Y): Tests F but repeats it, reducing information gain.
     - `TOWZY` (T, O, W, Z, Y): Tests W and Z, but Z is low-frequency.
     - `TODDY` (T, O, D, D, Y): Tests D but repeats it.
   - **Why TOWDY?**:
     - Tests **W** and **D** (distinct, common letters).
     - If incorrect, feedback on W/D will reveal their presence/absence and positions, leaving only 1–2 possible words for the final guess.
     - More efficient than options with repeats (e.g., TOFFY, TODDY) or rare letters (e.g., TOWZY).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   `TOWDY` efficiently tests the remaining unknown positions (3 and 4) while adhering to all constraints. It maximizes information gain for the penultimate guess.

<guess>TOWDY</guess>",TOWDY,"We are on the fifth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H, L: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3)
- Y: correct position (position 5)

From Guess 4 (POUTY):
- P, U: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 4)
- Y: correct position (position 5) [already known]

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY), not at position 4 (from POUTY), and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1, and we have only position 1 left, T must be at position 1.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: Y
- T is present but not at 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, T must be at position 1.

So the secret word must start with T, then O, then ?, then ?, then Y. Pattern: T O ? ? Y

Additionally, we have absent letters: from all guesses, absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.

So excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T, O, Y are present, but O and Y are fixed, and T is now fixed at position 1).

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two letters from the available set.

The word is T O _ _ Y

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

Possible words:

- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated. And F is available. Is TOFFY valid? Yes, meaning like covered with toffee or sweet.
- TOGAY? Not a word.
- TOGAE? But E is excluded -> invalid.
- TOKAY: T, O, K, A, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.
- TOMBY? M excluded -> invalid.
- TONKY? N excluded -> invalid.
- TOPPY? P excluded -> invalid.
- TORGY? R excluded -> invalid.
- TOUZY? U excluded -> invalid.
- TOWDY? W, D, Y -> T, O, W, D, Y? But we need two letters for positions 3 and 4. TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y. W and D are available. Is TOWDY a word? It might be a surname or rare, but let's see.
- TOYON? O at position 2 and then Y at position 3? But we need position 5 to be Y, so not matching.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated.
- TOXIN? X, I, N -> I and N excluded -> invalid.
- TOZED? Not a word.

Another one: TOWZY? T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z available. TOWZY is a variant of TOUSY, meaning disheveled. But might be accepted.

But let's list all possible:

- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y
- TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y
- TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y
- TOGGY? Not a word.
- TOVBY? Not a word.
- TOXIC? C and I excluded.
- JOWLY? But J at position 1? No, pattern is T O _ _ Y.

We need the word to start with T and O.

Another word: TODDY? T, O, D, D, Y -> D repeated. But D is available. TODDY is a word (a drink). Pattern: T O D D Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So it fits.

Similarly, DOGGY? But doesn't start with T.

So possible words: TOFFY, TOWDY, TOWZY, TODDY.

But TODDY has repeated D, TOFFY has repeated F.

TOWDY and TOWZY have distinct letters.

TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> tests W and D.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> tests W and Z.

Since Z is less common, TOWDY might be better.

But we need to choose one.

We have two positions to fill, and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We can test two of them.

In TOWDY, we test W and D.

In TOFFY, we test F (but repeated, so only one new letter effectively).

In TODDY, we test D (repeated).

So TOWDY is better because it tests two distinct new letters: W and D.

Similarly, TOWZY tests W and Z, but Z is rare.

So TOWDY is preferable.

Is TOWDY a valid word? It might be a surname or a rare word, but let's assume it's acceptable. Alternatively, we can check if there are more common words.

Another word: TOUGH? But U and H excluded -> invalid.

GODLY? Doesn't start with T.

BOWDY? Not a word.

Perhaps TOXIC is invalid.

Another possibility: TOYED? E excluded.

So TOWDY seems a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word like TOVAY? Not a word.

TOWZY is also possible.

But D is more common than Z, so TOWDY might be better for testing.

We have only two guesses left, so we need to make progress.

Since we know the pattern is T O ? ? Y, and we have to fill two letters, we can choose TOWDY.

If TOWDY is not the word, we get feedback on W and D.

Similarly, we could choose TOFFY, but with repeated F, if F is present, we don't know if it's one or two, but since we have only one spot, it might be confusing.

For example, if we guess TOFFY and the secret word has one F, then the feedback might show one F as present and one as absent? But in Wordle-style feedback, for repeated letters, it can be tricky.

But to avoid complexity, we should prefer distinct letters.

Therefore, TOWDY is a good choice.

But let me confirm: TOWDY is a word? It can be a variant of ""towdie"" or a surname, but it might not be in the word list. We need a common word.

Another word: TODDY is more common, but it has repeated D.

TOFFY is also common.

But in TODDY, we have repeated D, so if the secret word has only one D, we might get mixed feedback.

For example, if the secret word has D at position 3 but not 4, then in TODDY, position 3 D might be correct or present, and position 4 D absent.

But it's messy.

Similarly for TOFFY.

So to maximize information, we should use distinct letters.

Is there a word with distinct available letters?

For example, T O W D Y -> TOWDY, as above.

T O G D Y? Not a word.

T O B D Y? Not a word.

T O F G Y? TOFGY? Not a word.

T O W B Y? TOWBY? Not a word.

T O K A Y? A excluded.

So TOWDY might be the best we have.

Another one: TOVEX? Not 5 letters ending with Y.

Perhaps we can use a word like TYPAL, but doesn't start with T O.

I think TOWDY is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess TOWDY, and the secret word is, say, TODDY, then we get feedback: T(✓), O(✓), W(x), D(-), Y(✓) or something, but we don't know.

But we have to choose.

Perhaps TOFFY is more common.

TOFFY is a valid word, meaning a type of candy.

But it has repeated F.

To avoid repetition, let's go with TOWDY.

But I found another word: TOADY? T, O, A, D, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

So I think TOWDY is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, the fifth guess is TOWDY.

<guess>TOWDY</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (✗).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:
     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:
     - H✗, L✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).
     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (positions 1 or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 4 (POUTY)**:
     - P✗, U✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 4**).
     - Y✓ (confirmed at position 5).
     → **Eliminated letters**: P, U.  
     → **Inferred**: T cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5 → **T must be at position 1**.  
     → **Full pattern**: `T O _ _ Y`.

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `T O _ _ Y` (T at position 1, O at 2, Y at 5).
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U (avoid these).
   - **Available letters for positions 3–4**: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Focus on testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., D, F, W, G) in positions 3 and 4.
     - Prioritize words with **distinct new letters** to maximize information.
     - Avoid eliminated letters and repeated characters.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - **Candidate words** fitting `T O _ _ Y`:
     - `TOWDY` (T, O, W, D, Y): Tests W (position 3) and D (position 4), both high-frequency and untested.
     - `TOFFY` (T, O, F, F, Y): Tests F but repeats it, reducing information gain.
     - `TOWZY` (T, O, W, Z, Y): Tests W and Z, but Z is low-frequency.
     - `TODDY` (T, O, D, D, Y): Tests D but repeats it.
   - **Why TOWDY?**:
     - Tests **W** and **D** (distinct, common letters).
     - If incorrect, feedback on W/D will reveal their presence/absence and positions, leaving only 1–2 possible words for the final guess.
     - More efficient than options with repeats (e.g., TOFFY, TODDY) or rare letters (e.g., TOWZY).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   `TOWDY` efficiently tests the remaining unknown positions (3 and 4) while adhering to all constraints. It maximizes information gain for the penultimate guess.",Guess 5: TOWDY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) W(x) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,toddy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information. Ideally, we use a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words are ones that have often occurring letters in English and avoid repeated letters.
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me consider:
 - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E — these are fairly common. It doesn't have repeated letters.
 - Also, ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E — also common letters.

 How about ""RAISE""? It has R, A, I, S, E — also common.

 Since both are good, I can pick one arbitrarily. Let me pick ""CRANE"".

 But note: The instructions don't reveal the word list. So we have to stick to valid English words.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as an initial guess.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: CRANE

 Let me output it in the required format.For the first guess, I need to pick a word that maximizes information gathering. A good starting word should include commonly used vowels and consonants to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or their positions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:

- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are among the most frequently used letters.
- The consonants (C, R, N) are also common in English 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing for efficient testing of five different characters.
- It has been statistically proven to be a strong opener in word games.

This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly, regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making our second guess. We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked as 'x', meaning none of them are in the secret word.

 Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are in the secret word, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Our next guess should also be a 5-letter English word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We must choose a word with other common letters. Let's list common letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}:
 Vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are already excluded)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 We can aim for a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters: e.g., S, T, L, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded set? (excluded are C,R,A,N,E) — so S, L, O, T, H are allowed.

 Alternatively, consider other words:
 - ""POUCH"": but P, O, U, C, H — C is excluded! We cannot use C. So invalid.
 - ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. This is a valid word.

 However, ""SLOTH"" seems better because it has common letters: S, T are very common.

 Another common starting word is ""QUERY"", but that has Q (rare), U, E (excluded), R (excluded), Y — so not good.

 How about ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S? No C,R,A,N,E.

 But note: We are looking for a word without the excluded letters.

 Other possibilities: ""SPILT"", ""STOMP"", ""GUSTY"", etc.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover new common letters.

 ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be too obscure.

 A good word: ""MOIST"" — M, O, I, S, T — no C,R,A,N,E? Yes. It uses common letters.

 How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.

 I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.

 However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.

 Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.

 Considering frequency of letters:
 After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".

 Output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters. For the next guess:

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.  
   → Must avoid using any of these letters in the next guess.
   
2. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Choose a valid 5-letter English word using only **untested letters** to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, M, P, Y, H, B, U).  
   - Aim for high-frequency consonants and vowels: **S**, **T**, **O**, and **I** are among the most common untested letters.  

3. **Word selection**:  
   - Ideal options include words like **MOIST** (letters: M, O, I, S, T) or **POULT** (P, O, U, L, T).  
   - **MOIST** is particularly strong because:  
     → It covers four high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and one vowel (O, I), ensuring broad coverage.  
     → All letters are distinct and untested, minimizing redundancy.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - **MOIST** efficiently tests new letters while adhering to feedback constraints.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

So, from MOIST:
- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).
- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.
- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).

The remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _

We know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _
  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.
  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.

- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.
  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.
  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.

But note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.

However, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.

But in our next guess, we can try to test for that.

Alternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _
Example: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.

However, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Possible words:

- T at position 1: T O _ _ _
  Options: 
    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.
    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.
    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)
    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.
    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)
    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)
    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)
    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.

  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.

- T at position 3: _ O T _ _
  Options:
    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)
    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.
    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
    FOTCH -> not a word.
    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.
    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.
    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.
    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.
    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.
    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.
    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.
    WOTHY -> not a word.
    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.

  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.

- T at position 4: _ O _ T _
  Options:
    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.
    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.
    DOUTY -> not a word.
    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.
    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.
    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.
    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.
    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.
    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.
    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.
    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.
    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.
    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.
    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.

  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.

Now, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

Also, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.

Let's list the candidate words we have:

- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.
- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.
- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.
- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.

We want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.

Among the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.

We also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.

Common letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).

H and L are more common than F and G.

So HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).

HOTLY has H and L, which are very common.

Also, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.

Similarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.

We don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

We have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.

We haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.

In HOTLY, we test T at position 3.

In TOUGH, we test T at position 1.

In LOFTY, we test T at position 4.

In POUTY, we test T at position 4.

We might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.

All our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.

So let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.

Alternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.

But H is common to both.

We can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.

In all our candidates, T is not at position 5.

Now, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.

Similarly, TOUGH is valid.

But note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:

- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.
- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.
- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.

All good.

I think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.

Alternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.

Another word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).

So HOTLY is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.

BOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.

GOTHY? Not a word.

So HOTLY seems good.

We could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.

But HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.

In English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... 

But we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.

So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Most common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.

So L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.

HOTLY has H, L, Y.

LOFTY has L, F, Y.

POUTY has P, U, Y.

TOUGH has U, G, H.

All are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.

Also, Y is less common, but it's included.

Another word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.

In DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.

Similarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.

So DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.

Another word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.

HOTLY seems fine.

But let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word? Yes.

So I'll go with HOTLY.

Therefore, the third guess is HOTLY.

  - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**),  
  - I✗ (absent),  
  - S✗ (absent),  
  - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).  
  → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
  → **Confirmed**:  
    - Secret word has **O as the 2nd letter** (pattern: `_ O _ _ _`).  
    - Secret word contains **T**, but **not at position 5** (so T must be at position 1, 3, or 4).  

### Current Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
2. **Must include T** (position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (avoid these).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize** testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L, D, P, U, G) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid** placing T at position 5 (known incorrect) and repeated letters (to test more new letters).  
- **Strong candidates** must fit `_ O _ _ _`, include T (at 1/3/4), and use untested letters.  

### Selected Guess: **HOTLY**
- **Word breakdown**: H (position 1), O (position 2, fixed), T (position 3), L (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Why HOTLY?**  
  - Tests **T at position 3** (a possible location per constraints).  
  - Introduces **three new common letters**: H, L, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and repeats (all letters distinct).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H, L, Y, and T's position will significantly narrow possibilities.

<guess>HOTLY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
Guess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the fourth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3? In HOTLY, T is at position 3, and it's marked as present but wrong position, meaning that T is in the word but not at position 3. So T is not at position 3 either.)
- L: absent
- Y: correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY) and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1 and 4, T must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, we have more absent letters: H and L are absent, so we add them to the exclusion list.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T is present, but we are not sure of its position, and O and Y are fixed at positions 2 and 5).

The secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

T must be at position 1 or 4.

We need to form a word that:
- First character: either T or something else (if T is at position 4, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Third character: a letter from the available set (since T cannot be at position 3, and we don't know if it's at 1 or 4, so position 3 must be a new letter unless T is at 1 and then position 3 is not T)
- Fourth character: if T is not at position 4, then it must be a new letter, but if T is at position 4, then we put T there.

But note: we have to include T in the word because it's present.

So two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1 -> word: T O _ _ Y
Case 2: T at position 4 -> word: _ O _ T Y

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Case 1: T at position 1 -> T O _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with available letters (from B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z) and avoid excluded letters.

Possible words:
- TOXIC? But C and I are excluded -> invalid.
- TOUGH? But G and H: H is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? C and H excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY? T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated? And Y is at position 5, which is correct. But we have F at position 3 and 4? TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y. But F is repeated. Also, is TOFFY a word? It might be a proper noun or rare, but let's consider. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for more information.
- TOPPY? T, O, P, P, Y -> P repeated -> not ideal.
- TOUZY? Not a common word.
- TOWZY? Similarly, rare.
- TOYON? But O at position 2 and then O again? T, O, Y, O, N? But N is excluded, and also pattern is T O _ _ Y, so third and fourth must be filled. TOYON: T, O, Y, O, N -> but Y is at position 3? We need position 5 to be Y, but in TOYON, position 5 is N. So not matching pattern.

We need the word to end with Y, so last letter is Y.

So T O ? ? Y

Possible:
- TODAY? T, O, D, A, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
- TOUCH? Invalid.
- TOUGH? Invalid (H excluded).
- TOLLY? T, O, L, L, Y -> but L is excluded -> invalid.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated. But F is available. Is TOFFY valid? It means covered with toffee or something, but it's an adjective. We can consider.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> U and Z are available. Is TOUZY a word? It might be an alternate spelling of tousy, meaning disheveled. But let's see if it's accepted.
- TOWNY: T, O, W, N, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
- TOYON: doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TOUZY? T, O, U, Z, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:Z, 5:Y. This seems possible if TOUZY is accepted.

But let's check if there are better options.

Case 2: T at position 4 -> _ O _ T Y

Pattern: ? O ? T Y

Position 1 and 3 to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- BOTTY? B, O, T, T, Y -> but T repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, B is available. But BOTTY might not be common; it's informal for bottom.
- COTTY? C excluded -> invalid.
- DOTTY: D, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. D and Y available. DOTTY is a valid word.
- FOTTY? Not a word.
- GOTTY? Not a word.
- JOTTY? J, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. JOTTY might be a word (a type of pier), but rare.
- POTTED? 6 letters.
- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. POTTY is valid.
- PUTTY: P, U, T, T, Y -> T repeated. PUTTY is valid.
- WATTY? W, A, T, T, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

But all these have repeated T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But in previous feedback, we only had one T indicated, but it could be that there are two. However, to avoid repetition, we might prefer a word without repetition if possible.

Is there a word with T at position 4 and no repeated T? For example, with distinct letters.

- DOUTY? Not a word.
- FOUTY? Not a word.
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> no repeated letters. POUTY is a valid word (sulky). And it fits: position 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.
- BOUTY? Not a word.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> valid (relating to gout). Pattern: G O U T Y.
- WOUTY? Not a word.

So possible words for case 2: POUTY, GOUTY, and also the repeated T words like DOTTY, POTTY, PUTTY.

Now, we need to choose a guess. We have two cases for T position.

We can choose a word that tests one of the cases and also introduces new letters.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we need to be efficient.

We know that T is either at position 1 or 4.

If we choose a word with T at position 1, we can test that case. Similarly for position 4.

But we also have to consider the feedback from the new guess.

Let's list the candidate words:

For T at position 1:
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only test F and nothing else for positions 3 and 4. Not ideal.
- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> tests U and Z, which are new. But Z is rare. And TOUZY might not be in the word list.

For T at position 4:
- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P and U, both new and common.
- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> tests G and U.

We also have the word from case 2 without repetition: POUTY and GOUTY.

POUTY and GOUTY are both valid and test two new letters each.

But in POUTY, we have U at position 3, and in GOUTY, U at position 3 as well.

We also have to consider that Y is fixed at position 5, so we don't get new info about Y.

Now, which one to choose?

We can also consider if there is a word that tests position 1 with a new letter and has T at position 4.

For example, in case 2, we have POUTY: position 1 is P, which is new.

Similarly, GOUTY: position 1 is G, new.

But we don't have a word for case 1 that is common and tests two new letters without repetition. TOUZY is marginal.

Another word for case 1: TOWDY? Not a word.

TOWZY: variant of TOUSY, same as TOUZY.

Perhaps we should go with POUTY or GOUTY.

But note: in the previous guess, we had HOTLY which had T at position 3 and it was wrong, so T is not at 3.

Now, if we choose POUTY, which has T at position 4, we are testing that T is at position 4.

If it is, then we might get T correct, and also we test P and U.

If not, then T must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, we test that.

But we have to make a guess.

Since POUTY is a common word, let's consider it.

But we also have the feedback from HOTLY: Y is correct at position 5, so we know that.

Another thing: in POUTY, the pattern is P O U T Y.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then in POUTY, T would be correct, and we get feedback accordingly.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that.

Moreover, we test P and U.

Similarly, GOUTY tests G and U.

Which is better? P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But let's see the available letters.

We have to avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common ones: P, U, D, F, G, B, etc.

POUTY: tests P and U.

GOUTY: tests G and U.

Both test U, so the difference is P vs G.

P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.

But we also have to consider that if T is at position 1, then POUTY would have T at position 4 which is wrong, so we get T marked as present but wrong position (since it's in the word but not at 4, and we know it must be at 1).

Similarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, like TOUZY, we test U and Z.

But Z is rare, so not ideal.

Another word for case 1: TUPIK? Not 5 letters.

TOYON? Not matching pattern.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't assume T position but includes T and the fixed O and Y.

But we have to include T, and we know it's at 1 or 4.

We can choose a word that has T at position 1 and new letters, or at position 4.

But TOUZY is not great.

What about DOUBT? But T at position 5, which we know is wrong, so we avoid.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T at position 4 and also tests new letters, like POUTY.

But let's see if there is a word with T at position 1 and common letters.

TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only learn about F, and if F is present or not. But since repeated, if F is present, we might not know how many, etc. Not efficient.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z. W is common, Z is rare. But TOWZY might not be in the word list.

I think POUTY is a safer choice.

Moreover, POUTY was considered earlier as a candidate.

So I'll go with POUTY.

Therefore, the fourth guess is POUTY.

But let's confirm the pattern: P O U T Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.

Yes.

If the secret word has T at position 4, then T will be correct, and we get feedback on P and U.

If not, then T is at position 1, and we know that, and we get feedback on P and U.

Either way, we learn about P and U.

And we have two guesses left.

So it's acceptable.

<guess>POUTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:
     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).
   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:
     - H✗, L✗ (absent).
     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).
     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).
     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).
     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  
     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (now only positions 1 or 4 possible).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y` (O at position 2, Y at position 5).
   - **T position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be at 3 or 5).
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L (avoid these).
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **T must be included** in the guess (since it is confirmed present).

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Goal**: Test the two possible positions for T (1 or 4) while maximizing new letter coverage.
   - **Prioritize**:
     - Testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, U, D, F, G).
     - Avoiding repeated letters to gather more information.
   - **Candidate words**:
     - **T at position 1**: Words like `T O _ _ Y` (e.g., TOFFY, TOUZY). However, TOFFY has repeated F, reducing information, and TOUZY uses rare letters (Z).
     - **T at position 4**: Words like `_ O _ T Y` (e.g., POUTY, GOUTY). POUTY (P, O, U, T, Y) is ideal:
       - Tests T at position 4 (a possible location).
       - Introduces **P** and **U** (high-frequency untested letters).
       - All letters distinct, maximizing information.
   - **Why POUTY?**:
     - If T is at position 4, feedback will confirm its position.
     - If T is not at position 4, it must be at position 1 (narrowing options for future guesses).
     - Feedback on P and U will help identify their presence/absence, significantly reducing possibilities.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   POUTY efficiently tests the critical T position while probing new common letters, aligning with the goal of narrowing down the solution space.

<guess>POUTY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
Guess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: POUTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the fifth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

**Summary of information:**

From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.

From Guess 2 (MOIST):
- M, I, S: absent
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

From Guess 3 (HOTLY):
- H, L: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3)
- Y: correct position (position 5)

From Guess 4 (POUTY):
- P, U: absent
- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]
- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 4)
- Y: correct position (position 5) [already known]

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY), not at position 4 (from POUTY), and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1, and we have only position 1 left, T must be at position 1.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: Y
- T is present but not at 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, T must be at position 1.

So the secret word must start with T, then O, then ?, then ?, then Y. Pattern: T O ? ? Y

Additionally, we have absent letters: from all guesses, absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.

So excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T, O, Y are present, but O and Y are fixed, and T is now fixed at position 1).

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two letters from the available set.

The word is T O _ _ Y

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

Possible words:

- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated. And F is available. Is TOFFY valid? Yes, meaning like covered with toffee or sweet.
- TOGAY? Not a word.
- TOGAE? But E is excluded -> invalid.
- TOKAY: T, O, K, A, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.
- TOMBY? M excluded -> invalid.
- TONKY? N excluded -> invalid.
- TOPPY? P excluded -> invalid.
- TORGY? R excluded -> invalid.
- TOUZY? U excluded -> invalid.
- TOWDY? W, D, Y -> T, O, W, D, Y? But we need two letters for positions 3 and 4. TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y. W and D are available. Is TOWDY a word? It might be a surname or rare, but let's see.
- TOYON? O at position 2 and then Y at position 3? But we need position 5 to be Y, so not matching.
- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated.
- TOXIN? X, I, N -> I and N excluded -> invalid.
- TOZED? Not a word.

Another one: TOWZY? T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z available. TOWZY is a variant of TOUSY, meaning disheveled. But might be accepted.

But let's list all possible:

- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y
- TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y
- TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y
- TOGGY? Not a word.
- TOVBY? Not a word.
- TOXIC? C and I excluded.
- JOWLY? But J at position 1? No, pattern is T O _ _ Y.

We need the word to start with T and O.

Another word: TODDY? T, O, D, D, Y -> D repeated. But D is available. TODDY is a word (a drink). Pattern: T O D D Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So it fits.

Similarly, DOGGY? But doesn't start with T.

So possible words: TOFFY, TOWDY, TOWZY, TODDY.

But TODDY has repeated D, TOFFY has repeated F.

TOWDY and TOWZY have distinct letters.

TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> tests W and D.

TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> tests W and Z.

Since Z is less common, TOWDY might be better.

But we need to choose one.

We have two positions to fill, and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We can test two of them.

In TOWDY, we test W and D.

In TOFFY, we test F (but repeated, so only one new letter effectively).

In TODDY, we test D (repeated).

So TOWDY is better because it tests two distinct new letters: W and D.

Similarly, TOWZY tests W and Z, but Z is rare.

So TOWDY is preferable.

Is TOWDY a valid word? It might be a surname or a rare word, but let's assume it's acceptable. Alternatively, we can check if there are more common words.

Another word: TOUGH? But U and H excluded -> invalid.

GODLY? Doesn't start with T.

BOWDY? Not a word.

Perhaps TOXIC is invalid.

Another possibility: TOYED? E excluded.

So TOWDY seems a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word like TOVAY? Not a word.

TOWZY is also possible.

But D is more common than Z, so TOWDY might be better for testing.

We have only two guesses left, so we need to make progress.

Since we know the pattern is T O ? ? Y, and we have to fill two letters, we can choose TOWDY.

If TOWDY is not the word, we get feedback on W and D.

Similarly, we could choose TOFFY, but with repeated F, if F is present, we don't know if it's one or two, but since we have only one spot, it might be confusing.

For example, if we guess TOFFY and the secret word has one F, then the feedback might show one F as present and one as absent? But in Wordle-style feedback, for repeated letters, it can be tricky.

But to avoid complexity, we should prefer distinct letters.

Therefore, TOWDY is a good choice.

But let me confirm: TOWDY is a word? It can be a variant of ""towdie"" or a surname, but it might not be in the word list. We need a common word.

Another word: TODDY is more common, but it has repeated D.

TOFFY is also common.

But in TODDY, we have repeated D, so if the secret word has only one D, we might get mixed feedback.

For example, if the secret word has D at position 3 but not 4, then in TODDY, position 3 D might be correct or present, and position 4 D absent.

But it's messy.

Similarly for TOFFY.

So to maximize information, we should use distinct letters.

Is there a word with distinct available letters?

For example, T O W D Y -> TOWDY, as above.

T O G D Y? Not a word.

T O B D Y? Not a word.

T O F G Y? TOFGY? Not a word.

T O W B Y? TOWBY? Not a word.

T O K A Y? A excluded.

So TOWDY might be the best we have.

Another one: TOVEX? Not 5 letters ending with Y.

Perhaps we can use a word like TYPAL, but doesn't start with T O.

I think TOWDY is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess TOWDY, and the secret word is, say, TODDY, then we get feedback: T(✓), O(✓), W(x), D(-), Y(✓) or something, but we don't know.

But we have to choose.

Perhaps TOFFY is more common.

TOFFY is a valid word, meaning a type of candy.

But it has repeated F.

To avoid repetition, let's go with TOWDY.

But I found another word: TOADY? T, O, A, D, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

So I think TOWDY is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, the fifth guess is TOWDY.

   - **Available letters for positions 3–4**: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Focus on testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., D, F, W, G) in positions 3 and 4.
     - Prioritize words with **distinct new letters** to maximize information.
     - Avoid eliminated letters and repeated characters.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - **Candidate words** fitting `T O _ _ Y`:
     - `TOWDY` (T, O, W, D, Y): Tests W (position 3) and D (position 4), both high-frequency and untested.
     - `TOFFY` (T, O, F, F, Y): Tests F but repeats it, reducing information gain.
     - `TOWZY` (T, O, W, Z, Y): Tests W and Z, but Z is low-frequency.
     - `TODDY` (T, O, D, D, Y): Tests D but repeats it.
   - **Why TOWDY?**:
     - Tests **W** and **D** (distinct, common letters).
     - If incorrect, feedback on W/D will reveal their presence/absence and positions, leaving only 1–2 possible words for the final guess.
     - More efficient than options with repeats (e.g., TOFFY, TODDY) or rare letters (e.g., TOWZY).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   `TOWDY` efficiently tests the remaining unknown positions (3 and 4) while adhering to all constraints. It maximizes information gain for the penultimate guess.

Since it\'s the first guess, we don\'t have any prior feedback.\n We want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information. Ideally, we use a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n Common starting words are ones that have often occurring letters in English and avoid repeated letters.\n Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.\n\n Let me consider:\n - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E — these are fairly common. It doesn\'t have repeated letters.\n - Also, ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E — also common letters.\n\n How about ""RAISE""?

A good starting word should include commonly used vowels and consonants to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or their positions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:\n\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are among the most frequently used letters.\n- The consonants (C, R, N) are also common in English 5-letter words.\n- All letters are distinct, allowing for efficient testing of five different characters.\n- It has been statistically proven to be a strong opener in word games.\n\nThis choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly, regardless of the feedback.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are making our second guess.

Let\'s list common letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}:\n Vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are already excluded)\n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.\n\n We can aim for a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters: e.g., S, T, L, etc.\n\n A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but let\'s check: S, L, O, T, H.

Yes. It uses common letters.\n\n How about ""SLIMY""? S, L, I, M, Y — same.\n\n I think ""SLOTH"" or ""MOIST"" are fine choices.\n\n However, ""MOIST"" is very common in Wordle as a second guess in this situation.\n\n Alternatively, ""PHYLS"" is not a word.\n\n Considering frequency of letters:\n After avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T — all common.\n\n Let\'s go with ""MOIST"".\n\n Therefore, our second guess is ""MOIST"".\n\n Output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked incorrect (✗), we know the secret word contains **none** of these letters.

We have feedback from two previous guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> all letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nGuess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(x), T(-)\n\nThis means:\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in MOIST).\n- T is in the word but in the wrong position (so T is present, but not at the end).\n- M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nSo, from MOIST:\n- Correct position: O is the second letter. So the secret word has O as the second letter.\n- Present but wrong position: T is in the word, but not at the fifth position (since in MOIST, T is the fifth letter and it's marked as '-', meaning present but not there).\n- Absent: M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the second position.\n- The secret word has the letter T, but not at the fifth position.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nAlso, from the absence of these letters, we can list the available letters. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. Note that O and T are present, but we know O is fixed at position 2 and T is present but not at position 5.\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S. And we know the word has O (at position 2) and T (somewhere not at position 5).\n\nThe remaining letters of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: T is present, so we must include T in the word (but not at position 5). And O is fixed at position 2.\n\nSo the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _\n\nWe know T is in the word, but not at position 5. So T must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Second letter is O.\n- Contains T, but not at position 5 (so positions 1, 3, or 4).\n- Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.\n\nLet's think of words that fit this pattern.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- Position 1: could be T? Then we have T O _ _ _\n  But T is present, and if we put T at position 1, that would be a possibility.\n  Example: TOUCH? But C is excluded. Invalid.\n  Example: TOUGH? G and H are available. TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H. But we have to check if U, G, H are allowed? Yes, because not excluded. Also, note that T is at position 1, which is allowed (since T is not at position 5, and we are putting it at 1). But we must check if the word is valid.\n\n- Position 3: T could be at position 3: _ O T _ _\n  Example: MOTTO? But M is excluded. Invalid.\n  Example: POTTED? That's 6 letters. Not 5.\n  Example: POTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is available. But we have to check: P, O, T, T, Y. But T is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the secret word, if there is only one T, then we cannot have two T's. But we don't know if there are two T's. However, in the feedback for MOIST, we had only one T and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it could be that the secret word has one T. But it might have two? We don't know. We have to consider both.\n\nBut note: in MOIST, we had T at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one T, but it might have more? The feedback doesn't specify the count. So we must consider that there might be multiple T's.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should avoid assuming multiple T's until we have evidence.\n\nBut in our next guess, we can try to test for that.\n\nAlternatively, T at position 4: _ O _ T _\nExample: BOOTH? But O is at position 2? B O O T H? That has two O's? But we know O is at position 2, and if we put O at position 3? That would be a different position. But the feedback says O is correct at position 2, so the secret word has O at position 2. So in BOOTH: B (position1), O (position2, correct), O (position3, which would be an extra O), T (position4), H (position5). But we don't know if there is a second O. The feedback for MOIST only showed one O and it was correct, but it doesn't say if there are more. So it's possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters. BOOTH: B, O, O, T, H. Excluded letters? B is not excluded, O is allowed (but we know it's present), T is present, H is not excluded. But we have two O's? That might be acceptable if the word has two O's.\n\nHowever, we are trying to form a guess. We need to pick a word that fits the constraints.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit: second letter O, and contain T (not at position 5), and avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- T at position 1: T O _ _ _\n  Options: \n    TOUCH -> invalid (C excluded)\n    TOUGH -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid? Yes, and U, G, H are new.\n    TOXIC -> invalid (C and I excluded? I is excluded, and C excluded) -> invalid.\n    TOPIC -> invalid (I and C excluded)\n    TOYED -> invalid (E and D? E is excluded) -> invalid.\n    TOILS -> invalid (I and S excluded)\n    TOMBS -> invalid (M and S excluded)\n    TONGS -> invalid (N and S excluded)\n    TOOTH -> T, O, O, T, H -> but T is repeated? And O is repeated. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. Also, O is already at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, that's an extra O. And T at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, TOOTH is a valid word.\n\n  So possible: TOUGH, TOOTH.\n\n- T at position 3: _ O T _ _\n  Options:\n    BOTCH -> invalid (C excluded)\n    BOTHY -> B, O, T, H, Y -> valid? BOTHY is a word? I think it's a Scottish word, but might be obscure. Let's avoid if possible.\n    DOTAL -> D, O, T, A, L -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n    FOTCH -> not a word.\n    GOTHS -> G, O, T, H, S -> S is excluded -> invalid.\n    HOTLY -> H, O, T, L, Y -> valid? Yes, and letters H, L, Y are new.\n    JOTUN -> J, O, T, U, N -> N excluded -> invalid.\n    LOTUS -> L, O, T, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.\n    MOTHS -> M excluded -> invalid.\n    NOTCH -> N excluded -> invalid.\n    POTTY -> P, O, T, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but T repeated. And P and Y are new.\n    ROTCH -> R excluded -> invalid.\n    WOTHY -> not a word.\n    YOCTO -> Y, O, C, T, O -> C excluded and O repeated -> invalid.\n\n  So possible: HOTLY, POTTY.\n\n- T at position 4: _ O _ T _\n  Options:\n    BOOTH -> B, O, O, T, H -> valid, but O repeated.\n    BOOTS -> B, O, O, T, S -> S excluded -> invalid.\n    COUTH -> C excluded -> invalid.\n    DOUTY -> not a word.\n    FOOTY -> F, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Yes, but O repeated.\n    GOETH -> G, O, E, T, H -> E excluded -> invalid.\n    HOOTY -> H, O, O, T, Y -> valid? Maybe, but O repeated.\n    LOFTY -> L, O, F, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and L, F, Y are new.\n    MOUTH -> M excluded -> invalid.\n    POUTY -> P, O, U, T, Y -> valid? Yes, and P, U, Y are new.\n    ROOTY -> R excluded -> invalid.\n    SOOTH -> S excluded -> invalid.\n    TOOTH -> but that has T at position 1, not 4. We are considering T at position 4.\n    VOTED -> V, O, T, E, D -> E excluded -> invalid.\n    WOVEN -> W, O, V, E, N -> E and N excluded -> invalid.\n\n  So possible: LOFTY, POUTY, and also BOOTH and FOOTY and HOOTY if we allow repeated O.\n\nNow, we have to choose one for the next guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible and avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.\n\nAlso, note that we have to include T (since it's present) and we know it's not at position 5.\n\nLet's list the candidate words we have:\n\n- TOUGH: T, O, U, G, H -> tests U, G, H (all new) and T at position 1 (which is a possible location for T). Also, no repeated letters.\n- TOOTH: T, O, O, T, H -> tests T and O repeated, and H. But we already know O is present (at position 2) and T is present. So we don't get much new information about other letters. Also, it repeats O and T, which might not be necessary.\n- HOTLY: H, O, T, L, Y -> tests H, L, Y (new) and T at position 3. Also, no repeated letters.\n- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> tests P and Y, but repeats T. Not ideal for information.\n- LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y -> tests L, F, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P, U, Y (new) and T at position 4. No repeated letters.\n\nWe want to avoid words with repeated letters because they give less information about other letters. So TOOTH and POTTY are less desirable.\n\nAmong the others: TOUGH, HOTLY, LOFTY, POUTY.\n\nWe also want to cover common letters. The available common letters: T (we know is present), then among the new: H, L, P, U, Y, F, G.\n\nCommon letters in English: H, L, U, P, Y, F, G (in roughly that order?).\n\nH and L are more common than F and G.\n\nSo HOTLY (H, L, Y) and LOFTY (L, F, Y) and POUTY (P, U, Y) and TOUGH (U, G, H).\n\nHOTLY has H and L, which are very common.\n\nAlso, HOTLY places T at position 3, which is a possible slot.\n\nSimilarly, LOFTY places T at position 4.\n\nWe don't know which position T is in, so we might want to test a position.\n\nBut note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get information.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.\n\nWe have three possibilities for T: position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe haven't tested position 1, 3, or 4 for T.\n\nIn HOTLY, we test T at position 3.\n\nIn TOUGH, we test T at position 1.\n\nIn LOFTY, we test T at position 4.\n\nIn POUTY, we test T at position 4.\n\nWe might also consider that the word might have more than one T? But we don't know. So it's better to avoid multiple T's in the guess unless necessary.\n\nAll our candidates except TOOTH and POTTY have only one T.\n\nSo let's pick HOTLY because it tests H, L, and Y, which are common, and places T at position 3.\n\nAlternatively, TOUGH tests U, G, H, and places T at position 1.\n\nBut H is common to both.\n\nWe can also consider that we have to avoid the fifth position for T, but in our guess, we can put T anywhere except position 5? Actually, we can put T at position 5 in the guess? But we know that in the secret word, T is not at position 5. But in our guess, we can put T at position 5? It would be a wasted letter because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting T at position 5 in our guesses.\n\nIn all our candidates, T is not at position 5.\n\nNow, let me see if HOTLY is a valid word. Yes, it means in a hot manner, or something that is hot.\n\nSimilarly, TOUGH is valid.\n\nBut note: we have the constraint that the second letter must be O. In all these words, the second letter is O? Let's check:\n\n- HOTLY: H O T L Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n- TOUGH: T O U G H -> second letter O? Yes.\n- LOFTY: L O F T Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n- POUTY: P O U T Y -> second letter O? Yes.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think HOTLY is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (H, L, Y) and places T in position 3, which is one of the possible positions.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider other words that I haven't thought of.\n\nAnother word: DOUGH? D, O, U, G, H -> but D is available. And it tests D, U, G, H. But we don't have T! We must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot use DOUGH because it doesn't have T.\n\nSimilarly, we must include T in the guess because we know it's in the secret word. So all our guesses must include T (and O at position 2).\n\nSo HOTLY is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother possibility: THUMB? But T at position 1, then H, U, M, B. But M is excluded -> invalid.\n\nBOUGH? B, O, U, G, H -> no T -> invalid.\n\nGOTHY? Not a word.\n\nSo HOTLY seems good.\n\nWe could also consider: POUTY, which has P, U, Y. But U is a vowel and might be less common? Actually, U is common.\n\nBut HOTLY has H and L, which are more common than P and U? Let me check letter frequencies.\n\nIn English, the frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, ... \n\nBut we have already excluded E, A, R, I, O (O is present but we know its position), T (present), N, S. So the most common remaining are L, U, D, P, M, H, G. But M is excluded? Wait, M is excluded from the first feedback? In guess 1: CRANE had M? No, CRANE didn't have M. But in guess 2: MOIST had M and it was marked absent, so M is excluded.\n\nSo excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nMost common available: L, D, P, H, G, U, B, Y, F, etc.\n\nSo L, H, D, P, G, U are the top.\n\nHOTLY has H, L, Y.\n\nLOFTY has L, F, Y.\n\nPOUTY has P, U, Y.\n\nTOUGH has U, G, H.\n\nAll are good, but HOTLY has H and L, which are both high frequency.\n\nAlso, Y is less common, but it's included.\n\nAnother word: DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T -> but O is at position 2? D O U B T -> that's D at 1, O at 2, U at 3, B at 4, T at 5. But we know T is not at position 5 in the secret word. So if we put T at position 5, it will be wrong, but we know that. However, we can still use it? But it would be a waste because we know T is not at 5. Also, we are testing T at 5, which we know is incorrect. So it doesn't give us new information about T. We should avoid putting T at position 5.\n\nIn DOUBT, T is at position 5, so we avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we should not put T at position 5 in any guess.\n\nSo DOUBT is invalid for our purpose.\n\nAnother word: BOUTS? But S is excluded.\n\nHOTLY seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm: HOTLY is a valid word?

Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.\n\n**Summary of information:**\n\nFrom Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (MOIST):\n- M, I, S: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2)\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 3 (HOTLY):\n- H: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3? In HOTLY, T is at position 3, and it's marked as present but wrong position, meaning that T is in the word but not at position 3. So T is not at position 3 either.)\n- L: absent\n- Y: correct position (position 5)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y\n- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY) and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1 and 4, T must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have more absent letters: H and L are absent, so we add them to the exclusion list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T is present, but we are not sure of its position, and O and Y are fixed at positions 2 and 5).\n\nThe secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y\n\nT must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n- First character: either T or something else (if T is at position 4, then position 1 is a new letter)\n- Third character: a letter from the available set (since T cannot be at position 3, and we don't know if it's at 1 or 4, so position 3 must be a new letter unless T is at 1 and then position 3 is not T)\n- Fourth character: if T is not at position 4, then it must be a new letter, but if T is at position 4, then we put T there.\n\nBut note: we have to include T in the word because it's present.\n\nSo two cases:\n\nCase 1: T at position 1 -> word: T O _ _ Y\nCase 2: T at position 4 -> word: _ O _ T Y\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nLet's list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, Case 1: T at position 1 -> T O _ _ Y\n\nWe need to fill positions 3 and 4 with available letters (from B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z) and avoid excluded letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- TOXIC? But C and I are excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUGH? But G and H: H is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUCH? C and H excluded -> invalid.\n- TOFFY? T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated? And Y is at position 5, which is correct. But we have F at position 3 and 4? TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y. But F is repeated. Also, is TOFFY a word? It might be a proper noun or rare, but let's consider. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for more information.\n- TOPPY? T, O, P, P, Y -> P repeated -> not ideal.\n- TOUZY? Not a common word.\n- TOWZY? Similarly, rare.\n- TOYON? But O at position 2 and then O again? T, O, Y, O, N? But N is excluded, and also pattern is T O _ _ Y, so third and fourth must be filled. TOYON: T, O, Y, O, N -> but Y is at position 3? We need position 5 to be Y, but in TOYON, position 5 is N. So not matching pattern.\n\nWe need the word to end with Y, so last letter is Y.\n\nSo T O ? ? Y\n\nPossible:\n- TODAY? T, O, D, A, Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUCH? Invalid.\n- TOUGH? Invalid (H excluded).\n- TOLLY? T, O, L, L, Y -> but L is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated. But F is available. Is TOFFY valid? It means covered with toffee or something, but it's an adjective. We can consider.\n- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> U and Z are available. Is TOUZY a word? It might be an alternate spelling of tousy, meaning disheveled. But let's see if it's accepted.\n- TOWNY: T, O, W, N, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.\n- TOYON: doesn't fit pattern.\n\nAnother one: TOUZY? T, O, U, Z, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:U, 4:Z, 5:Y. This seems possible if TOUZY is accepted.\n\nBut let's check if there are better options.\n\nCase 2: T at position 4 -> _ O _ T Y\n\nPattern: ? O ? T Y\n\nPosition 1 and 3 to be filled with available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BOTTY? B, O, T, T, Y -> but T repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, B is available. But BOTTY might not be common; it's informal for bottom.\n- COTTY? C excluded -> invalid.\n- DOTTY: D, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. D and Y available. DOTTY is a valid word.\n- FOTTY? Not a word.\n- GOTTY? Not a word.\n- JOTTY? J, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. JOTTY might be a word (a type of pier), but rare.\n- POTTED? 6 letters.\n- POTTY: P, O, T, T, Y -> T repeated. POTTY is valid.\n- PUTTY: P, U, T, T, Y -> T repeated. PUTTY is valid.\n- WATTY? W, A, T, T, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\nBut all these have repeated T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But in previous feedback, we only had one T indicated, but it could be that there are two. However, to avoid repetition, we might prefer a word without repetition if possible.\n\nIs there a word with T at position 4 and no repeated T? For example, with distinct letters.\n\n- DOUTY? Not a word.\n- FOUTY? Not a word.\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> no repeated letters. POUTY is a valid word (sulky). And it fits: position 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.\n- BOUTY? Not a word.\n- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> valid (relating to gout). Pattern: G O U T Y.\n- WOUTY? Not a word.\n\nSo possible words for case 2: POUTY, GOUTY, and also the repeated T words like DOTTY, POTTY, PUTTY.\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess. We have two cases for T position.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests one of the cases and also introduces new letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we need to be efficient.\n\nWe know that T is either at position 1 or 4.\n\nIf we choose a word with T at position 1, we can test that case. Similarly for position 4.\n\nBut we also have to consider the feedback from the new guess.\n\nLet's list the candidate words:\n\nFor T at position 1:\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only test F and nothing else for positions 3 and 4. Not ideal.\n- TOUZY: T, O, U, Z, Y -> tests U and Z, which are new. But Z is rare. And TOUZY might not be in the word list.\n\nFor T at position 4:\n- POUTY: P, O, U, T, Y -> tests P and U, both new and common.\n- GOUTY: G, O, U, T, Y -> tests G and U.\n\nWe also have the word from case 2 without repetition: POUTY and GOUTY.\n\nPOUTY and GOUTY are both valid and test two new letters each.\n\nBut in POUTY, we have U at position 3, and in GOUTY, U at position 3 as well.\n\nWe also have to consider that Y is fixed at position 5, so we don't get new info about Y.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider if there is a word that tests position 1 with a new letter and has T at position 4.\n\nFor example, in case 2, we have POUTY: position 1 is P, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, GOUTY: position 1 is G, new.\n\nBut we don't have a word for case 1 that is common and tests two new letters without repetition. TOUZY is marginal.\n\nAnother word for case 1: TOWDY? Not a word.\n\nTOWZY: variant of TOUSY, same as TOUZY.\n\nPerhaps we should go with POUTY or GOUTY.\n\nBut note: in the previous guess, we had HOTLY which had T at position 3 and it was wrong, so T is not at 3.\n\nNow, if we choose POUTY, which has T at position 4, we are testing that T is at position 4.\n\nIf it is, then we might get T correct, and also we test P and U.\n\nIf not, then T must be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, we test that.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nSince POUTY is a common word, let's consider it.\n\nBut we also have the feedback from HOTLY: Y is correct at position 5, so we know that.\n\nAnother thing: in POUTY, the pattern is P O U T Y.\n\nIf the secret word has T at position 4, then in POUTY, T would be correct, and we get feedback accordingly.\n\nIf not, then T is at position 1, and we know that.\n\nMoreover, we test P and U.\n\nSimilarly, GOUTY tests G and U.\n\nWhich is better? P is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.\n\nBut let's see the available letters.\n\nWe have to avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L.\n\nAvailable: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.\n\nCommon ones: P, U, D, F, G, B, etc.\n\nPOUTY: tests P and U.\n\nGOUTY: tests G and U.\n\nBoth test U, so the difference is P vs G.\n\nP is more common than G, so POUTY might be better.\n\nBut we also have to consider that if T is at position 1, then POUTY would have T at position 4 which is wrong, so we get T marked as present but wrong position (since it's in the word but not at 4, and we know it must be at 1).\n\nSimilarly, if we choose a word with T at position 1, like TOUZY, we test U and Z.\n\nBut Z is rare, so not ideal.\n\nAnother word for case 1: TUPIK? Not 5 letters.\n\nTOYON? Not matching pattern.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that doesn't assume T position but includes T and the fixed O and Y.\n\nBut we have to include T, and we know it's at 1 or 4.\n\nWe can choose a word that has T at position 1 and new letters, or at position 4.\n\nBut TOUZY is not great.\n\nWhat about DOUBT? But T at position 5, which we know is wrong, so we avoid.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T at position 4 and also tests new letters, like POUTY.\n\nBut let's see if there is a word with T at position 1 and common letters.\n\nTOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated, so we only learn about F, and if F is present or not. But since repeated, if F is present, we might not know how many, etc. Not efficient.\n\nTOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z. W is common, Z is rare. But TOWZY might not be in the word list.\n\nI think POUTY is a safer choice.\n\nMoreover, POUTY was considered earlier as a candidate.\n\nSo I'll go with POUTY.\n\nTherefore, the fourth guess is POUTY.\n\nBut let's confirm the pattern: P O U T Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\nYes.\n\nIf the secret word has T at position 4, then T will be correct, and we get feedback on P and U.\n\nIf not, then T is at position 1, and we know that, and we get feedback on P and U.\n\nEither way, we learn about P and U.\n\nAnd we have two guesses left.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\n<guess>POUTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Feedback Summary**:\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  \n     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.\n   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**:\n     - M✗, I✗, S✗ (absent).\n     - O✓ (correct position: **O is the 2nd letter**).\n     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is in the word, not at position 5**).\n     → **Eliminated letters**: M, I, S.  \n     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ _` with T present (positions 1, 3, or 4 possible).\n   - **Guess 3 (HOTLY)**:\n     - H✗, L✗ (absent).\n     - O✓ (confirmed at position 2).\n     - T- (present but wrong position; **T is not at position 3**).\n     - Y✓ (correct position: **Y is the 5th letter**).\n     → **Eliminated letters**: H, L.  \n     → **Confirmed**: Secret word pattern is `_ O _ _ Y` with T present (now only positions 1 or 4 possible).\n\n2. **Current Constraints**:\n   - **Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y` (O at position 2, Y at position 5).\n   - **T position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be at 3 or 5).\n   - **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L (avoid these).\n   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n   - **T must be included** in the guess (since it is confirmed present).\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:\n   - **Goal**: Test the two possible positions for T (1 or 4) while maximizing new letter coverage.\n   - **Prioritize**:\n     - Testing high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, U, D, F, G).\n     - Avoiding repeated letters to gather more information.\n   - **Candidate words**:\n     - **T at position 1**: Words like `T O _ _ Y` (e.g., TOFFY, TOUZY). However, TOFFY has repeated F, reducing information, and TOUZY uses rare letters (Z).\n     - **T at position 4**: Words like `_ O _ T Y` (e.g., POUTY, GOUTY). POUTY (P, O, U, T, Y) is ideal:\n       - Tests T at position 4 (a possible location).\n       - Introduces **P** and **U** (high-frequency untested letters).\n       - All letters distinct, maximizing information.\n   - **Why POUTY?**:\n     - If T is at position 4, feedback will confirm its position.\n     - If T is not at position 4, it must be at position 1 (narrowing options for future guesses).\n     - Feedback on P and U will help identify their presence/absence, significantly reducing possibilities.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   POUTY efficiently tests the critical T position while probing new common letters, aligning with the goal of narrowing down the solution space.\n\n<guess>POUTY</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: HOTLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(-) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: POUTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the fifth guess. Let\'s analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.\n\n**Summary of information:**\n\nFrom Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word has none of these.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (MOIST):\n- M, I, S: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2)\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 3 (HOTLY):\n- H, L: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 3)\n- Y: correct position (position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 4 (POUTY):\n- P, U: absent\n- O: correct position (position 2) [already known]\n- T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 4)\n- Y: correct position (position 5) [already known]\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has O at position 2 and Y at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y\n- T is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from HOTLY), not at position 4 (from POUTY), and not at position 5 (from MOIST). Since the only positions left are 1, and we have only position 1 left, T must be at position 1.\n\nPositions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nWe know:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 5: Y\n- T is present but not at 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, T must be at position 1.\n\nSo the secret word must start with T, then O, then ?, then ?, then Y. Pattern: T O ? ? Y\n\nAdditionally, we have absent letters: from all guesses, absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.\n\nSo excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z. (and we know T, O, Y are present, but O and Y are fixed, and T is now fixed at position 1).\n\nWe need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two letters from the available set.\n\nThe word is T O _ _ Y\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> but F repeated. And F is available. Is TOFFY valid? Yes, meaning like covered with toffee or sweet.\n- TOGAY? Not a word.\n- TOGAE? But E is excluded -> invalid.\n- TOKAY: T, O, K, A, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.\n- TOMBY? M excluded -> invalid.\n- TONKY? N excluded -> invalid.\n- TOPPY? P excluded -> invalid.\n- TORGY? R excluded -> invalid.\n- TOUZY? U excluded -> invalid.\n- TOWDY? W, D, Y -> T, O, W, D, Y? But we need two letters for positions 3 and 4. TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y. W and D are available. Is TOWDY a word? It might be a surname or rare, but let\'s see.\n- TOYON? O at position 2 and then Y at position 3? But we need position 5 to be Y, so not matching.\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y -> F repeated.\n- TOXIN? X, I, N -> I and N excluded -> invalid.\n- TOZED? Not a word.\n\nAnother one: TOWZY? T, O, W, Z, Y -> W and Z available. TOWZY is a variant of TOUSY, meaning disheveled. But might be accepted.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible:\n\n- TOFFY: T, O, F, F, Y\n- TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y\n- TOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y\n- TOGGY? Not a word.\n- TOVBY? Not a word.\n- TOXIC? C and I excluded.\n- JOWLY? But J at position 1? No, pattern is T O _ _ Y.\n\nWe need the word to start with T and O.\n\nAnother word: TODDY? T, O, D, D, Y -> D repeated. But D is available. TODDY is a word (a drink). Pattern: T O D D Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So it fits.\n\nSimilarly, DOGGY? But doesn\'t start with T.\n\nSo possible words: TOFFY, TOWDY, TOWZY, TODDY.\n\nBut TODDY has repeated D, TOFFY has repeated F.\n\nTOWDY and TOWZY have distinct letters.\n\nTOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> tests W and D.\n\nTOWZY: T, O, W, Z, Y -> tests W and Z.\n\nSince Z is less common, TOWDY might be better.\n\nBut we need to choose one.\n\nWe have two positions to fill, and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe can test two of them.\n\nIn TOWDY, we test W and D.\n\nIn TOFFY, we test F (but repeated, so only one new letter effectively).\n\nIn TODDY, we test D (repeated).\n\nSo TOWDY is better because it tests two distinct new letters: W and D.\n\nSimilarly, TOWZY tests W and Z, but Z is rare.\n\nSo TOWDY is preferable.\n\nIs TOWDY a valid word? It might be a surname or a rare word, but let\'s assume it\'s acceptable. Alternatively, we can check if there are more common words.\n\nAnother word: TOUGH? But U and H excluded -> invalid.\n\nGODLY? Doesn\'t start with T.\n\nBOWDY? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps TOXIC is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: TOYED? E excluded.\n\nSo TOWDY seems a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word like TOVAY? Not a word.\n\nTOWZY is also possible.\n\nBut D is more common than Z, so TOWDY might be better for testing.\n\nWe have only two guesses left, so we need to make progress.\n\nSince we know the pattern is T O ? ? Y, and we have to fill two letters, we can choose TOWDY.\n\nIf TOWDY is not the word, we get feedback on W and D.\n\nSimilarly, we could choose TOFFY, but with repeated F, if F is present, we don\'t know if it\'s one or two, but since we have only one spot, it might be confusing.\n\nFor example, if we guess TOFFY and the secret word has one F, then the feedback might show one F as present and one as absent? But in Wordle-style feedback, for repeated letters, it can be tricky.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, we should prefer distinct letters.\n\nTherefore, TOWDY is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: TOWDY is a word? It can be a variant of ""towdie"" or a surname, but it might not be in the word list. We need a common word.\n\nAnother word: TODDY is more common, but it has repeated D.\n\nTOFFY is also common.\n\nBut in TODDY, we have repeated D, so if the secret word has only one D, we might get mixed feedback.\n\nFor example, if the secret word has D at position 3 but not 4, then in TODDY, position 3 D might be correct or present, and position 4 D absent.\n\nBut it\'s messy.\n\nSimilarly for TOFFY.\n\nSo to maximize information, we should use distinct letters.\n\nIs there a word with distinct available letters?\n\nFor example, T O W D Y -> TOWDY, as above.\n\nT O G D Y?

We are on the sixth guess (last try). We have feedback from all previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters absent: eliminated C,R,A,N,E
Guess 2: MOIST -> M,I,S absent; O correct at position 2; T present but wrong position (not 5)
Guess 3: HOTLY -> H,L absent; O correct (pos2); T present but wrong position (not 3); Y correct at position 5
Guess 4: POUTY -> P,U absent; O correct; T present but wrong position (not 4); Y correct
Guess 5: TOWDY -> T correct (pos1), O correct (pos2), W absent, D correct (pos4), Y correct (pos5)

From Guess 5 feedback: T(✓), O(✓), W(x), D(✓), Y(✓)
This confirms:
- T is at position 1
- O at position 2
- D is at position 4 (since we got D as correct at position 4 in TOWDY? But note: in TOWDY, D is at position 4 and marked correct, so yes)
- Y at position 5
- W is absent (so not in the word)

Additionally, from previous feedback:
- We know T is not at positions 3,4,5 (from earlier feedback) but now it is fixed at position 1.
- We have eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L,P,U,W

Current known positions:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: D (since in TOWDY, D was at position 4 and marked correct)
- Position 5: Y

We are missing position 3.

From TOWDY feedback: we have T(✓) O(✓) W(x) D(✓) Y(✓). So the word is T O ? D Y, where the third letter is missing and must be a letter not eliminated and not W.

The word structure: T O _ D Y

Eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L,P,U,W

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,Q,V,X,Z

But note: the third letter must be one of these, and it must form a valid English word.

Now, what words fit ""T O _ D Y""?

Possible letters at position 3: one of B,F,G,J,K,Q,V,X,Z

We need to guess a word that fits T O ? D Y, with ? being one of these.

Possible words:
- TOADY: T,O,A,D,Y -> but A is eliminated (from CRANE, A is absent). Invalid.
- TODDY: T,O,D,D,Y -> but in our pattern the fourth letter is D, but in TODDY, position 3 is D and position 4 is D? But we have position 4 fixed as D. Also, TODDY has two D's. But our pattern is T O ? D Y, so position 3 must be distinct from D? Not necessarily, but if we put D at position 3, then position 4 is also D? We don't know if the word has two D's. However, in TOWDY we guessed D at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't test D at position 3.

Let's list possible words:

- If third letter is F: TOFDY? Not a word.
- If G: TOGDY? Not a word.
- If K: TOKDY? Not a word.
- If B: TOBDY? Not a word.
- If V: TOVDY? Not a word.
- If X: TOXDY? Not a word.
- If Z: TOZDY? Not a word.
- If J: not a word.

Perhaps TODDY? But in TODDY: T, O, D, D, Y -> so if we assign: position 1:T, 2:O, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So the pattern matches? Yes: T O D D Y. But we have D at both position 3 and 4. But in our pattern, we require position 4 to be D, but position 3 could be D? Yes.

Is TODDY a valid word? Yes, meaning a drink.

But in our previous feedback, have we eliminated D? No, D is not eliminated because it wasn't guessed before TOWDY. In TOWDY, we guessed D at position 4 and it was correct, so D is present and at position 4.

But TODDY would have D at position 3 as well? Yes.

But we don't know if the word has two D's.

Similarly, we have other words?

Another word: TODY? But that's 4 letters.

Perhaps TOODY? Not a word.

TOWED? But ends with D? Pattern must end with Y.

I think the only common word that fits is TODDY.

But TODDY has D at position 3, which we haven't directly tested, but it is possible.

Another possibility: TOADY, but A is eliminated.

Or BOWDY? Doesn't start with T.

We must have T O _ D Y.

With available letters, TODDY seems the only option.

But let's confirm: TODDY: T, O, D, D, Y.

In the feedback from TOWDY: we had D marked as correct at position 4. If the secret word is TODDY, then it has two D's. In TOWDY, we had D at position 4 correct, and W absent, so that matches. For the third position, in TODDY it is D, but we didn't have D at position 3 in any previous guess? So we don't know.

But when we guess TODDY, we can confirm.

But are there other words? For example, if we consider other available letters? But I can't find any other 5-letter word T O ? D Y that is valid.

What about ""TODAY""? But A is eliminated and doesn't end with Y? TODAY ends with Y? T-O-D-A-Y, so but A is eliminated.

So only TODDY fits.

Therefore, the secret word must be TODDY.

So we guess TODDY.

But let's verify the previous feedback:

- For guess 2: MOIST with T(-). In TODDY, T is at position 1, so it is present but not at position 5 as in MOIST? Yes, because MOIST had T at position 5 and it was marked present but wrong position.

- Guess 3: HOTLY had T at position 3 marked present but wrong? In HOTLY, we guessed T at position 3, but in TODDY the T is only at position 1, so T is not at position 3? So the feedback was correct: T is present but not at position 3.

Also, in TODDY, there is no L (from HOTLY), so absent is correct.

- Guess 4: POUTY had T at position 4 marked present but wrong? In TODDY, there is a D at position 4, not T? TODDY has D at position 3 and 4? Positions:
  TODDY: pos1: T, pos2: O, pos3: D, pos4: D, pos5: Y.
  So no T at position 4, so T is present at pos1, not at pos4, so feedback T(-) for POUTY (which had T at position 4) is correct.

- Guess 5: TOWDY: we guessed TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> feedback: T(✓) O(✓) W(x) D(✓) Y(✓). 
  For TODDY: T is correct at 1, O at 2, W is absent (since TODDY has no W), D at position 4 is correct (TODDY has D at position 4? Yes, because TODDY: pos4 is D). And Y correct.

So all feedback matches.

Therefore, TODDY is the word.

So we guess it.

But note: we are on the sixth guess, so we have one shot.

And TODDY is the only reasonable option.

So we go with TODDY.

### Final Analysis:

- **Previous Feedback Synthesis**:
  - **Pattern Confirmed**: The secret word is `T O _ D Y` (T at position 1, O at 2, D at 4, Y at 5).
  - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, H, L, P, U, W (all absent per feedback).
  - **Position 3 Constraints**: 
    - Must be a valid English letter not eliminated (available: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Z).
    - Must form a valid 5-letter word when combined with `T`, `O`, `D`, and `Y`.

- **Identifying Position 3**:
  - Tested available letters (B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Z) against common English words matching `T O _ D Y`.
  - **Only valid word**: **TODDY** (T-O-D-D-Y), meaning a drink or affectionate term.
    - Position 3 = D (using available letter D, which is already confirmed at position 4 but can repeat).
    - Eliminated alternatives like TOADY (A eliminated), TOFFY (F possible but word invalid), or TOYOND (doesn’t fit pattern).

- **Consistency Check**:
  - Feedback from **Guess 5 (TOWDY)**: T(✓), O(✓), W(x), D(✓), Y(✓) confirms:
    - D is correct at position 4 (newly confirmed).
    - W is absent.
  - **TODDY** fits all prior feedback:
    - No eliminated letters (D is reused but allowed).
    - Matches positions: T(1), O(2), D(4), Y(5).
    - Position 3 (D) not previously tested—consistent with unknowns.

- **Conclusion**:
  - **TODDY** is the only possible solution given constraints and word validity.

- D is at position 4 (since we got D as correct at position 4 in TOWDY? But note: in TOWDY, D is at position 4 and marked correct, so yes)
- Y at position 5

Additionally, from previous feedback:
- We know T is not at positions 3,4,5 (from earlier feedback) but now it is fixed at position 1.
- We have eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L,P,U,W

Current known positions:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: D (since in TOWDY, D was at position 4 and marked correct)
- Position 5: Y

We are missing position 3.

From TOWDY feedback: we have T(✓) O(✓) W(x) D(✓) Y(✓). So the word is T O ? D Y, where the third letter is missing and must be a letter not eliminated and not W.

The word structure: T O _ D Y

Eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,H,L,P,U,W

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,Q,V,X,Z

But note: the third letter must be one of these, and it must form a valid English word.

Now, what words fit ""T O _ D Y""?

Possible letters at position 3: one of B,F,G,J,K,Q,V,X,Z

We need to guess a word that fits T O ? D Y, with ? being one of these.

Possible words:
- TOADY: T,O,A,D,Y -> but A is eliminated (from CRANE, A is absent). Invalid.
- TODDY: T,O,D,D,Y -> but in our pattern the fourth letter is D, but in TODDY, position 3 is D and position 4 is D? But we have position 4 fixed as D. Also, TODDY has two D's. But our pattern is T O ? D Y, so position 3 must be distinct from D? Not necessarily, but if we put D at position 3, then position 4 is also D? We don't know if the word has two D's. However, in TOWDY we guessed D at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't test D at position 3.

Let's list possible words:

- If third letter is F: TOFDY? Not a word.
- If G: TOGDY? Not a word.
- If K: TOKDY? Not a word.
- If B: TOBDY? Not a word.
- If V: TOVDY? Not a word.
- If X: TOXDY? Not a word.
- If Z: TOZDY? Not a word.
- If J: not a word.

Perhaps TODDY? But in TODDY: T, O, D, D, Y -> so if we assign: position 1:T, 2:O, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So the pattern matches? Yes: T O D D Y. But we have D at both position 3 and 4. But in our pattern, we require position 4 to be D, but position 3 could be D? Yes.

Is TODDY a valid word? Yes, meaning a drink.

But in our previous feedback, have we eliminated D? No, D is not eliminated because it wasn't guessed before TOWDY. In TOWDY, we guessed D at position 4 and it was correct, so D is present and at position 4.

But TODDY would have D at position 3 as well? Yes.

But we don't know if the word has two D's.

In the feedback from TOWDY: we had D marked as correct at position 4. If the secret word is TODDY, then it has two D's. In TOWDY, we had D at position 4 correct, and W absent, so that matches. For the third position, in TODDY it is D, but we didn't have D at position 3 in any previous guess? So we don't know.

But are there other words? For example, if we consider other available letters? But I can't find any other 5-letter word T O ? D Y that is valid.

What about ""TODAY""? But A is eliminated and doesn't end with Y? TODAY ends with Y? T-O-D-A-Y, so but A is eliminated.

So only TODDY fits.

Therefore, the secret word must be TODDY.

So we guess TODDY.

But let's verify the previous feedback:

- For guess 2: MOIST with T(-). In TODDY, T is at position 1, so it is present but not at position 5 as in MOIST? Yes, because MOIST had T at position 5 and it was marked present but wrong position.

- Guess 3: HOTLY had T at position 3 marked present but wrong? In HOTLY, we guessed T at position 3, but in TODDY the T is only at position 1, so T is not at position 3? So the feedback was correct: T is present but not at position 3.

Also, in TODDY, there is no L (from HOTLY), so absent is correct.

- Guess 4: POUTY had T at position 4 marked present but wrong? In TODDY, there is a D at position 4, not T? TODDY has D at position 3 and 4? Positions:
  TODDY: pos1: T, pos2: O, pos3: D, pos4: D, pos5: Y.
  So no T at position 4, so T is present at pos1, not at pos4, so feedback T(-) for POUTY (which had T at position 4) is correct.

- Guess 5: TOWDY: we guessed TOWDY: T, O, W, D, Y -> feedback: T(✓) O(✓) W(x) D(✓) Y(✓). 
  For TODDY: T is correct at 1, O at 2, W is absent (since TODDY has no W), D at position 4 is correct (TODDY has D at position 4? Yes, because TODDY: pos4 is D). And Y correct.

So all feedback matches.

Therefore, TODDY is the word.

So we guess it.

But note: we are on the sixth guess, so we have one shot.

And TODDY is the only reasonable option.

So we go with TODDY.### Final Analysis:
