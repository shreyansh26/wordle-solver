We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

Alright, let me tackle this next guess step by step. The user asked for a new 5-letter word guess, and I've got the previous feedback to work with: for ""crane,"" every letter got marked with ""x"" – C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). 

Hmm... that means none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word. That's actually helpful because it eliminates those letters entirely. So C, R, A, N, and E are not part of the secret word. I need to choose a new word with letters not in this set.

Now, what's a good word without those letters? Common letters in 5-letter words might include S, T, O, L, P, M, etc. I could pick something like ""slide"" but wait – E is already eliminated. Let me think carefully...

Words like ""pilot"" – P, I, L, O, T. None of those are C,R,A,N,E. That seems solid. ""Sight"" would be problematic because it ends with T? No, T wasn't eliminated. But let me verify: ""p-i-l-o-t"" – P isn't eliminated, I isn't, L isn't, O isn't, T isn't. Perfect. 

Alternatively, ""mouth"" would work too: M,O,U,T,H – all unused letters. But ""pilot"" feels slightly more common and might yield better positional insights, especially with diverse vowels (I and O). 

I'll go with ""pilot"" for this guess. It avoids all the excluded letters and has a good mix of consonants and vowels. 

So my second guess is ""pilot"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked ""x""), the secret word contains none of the letters: **C, R, A, N, E**. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

- It uses common letters not excluded (P, I, L, O, T).

We have eliminated the letters C, R, A, N, E from the first guess. In the second guess, ""pilot"", we have:
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: x (not in the word)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know the secret word contains the letters I, L, and T, but none of P, O, and previously eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E). Also, note that I, L, T are present but must be in different positions because they are marked as wrong position.

Recall the positions of the second guess: 
Position 1: P (eliminated)
Position 2: I (must be in the word but not in position 2)
Position 3: L (must be in the word but not in position 3)
Position 4: O (eliminated)
Position 5: T (must be in the word but not in position 5)

So the secret word has I, L, T, and two more letters (not from the eliminated set: C, R, A, N, E, P, O). 

We also know the word does not have any of the letters from the previous guesses that were marked 'x' (from guess1: C,R,A,N,E and guess2: P,O).

We need a word that contains I, L, T and two other letters. The positions of I, L, T cannot be at positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

Let me consider possible letters for the remaining two. Common letters that haven't been used: S, U, D, M, H, K, B, G, F, etc.

We can form words with I, L, T and two others. For example: BUILT, GUILT, STILT, etc.

We must avoid positions:
- I cannot be in position 2 (so it was in position 2 in guess2, so it must be in 1,3,4, or 5? but position 3 and 5 are also restricted? Actually, the feedback says the letter is in the word but not in that position. So for I, we know it's not at position 2. Similarly, L is not at position 3, and T is not at position 5.

Now, in the secret word, I could be at 1,3,4? But note: position 3 was L in guess2, and that position is marked '-' meaning L is not at position 3, but it doesn't say anything about having I at position 3. Similarly, position 5 is T was not there, but I could be at 5? 

Constraints:
- I cannot be at position 2.
- L cannot be at position 3.
- T cannot be at position 5.

So valid positions for:
I: 1,3,4
L: 1,2,4,5
T: 1,2,3,4

We need a word that has these three letters and two new ones, and avoids positions that are forbidden.

Let me think of common words with I, L, T:

Possible words:
- TILTS: contains T, I, L, T, S -> but T repeated? Actually, we don't know if T can be repeated? The rules don't say anything, but typically in word games, words can have repeated letters? The feedback format suggests that each letter is marked independently, so repeated letters are allowed? But in this case, our constraints: I must be present, L present, T present. In TILTS, there are two T's, which is acceptable.

However, in ""TILTS"", let's see the positions:
T at pos1, I at pos2, L at pos3, T at pos4, S at pos5.

Check against our constraints:
- I is at position 2: but from guess2, I was at position 2 and marked '-', meaning that I is not at position 2 in the secret. So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, TILTS has I at position 2 -> invalid? Actually, no: if the secret were TILTS, and we guessed ""pilot"" (I at position2) and got ""I(-)"", that would mean that in the secret, I is not at position2, but in TILTS, I is at position2? So indeed, TILTS would not be possible because the feedback contradicts.

Therefore, we must avoid having I at position2. So words with I at 2 are not allowed.

Alternative words:

- BUILT: B,U,I,L,T -> positions: B1, U2, I3, L4, T5
Check constraints:
  - I at position3 -> allowed (since I must not be at position2, and 3 is fine)
  - L at position4 -> allowed (because L was at position3 in guess2 and we know it's not at position3, but 4 is fine)
  - T at position5 -> disallowed! because in guess2, T was at position5 and marked '-' meaning T is not at position5. So T at position5 is forbidden.

Therefore, BUILT has T at position5 -> invalid.

- GUILT: G,U,I,L,T -> T is at position5 -> same problem -> invalid.

- STILT: S,T,I,L,T -> T at1? Let's see: S1, T2, I3, L4, T5
  - T at position2: allowed? T constraint: must not be at position5 -> position2 is allowed.
  - I at position3: allowed (not position2)
  - L at position4: allowed (not position3)
  - T at position5: disallowed! -> because T must not be at position5. So STILT has T at position5 -> invalid.

We need a word without T at position5.

What about moving L to a different position? And I? And T not at 5.

Another common word: LILTS? Not a valid word? 
How about: FLITS? F,L,I,T,S -> positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5.
- L is at position2 -> allowed (since L constraint: not position3)
- I is at position3 -> allowed (not position2)
- T is at position4 -> allowed (not position5)
- Also, the word contains I, L, T and two new letters: F and S, which haven't been eliminated.

Let me check if FLITS is valid? Meaning, is it a word? Yes, it means to move swiftly and lightly.

But we have eliminated letters: none of F or S have been eliminated? We eliminated C,R,A,N,E,P,O. So F and S are fine.

Another option: GLINT? G,L,I,N,T -> but N was eliminated? Wait, guess1: N was eliminated (N(x)). So GLINT has N, which is eliminated -> invalid.

STILL? But if we use STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> positions: S1, T2, I3, L4, L5.
- I: at position3 -> allowed
- L: L at position4 and also at position5? 
But constraints: L constraint is that it must not be at position3 -> so positions 4 and 5 are allowed? Yes.

However, we must check T: T is at position2 -> allowed (not position5). And L is present? There are two L's? The word STILL has two L's. The feedback for L in guess2 was for one L, so we know at least one L is in the word. Two L's would be okay? But note, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? 

But in the feedback, each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two L's and we guess one L at position3, we would get '-' for that one L? And then the other L could be anywhere? However, in our constraints we know L is in the word and not at position3. It doesn't say anything about not being at other positions.

But STILL has T at position2? Allowed? But T must be in the word? Yes, and it is at position2. Also, I at position3: allowed? I cannot be at position2, position3 is allowed? Wait, no constraint says I cannot be at position3? Only that I cannot be at position2. So I at position3 is allowed.

However, STILL has two L's: we must account for the feedback. In guess2, we had L at position3 and it was '-', meaning at least one L is in the word and not at that position. But if there are two L's, then the L at position3 in guess2 might not hit a correctly placed one? Actually, the rules don't specify how duplicate letters are handled? Typically in Wordle-like games, if you have duplicate letters and one is in the correct position, it would get a '✓' for that one and then if the other is missing or wrong position? But the FAQ says: each letter is marked independently? 

But the feedback for guess2: L was marked only once? We must take the feedback as given: one L was in the word but not at position3.

In STILL, the secret word has L at positions 4 and 5. So in guess2, position3 was L -> this L would correspond to a wrong position? It might be that the secret has L at positions 4 and 5, so position3 is wrong? And then the L at position3 in guess2 gets '-'. Meanwhile, we haven't revealed the other L? So that's acceptable? 

But note: we only know that L is not at position3? We don't know if there's another L? However, STILL does have I and T? But T is at position2? Is that allowed? T constraint is that it must not be at position5? So position2 is allowed? And I at 3? Also allowed.

So STILL could be a candidate? However, let's compare to another word without duplicates.

FLITS seems good: F,L,I,T,S -> and avoids duplicates.

Also, another word: MILKT? Not a word? Maybe? 

How about QUILT? But Q is rare. Also, we haven't eliminated Q? But U: not eliminated? Guess2: O was eliminated, but U wasn't? Quilt: Q,U,I,L,T -> T at position5? That's disallowed -> invalid.

So FLITS and STILL seem candidates. But STILL has two L's? It might be. Let me see alternative.

Another word: SLIPT? (past tense of slip) S,L,I,P,T -> P is eliminated? Guess2: P(x) -> P is eliminated? So SLIPT has P -> invalid.

WAIFT? Not common, and F is available? But I think FLITS is better.

What about STILT? We already discussed, but T at position5 is not allowed.

Another: BUILT? T at5 not allowed.

So let me try words without T at the end.

FLITS: letters F, L, I, T, S - none eliminated. Positions:
1: F
2: L -> L constraint: must not be at position3 -> L at position2 allowed? Because the constraint is only against position3? Not position2? So yes.
3: I? But I constraint is that it must not be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Wait, guess2: I was at position2 and marked '-' meaning it is not at position2? So we can have I at position3? 
But then L at position2? That's allowed? But in the secret word, if L is at position2, then note: we have L also at position2? Then our guess2 had L at position3? And we got '-' meaning L is in the word and not at position3? So L at position2 is okay? It would be correct? But the symbol '-' says ""in the word but in the wrong position"". So if in the secret, L is at position2, then when we guessed L at position3 it would not be in the correct position? It would be yellow? So then we can have L at position2? Yes.

Similarly, T at position4? Not position5? Then allowed? And I at position3? However, the constraint for I: it cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? And S at position5? Not yet constrained? 

But wait: the secret word might not have S? So FLITS has S at position5? Is that a problem? We don't know? Also, FLITS has I at position3? And the constraint only said I cannot be at position2? So position3 is fine? 

Now, let's see: is there a reason why FLITS might not work? 

Another word: BLITZ? That has Z? Not eliminated? But FLITS is better? Or STILL?

But STILL uses L twice? And FLITS uses distinct letters? Which gives more information? Let me think? FLITS has distinct letters except no? F,L,I,T,S? All distinct? That's better? Because STILL has repeated L? 

But STILL might be a word? And FLITS is a word? So both are valid? 

But STILL has T? Wait? STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> the T is at position2? Allowed? And I at position3? Allowed? 

But note: the secret word must have I, L, T? And STILL has T? Yes? 

But STILL doesn't have T? Wait, STILL: letters are S,T,I,L,L -> it has T at position2? So T is present? And I? And L? So yes? Then why? 

However, we must be cautious: the T constraint is not at position5? So having T at position2 is allowed? And STILL has T at position2? So it's valid? 

But FLITS has T at position4? Which is also allowed? 

I think for maximising information, FLITS is better because all letters are distinct? We might get clearer feedback? 

Alternatively, consider that since L cannot be at position3, but in FLITS we put L at position2? Which is a new position? And I at position3? 

But wait: we know that L is not at position3? So having L at position3 in a guess? But I think the important point is that the secret word must have L and I and T? So let's form a guess that has I, L, T and two new letters? 

What about SPLIT? It has P? Eliminated? P was eliminated? So no? 

So I think FLITS is a good guess? 

But what about SHIFT? S,H,I,F,T -> H? not eliminated? But wait? SHIFT: S1,H2,I3,F4,T5? Now? T at position5? Disallowed! So SHIFT? T at the end? No? 

Another: LIGHT? L,I,G,H,T -> positions: L1, I2, G3, H4, T5? T at position5? Disallowed? Also I at position2? Disallowed? Because I cannot be at position2? So LIGHT would be an invalid word? 

So I think FLITS is a good candidate? 

Alternatively: WHIST? W,H,I,S,T -> positions: W1,H2,I3,S4,T5? T at position5? Disallowed? So T must not be at position5? 

How about MITTS? M,I,T,T,S? T at position3 and position4? But I at position2? Disallowed? 

So FLITS becomes a strong candidate? 

But how about: SMILT? Smilt? Not a word? 

Or BUILT? T at5 disallowed? 

Then we might go with FLITS? But what about TILTH? T,I,L,T,H? T at position1? But I at position2: disallowed? 

So FLITS: F,L,I,T,S? Positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5. We did already.

We can also consider: GILTH? Not a word? 

So I think FLITS is an acceptable guess? 

But to confirm? Are there other words such as STULM? Not standard? 

Another: QUINT? But N is eliminated? 

So FLITS? 

But perhaps there is a word that covers more common letters? For example, SHIFT? But T at end not allowed? Why can't I try to put T not at the end? 

What about TOILS? We know O eliminated: from guess2, O was marked 'x'. So TOILS: O eliminated? Invalid? 

So let me choose FLITS? 

Another: KLUTZ? K,L,U,T,Z? But T at position4? Allowed? But KLUTZ has L at position2? And I would be missing? We must have the letter I? Because we know I is present? And U? Not eliminated? 

In KLUTZ? No 'I'? So the secret word must have I? Therefore? KLUTZ has K,L,U,T,Z? But no I? So invalid? The guess must include I? Not necessarily? 

Actually, the rules don't require the guess to contain the known letters? But note: we know I is present? So if we don't include I in a guess? Then we might miss out? But we are allowed to guess any 5 letter word? It's not mandatory to include the known letters? However, strategically? We want to confirm positions? So including the known letters would be better? 

Alternatively? We could guess a word that doesn't include I? To check other letters? But that might be efficient? But we know I is present? So why not check it? 

So I think include I? 

So if we don't include I? Then we might not get information on its position? And we have 3 misplaced letters? So including them might be wise? 

So FLITS includes I, L, T? So that's good? 

Therefore? the third guess: FLITS. 

But to note? FLITS might not be the most common word? But it's valid? 

Perhaps there's a better word? 

Another word: STILL? But it has repeated L? And we are not sure? But FLITS has distinct? So better? 

I'll go with FLITS? 

But let's think of position: we'll put:
Position1: some new letter? F?
Position2: L? Which? Then we know L cannot be at position3? But position2 is allowed?
Position3: I? We know I cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Then it could be correct? 
Position4: T? Cannot be at position5? Position4 is allowed?
Position5: S? 

So let's hope? 

Alternatively? We could try STINK? N? eliminated? No? 

So FLITS? 

I think that's the choice? 

Therefore? the third guess is ""flits"".
</think>
After evaluating the previous feedback, here's my thought process:

### Feedback Analysis:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x,"" eliminating them entirely.
- Guess 2 (""pilot""):
  - P(x) → eliminated.
  - I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - O(x) → eliminated.
  - T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: I, L, T (confirmed via ""-"" feedback).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, P, O.
- **Position constraints**:
  - I ≠ 2nd position.
  - L ≠ 3rd position.
  - T ≠ 5th position.
- **Additional letters needed**: The secret word has 2 more letters besides I, L, T, chosen from unused letters (e.g., S, F, D, M, H, K, etc.).

### Strategy:
- Choose a word with I, L, T (to deduplicate against constraints) and two unused letters.
- Avoid placing I at position 2, L at position 3, or T at position 5.
- Prioritize common letters like S, F, or H to maximize information.

### Selected Word:
- **FLITS**: 
  - F and S are unused common letters.
  - Positions:
    - L in position → avoids L constraint (position 3 forbidden).
    - I in position → avoids I constraint (position 2 forbidden).
    - T in position → avoids T constraint (position 5 forbidden).
  - Proper English word (""to move swiftly""), satisfying guess requirements.

<guess>flits</guess>",flits,"We have eliminated the letters C, R, A, N, E from the first guess. In the second guess, ""pilot"", we have:
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: x (not in the word)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know the secret word contains the letters I, L, and T, but none of P, O, and previously eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E). Also, note that I, L, T are present but must be in different positions because they are marked as wrong position.

Recall the positions of the second guess: 
Position 1: P (eliminated)
Position 2: I (must be in the word but not in position 2)
Position 3: L (must be in the word but not in position 3)
Position 4: O (eliminated)
Position 5: T (must be in the word but not in position 5)

So the secret word has I, L, T, and two more letters (not from the eliminated set: C, R, A, N, E, P, O). 

We also know the word does not have any of the letters from the previous guesses that were marked 'x' (from guess1: C,R,A,N,E and guess2: P,O).

We need a word that contains I, L, T and two other letters. The positions of I, L, T cannot be at positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

Let me consider possible letters for the remaining two. Common letters that haven't been used: S, U, D, M, H, K, B, G, F, etc.

We can form words with I, L, T and two others. For example: BUILT, GUILT, STILT, etc.

We must avoid positions:
- I cannot be in position 2 (so it was in position 2 in guess2, so it must be in 1,3,4, or 5? but position 3 and 5 are also restricted? Actually, the feedback says the letter is in the word but not in that position. So for I, we know it's not at position 2. Similarly, L is not at position 3, and T is not at position 5.

Now, in the secret word, I could be at 1,3,4? But note: position 3 was L in guess2, and that position is marked '-' meaning L is not at position 3, but it doesn't say anything about having I at position 3. Similarly, position 5 is T was not there, but I could be at 5? 

Constraints:
- I cannot be at position 2.
- L cannot be at position 3.
- T cannot be at position 5.

So valid positions for:
I: 1,3,4
L: 1,2,4,5
T: 1,2,3,4

We need a word that has these three letters and two new ones, and avoids positions that are forbidden.

Let me think of common words with I, L, T:

Possible words:
- TILTS: contains T, I, L, T, S -> but T repeated? Actually, we don't know if T can be repeated? The rules don't say anything, but typically in word games, words can have repeated letters? The feedback format suggests that each letter is marked independently, so repeated letters are allowed? But in this case, our constraints: I must be present, L present, T present. In TILTS, there are two T's, which is acceptable.

However, in ""TILTS"", let's see the positions:
T at pos1, I at pos2, L at pos3, T at pos4, S at pos5.

Check against our constraints:
- I is at position 2: but from guess2, I was at position 2 and marked '-', meaning that I is not at position 2 in the secret. So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, TILTS has I at position 2 -> invalid? Actually, no: if the secret were TILTS, and we guessed ""pilot"" (I at position2) and got ""I(-)"", that would mean that in the secret, I is not at position2, but in TILTS, I is at position2? So indeed, TILTS would not be possible because the feedback contradicts.

Therefore, we must avoid having I at position2. So words with I at 2 are not allowed.

Alternative words:

- BUILT: B,U,I,L,T -> positions: B1, U2, I3, L4, T5
Check constraints:
  - I at position3 -> allowed (since I must not be at position2, and 3 is fine)
  - L at position4 -> allowed (because L was at position3 in guess2 and we know it's not at position3, but 4 is fine)
  - T at position5 -> disallowed! because in guess2, T was at position5 and marked '-' meaning T is not at position5. So T at position5 is forbidden.

Therefore, BUILT has T at position5 -> invalid.

- GUILT: G,U,I,L,T -> T is at position5 -> same problem -> invalid.

- STILT: S,T,I,L,T -> T at1? Let's see: S1, T2, I3, L4, T5
  - T at position2: allowed? T constraint: must not be at position5 -> position2 is allowed.
  - I at position3: allowed (not position2)
  - L at position4: allowed (not position3)
  - T at position5: disallowed! -> because T must not be at position5. So STILT has T at position5 -> invalid.

We need a word without T at position5.

What about moving L to a different position? And I? And T not at 5.

Another common word: LILTS? Not a valid word? 
How about: FLITS? F,L,I,T,S -> positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5.
- L is at position2 -> allowed (since L constraint: not position3)
- I is at position3 -> allowed (not position2)
- T is at position4 -> allowed (not position5)
- Also, the word contains I, L, T and two new letters: F and S, which haven't been eliminated.

Let me check if FLITS is valid? Meaning, is it a word? Yes, it means to move swiftly and lightly.

But we have eliminated letters: none of F or S have been eliminated? We eliminated C,R,A,N,E,P,O. So F and S are fine.

Another option: GLINT? G,L,I,N,T -> but N was eliminated? Wait, guess1: N was eliminated (N(x)). So GLINT has N, which is eliminated -> invalid.

STILL? But if we use STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> positions: S1, T2, I3, L4, L5.
- I: at position3 -> allowed
- L: L at position4 and also at position5? 
But constraints: L constraint is that it must not be at position3 -> so positions 4 and 5 are allowed? Yes.

However, we must check T: T is at position2 -> allowed (not position5). And L is present? There are two L's? The word STILL has two L's. The feedback for L in guess2 was for one L, so we know at least one L is in the word. Two L's would be okay? But note, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? 

But in the feedback, each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two L's and we guess one L at position3, we would get '-' for that one L? And then the other L could be anywhere? However, in our constraints we know L is in the word and not at position3. It doesn't say anything about not being at other positions.

But STILL has T at position2? Allowed? But T must be in the word? Yes, and it is at position2. Also, I at position3: allowed? I cannot be at position2, position3 is allowed? Wait, no constraint says I cannot be at position3? Only that I cannot be at position2. So I at position3 is allowed.

However, STILL has two L's: we must account for the feedback. In guess2, we had L at position3 and it was '-', meaning at least one L is in the word and not at that position. But if there are two L's, then the L at position3 in guess2 might not hit a correctly placed one? Actually, the rules don't specify how duplicate letters are handled? Typically in Wordle-like games, if you have duplicate letters and one is in the correct position, it would get a '✓' for that one and then if the other is missing or wrong position? But the FAQ says: each letter is marked independently? 

But the feedback for guess2: L was marked only once? We must take the feedback as given: one L was in the word but not at position3.

In STILL, the secret word has L at positions 4 and 5. So in guess2, position3 was L -> this L would correspond to a wrong position? It might be that the secret has L at positions 4 and 5, so position3 is wrong? And then the L at position3 in guess2 gets '-'. Meanwhile, we haven't revealed the other L? So that's acceptable? 

But note: we only know that L is not at position3? We don't know if there's another L? However, STILL does have I and T? But T is at position2? Is that allowed? T constraint is that it must not be at position5? So position2 is allowed? And I at 3? Also allowed.

So STILL could be a candidate? However, let's compare to another word without duplicates.

FLITS seems good: F,L,I,T,S -> and avoids duplicates.

Also, another word: MILKT? Not a word? Maybe? 

How about QUILT? But Q is rare. Also, we haven't eliminated Q? But U: not eliminated? Guess2: O was eliminated, but U wasn't? Quilt: Q,U,I,L,T -> T at position5? That's disallowed -> invalid.

So FLITS and STILL seem candidates. But STILL has two L's? It might be. Let me see alternative.

Another word: SLIPT? (past tense of slip) S,L,I,P,T -> P is eliminated? Guess2: P(x) -> P is eliminated? So SLIPT has P -> invalid.

WAIFT? Not common, and F is available? But I think FLITS is better.

What about STILT? We already discussed, but T at position5 is not allowed.

Another: BUILT? T at5 not allowed.

So let me try words without T at the end.

FLITS: letters F, L, I, T, S - none eliminated. Positions:
1: F
2: L -> L constraint: must not be at position3 -> L at position2 allowed? Because the constraint is only against position3? Not position2? So yes.
3: I? But I constraint is that it must not be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Wait, guess2: I was at position2 and marked '-' meaning it is not at position2? So we can have I at position3? 
But then L at position2? That's allowed? But in the secret word, if L is at position2, then note: we have L also at position2? Then our guess2 had L at position3? And we got '-' meaning L is in the word and not at position3? So L at position2 is okay? It would be correct? But the symbol '-' says ""in the word but in the wrong position"". So if in the secret, L is at position2, then when we guessed L at position3 it would not be in the correct position? It would be yellow? So then we can have L at position2? Yes.

Similarly, T at position4? Not position5? Then allowed? And I at position3? However, the constraint for I: it cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? And S at position5? Not yet constrained? 

But wait: the secret word might not have S? So FLITS has S at position5? Is that a problem? We don't know? Also, FLITS has I at position3? And the constraint only said I cannot be at position2? So position3 is fine? 

Now, let's see: is there a reason why FLITS might not work? 

Another word: BLITZ? That has Z? Not eliminated? But FLITS is better? Or STILL?

But STILL uses L twice? And FLITS uses distinct letters? Which gives more information? Let me think? FLITS has distinct letters except no? F,L,I,T,S? All distinct? That's better? Because STILL has repeated L? 

But STILL might be a word? And FLITS is a word? So both are valid? 

But STILL has T? Wait? STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> the T is at position2? Allowed? And I at position3? Allowed? 

But note: the secret word must have I, L, T? And STILL has T? Yes? 

But STILL doesn't have T? Wait, STILL: letters are S,T,I,L,L -> it has T at position2? So T is present? And I? And L? So yes? Then why? 

However, we must be cautious: the T constraint is not at position5? So having T at position2 is allowed? And STILL has T at position2? So it's valid? 

But FLITS has T at position4? Which is also allowed? 

I think for maximising information, FLITS is better because all letters are distinct? We might get clearer feedback? 

Alternatively, consider that since L cannot be at position3, but in FLITS we put L at position2? Which is a new position? And I at position3? 

But wait: we know that L is not at position3? So having L at position3 in a guess? But I think the important point is that the secret word must have L and I and T? So let's form a guess that has I, L, T and two new letters? 

What about SPLIT? It has P? Eliminated? P was eliminated? So no? 

So I think FLITS is a good guess? 

But what about SHIFT? S,H,I,F,T -> H? not eliminated? But wait? SHIFT: S1,H2,I3,F4,T5? Now? T at position5? Disallowed! So SHIFT? T at the end? No? 

Another: LIGHT? L,I,G,H,T -> positions: L1, I2, G3, H4, T5? T at position5? Disallowed? Also I at position2? Disallowed? Because I cannot be at position2? So LIGHT would be an invalid word? 

So I think FLITS is a good candidate? 

Alternatively: WHIST? W,H,I,S,T -> positions: W1,H2,I3,S4,T5? T at position5? Disallowed? So T must not be at position5? 

How about MITTS? M,I,T,T,S? T at position3 and position4? But I at position2? Disallowed? 

So FLITS becomes a strong candidate? 

But how about: SMILT? Smilt? Not a word? 

Or BUILT? T at5 disallowed? 

Then we might go with FLITS? But what about TILTH? T,I,L,T,H? T at position1? But I at position2: disallowed? 

So FLITS: F,L,I,T,S? Positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5. We did already.

We can also consider: GILTH? Not a word? 

So I think FLITS is an acceptable guess? 

But to confirm? Are there other words such as STULM? Not standard? 

Another: QUINT? But N is eliminated? 

So FLITS? 

But perhaps there is a word that covers more common letters? For example, SHIFT? But T at end not allowed? Why can't I try to put T not at the end? 

What about TOILS? We know O eliminated: from guess2, O was marked 'x'. So TOILS: O eliminated? Invalid? 

So let me choose FLITS? 

Another: KLUTZ? K,L,U,T,Z? But T at position4? Allowed? But KLUTZ has L at position2? And I would be missing? We must have the letter I? Because we know I is present? And U? Not eliminated? 

In KLUTZ? No 'I'? So the secret word must have I? Therefore? KLUTZ has K,L,U,T,Z? But no I? So invalid? The guess must include I? Not necessarily? 

Actually, the rules don't require the guess to contain the known letters? But note: we know I is present? So if we don't include I in a guess? Then we might miss out? But we are allowed to guess any 5 letter word? It's not mandatory to include the known letters? However, strategically? We want to confirm positions? So including the known letters would be better? 

Alternatively? We could guess a word that doesn't include I? To check other letters? But that might be efficient? But we know I is present? So why not check it? 

So I think include I? 

So if we don't include I? Then we might not get information on its position? And we have 3 misplaced letters? So including them might be wise? 

So FLITS includes I, L, T? So that's good? 

Therefore? the third guess: FLITS. 

But to note? FLITS might not be the most common word? But it's valid? 

Perhaps there's a better word? 

Another word: STILL? But it has repeated L? And we are not sure? But FLITS has distinct? So better? 

I'll go with FLITS? 

But let's think of position: we'll put:
Position1: some new letter? F?
Position2: L? Which? Then we know L cannot be at position3? But position2 is allowed?
Position3: I? We know I cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Then it could be correct? 
Position4: T? Cannot be at position5? Position4 is allowed?
Position5: S? 

So let's hope? 

Alternatively? We could try STINK? N? eliminated? No? 

So FLITS? 

I think that's the choice? 

Therefore? the third guess is ""flits"".After evaluating the previous feedback, here's my thought process:

### Feedback Analysis:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x,"" eliminating them entirely.
- Guess 2 (""pilot""):
  - P(x) → eliminated.
  - I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - O(x) → eliminated.
  - T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: I, L, T (confirmed via ""-"" feedback).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, P, O.
- **Position constraints**:
  - I ≠ 2nd position.
  - L ≠ 3rd position.
  - T ≠ 5th position.
- **Additional letters needed**: The secret word has 2 more letters besides I, L, T, chosen from unused letters (e.g., S, F, D, M, H, K, etc.).

### Strategy:
- Choose a word with I, L, T (to deduplicate against constraints) and two unused letters.
- Avoid placing I at position 2, L at position 3, or T at position 5.
- Prioritize common letters like S, F, or H to maximize information.

### Selected Word:
- **FLITS**: 
  - F and S are unused common letters.
  - Positions:
    - L in position → avoids L constraint (position 3 forbidden).
    - I in position → avoids I constraint (position 2 forbidden).
    - T in position → avoids T constraint (position 5 forbidden).
  - Proper English word (""to move swiftly""), satisfying guess requirements.",Guess 3: flits -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) I(✓) T(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,blitz,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me tackle this next guess step by step. The user asked for a new 5-letter word guess, and I've got the previous feedback to work with: for ""crane,"" every letter got marked with ""x"" – C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). 

Hmm... that means none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word. That's actually helpful because it eliminates those letters entirely. So C, R, A, N, and E are not part of the secret word. I need to choose a new word with letters not in this set.

Now, what's a good word without those letters? Common letters in 5-letter words might include S, T, O, L, P, M, etc. I could pick something like ""slide"" but wait – E is already eliminated. Let me think carefully...

Words like ""pilot"" – P, I, L, O, T. None of those are C,R,A,N,E. That seems solid. ""Sight"" would be problematic because it ends with T? No, T wasn't eliminated. But let me verify: ""p-i-l-o-t"" – P isn't eliminated, I isn't, L isn't, O isn't, T isn't. Perfect. 

Alternatively, ""mouth"" would work too: M,O,U,T,H – all unused letters. But ""pilot"" feels slightly more common and might yield better positional insights, especially with diverse vowels (I and O). 

I'll go with ""pilot"" for this guess. It avoids all the excluded letters and has a good mix of consonants and vowels. 

So my second guess is ""pilot"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked ""x""), the secret word contains none of the letters: **C, R, A, N, E**. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

For the second guess, I'll choose **""PILOT""** because:
- It uses common letters not excluded (P, I, L, O, T).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C/R/A/N/E).
- It includes vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T) to maximize new information.

<guess>pilot</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have eliminated the letters C, R, A, N, E from the first guess. In the second guess, ""pilot"", we have:
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: x (not in the word)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know the secret word contains the letters I, L, and T, but none of P, O, and previously eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E). Also, note that I, L, T are present but must be in different positions because they are marked as wrong position.

Recall the positions of the second guess: 
Position 1: P (eliminated)
Position 2: I (must be in the word but not in position 2)
Position 3: L (must be in the word but not in position 3)
Position 4: O (eliminated)
Position 5: T (must be in the word but not in position 5)

So the secret word has I, L, T, and two more letters (not from the eliminated set: C, R, A, N, E, P, O). 

We also know the word does not have any of the letters from the previous guesses that were marked 'x' (from guess1: C,R,A,N,E and guess2: P,O).

We need a word that contains I, L, T and two other letters. The positions of I, L, T cannot be at positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

Let me consider possible letters for the remaining two. Common letters that haven't been used: S, U, D, M, H, K, B, G, F, etc.

We can form words with I, L, T and two others. For example: BUILT, GUILT, STILT, etc.

We must avoid positions:
- I cannot be in position 2 (so it was in position 2 in guess2, so it must be in 1,3,4, or 5? but position 3 and 5 are also restricted? Actually, the feedback says the letter is in the word but not in that position. So for I, we know it's not at position 2. Similarly, L is not at position 3, and T is not at position 5.

Now, in the secret word, I could be at 1,3,4? But note: position 3 was L in guess2, and that position is marked '-' meaning L is not at position 3, but it doesn't say anything about having I at position 3. Similarly, position 5 is T was not there, but I could be at 5? 

Constraints:
- I cannot be at position 2.
- L cannot be at position 3.
- T cannot be at position 5.

So valid positions for:
I: 1,3,4
L: 1,2,4,5
T: 1,2,3,4

We need a word that has these three letters and two new ones, and avoids positions that are forbidden.

Let me think of common words with I, L, T:

Possible words:
- TILTS: contains T, I, L, T, S -> but T repeated? Actually, we don't know if T can be repeated? The rules don't say anything, but typically in word games, words can have repeated letters? The feedback format suggests that each letter is marked independently, so repeated letters are allowed? But in this case, our constraints: I must be present, L present, T present. In TILTS, there are two T's, which is acceptable.

However, in ""TILTS"", let's see the positions:
T at pos1, I at pos2, L at pos3, T at pos4, S at pos5.

Check against our constraints:
- I is at position 2: but from guess2, I was at position 2 and marked '-', meaning that I is not at position 2 in the secret. So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, TILTS has I at position 2 -> invalid? Actually, no: if the secret were TILTS, and we guessed ""pilot"" (I at position2) and got ""I(-)"", that would mean that in the secret, I is not at position2, but in TILTS, I is at position2? So indeed, TILTS would not be possible because the feedback contradicts.

Therefore, we must avoid having I at position2. So words with I at 2 are not allowed.

Alternative words:

- BUILT: B,U,I,L,T -> positions: B1, U2, I3, L4, T5
Check constraints:
  - I at position3 -> allowed (since I must not be at position2, and 3 is fine)
  - L at position4 -> allowed (because L was at position3 in guess2 and we know it's not at position3, but 4 is fine)
  - T at position5 -> disallowed! because in guess2, T was at position5 and marked '-' meaning T is not at position5. So T at position5 is forbidden.

Therefore, BUILT has T at position5 -> invalid.

- GUILT: G,U,I,L,T -> T is at position5 -> same problem -> invalid.

- STILT: S,T,I,L,T -> T at1? Let's see: S1, T2, I3, L4, T5
  - T at position2: allowed? T constraint: must not be at position5 -> position2 is allowed.
  - I at position3: allowed (not position2)
  - L at position4: allowed (not position3)
  - T at position5: disallowed! -> because T must not be at position5. So STILT has T at position5 -> invalid.

We need a word without T at position5.

What about moving L to a different position? And I? And T not at 5.

Another common word: LILTS? Not a valid word? 
How about: FLITS? F,L,I,T,S -> positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5.
- L is at position2 -> allowed (since L constraint: not position3)
- I is at position3 -> allowed (not position2)
- T is at position4 -> allowed (not position5)
- Also, the word contains I, L, T and two new letters: F and S, which haven't been eliminated.

Let me check if FLITS is valid? Meaning, is it a word? Yes, it means to move swiftly and lightly.

But we have eliminated letters: none of F or S have been eliminated? We eliminated C,R,A,N,E,P,O. So F and S are fine.

Another option: GLINT? G,L,I,N,T -> but N was eliminated? Wait, guess1: N was eliminated (N(x)). So GLINT has N, which is eliminated -> invalid.

STILL? But if we use STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> positions: S1, T2, I3, L4, L5.
- I: at position3 -> allowed
- L: L at position4 and also at position5? 
But constraints: L constraint is that it must not be at position3 -> so positions 4 and 5 are allowed? Yes.

However, we must check T: T is at position2 -> allowed (not position5). And L is present? There are two L's? The word STILL has two L's. The feedback for L in guess2 was for one L, so we know at least one L is in the word. Two L's would be okay? But note, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? 

But in the feedback, each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two L's and we guess one L at position3, we would get '-' for that one L? And then the other L could be anywhere? However, in our constraints we know L is in the word and not at position3. It doesn't say anything about not being at other positions.

But STILL has T at position2? Allowed? But T must be in the word? Yes, and it is at position2. Also, I at position3: allowed? I cannot be at position2, position3 is allowed? Wait, no constraint says I cannot be at position3? Only that I cannot be at position2. So I at position3 is allowed.

However, STILL has two L's: we must account for the feedback. In guess2, we had L at position3 and it was '-', meaning at least one L is in the word and not at that position. But if there are two L's, then the L at position3 in guess2 might not hit a correctly placed one? Actually, the rules don't specify how duplicate letters are handled? Typically in Wordle-like games, if you have duplicate letters and one is in the correct position, it would get a '✓' for that one and then if the other is missing or wrong position? But the FAQ says: each letter is marked independently? 

But the feedback for guess2: L was marked only once? We must take the feedback as given: one L was in the word but not at position3.

In STILL, the secret word has L at positions 4 and 5. So in guess2, position3 was L -> this L would correspond to a wrong position? It might be that the secret has L at positions 4 and 5, so position3 is wrong? And then the L at position3 in guess2 gets '-'. Meanwhile, we haven't revealed the other L? So that's acceptable? 

But note: we only know that L is not at position3? We don't know if there's another L? However, STILL does have I and T? But T is at position2? Is that allowed? T constraint is that it must not be at position5? So position2 is allowed? And I at 3? Also allowed.

So STILL could be a candidate? However, let's compare to another word without duplicates.

FLITS seems good: F,L,I,T,S -> and avoids duplicates.

Also, another word: MILKT? Not a word? Maybe? 

How about QUILT? But Q is rare. Also, we haven't eliminated Q? But U: not eliminated? Guess2: O was eliminated, but U wasn't? Quilt: Q,U,I,L,T -> T at position5? That's disallowed -> invalid.

So FLITS and STILL seem candidates. But STILL has two L's? It might be. Let me see alternative.

Another word: SLIPT? (past tense of slip) S,L,I,P,T -> P is eliminated? Guess2: P(x) -> P is eliminated? So SLIPT has P -> invalid.

WAIFT? Not common, and F is available? But I think FLITS is better.

What about STILT? We already discussed, but T at position5 is not allowed.

Another: BUILT? T at5 not allowed.

So let me try words without T at the end.

FLITS: letters F, L, I, T, S - none eliminated. Positions:
1: F
2: L -> L constraint: must not be at position3 -> L at position2 allowed? Because the constraint is only against position3? Not position2? So yes.
3: I? But I constraint is that it must not be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Wait, guess2: I was at position2 and marked '-' meaning it is not at position2? So we can have I at position3? 
But then L at position2? That's allowed? But in the secret word, if L is at position2, then note: we have L also at position2? Then our guess2 had L at position3? And we got '-' meaning L is in the word and not at position3? So L at position2 is okay? It would be correct? But the symbol '-' says ""in the word but in the wrong position"". So if in the secret, L is at position2, then when we guessed L at position3 it would not be in the correct position? It would be yellow? So then we can have L at position2? Yes.

Similarly, T at position4? Not position5? Then allowed? And I at position3? However, the constraint for I: it cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? And S at position5? Not yet constrained? 

But wait: the secret word might not have S? So FLITS has S at position5? Is that a problem? We don't know? Also, FLITS has I at position3? And the constraint only said I cannot be at position2? So position3 is fine? 

Now, let's see: is there a reason why FLITS might not work? 

Another word: BLITZ? That has Z? Not eliminated? But FLITS is better? Or STILL?

But STILL uses L twice? And FLITS uses distinct letters? Which gives more information? Let me think? FLITS has distinct letters except no? F,L,I,T,S? All distinct? That's better? Because STILL has repeated L? 

But STILL might be a word? And FLITS is a word? So both are valid? 

But STILL has T? Wait? STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> the T is at position2? Allowed? And I at position3? Allowed? 

But note: the secret word must have I, L, T? And STILL has T? Yes? 

But STILL doesn't have T? Wait, STILL: letters are S,T,I,L,L -> it has T at position2? So T is present? And I? And L? So yes? Then why? 

However, we must be cautious: the T constraint is not at position5? So having T at position2 is allowed? And STILL has T at position2? So it's valid? 

But FLITS has T at position4? Which is also allowed? 

I think for maximising information, FLITS is better because all letters are distinct? We might get clearer feedback? 

Alternatively, consider that since L cannot be at position3, but in FLITS we put L at position2? Which is a new position? And I at position3? 

But wait: we know that L is not at position3? So having L at position3 in a guess? But I think the important point is that the secret word must have L and I and T? So let's form a guess that has I, L, T and two new letters? 

What about SPLIT? It has P? Eliminated? P was eliminated? So no? 

So I think FLITS is a good guess? 

But what about SHIFT? S,H,I,F,T -> H? not eliminated? But wait? SHIFT: S1,H2,I3,F4,T5? Now? T at position5? Disallowed! So SHIFT? T at the end? No? 

Another: LIGHT? L,I,G,H,T -> positions: L1, I2, G3, H4, T5? T at position5? Disallowed? Also I at position2? Disallowed? Because I cannot be at position2? So LIGHT would be an invalid word? 

So I think FLITS is a good candidate? 

Alternatively: WHIST? W,H,I,S,T -> positions: W1,H2,I3,S4,T5? T at position5? Disallowed? So T must not be at position5? 

How about MITTS? M,I,T,T,S? T at position3 and position4? But I at position2? Disallowed? 

So FLITS becomes a strong candidate? 

But how about: SMILT? Smilt? Not a word? 

Or BUILT? T at5 disallowed? 

Then we might go with FLITS? But what about TILTH? T,I,L,T,H? T at position1? But I at position2: disallowed? 

So FLITS: F,L,I,T,S? Positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5. We did already.

We can also consider: GILTH? Not a word? 

So I think FLITS is an acceptable guess? 

But to confirm? Are there other words such as STULM? Not standard? 

Another: QUINT? But N is eliminated? 

So FLITS? 

But perhaps there is a word that covers more common letters? For example, SHIFT? But T at end not allowed? Why can't I try to put T not at the end? 

What about TOILS? We know O eliminated: from guess2, O was marked 'x'. So TOILS: O eliminated? Invalid? 

So let me choose FLITS? 

Another: KLUTZ? K,L,U,T,Z? But T at position4? Allowed? But KLUTZ has L at position2? And I would be missing? We must have the letter I? Because we know I is present? And U? Not eliminated? 

In KLUTZ? No 'I'? So the secret word must have I? Therefore? KLUTZ has K,L,U,T,Z? But no I? So invalid? The guess must include I? Not necessarily? 

Actually, the rules don't require the guess to contain the known letters? But note: we know I is present? So if we don't include I in a guess? Then we might miss out? But we are allowed to guess any 5 letter word? It's not mandatory to include the known letters? However, strategically? We want to confirm positions? So including the known letters would be better? 

Alternatively? We could guess a word that doesn't include I? To check other letters? But that might be efficient? But we know I is present? So why not check it? 

So I think include I? 

So if we don't include I? Then we might not get information on its position? And we have 3 misplaced letters? So including them might be wise? 

So FLITS includes I, L, T? So that's good? 

Therefore? the third guess: FLITS. 

But to note? FLITS might not be the most common word? But it's valid? 

Perhaps there's a better word? 

Another word: STILL? But it has repeated L? And we are not sure? But FLITS has distinct? So better? 

I'll go with FLITS? 

But let's think of position: we'll put:
Position1: some new letter? F?
Position2: L? Which? Then we know L cannot be at position3? But position2 is allowed?
Position3: I? We know I cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Then it could be correct? 
Position4: T? Cannot be at position5? Position4 is allowed?
Position5: S? 

So let's hope? 

Alternatively? We could try STINK? N? eliminated? No? 

So FLITS? 

I think that's the choice? 

Therefore? the third guess is ""flits"".After evaluating the previous feedback, here's my thought process:

### Feedback Analysis:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x,"" eliminating them entirely.
- Guess 2 (""pilot""):
  - P(x) → eliminated.
  - I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - O(x) → eliminated.
  - T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: I, L, T (confirmed via ""-"" feedback).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, P, O.
- **Position constraints**:
  - I ≠ 2nd position.
  - L ≠ 3rd position.
  - T ≠ 5th position.
- **Additional letters needed**: The secret word has 2 more letters besides I, L, T, chosen from unused letters (e.g., S, F, D, M, H, K, etc.).

### Strategy:
- Choose a word with I, L, T (to deduplicate against constraints) and two unused letters.
- Avoid placing I at position 2, L at position 3, or T at position 5.
- Prioritize common letters like S, F, or H to maximize information.

### Selected Word:
- **FLITS**: 
  - F and S are unused common letters.
  - Positions:
    - L in position → avoids L constraint (position 3 forbidden).
    - I in position → avoids I constraint (position 2 forbidden).
    - T in position → avoids T constraint (position 5 forbidden).
  - Proper English word (""to move swiftly""), satisfying guess requirements.

So STILT has T at position5 -> invalid.\n\nWe need a word without T at position5.\n\nWhat about moving L to a different position? And I? And T not at 5.\n\nAnother common word: LILTS? Not a valid word? \nHow about: FLITS? F,L,I,T,S -> positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5.\n- L is at position2 -> allowed (since L constraint: not position3)\n- I is at position3 -> allowed (not position2)\n- T is at position4 -> allowed (not position5)\n- Also, the word contains I, L, T and two new letters: F and S, which haven\'t been eliminated.\n\nLet me check if FLITS is valid? Meaning, is it a word? Yes, it means to move swiftly and lightly.\n\nBut we have eliminated letters: none of F or S have been eliminated? We eliminated C,R,A,N,E,P,O. So F and S are fine.\n\nAnother option: GLINT? G,L,I,N,T -> but N was eliminated? Wait, guess1: N was eliminated (N(x)). So GLINT has N, which is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSTILL? But if we use STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> positions: S1, T2, I3, L4, L5.\n- I: at position3 -> allowed\n- L: L at position4 and also at position5? \nBut constraints: L constraint is that it must not be at position3 -> so positions 4 and 5 are allowed? Yes.\n\nHowever, we must check T: T is at position2 -> allowed (not position5). And L is present? There are two L\'s? The word STILL has two L\'s. The feedback for L in guess2 was for one L, so we know at least one L is in the word. Two L\'s would be okay? But note, we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? \n\nBut in the feedback, each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two L\'s and we guess one L at position3, we would get \'-\' for that one L? And then the other L could be anywhere? However, in our constraints we know L is in the word and not at position3. It doesn\'t say anything about not being at other positions.\n\nBut STILL has T at position2? Allowed? But T must be in the word? Yes, and it is at position2. Also, I at position3: allowed? I cannot be at position2, position3 is allowed? Wait, no constraint says I cannot be at position3? Only that I cannot be at position2. So I at position3 is allowed.\n\nHowever, STILL has two L\'s: we must account for the feedback. In guess2, we had L at position3 and it was \'-\', meaning at least one L is in the word and not at that position. But if there are two L\'s, then the L at position3 in guess2 might not hit a correctly placed one? Actually, the rules don\'t specify how duplicate letters are handled? Typically in Wordle-like games, if you have duplicate letters and one is in the correct position, it would get a \'✓\' for that one and then if the other is missing or wrong position? But the FAQ says: each letter is marked independently? \n\nBut the feedback for guess2: L was marked only once? We must take the feedback as given: one L was in the word but not at position3.\n\nIn STILL, the secret word has L at positions 4 and 5. So in guess2, position3 was L -> this L would correspond to a wrong position? It might be that the secret has L at positions 4 and 5, so position3 is wrong? And then the L at position3 in guess2 gets \'-\'. Meanwhile, we haven\'t revealed the other L? So that\'s acceptable? \n\nBut note: we only know that L is not at position3? We don\'t know if there\'s another L? However, STILL does have I and T? But T is at position2? Is that allowed? T constraint is that it must not be at position5? So position2 is allowed? And I at 3? Also allowed.\n\nSo STILL could be a candidate? However, let\'s compare to another word without duplicates.\n\nFLITS seems good: F,L,I,T,S -> and avoids duplicates.\n\nAlso, another word: MILKT? Not a word? Maybe? \n\nHow about QUILT? But Q is rare. Also, we haven\'t eliminated Q? But U: not eliminated? Guess2: O was eliminated, but U wasn\'t? Quilt: Q,U,I,L,T -> T at position5? That\'s disallowed -> invalid.\n\nSo FLITS and STILL seem candidates. But STILL has two L\'s? It might be. Let me see alternative.\n\nAnother word: SLIPT? (past tense of slip) S,L,I,P,T -> P is eliminated? Guess2: P(x) -> P is eliminated? So SLIPT has P -> invalid.\n\nWAIFT? Not common, and F is available? But I think FLITS is better.\n\nWhat about STILT? We already discussed, but T at position5 is not allowed.\n\nAnother: BUILT? T at5 not allowed.\n\nSo let me try words without T at the end.\n\nFLITS: letters F, L, I, T, S - none eliminated. Positions:\n1: F\n2: L -> L constraint: must not be at position3 -> L at position2 allowed? Because the constraint is only against position3? Not position2? So yes.\n3: I? But I constraint is that it must not be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Wait, guess2: I was at position2 and marked \'-\' meaning it is not at position2? So we can have I at position3? \nBut then L at position2? That\'s allowed? But in the secret word, if L is at position2, then note: we have L also at position2? Then our guess2 had L at position3? And we got \'-\' meaning L is in the word and not at position3? So L at position2 is okay? It would be correct? But the symbol \'-\' says ""in the word but in the wrong position"". So if in the secret, L is at position2, then when we guessed L at position3 it would not be in the correct position? It would be yellow? So then we can have L at position2? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, T at position4? Not position5? Then allowed? And I at position3? However, the constraint for I: it cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? And S at position5? Not yet constrained? \n\nBut wait: the secret word might not have S? So FLITS has S at position5? Is that a problem? We don\'t know? Also, FLITS has I at position3? And the constraint only said I cannot be at position2? So position3 is fine? \n\nNow, let\'s see: is there a reason why FLITS might not work? \n\nAnother word: BLITZ? That has Z? Not eliminated? But FLITS is better? Or STILL?\n\nBut STILL uses L twice? And FLITS uses distinct letters? Which gives more information? Let me think? FLITS has distinct letters except no? F,L,I,T,S? All distinct? That\'s better? Because STILL has repeated L? \n\nBut STILL might be a word? And FLITS is a word? So both are valid? \n\nBut STILL has T? Wait? STILL: S,T,I,L,L -> the T is at position2? Allowed? And I at position3? Allowed? \n\nBut note: the secret word must have I, L, T? And STILL has T? Yes? \n\nBut STILL doesn\'t have T? Wait, STILL: letters are S,T,I,L,L -> it has T at position2? So T is present? And I? And L? So yes? Then why? \n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the T constraint is not at position5? So having T at position2 is allowed? And STILL has T at position2? So it\'s valid? \n\nBut FLITS has T at position4? Which is also allowed? \n\nI think for maximising information, FLITS is better because all letters are distinct? We might get clearer feedback? \n\nAlternatively, consider that since L cannot be at position3, but in FLITS we put L at position2? Which is a new position? And I at position3? \n\nBut wait: we know that L is not at position3? So having L at position3 in a guess? But I think the important point is that the secret word must have L and I and T? So let\'s form a guess that has I, L, T and two new letters? \n\nWhat about SPLIT? It has P? Eliminated? P was eliminated? So no? \n\nSo I think FLITS is a good guess? \n\nBut what about SHIFT? S,H,I,F,T -> H? not eliminated? But wait? SHIFT: S1,H2,I3,F4,T5? Now? T at position5? Disallowed! So SHIFT? T at the end? No? \n\nAnother: LIGHT? L,I,G,H,T -> positions: L1, I2, G3, H4, T5? T at position5? Disallowed? Also I at position2? Disallowed? Because I cannot be at position2? So LIGHT would be an invalid word? \n\nSo I think FLITS is a good candidate? \n\nAlternatively: WHIST? W,H,I,S,T -> positions: W1,H2,I3,S4,T5? T at position5? Disallowed? So T must not be at position5? \n\nHow about MITTS? M,I,T,T,S? T at position3 and position4? But I at position2? Disallowed? \n\nSo FLITS becomes a strong candidate? \n\nBut how about: SMILT? Smilt? Not a word? \n\nOr BUILT? T at5 disallowed? \n\nThen we might go with FLITS? But what about TILTH? T,I,L,T,H? T at position1? But I at position2: disallowed? \n\nSo FLITS: F,L,I,T,S? Positions: F1, L2, I3, T4, S5. We did already.\n\nWe can also consider: GILTH? Not a word? \n\nSo I think FLITS is an acceptable guess? \n\nBut to confirm? Are there other words such as STULM? Not standard? \n\nAnother: QUINT? But N is eliminated? \n\nSo FLITS? \n\nBut perhaps there is a word that covers more common letters? For example, SHIFT? But T at end not allowed? Why can\'t I try to put T not at the end? \n\nWhat about TOILS? We know O eliminated: from guess2, O was marked \'x\'. So TOILS: O eliminated? Invalid? \n\nSo let me choose FLITS? \n\nAnother: KLUTZ? K,L,U,T,Z? But T at position4? Allowed? But KLUTZ has L at position2? And I would be missing? We must have the letter I? Because we know I is present? And U? Not eliminated? \n\nIn KLUTZ? No \'I\'? So the secret word must have I? Therefore? KLUTZ has K,L,U,T,Z? But no I? So invalid? The guess must include I? Not necessarily? \n\nActually, the rules don\'t require the guess to contain the known letters? But note: we know I is present? So if we don\'t include I in a guess? Then we might miss out? But we are allowed to guess any 5 letter word? It\'s not mandatory to include the known letters? However, strategically? We want to confirm positions? So including the known letters would be better? \n\nAlternatively? We could guess a word that doesn\'t include I? To check other letters? But that might be efficient? But we know I is present? So why not check it? \n\nSo I think include I? \n\nSo if we don\'t include I? Then we might not get information on its position? And we have 3 misplaced letters? So including them might be wise? \n\nSo FLITS includes I, L, T? So that\'s good? \n\nTherefore? the third guess: FLITS. \n\nBut to note? FLITS might not be the most common word? But it\'s valid? \n\nPerhaps there\'s a better word? \n\nAnother word: STILL? But it has repeated L? And we are not sure? But FLITS has distinct? So better? \n\nI\'ll go with FLITS? \n\nBut let\'s think of position: we\'ll put:\nPosition1: some new letter? F?\nPosition2: L? Which? Then we know L cannot be at position3? But position2 is allowed?\nPosition3: I? We know I cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Then it could be correct? \nPosition4: T? Cannot be at position5? Position4 is allowed?\nPosition5: S? \n\nSo let\'s hope? \n\nAlternatively? We could try STINK? N? eliminated? No? \n\nSo FLITS? \n\nI think that\'s the choice? \n\nTherefore? the third guess is ""flits"".After evaluating the previous feedback, here\'s my thought process:\n\n### Feedback Analysis:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x,"" eliminating them entirely.\n- Guess 2 (""pilot""):\n  - P(x) → eliminated.\n  - I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.\n  - O(x) → eliminated.\n  - T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Secret word contains**: I, L, T (confirmed via ""-"" feedback).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, P, O.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - I ≠ 2nd position.\n  - L ≠ 3rd position.\n  - T ≠ 5th position.\n- **Additional letters needed**: The secret word has 2 more letters besides I, L, T, chosen from unused letters (e.g., S, F, D, M, H, K, etc.).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Choose a word with I, L, T (to deduplicate against constraints) and two unused letters.\n- Avoid placing I at position 2, L at position 3, or T at position 5.\n- Prioritize common letters like S, F, or H to maximize information.\n\n### Selected Word:\n- **FLITS**: \n  - F and S are unused common letters.\n  - Positions:\n    - L in position → avoids L constraint (position 3 forbidden).\n    - I in position → avoids I constraint (position 2 forbidden).\n    - T in position → avoids T constraint (position 5 forbidden).\n  - Proper English word (""to move swiftly""), satisfying guess requirements.\n\n<guess>flits</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: flits -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) I(✓) T(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""flits"":
- F(x) → F is not in the word.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(✓) → I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has L in position 2, I in position 3, and T in position 4.
- The letters F and S are eliminated (not in the word).

Additionally, we have the previous eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, O.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ L I T _

We need to find the first and last letters.

Constraints:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not eliminated (so not C,R,A,N,E,P,O,F,S). Available letters: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and possibly others, but common ones).
- Position 5: Similarly, must be a letter not eliminated and not in the above list.

We also know from guess 2 that:
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (which we already know, and now we have it at position 3, which is correct).
- L is in the word but not at position 3 (now we have it at position 2, which is correct).
- T is in the word but not at position 5 (now we have it at position 4, which is correct).

So the constraints from guess 2 are satisfied.

Now, we need to fill the first and fifth positions.

Possible words: 
- The word must be of the form ? L I T ?

We can think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common possibilities:
- FLIT? But F is eliminated, and we have FLITS which had F and S eliminated, so FLIT is not possible because it has F and also it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words ending with T? But our pattern is _ L I T _, so the last letter is the fifth character.

Examples:
- DELIT? Not a common word.
- RELIT? But R and E are eliminated.
- UNLIT: U, N, L, I, T -> N is eliminated? Yes, from guess1.
- BUILT: B, U, I, L, T -> but the pattern requires L at position 2? In BUILT, L is at position 4? But we need L at position 2? So no.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is L, position 3 is I, position 4 is T. So the word must be: [letter1] L I T [letter5]

So:
- Position 1: unknown, not eliminated.
- Position 5: unknown, not eliminated.

Common words:
- ""EXIT""? But E and X? E is eliminated? And pattern: E at1, X at2? But we need L at2? So no.
- ""SPLIT""? S and P eliminated? And pattern: S at1, P at2? But we need L at2? So no.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BLITZ"": B at1, L at2, I at3, T at4, Z at5. 
  - B and Z are not eliminated? So possible.
- ""GLITZ"": G at1, L at2, I at3, T at4, Z at5. G and Z not eliminated.
- ""FLITS"" we already tried? But we know it's not because we got feedback.

Other words:
- ""SLIMY""? But M and Y? But pattern: S at1? S is eliminated? And we need T at4? So no.

We need the pattern: ? L I T ?

So:
- ""BLITE""? But E eliminated? And not a common word.
- ""CLIPT""? C eliminated? Not common.

Perhaps less common words? But we need valid English words.

Another: ""OLIVE""? But O eliminated? And pattern doesn't match.

We have to use the available letters.

Available letters for position1 and 5: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words with pattern ?LIT?:
- ""BLITZ"" (meaning a flashy display) → B L I T Z
- ""GLITZ"" (similar meaning) → G L I T Z
- ""FLITT"" not a word? 
- ""SLITS"" S eliminated? 
- ""TWITS"" T at1? But then pattern: T at1, W at2? But we need L at2? So no.

What about ""MILIT""? Not a word? 

""DELIT"" not common? 

""RELIT"" eliminated? 

So the only common words I can think of are ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"". 

But note: we have position5: Z? 

We haven't eliminated Z? 

So both are possible? 

But we need to choose one? 

Alternatively, is there a word like ""LITAS""? But L at position1? But we need L at position2? So no? 

Or ""ALITS""? A eliminated? 

So I think ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"" are the main candidates? 

But we have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 4? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Another word: ""UNLIT"" → U N L I T → N eliminated? 

""INLIT"" not a word? 

""KLUTZ"" → K L U T Z → but pattern: K at1, L at2, U at3? But we need I at3? So no? 

So only ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"" fit the pattern? 

But ""GLITZ"" is a word? Yes? 

We can also consider ""BLITE""? Not common? 

So I think we have to choose between B and G for the first letter? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider if there are words with different last letters? 

What about ""LITHE""? But L at1? And E eliminated? 

""WIDTH""? W I D T H? Pattern: W at1, I at2? But we need L at2? So no? 

So I think ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"" are the only common options? 

But let me confirm: 
- BLITZ: positions 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Z → fits pattern and available letters.
- GLITZ: positions 1:G, 2:L, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Z → same.

We don't have any information about B or G? 

So we need to guess one? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions? And we know the pattern? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has B and G? But we don't have such a word with the fixed positions? 

We have to guess one? 

Since we are at guess 4, we can try ""BLITZ"". 

If it's wrong, then we know it must be ""GLITZ"" for guess 5? 

But we have two guesses left after this? 

We have 6 guesses total? We are about to make guess 4? 

Guesses so far: 1,2,3 → next is 4, then 5 and 6 left? 

So we can try ""BLITZ"". 

But let's see if there is another word? 

What about ""JILTS""? J at1, I at2? But we need L at2? So no? 

""TILTS""? T at1? But then pattern: T at1, I at2? But we need L at2? So no? 

So I think ""BLITZ"" is a good guess? 

But ""GLITZ"" is also possible? 

Perhaps we can use a word that doesn't have Z? But what other words? 

""DELFT""? D E L F T → E and F eliminated? 

""BUILT"" → B U I L T → but L is at position4? We need L at position2? So no? 

So I think we have to go with ""BLITZ"" or ""GLITZ"". 

I'll choose ""BLITZ"" as it is more common? 

But both are valid? 

Alternatively, to be safe? But we have to guess? 

We can also consider: in the feedback, we have no information about B or G? So we must test one? 

So let's guess ""BLITZ"". 

If it's wrong, then we know it's ""GLITZ"". 

But we have two more guesses? So it's acceptable? 

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""blitz"". 

But note: the pattern is fixed? So if ""BLITZ"" is not the word, then ""GLITZ"" must be? 

Are there other words? 

What about ""FLITT""? Not a word? 

Or ""SLITY""? Not a word? 

I think only two possibilities? 

So I'll go with ""BLITZ"". 

But let's double-check the eliminated letters: 
Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,F,S

Available: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And pattern: ? L I T ?

So ""BLITZ"" uses B and Z, both available.

Similarly, ""GLITZ"" uses G and Z.

Another word: ""KLUTZ"" doesn't fit because of U at position3? We need I at position3? 

""QUITZ""? Not a word? 

So yes, only two. 

Therefore, we guess ""BLITZ"".
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (`x`). **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2: ""pilot""** → 
  - P absent (`x`) → Eliminated.
  - I present but wrong position (`-`) → I is in the word, not at position 2.
  - L present but wrong position (`-`) → L is in the word, not at position 3.
  - O absent (`x`) → Eliminated.
  - T present but wrong position (`-`) → T is in the word, not at position 5.  
  **Eliminated additions**: P, O.  
  **Confirmed letters**: I, L, T (all present, but positions unknown except constraints).
- **Guess 3: ""flits""** → 
  - F absent (`x`) → Eliminated.
  - L correct (`✓`) → L is in position 2.
  - I correct (`✓`) → I is in position 3.
  - T correct (`✓`) → T is in position 4.
  - S absent (`x`) → Eliminated.  
  **Eliminated additions**: F, S.  
  **Confirmed positions**: Position 2 = L, Position 3 = I, Position 4 = T.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[?] L I T [?]` (positions 2, 3, 4 are fixed as L, I, T).
- **Eliminated letters (total)**: C, R, A, N, E, P, O, F, S (9 letters).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and other uncommon letters, but prioritizing common English words).
- **Constraints from Guess 2**: I ≠ pos 2 (already resolved), L ≠ pos 3 (resolved), T ≠ pos 5 (still relevant for position 5).

### Deduction:
- The secret word must be a 5-letter word of the form `? L I T ?`.
- Position 1 and 5 must use letters from the available set (not eliminated).
- Position 5 cannot be T (from Guess 2 feedback), but this is already satisfied since T is fixed at position 4.
- Common English words fitting `? L I T ?`:
  - **BLITZ**: B at position 1, Z at position 5.
  - **GLITZ**: G at position 1, Z at position 5.
  - Both are valid (BLITZ = a sudden attack; GLITZ = flashy showiness). No other common words fit the pattern with available letters (e.g., ""FLITT"" is invalid, ""SLITS"" has eliminated S, ""UNLIT"" has eliminated N).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **""BLITZ""** to check if B and Z are correct. If incorrect, ""GLITZ"" will be the logical next guess (only 2 possibilities remain).
- Why ""BLITZ"" over ""GLITZ""? It is slightly more common in usage, and testing it maximizes information:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, we confirm ""GLITZ"" must be the answer (to be used in Guess 5).

<guess>blitz</guess>",blitz,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""flits"":
- F(x) → F is not in the word.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(✓) → I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has L in position 2, I in position 3, and T in position 4.
- The letters F and S are eliminated (not in the word).

Additionally, we have the previous eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, O.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ L I T _

We need to find the first and last letters.

Constraints:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not eliminated (so not C,R,A,N,E,P,O,F,S). Available letters: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and possibly others, but common ones).
- Position 5: Similarly, must be a letter not eliminated and not in the above list.

We also know from guess 2 that:
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (which we already know, and now we have it at position 3, which is correct).
- L is in the word but not at position 3 (now we have it at position 2, which is correct).
- T is in the word but not at position 5 (now we have it at position 4, which is correct).

So the constraints from guess 2 are satisfied.

Now, we need to fill the first and fifth positions.

Possible words: 
- The word must be of the form ? L I T ?

We can think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common possibilities:
- FLIT? But F is eliminated, and we have FLITS which had F and S eliminated, so FLIT is not possible because it has F and also it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words ending with T? But our pattern is _ L I T _, so the last letter is the fifth character.

Examples:
- DELIT? Not a common word.
- RELIT? But R and E are eliminated.
- UNLIT: U, N, L, I, T -> N is eliminated? Yes, from guess1.
- BUILT: B, U, I, L, T -> but the pattern requires L at position 2? In BUILT, L is at position 4? But we need L at position 2? So no.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is L, position 3 is I, position 4 is T. So the word must be: [letter1] L I T [letter5]

So:
- Position 1: unknown, not eliminated.
- Position 5: unknown, not eliminated.

Common words:
- ""EXIT""? But E and X? E is eliminated? And pattern: E at1, X at2? But we need L at2? So no.
- ""SPLIT""? S and P eliminated? And pattern: S at1, P at2? But we need L at2? So no.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BLITZ"": B at1, L at2, I at3, T at4, Z at5. 
  - B and Z are not eliminated? So possible.
- ""GLITZ"": G at1, L at2, I at3, T at4, Z at5. G and Z not eliminated.
- ""FLITS"" we already tried? But we know it's not because we got feedback.

Other words:
- ""SLIMY""? But M and Y? But pattern: S at1? S is eliminated? And we need T at4? So no.

We need the pattern: ? L I T ?

So:
- ""BLITE""? But E eliminated? And not a common word.
- ""CLIPT""? C eliminated? Not common.

Perhaps less common words? But we need valid English words.

Another: ""OLIVE""? But O eliminated? And pattern doesn't match.

We have to use the available letters.

Available letters for position1 and 5: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words with pattern ?LIT?:
- ""BLITZ"" (meaning a flashy display) → B L I T Z
- ""GLITZ"" (similar meaning) → G L I T Z
- ""FLITT"" not a word? 
- ""SLITS"" S eliminated? 
- ""TWITS"" T at1? But then pattern: T at1, W at2? But we need L at2? So no.

What about ""MILIT""? Not a word? 

""DELIT"" not common? 

""RELIT"" eliminated? 

So the only common words I can think of are ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"". 

But note: we have position5: Z? 

We haven't eliminated Z? 

So both are possible? 

But we need to choose one? 

Alternatively, is there a word like ""LITAS""? But L at position1? But we need L at position2? So no? 

Or ""ALITS""? A eliminated? 

So I think ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"" are the main candidates? 

But we have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 4? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Another word: ""UNLIT"" → U N L I T → N eliminated? 

""INLIT"" not a word? 

""KLUTZ"" → K L U T Z → but pattern: K at1, L at2, U at3? But we need I at3? So no? 

So only ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"" fit the pattern? 

But ""GLITZ"" is a word? Yes? 

We can also consider ""BLITE""? Not common? 

So I think we have to choose between B and G for the first letter? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider if there are words with different last letters? 

What about ""LITHE""? But L at1? And E eliminated? 

""WIDTH""? W I D T H? Pattern: W at1, I at2? But we need L at2? So no? 

So I think ""BLITZ"" and ""GLITZ"" are the only common options? 

But let me confirm: 
- BLITZ: positions 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Z → fits pattern and available letters.
- GLITZ: positions 1:G, 2:L, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Z → same.

We don't have any information about B or G? 

So we need to guess one? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions? And we know the pattern? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has B and G? But we don't have such a word with the fixed positions? 

We have to guess one? 

Since we are at guess 4, we can try ""BLITZ"". 

If it's wrong, then we know it must be ""GLITZ"" for guess 5? 

But we have two guesses left after this? 

We have 6 guesses total? We are about to make guess 4? 

Guesses so far: 1,2,3 → next is 4, then 5 and 6 left? 

So we can try ""BLITZ"". 

But let's see if there is another word? 

What about ""JILTS""? J at1, I at2? But we need L at2? So no? 

""TILTS""? T at1? But then pattern: T at1, I at2? But we need L at2? So no? 

So I think ""BLITZ"" is a good guess? 

But ""GLITZ"" is also possible? 

Perhaps we can use a word that doesn't have Z? But what other words? 

""DELFT""? D E L F T → E and F eliminated? 

""BUILT"" → B U I L T → but L is at position4? We need L at position2? So no? 

So I think we have to go with ""BLITZ"" or ""GLITZ"". 

I'll choose ""BLITZ"" as it is more common? 

But both are valid? 

Alternatively, to be safe? But we have to guess? 

We can also consider: in the feedback, we have no information about B or G? So we must test one? 

So let's guess ""BLITZ"". 

If it's wrong, then we know it's ""GLITZ"". 

But we have two more guesses? So it's acceptable? 

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""blitz"". 

But note: the pattern is fixed? So if ""BLITZ"" is not the word, then ""GLITZ"" must be? 

Are there other words? 

What about ""FLITT""? Not a word? 

Or ""SLITY""? Not a word? 

I think only two possibilities? 

So I'll go with ""BLITZ"". 

But let's double-check the eliminated letters: 
Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,F,S

Available: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And pattern: ? L I T ?

So ""BLITZ"" uses B and Z, both available.

Similarly, ""GLITZ"" uses G and Z.

Another word: ""KLUTZ"" doesn't fit because of U at position3? We need I at position3? 

""QUITZ""? Not a word? 

So yes, only two. 

Therefore, we guess ""BLITZ"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (`x`). **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2: ""pilot""** → 
  - P absent (`x`) → Eliminated.
  - I present but wrong position (`-`) → I is in the word, not at position 2.
  - L present but wrong position (`-`) → L is in the word, not at position 3.
  - O absent (`x`) → Eliminated.
  - T present but wrong position (`-`) → T is in the word, not at position 5.  
  **Eliminated additions**: P, O.  
  **Confirmed letters**: I, L, T (all present, but positions unknown except constraints).
- **Guess 3: ""flits""** → 
  - F absent (`x`) → Eliminated.
  - L correct (`✓`) → L is in position 2.
  - I correct (`✓`) → I is in position 3.
  - T correct (`✓`) → T is in position 4.
  - S absent (`x`) → Eliminated.  
  **Eliminated additions**: F, S.  
  **Confirmed positions**: Position 2 = L, Position 3 = I, Position 4 = T.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[?] L I T [?]` (positions 2, 3, 4 are fixed as L, I, T).
- **Eliminated letters (total)**: C, R, A, N, E, P, O, F, S (9 letters).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and other uncommon letters, but prioritizing common English words).
- **Constraints from Guess 2**: I ≠ pos 2 (already resolved), L ≠ pos 3 (resolved), T ≠ pos 5 (still relevant for position 5).

### Deduction:
- The secret word must be a 5-letter word of the form `? L I T ?`.
- Position 1 and 5 must use letters from the available set (not eliminated).
- Position 5 cannot be T (from Guess 2 feedback), but this is already satisfied since T is fixed at position 4.
- Common English words fitting `? L I T ?`:
  - **BLITZ**: B at position 1, Z at position 5.
  - **GLITZ**: G at position 1, Z at position 5.
  - Both are valid (BLITZ = a sudden attack; GLITZ = flashy showiness). No other common words fit the pattern with available letters (e.g., ""FLITT"" is invalid, ""SLITS"" has eliminated S, ""UNLIT"" has eliminated N).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **""BLITZ""** to check if B and Z are correct. If incorrect, ""GLITZ"" will be the logical next guess (only 2 possibilities remain).
- Why ""BLITZ"" over ""GLITZ""? It is slightly more common in usage, and testing it maximizes information:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, we confirm ""GLITZ"" must be the answer (to be used in Guess 5).",Guess 4: blitz -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) I(✓) T(✓) Z(✓),SUCCESS
