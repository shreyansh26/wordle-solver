We are starting the game. Without any prior feedback, we need to make an initial guess.
It's beneficial to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
One popular starting word is ""RAISE"" as it contains common letters: R, A, I, S, E.
Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""CRANE"" are also good. But let's go with ""RAISE"" for now.

Step-by-step:
1. We have no previous feedback, so we choose a word that maximizes information.
2. ""RAISE"" has two vowels (A, E, I are vowels but I is sometimes a consonant, and here we have A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).
3. This will help us gather feedback on these common letters and their positions.

Therefore, our first guess will be ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 for A and position 5 for E).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.

We also know that A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are not in the word).
- Contains A and E (to get more information about their positions).
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

We know A is not in position 2, so it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, and we have positions 1 to 5.

However, we must also consider that E is not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But we have to avoid the letters R, I, S.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and no R, I, S.

Common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions that are not excluded and include other new letters.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""LATEN"" but that's not very common. 
- ""LEAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so avoid.
- ""TEARY"" has R and we know R is not in the word.

We need to avoid R, I, S.

Let me think of words with A and E, without R, I, S.

Some options:
- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. But note, we don't know about P, L, N. Also, A is in position 2? But wait, in ""PLANE"", A is in position 3? Let's check:
  P L A N E -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

But we know that in the secret word, A is not in position 2 (from the first guess), but in this word A is in position 3, which is allowed. However, E is in position 5, and we know E is not in position 5? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So in the secret word, E is not at position 5, but it could be in other positions. In ""PLANE"", E is at position 5, which is the same as the first guess? But we are allowed to guess it, but we know that if we put E at position 5, it will be wrong because the feedback already told us E is not at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess.

Therefore, we should avoid words that have E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid A at position 2.

So for ""PLANE"", E is at position 5 -> not good.

Another word: ""TABLE"": T A B L E
- A is at position 2 -> but we know A is not at position 2 in the secret word? Actually, in the secret word, A is not at position 2, but in our guess we can put it anywhere. However, if we put A at position 2, we know it will be wrong (because the secret word doesn't have A at position 2), so that might not be efficient. We want to put A in a position where it could be correct to get more information.

We know A is in the word but not at position 2, so we should try A in a different position, such as 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E? Not necessarily.

Similarly for E, we should avoid position 5.

So let's try to put A in position 1 and E in position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed.

Another idea: ""AGENT"" -> A G E N T
- A at position 1, E at position 3. This avoids position 2 for A and position 5 for E? Actually, E is at position 3, which is fine. But we don't know about G, N, T.

But note: we have to avoid R, I, S, which we do.

Another common word: ""OCEAN"" -> O C E A N
- Here, E is at position 3, A at position 4. So A is not at 2, and E is not at 5. Also, no R, I, S.

This seems good.

But let's check the letters: O, C, E, A, N. We know E and A are in the word, and we are testing O, C, N.

Alternatively, ""ALONE"": A L O N E
- A at position 1, E at position 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at position 5, we will get a '-' for E? No, because the feedback will show that E is in the word but not at position 5, so it will be marked as '-'. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information about E's position. We want to test E in a new position to see if it is correct there.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 and A at position 2.

So ""ALONE"" has E at position 5 -> not ideal.

Another word: ""LEAVE"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, it has V and L. But note, we have to avoid R, I, S, which we do. However, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, A is at position 3? L E A V E -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E. So A is at position 3, E at positions 2 and 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so the E at position 5 will be wrong, and the E at position 2 might be correct or not. But we are testing E at position 2 and A at position 3.

But the word has duplicate E, which might not be efficient.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""TACET"" is not common.

Let me think of ""ADOBE"": A D O B E -> A at 1, E at 5 -> again E at 5.

""MANGE"" is not a word.

""BEADY"": B E A D Y -> E at position 2, A at position 3. This seems okay: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y.

We know A is not at position 2, but we are putting it at 3. E is at position 2, which is a new position (not 5). And we are testing B, D, Y.

But we have to make sure the word is valid. ""BEADY"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DEALT"" -> D E A L T -> E at 2, A at 3. But we know from the first guess that A is in the word, and E is in the word. Also, avoids R, I, S.

But ""DEALT"" has L and T, which are new.

However, note that the first guess had A at position 2 and E at position 5, both wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2 and A at position 3. This might be a good test.

But we also want to cover other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.

Like ""CAFES"": C A F E S -> but S is in the word, and we know S is not in the secret word. So invalid.

""CAKED"": C A K E D -> A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so if we put it at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get a '-' for A, but we already know A is in the word, so it doesn't tell us much about the position. We want to try A in a position where it might be correct.

So we should avoid position 2 for A.

Similarly, avoid position 5 for E.

So for ""CAKED"", A is at 2 -> not good.

""HAVEN"": H A V E N -> A at 2 -> not good.

""LATER"": has R -> not allowed.

""WATER"": has R? W A T E R -> R at the end, but R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, I, S.

So let's list possible words: 

- ""BEADY"": B E A D Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y
- ""DEALT"": D E A L T -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T
- ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N

In ""OCEAN"", E is at position 3 and A at position 4. Both are new positions. And we test O, C, N.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", we test D, L, T.

Which one is better? ""OCEAN"" has the advantage that it places E and A in positions that are not the ones we tried before, and it uses common letters.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now in ""OCEAN"", we have E at 3 and A at 4. So we are testing two new positions for E and A.

Also, we are introducing O, C, N.

Another word: ""ULNAE"" is not common.

I think ""OCEAN"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: we know the secret word has A and E, and no R, I, S.

We are guessing ""OCEAN"".

If the feedback shows:
- If O is not in the word, we get x.
- If C is not in the word, we get x.
- E at position 3: if it is correct, we get ✓, else if it is in the word but wrong position, we get -, else x (but we know E is in the word, so it won't be x, but it could be - if not at position 3).
Similarly for A at position 4.

This should give us good information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 3, for example.

Like ""BAKER"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word.

""MAKER"" -> same.

""PALED"": P A L E D -> A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so we will get a '-' for A, which we already know. So it doesn't help for A's position. We want to test a new position for A.

In ""PALED"", A is at 2 -> not good.

""PLANE"": P L A N E -> A at 3, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5), so we will get a '-' for E, which we already know. So it doesn't help for E's position.

Therefore, ""OCEAN"" seems better because both E and A are in new positions (3 and 4) that are not excluded.

So I will go with ""OCEAN"".

But let's see if there is a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.

""CAFES"" has S -> invalid.

""HAZEL"": H A Z E L -> A at 2 -> not good.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so the E at 5 will be wrong. Also, A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so that will be wrong too. So we are testing E at position 1 and A at position 3? Wait, in ""EAGLE"": 
- Position 1: E -> if E is at position 1, we get ✓, else if it's in the word but not 1, we get -, else x (but we know it's in the word, so not x).
- Position 2: A -> we know it's not at 2, so we get -.
- Position 3: G -> unknown.
- Position 4: L -> unknown.
- Position 5: E -> we know it's not at 5, so we get -.

So we get some information: if E is at position 1, we get a ✓, otherwise we get a - for position 1. And for A, we get a - at position 2 (which we know). And we test G and L.

But we are using two positions for E, and one is known to be wrong (position 5).

So it might be less efficient.

Therefore, I think ""OCEAN"" is a better choice.

We'll go with ""OCEAN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and S are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using R, I, or S.
- Include A and E, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for A, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (like O, C, N) to gather more information.

The word ""OCEAN"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (placed at position 4) and E (placed at position 3), both in new untested positions.
- Introduces new letters: O, C, N.
- Avoids R, I, S.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E and reveal if any of O, C, or N are in the secret word.

<guess>OCEAN</guess>",OCEAN,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 for A and position 5 for E).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.

Similarly, we should avoid A at position 2.

So for ""PLANE"", E is at position 5 -> not good.

- A is at position 2 -> but we know A is not at position 2 in the secret word? Actually, in the secret word, A is not at position 2, but in our guess we can put it anywhere.

""WATER"": has R? W A T E R -> R at the end, but R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, I, S.

So let's list possible words: 

- ""BEADY"": B E A D Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y
- ""DEALT"": D E A L T -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T
- ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N

In ""OCEAN"", E is at position 3 and A at position 4. Both are new positions. And we test O, C, N.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", we test D, L, T.

Which one is better? ""OCEAN"" has the advantage that it places E and A in positions that are not the ones we tried before, and it uses common letters.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now in ""OCEAN"", we have E at 3 and A at 4. So we are testing two new positions for E and A.

Also, we are introducing O, C, N.

Another word: ""ULNAE"" is not common.

I think ""OCEAN"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: we know the secret word has A and E, and no R, I, S.

We are guessing ""OCEAN"".

If the feedback shows:
- If O is not in the word, we get x.
- If C is not in the word, we get x.
- E at position 3: if it is correct, we get ✓, else if it is in the word but wrong position, we get -, else x (but we know E is in the word, so it won't be x, but it could be - if not at position 3).
Similarly for A at position 4.

This should give us good information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 3, for example.

Like ""BAKER"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word.

""MAKER"" -> same.

""PALED"": P A L E D -> A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so we will get a '-' for A, which we already know. So it doesn't help for A's position. We want to test a new position for A.

In ""PALED"", A is at 2 -> not good.

""PLANE"": P L A N E -> A at 3, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5), so we will get a '-' for E, which we already know. So it doesn't help for E's position.

Therefore, ""OCEAN"" seems better because both E and A are in new positions (3 and 4) that are not excluded.

So I will go with ""OCEAN"".

But let's see if there is a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.

""CAFES"" has S -> invalid.

""HAZEL"": H A Z E L -> A at 2 -> not good.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so the E at 5 will be wrong. Also, A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so that will be wrong too. So we are testing E at position 1 and A at position 3? Wait, in ""EAGLE"": 
- Position 1: E -> if E is at position 1, we get ✓, else if it's in the word but not 1, we get -, else x (but we know it's in the word, so not x).
- Position 2: A -> we know it's not at 2, so we get -.
- Position 3: G -> unknown.
- Position 4: L -> unknown.
- Position 5: E -> we know it's not at 5, so we get -.

So we get some information: if E is at position 1, we get a ✓, otherwise we get a - for position 1. And for A, we get a - at position 2 (which we know). And we test G and L.

But we are using two positions for E, and one is known to be wrong (position 5).

So it might be less efficient.

Therefore, I think ""OCEAN"" is a better choice.

We'll go with ""OCEAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and S are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using R, I, or S.
- Include A and E, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for A, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (like O, C, N) to gather more information.

The word ""OCEAN"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (placed at position 4) and E (placed at position 3), both in new untested positions.
- Introduces new letters: O, C, N.
- Avoids R, I, S.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E and reveal if any of O, C, or N are in the secret word.",Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) C(x) E(✓) A(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,agent,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Without any prior feedback, we need to make an initial guess.
It's beneficial to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
One popular starting word is ""RAISE"" as it contains common letters: R, A, I, S, E.
Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""CRANE"" are also good. But let's go with ""RAISE"" for now.

Step-by-step:
1. We have no previous feedback, so we choose a word that maximizes information.
2. ""RAISE"" has two vowels (A, E, I are vowels but I is sometimes a consonant, and here we have A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).
3. This will help us gather feedback on these common letters and their positions.

Therefore, our first guess will be ""RAISE"".

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 for A and position 5 for E).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.

We also know that A is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, I, S (since they are not in the word).
- Contains A and E (to get more information about their positions).
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

We know A is not in position 2, so it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, and we have positions 1 to 5.

However, we must also consider that E is not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But we have to avoid the letters R, I, S.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and no R, I, S.

Common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions that are not excluded and include other new letters.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""LATEN"" but that's not very common. 
- ""LEAST"" has S and we know S is not in the word, so avoid.
- ""TEARY"" has R and we know R is not in the word.

We need to avoid R, I, S.

Let me think of words with A and E, without R, I, S.

Some options:
- ""PLANE"": has P, L, A, N, E. But note, we don't know about P, L, N. Also, A is in position 2? But wait, in ""PLANE"", A is in position 3? Let's check:
  P L A N E -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

But we know that in the secret word, A is not in position 2 (from the first guess), but in this word A is in position 3, which is allowed. However, E is in position 5, and we know E is not in position 5? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So in the secret word, E is not at position 5, but it could be in other positions. In ""PLANE"", E is at position 5, which is the same as the first guess? But we are allowed to guess it, but we know that if we put E at position 5, it will be wrong because the feedback already told us E is not at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess.

Therefore, we should avoid words that have E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid A at position 2.

So for ""PLANE"", E is at position 5 -> not good.

Another word: ""TABLE"": T A B L E
- A is at position 2 -> but we know A is not at position 2 in the secret word? Actually, in the secret word, A is not at position 2, but in our guess we can put it anywhere. However, if we put A at position 2, we know it will be wrong (because the secret word doesn't have A at position 2), so that might not be efficient. We want to put A in a position where it could be correct to get more information.

We know A is in the word but not at position 2, so we should try A in a different position, such as 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E? Not necessarily.

Similarly for E, we should avoid position 5.

So let's try to put A in position 1 and E in position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed.

Another idea: ""AGENT"" -> A G E N T
- A at position 1, E at position 3. This avoids position 2 for A and position 5 for E? Actually, E is at position 3, which is fine. But we don't know about G, N, T.

But note: we have to avoid R, I, S, which we do.

Another common word: ""OCEAN"" -> O C E A N
- Here, E is at position 3, A at position 4. So A is not at 2, and E is not at 5. Also, no R, I, S.

This seems good.

But let's check the letters: O, C, E, A, N. We know E and A are in the word, and we are testing O, C, N.

Alternatively, ""ALONE"": A L O N E
- A at position 1, E at position 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at position 5, we will get a '-' for E? No, because the feedback will show that E is in the word but not at position 5, so it will be marked as '-'. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information about E's position. We want to test E in a new position to see if it is correct there.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 and A at position 2.

So ""ALONE"" has E at position 5 -> not ideal.

Another word: ""LEAVE"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, it has V and L. But note, we have to avoid R, I, S, which we do. However, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, A is at position 3? L E A V E -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E. So A is at position 3, E at positions 2 and 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so the E at position 5 will be wrong, and the E at position 2 might be correct or not. But we are testing E at position 2 and A at position 3.

But the word has duplicate E, which might not be efficient.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""TACET"" is not common.

Let me think of ""ADOBE"": A D O B E -> A at 1, E at 5 -> again E at 5.

""MANGE"" is not a word.

""BEADY"": B E A D Y -> E at position 2, A at position 3. This seems okay: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y.

We know A is not at position 2, but we are putting it at 3. E is at position 2, which is a new position (not 5). And we are testing B, D, Y.

But we have to make sure the word is valid. ""BEADY"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DEALT"" -> D E A L T -> E at 2, A at 3. But we know from the first guess that A is in the word, and E is in the word. Also, avoids R, I, S.

But ""DEALT"" has L and T, which are new.

However, note that the first guess had A at position 2 and E at position 5, both wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2 and A at position 3. This might be a good test.

But we also want to cover other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.

Like ""CAFES"": C A F E S -> but S is in the word, and we know S is not in the secret word. So invalid.

""CAKED"": C A K E D -> A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so if we put it at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get a '-' for A, but we already know A is in the word, so it doesn't tell us much about the position. We want to try A in a position where it might be correct.

So we should avoid position 2 for A.

Similarly, avoid position 5 for E.

So for ""CAKED"", A is at 2 -> not good.

""HAVEN"": H A V E N -> A at 2 -> not good.

""LATER"": has R -> not allowed.

""WATER"": has R? W A T E R -> R at the end, but R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, I, S.

So let's list possible words: 

- ""BEADY"": B E A D Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y
- ""DEALT"": D E A L T -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T
- ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N

In ""OCEAN"", E is at position 3 and A at position 4. Both are new positions. And we test O, C, N.

Similarly, in ""DEALT"", we test D, L, T.

Which one is better? ""OCEAN"" has the advantage that it places E and A in positions that are not the ones we tried before, and it uses common letters.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now in ""OCEAN"", we have E at 3 and A at 4. So we are testing two new positions for E and A.

Also, we are introducing O, C, N.

Another word: ""ULNAE"" is not common.

I think ""OCEAN"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: we know the secret word has A and E, and no R, I, S.

We are guessing ""OCEAN"".

If the feedback shows:
- If O is not in the word, we get x.
- If C is not in the word, we get x.
- E at position 3: if it is correct, we get ✓, else if it is in the word but wrong position, we get -, else x (but we know E is in the word, so it won't be x, but it could be - if not at position 3).
Similarly for A at position 4.

This should give us good information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 3, for example.

Like ""BAKER"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word.

""MAKER"" -> same.

""PALED"": P A L E D -> A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so we will get a '-' for A, which we already know. So it doesn't help for A's position. We want to test a new position for A.

In ""PALED"", A is at 2 -> not good.

""PLANE"": P L A N E -> A at 3, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5), so we will get a '-' for E, which we already know. So it doesn't help for E's position.

Therefore, ""OCEAN"" seems better because both E and A are in new positions (3 and 4) that are not excluded.

So I will go with ""OCEAN"".

But let's see if there is a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.

""CAFES"" has S -> invalid.

""HAZEL"": H A Z E L -> A at 2 -> not good.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so the E at 5 will be wrong. Also, A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so that will be wrong too. So we are testing E at position 1 and A at position 3? Wait, in ""EAGLE"": 
- Position 1: E -> if E is at position 1, we get ✓, else if it's in the word but not 1, we get -, else x (but we know it's in the word, so not x).
- Position 2: A -> we know it's not at 2, so we get -.
- Position 3: G -> unknown.
- Position 4: L -> unknown.
- Position 5: E -> we know it's not at 5, so we get -.

So we get some information: if E is at position 1, we get a ✓, otherwise we get a - for position 1. And for A, we get a - at position 2 (which we know). And we test G and L.

But we are using two positions for E, and one is known to be wrong (position 5).

This seems okay: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y.\n\nWe know A is not at position 2, but we are putting it at 3. E is at position 2, which is a new position (not 5). And we are testing B, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid. ""BEADY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""DEALT"" -> D E A L T -> E at 2, A at 3. But we know from the first guess that A is in the word, and E is in the word. Also, avoids R, I, S.\n\nBut ""DEALT"" has L and T, which are new.\n\nHowever, note that the first guess had A at position 2 and E at position 5, both wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2 and A at position 3. This might be a good test.\n\nBut we also want to cover other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.\n\nLike ""CAFES"": C A F E S -> but S is in the word, and we know S is not in the secret word. So invalid.\n\n""CAKED"": C A K E D -> A at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so if we put it at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get a \'-\' for A, but we already know A is in the word, so it doesn\'t tell us much about the position. We want to try A in a position where it might be correct.\n\nSo we should avoid position 2 for A.\n\nSimilarly, avoid position 5 for E.\n\nSo for ""CAKED"", A is at 2 -> not good.\n\n""HAVEN"": H A V E N -> A at 2 -> not good.\n\n""LATER"": has R -> not allowed.\n\n""WATER"": has R? W A T E R -> R at the end, but R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.\n\nWe must avoid R, I, S.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words: \n\n- ""BEADY"": B E A D Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y\n- ""DEALT"": D E A L T -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T\n- ""OCEAN"": O C E A N -> 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N\n\nIn ""OCEAN"", E is at position 3 and A at position 4. Both are new positions. And we test O, C, N.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DEALT"", we test D, L, T.\n\nWhich one is better? ""OCEAN"" has the advantage that it places E and A in positions that are not the ones we tried before, and it uses common letters.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now in ""OCEAN"", we have E at 3 and A at 4. So we are testing two new positions for E and A.\n\nAlso, we are introducing O, C, N.\n\nAnother word: ""ULNAE"" is not common.\n\nI think ""OCEAN"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: we know the secret word has A and E, and no R, I, S.\n\nWe are guessing ""OCEAN"".\n\nIf the feedback shows:\n- If O is not in the word, we get x.\n- If C is not in the word, we get x.\n- E at position 3: if it is correct, we get ✓, else if it is in the word but wrong position, we get -, else x (but we know E is in the word, so it won\'t be x, but it could be - if not at position 3).\nSimilarly for A at position 4.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 3, for example.\n\nLike ""BAKER"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word.\n\n""MAKER"" -> same.\n\n""PALED"": P A L E D -> A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so we will get a \'-\' for A, which we already know. So it doesn\'t help for A\'s position. We want to test a new position for A.\n\nIn ""PALED"", A is at 2 -> not good.\n\n""PLANE"": P L A N E -> A at 3, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5), so we will get a \'-\' for E, which we already know. So it doesn\'t help for E\'s position.\n\nTherefore, ""OCEAN"" seems better because both E and A are in new positions (3 and 4) that are not excluded.\n\nSo I will go with ""OCEAN"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that has A at position 1 and E at position 4, for example.\n\n""CAFES"" has S -> invalid.\n\n""HAZEL"": H A Z E L -> A at 2 -> not good.\n\n""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so the E at 5 will be wrong. Also, A at position 2 -> we know A is not at position 2, so that will be wrong too. So we are testing E at position 1 and A at position 3? Wait, in ""EAGLE"": \n- Position 1: E -> if E is at position 1, we get ✓, else if it\'s in the word but not 1, we get -, else x (but we know it\'s in the word, so not x).\n- Position 2: A -> we know it\'s not at 2, so we get -.\n- Position 3: G -> unknown.\n- Position 4: L -> unknown.\n- Position 5: E -> we know it\'s not at 5, so we get -.\n\nSo we get some information: if E is at position 1, we get a ✓, otherwise we get a - for position 1. And for A, we get a - at position 2 (which we know). And we test G and L.\n\nBut we are using two positions for E, and one is known to be wrong (position 5).\n\nSo it might be less efficient.\n\nTherefore, I think ""OCEAN"" is a better choice.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""OCEAN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and S are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using R, I, or S.\n- Include A and E, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for A, not position 5 for E).\n- Test new common letters (like O, C, N) to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""OCEAN"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A (placed at position 4) and E (placed at position 3), both in new untested positions.\n- Introduces new letters: O, C, N.\n- Avoids R, I, S.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E and reveal if any of O, C, or N are in the secret word.\n\n<guess>OCEAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) C(x) E(✓) A(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""RAISE"": 
- R(x) : not in word
- A(-) : A is in word but not in position 2 (index 2)
- I(x) : not in word
- S(x) : not in word
- E(-) : E is in word but not in position 5 (index 5)

Second guess ""OCEAN"":
- O(x) : not in word
- C(x) : not in word
- E(✓) : E is correct and in position 3 (index 3)
- A(-) : A is in word but not in position 4 (index 4)
- N(-) : N is in word but not in position 5 (index 5)

What we know:
1. The secret word contains: A, E, N (because of '-' and '✓' in both guesses).
2. Letters not in the word: R, I, S, O, C (from 'x' in both guesses).
3. Positions:
   - E is at position 3 (from ""OCEAN"" feedback: E(✓)).
   - A is not in position 2 (from ""RAISE"") and not in position 4 (from ""OCEAN"").
   - N is in the word but not in position 5 (from ""OCEAN"" feedback: N(-)).

Also, from ""RAISE"", we know E is not at position 5 (but now we know E is at position 3).

We need to find a word that:
- Is 5 letters, valid English word.
- Contains A, E, N (and possibly other letters).
- Does not contain R, I, S, O, C.
- E must be at position 3 (fixed).
- A not at position 2 or 4.
- N not at position 5.

Since E is fixed at position 3, the word has the form: _ _ E _ _

Now, A must be in the word but not at position 2 or 4. Possible positions for A: 1 or 5? Because positions 3 is taken by E.

Similarly, N must be in the word but not at position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 4.

But N could be at positions 1,2,4 and A at positions 1,5. Note that position 1 cannot have both A and N, so we need to assign them to different positions.

Possible structures:

Case 1: A at position 1
Then word: A _ E _ _
N must be at 2 or 4? (since not 5, and 1 is taken by A). So either:
- A N E _ _
- A _ E N _

Case 2: A at position 5
Then word: _ _ E _ A
N must be at 1,2,4? But 5 is taken by A. So:
- N _ E _ A
- _ N E _ A
- _ _ E N A

But note, we have other letters to fill.

We also need to consider that the word must contain A, E, N and two other distinct letters? Or possibly repeated letters? But from feedback, we have only seen one A and one E so far, but it could have duplicates? E is fixed at 3, and we know E is not at 5 but that doesn't prevent another E? However, in ""RAISE"", we had E at 5 and got '-', meaning there might be only one E? Not necessarily — it could be that there is another E, but since we know E is at position 3, if there is another E, it would be marked appropriately.

But let's assume for now that we don't have duplicate letters unless necessary, to keep it simple.

Now, we know the letters not in the word: R, I, S, O, C. So available letters: A-Z minus those, and minus the known included ones? Actually, we have A, E, N must be included, and two more.

We don't know what the other letters are.

We can think of common letters that haven't been tried: for example, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: A at position 1
- Option 1A: A N E _ _
  We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be valid. And N is at position 2? Yes.
  Examples: ANGER? but has R (not allowed). ANGLE? has L and E but E is at 5? Wait, positions: A N G L E -> E at position 5? But we have E fixed at 3, so if we put E at 3, then in ""A N E _ _"", the E is at 3. So for positions 4 and 5: any letters? But we cannot use R, I, S, O, C.

  Possible words: 
  - ""ANEW ..."" but 5 letters: ""ANEW"" is 4. Not enough.
  - ""ANVIL"" has I and V? But positions: ""ANV I L"" -> wait, we have E at 3? We need A N E at 1,2,3 -> then two more letters: say ""ANV E L"" -> wait, we have E at 3? The word is A N E V L? Not a word.

  Actually, with A N E at 1,2,3, we need words ending with two letters. For example, ""ANODE"" but O is not allowed? O is excluded. ""ANISE"" has S and I? Excluded.

  Another: ""ANKLE"" -> A N K L E -> positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:E? No, E at 3? But ""ANKLE"" is A N K L E -> so it's A(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5). But we need E at position 3? So if we want E at position 3, it must be _ _ E _ _, so if first three are A N E, then word: A N E ? ?

  Example: ""ANEAR"" -> but R excluded? ""ANEAR"" has R? Not valid and R not allowed.

  Another: ""ANELT""? Not a word.

  Let's try: ""ANELE"" not common.

  So ""AN"" at start with E at 3 might be limited.

- Option 1B: A _ E N _
  Word: A ? E N ? (positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:?)

  We know A at 1, E at 3, N at 4. Position 2 and 5 are unknown.

  Also, we have to avoid R, I, S, O, C.

  Common words: like ""AGENT"" but has G? Yes, but let's see: A G E N T -> but in our structure, it would be A, G, E, N, T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:E, 4:N, 5:T.

  This word: ""AGENT"" — valid? Yes.

  But note: we know from earlier that in ""OCEAN"", N is not at position 5? But here N is at position 4? So that should be fine? Wait, in ""OCEAN"" feedback, N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 5, so it can be at other positions. In ""AGENT"", N is at position 4, which is not 5, so okay.

  Also, A at position 1: we haven't tested position 1 before? In first guess, RAISE had R at 1? But A was at 2. So we don't know about A at position 1.

  Now, position 2: G, which is new.

  Position 5: T, new.

  This seems good.

  But check if any constraints broken? E at 3: correct. A not at 2 or 4: here at 1, good. N at 4: we know from feedback that N is not at position 5? But position 4 is allowed? Also, N could be at position 4? Yes.

Case 2: A at position 5

- Option 2A: N _ E _ A -> positions:1:N, 2:?, 3:E, 4:?, 5:A
  Example: ""NUTEA""? Not word.

  ""NULLE""? Not.

  ""NYL E A""? Not.

  ""NONCE"" has O? Excluded.

  ""NAIVE"" has I? Excluded.

  Hard to find.

- Option 2B: _ N E _ A
  Positions:1:?, 2:N, 3:E, 4:?, 5:A
  Example: ""UNI E A""? Only possible words: ""UNLEA""? Not valid? ""UNZ E A""? Not.

  ""ANELE"" is not common.

  ""INLET"" has I? Excluded.

  Few options.

- Option 2C: _ _ E N A -> positions:1:?, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A
  Example: ""ALENA""? Not common? Or ""SENA""? Not 5 letters? Wait, 5 letters: ""SENNA"" has S and double N? But S excluded.

  ""B E N N A"" -> ""BENNA""? Valid word? Uncommon.

  ""VEN A"" -> not 5.

  I think this case is less likely.

Given that, Option 1B: ""AGENT"" seems a strong candidate.

But wait, in ""AGENT"":
- A at 1: could be correct?
- G at 2: unknown
- E at 3: correct (so ✓ for E)
- N at 4: but from feedback in ""OCEAN"", we know N is not at position 5? But position 4 is open? Also, N must be in the word? We have N in the word? But in ""OCEAN"" we got N(-) meaning N is in the word? Yes.

Also, we need to check if N could be at position 4? Since we haven't tried position 4 for N? Yes.

But we also have position 5: T? Unknown.

Could we verify if there are other possibilities?

Another word in Case 1B: like ""AFENT""? Not common.

""ADENY""? Not word.

""ALERT"" has R? Excluded.

So ""AGENT"" is a common word.

We must consider that there might be more than one ""A""? But from the feedback, in ""RAISE"", A was at position 2 and not correct? Similarly, in ""OCEAN"" A at position 4 and not correct? So in ""AGENT"", A is at position 1? If it is correct, we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere, we get '-'. And similarly for others.

But since A is already known to be in the word, and only position matters.

However, note that in ""AGENT"", we have A at position 1. We don't know if that is correct.

Another possibility: A might not be at position 1? But we have to put it at 1 or 5? But that was under case 1 or 2.

Wait, we also have Case 1C: if A is not at 1 or 5? But earlier I thought only 1 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are excluded? But what about position 3? Position 3 is fixed for E? So A cannot be at 3.

Similarly, position 4 we know A not at 4? From ""OCEAN"" feedback? So A cannot be at 4? So only positions 1 and 5 for A? Yes.

Similarly for N: it cannot be at position 5 (from ""OCEAN"")? But positions can be 1,2,4? But in ""AGENT"", N is at 4? And that could be correct or not? We'll get feedback.

But wait: in ""OCEAN"", we got N(-) meaning N is not at position 5? So in ""AGENT"", if N is at 4? That should be acceptable? Because position 4 is different from 5.

So ""AGENT"" seems fine.

But let me check if there are other words.

For example, if we have A at position 5? But we struggled to find words.

Alternative: what about the position 2? For example, if we have the word: _ _ E N _ with A at 5? But then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A? Word?

""VENGA""? Not English.

""PENNA""? Has P? And not common? Also, double N? Positions: P E N N A? Then E at 3? And N at 4? And last A? So it's P E N N A? The word would have two N's? But we haven't been told anything against duplicates? And the feedback: in ""OCEAN"" we had only one N? So if there's an additional N? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Or all? Actually, Wordle rules: each letter is checked independently? And position matters per occurrence.

But in our case, ""OCEAN"" had N at position 5? Which was marked as not correct position, so implying there is at least one N? But if there is another N? We don't know? But when we guess, we'll see.

Still, ""PENNA"" is a rare word.

Better to stick to common words.

Another common word: in the structure A _ E N _ -> ""AGENT"" is good.

But also ""AMEND"": A M E N D -> has M and D? But let's see: positions:1:A, 2:M, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.

This also fits! And ""AMEND"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""ATTEN"" is not a word? Wait, ""ATTEN"" D?

""ASHEN"" has S? Excluded.

""AXMEN""? Not.

So both ""AGENT"" and ""AMEND"" are possible? How to choose?

Also, ""ABEND""? Not common.

But note: we need to maximize information? Since we haven't tested many letters, we could choose a word with more common letters? Or simply try one.

Another word: ""ALERT"" is excluded because of R.

So among ""AGENT"" and ""AMEND"", both are valid.

But we have E fixed at position 3? And we'll test new letters? In ""AGENT"": G and T? In ""AMEND"": M and D.

Now, we don't know which is more common? Perhaps arbitrary choice.

But notice in the feedback? We have two '-' for A? Meaning the position is not found? But we don't know how many times A appears? In ""AGENT"", A is at position 1? If A is actually at position 5? Then we get a '-' for A at 1? And then we would know A must be at 5? Similarly for other, but in that case, we make progress.

Alternatively, if the word is ""AGENT"", then our guess would be correct? But we don't know.

Another structure: could N be at position 2? For example, word: A N E _ _ ? But we found few words? But let me check: ""AN E S T"" but S excluded.

""AN E X T"" -> ""ANEXT"" not a word? ""INDEX"" has I? Not.

So harder? Therefore, probably either A at 1 with N at 4? Or A at 5.

But A at 5 also hard? So likely A at 1? Then ""AGENT"" or ""AMEND"".

Which one? Let's pick ""AGENT"" because it has G and T which are common? Or ""AMEND"" with M and D? Also? We need to choose.

Also, note in ""RAISE"", we had A at position 2? Now we put at position 1? So we are testing a new position.

Similarly, in ""OCEAN"", we had A at position 4? Now at 1? So good? 

I think either is fine. Let me pick ""AGENT"".

But wait: we don't know if N could be at position 4? But we'll find out.

If we guess ""AGENT"" and the feedback? 

- If A is at position 1? Then ✓ for A.
- G at position 2: unknown? Could be ✓, -, or x?
- E at 3: ✓
- N at 4: could be correct? Or not? If not, we get? If N is in the word but position 4 is not correct? Then '-'? Or if it is correct? Then ✓?
- T at 5: unknown?

But we know N is in the word? So even if position 4 is not correct for N? We get '-', meaning N is at a different position?

In our case? We assumed N at 4? But if it's not? Then we learn? So it's fine.

Moreover, there is another possibility: what if A is not at position 1? Then our guess ""AGENT"" would have A at 1? Which is wrong? So we get '-' for A? Then we know A must be at position 5? And the word must be like _ _ E _ A? With N in the word? Not at position 5? So at 1,2,4? But 4? Then the word is _ _ E N A? Then we need to fill positions 1 and 2? Without R,I,S,O,C? And also? The letters must match? 

But for now, we can try ""AGENT"" to get more information.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AGENT"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:
- **Secret word contains**: A, E, N (due to '-' or '✓' feedback).
- **Secret word does not contain**: R, I, S, O, C (due to 'x' feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - E must be in position 3 (from E(✓) in Guess 2).
  - A cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2).
  - N cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 2).
- The secret word structure is _ _ E _ _, with E fixed at position 3.

Considering the constraints, A can only be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded, and position 3 is occupied by E). Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 5 is excluded). After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints and exclude forbidden letters, ""AGENT"" was chosen as it:
- Places A at position 1 (a new position to test).
- Places N at position 4 (a new position to test).
- Tests new common letters G and T.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>AGENT</guess>",AGENT,"We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""RAISE"": 
- R(x) : not in word
- A(-) : A is in word but not in position 2 (index 2)
- I(x) : not in word
- S(x) : not in word
- E(-) : E is in word but not in position 5 (index 5)

Second guess ""OCEAN"":
- O(x) : not in word
- C(x) : not in word
- E(✓) : E is correct and in position 3 (index 3)
- A(-) : A is in word but not in position 4 (index 4)
- N(-) : N is in word but not in position 5 (index 5)

What we know:
1. The secret word contains: A, E, N (because of '-' and '✓' in both guesses).
2. Letters not in the word: R, I, S, O, C (from 'x' in both guesses).
3. Positions:
   - E is at position 3 (from ""OCEAN"" feedback: E(✓)).
   - A is not in position 2 (from ""RAISE"") and not in position 4 (from ""OCEAN"").
   - N is in the word but not in position 5 (from ""OCEAN"" feedback: N(-)).

Also, from ""RAISE"", we know E is not at position 5 (but now we know E is at position 3).

We need to find a word that:
- Is 5 letters, valid English word.
- Contains A, E, N (and possibly other letters).
- Does not contain R, I, S, O, C.
- E must be at position 3 (fixed).
- A not at position 2 or 4.
- N not at position 5.

Since E is fixed at position 3, the word has the form: _ _ E _ _

Now, A must be in the word but not at position 2 or 4. Possible positions for A: 1 or 5? Because positions 3 is taken by E.

Similarly, N must be in the word but not at position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 4.

But N could be at positions 1,2,4 and A at positions 1,5. Note that position 1 cannot have both A and N, so we need to assign them to different positions.

Possible structures:

Case 1: A at position 1
Then word: A _ E _ _
N must be at 2 or 4? (since not 5, and 1 is taken by A). So either:
- A N E _ _
- A _ E N _

Case 2: A at position 5
Then word: _ _ E _ A
N must be at 1,2,4? But 5 is taken by A. So:
- N _ E _ A
- _ N E _ A
- _ _ E N A

But note, we have other letters to fill.

We also need to consider that the word must contain A, E, N and two other distinct letters? Or possibly repeated letters? But from feedback, we have only seen one A and one E so far, but it could have duplicates? E is fixed at 3, and we know E is not at 5 but that doesn't prevent another E? However, in ""RAISE"", we had E at 5 and got '-', meaning there might be only one E? Not necessarily — it could be that there is another E, but since we know E is at position 3, if there is another E, it would be marked appropriately.

But let's assume for now that we don't have duplicate letters unless necessary, to keep it simple.

Now, we know the letters not in the word: R, I, S, O, C. So available letters: A-Z minus those, and minus the known included ones? Actually, we have A, E, N must be included, and two more.

We don't know what the other letters are.

We can think of common letters that haven't been tried: for example, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: A at position 1
- Option 1A: A N E _ _
  We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be valid. And N is at position 2? Yes.
  Examples: ANGER? but has R (not allowed). ANGLE? has L and E but E is at 5? Wait, positions: A N G L E -> E at position 5? But we have E fixed at 3, so if we put E at 3, then in ""A N E _ _"", the E is at 3. So for positions 4 and 5: any letters? But we cannot use R, I, S, O, C.

  Possible words: 
  - ""ANEW ..."" but 5 letters: ""ANEW"" is 4. Not enough.
  - ""ANVIL"" has I and V? But positions: ""ANV I L"" -> wait, we have E at 3? We need A N E at 1,2,3 -> then two more letters: say ""ANV E L"" -> wait, we have E at 3? The word is A N E V L? Not a word.

  Actually, with A N E at 1,2,3, we need words ending with two letters. For example, ""ANODE"" but O is not allowed? O is excluded. ""ANISE"" has S and I? Excluded.

  Another: ""ANKLE"" -> A N K L E -> positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:E? No, E at 3? But ""ANKLE"" is A N K L E -> so it's A(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5). But we need E at position 3? So if we want E at position 3, it must be _ _ E _ _, so if first three are A N E, then word: A N E ? ?

  Example: ""ANEAR"" -> but R excluded? ""ANEAR"" has R? Not valid and R not allowed.

  Another: ""ANELT""? Not a word.

  Let's try: ""ANELE"" not common.

  So ""AN"" at start with E at 3 might be limited.

- Option 1B: A _ E N _
  Word: A ? E N ? (positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:?)

  We know A at 1, E at 3, N at 4. Position 2 and 5 are unknown.

  Also, we have to avoid R, I, S, O, C.

  Common words: like ""AGENT"" but has G? Yes, but let's see: A G E N T -> but in our structure, it would be A, G, E, N, T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:E, 4:N, 5:T.

  This word: ""AGENT"" — valid? Yes.

  But note: we know from earlier that in ""OCEAN"", N is not at position 5? But here N is at position 4? So that should be fine? Wait, in ""OCEAN"" feedback, N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 5, so it can be at other positions. In ""AGENT"", N is at position 4, which is not 5, so okay.

  Also, A at position 1: we haven't tested position 1 before? In first guess, RAISE had R at 1? But A was at 2. So we don't know about A at position 1.

  Now, position 2: G, which is new.

  Position 5: T, new.

  This seems good.

  But check if any constraints broken? E at 3: correct. A not at 2 or 4: here at 1, good. N at 4: we know from feedback that N is not at position 5? But position 4 is allowed? Also, N could be at position 4? Yes.

Case 2: A at position 5

- Option 2A: N _ E _ A -> positions:1:N, 2:?, 3:E, 4:?, 5:A
  Example: ""NUTEA""? Not word.

  ""NULLE""? Not.

  ""NYL E A""? Not.

  ""NONCE"" has O? Excluded.

  ""NAIVE"" has I? Excluded.

  Hard to find.

- Option 2B: _ N E _ A
  Positions:1:?, 2:N, 3:E, 4:?, 5:A
  Example: ""UNI E A""? Only possible words: ""UNLEA""? Not valid? ""UNZ E A""? Not.

  ""ANELE"" is not common.

  ""INLET"" has I? Excluded.

  Few options.

- Option 2C: _ _ E N A -> positions:1:?, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A
  Example: ""ALENA""? Not common? Or ""SENA""? Not 5 letters? Wait, 5 letters: ""SENNA"" has S and double N? But S excluded.

  ""B E N N A"" -> ""BENNA""? Valid word? Uncommon.

  ""VEN A"" -> not 5.

  I think this case is less likely.

Given that, Option 1B: ""AGENT"" seems a strong candidate.

But wait, in ""AGENT"":
- A at 1: could be correct?
- G at 2: unknown
- E at 3: correct (so ✓ for E)
- N at 4: but from feedback in ""OCEAN"", we know N is not at position 5? But position 4 is open? Also, N must be in the word? We have N in the word? But in ""OCEAN"" we got N(-) meaning N is in the word? Yes.

Also, we need to check if N could be at position 4? Since we haven't tried position 4 for N? Yes.

But we also have position 5: T? Unknown.

Could we verify if there are other possibilities?

Another word in Case 1B: like ""AFENT""? Not common.

""ADENY""? Not word.

""ALERT"" has R? Excluded.

So ""AGENT"" is a common word.

We must consider that there might be more than one ""A""? But from the feedback, in ""RAISE"", A was at position 2 and not correct? Similarly, in ""OCEAN"" A at position 4 and not correct? So in ""AGENT"", A is at position 1? If it is correct, we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere, we get '-'. And similarly for others.

But since A is already known to be in the word, and only position matters.

However, note that in ""AGENT"", we have A at position 1. We don't know if that is correct.

Another possibility: A might not be at position 1? But we have to put it at 1 or 5? But that was under case 1 or 2.

Wait, we also have Case 1C: if A is not at 1 or 5? But earlier I thought only 1 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are excluded? But what about position 3? Position 3 is fixed for E? So A cannot be at 3.

Similarly, position 4 we know A not at 4? From ""OCEAN"" feedback? So A cannot be at 4? So only positions 1 and 5 for A? Yes.

Similarly for N: it cannot be at position 5 (from ""OCEAN"")? But positions can be 1,2,4? But in ""AGENT"", N is at 4? And that could be correct or not? We'll get feedback.

But wait: in ""OCEAN"", we got N(-) meaning N is not at position 5? So in ""AGENT"", if N is at 4? That should be acceptable? Because position 4 is different from 5.

So ""AGENT"" seems fine.

But let me check if there are other words.

For example, if we have A at position 5? But we struggled to find words.

Alternative: what about the position 2? For example, if we have the word: _ _ E N _ with A at 5? But then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A? Word?

""VENGA""? Not English.

""PENNA""? Has P? And not common? Also, double N? Positions: P E N N A? Then E at 3? And N at 4? And last A? So it's P E N N A? The word would have two N's? But we haven't been told anything against duplicates? And the feedback: in ""OCEAN"" we had only one N? So if there's an additional N? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Or all? Actually, Wordle rules: each letter is checked independently? And position matters per occurrence.

But in our case, ""OCEAN"" had N at position 5? Which was marked as not correct position, so implying there is at least one N? But if there is another N? We don't know? But when we guess, we'll see.

Still, ""PENNA"" is a rare word.

Better to stick to common words.

Another common word: in the structure A _ E N _ -> ""AGENT"" is good.

But also ""AMEND"": A M E N D -> has M and D? But let's see: positions:1:A, 2:M, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.

This also fits! And ""AMEND"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""ATTEN"" is not a word? Wait, ""ATTEN"" D?

""ASHEN"" has S? Excluded.

""AXMEN""? Not.

So both ""AGENT"" and ""AMEND"" are possible? How to choose?

Also, ""ABEND""? Not common.

But note: we need to maximize information? Since we haven't tested many letters, we could choose a word with more common letters? Or simply try one.

Another word: ""ALERT"" is excluded because of R.

So among ""AGENT"" and ""AMEND"", both are valid.

But we have E fixed at position 3? And we'll test new letters? In ""AGENT"": G and T? In ""AMEND"": M and D.

Now, we don't know which is more common? Perhaps arbitrary choice.

But notice in the feedback? We have two '-' for A? Meaning the position is not found? But we don't know how many times A appears? In ""AGENT"", A is at position 1? If A is actually at position 5? Then we get a '-' for A at 1? And then we would know A must be at 5? Similarly for other, but in that case, we make progress.

Alternatively, if the word is ""AGENT"", then our guess would be correct? But we don't know.

Another structure: could N be at position 2? For example, word: A N E _ _ ? But we found few words? But let me check: ""AN E S T"" but S excluded.

""AN E X T"" -> ""ANEXT"" not a word? ""INDEX"" has I? Not.

So harder? Therefore, probably either A at 1 with N at 4? Or A at 5.

But A at 5 also hard? So likely A at 1? Then ""AGENT"" or ""AMEND"".

Which one? Let's pick ""AGENT"" because it has G and T which are common? Or ""AMEND"" with M and D? Also? We need to choose.

Also, note in ""RAISE"", we had A at position 2? Now we put at position 1? So we are testing a new position.

Similarly, in ""OCEAN"", we had A at position 4? Now at 1? So good? 

I think either is fine. Let me pick ""AGENT"".

But wait: we don't know if N could be at position 4? But we'll find out.

If we guess ""AGENT"" and the feedback? 

- If A is at position 1? Then ✓ for A.
- G at position 2: unknown? Could be ✓, -, or x?
- E at 3: ✓
- N at 4: could be correct? Or not? If not, we get? If N is in the word but position 4 is not correct? Then '-'? Or if it is correct? Then ✓?
- T at 5: unknown?

But we know N is in the word? So even if position 4 is not correct for N? We get '-', meaning N is at a different position?

In our case? We assumed N at 4? But if it's not? Then we learn? So it's fine.

Moreover, there is another possibility: what if A is not at position 1? Then our guess ""AGENT"" would have A at 1? Which is wrong? So we get '-' for A? Then we know A must be at position 5? And the word must be like _ _ E _ A? With N in the word? Not at position 5? So at 1,2,4? But 4? Then the word is _ _ E N A? Then we need to fill positions 1 and 2? Without R,I,S,O,C? And also? The letters must match? 

But for now, we can try ""AGENT"" to get more information.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AGENT"".Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:
- **Secret word contains**: A, E, N (due to '-' or '✓' feedback).
- **Secret word does not contain**: R, I, S, O, C (due to 'x' feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - E must be in position 3 (from E(✓) in Guess 2).
  - A cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2).
  - N cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 2).
- The secret word structure is _ _ E _ _, with E fixed at position 3.

Considering the constraints, A can only be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded, and position 3 is occupied by E). Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 5 is excluded). After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints and exclude forbidden letters, ""AGENT"" was chosen as it:
- Places A at position 1 (a new position to test).
- Places N at position 4 (a new position to test).
- Tests new common letters G and T.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 3: AGENT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(✓) E(✓) N(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
