We are starting the game and need to make our first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we should pick a word that maximizes information gain. Good starter words often have a variety of common letters and avoid repeating letters.

Commonly used letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, etc.

I'll choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has C, R, A, N, E — two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular one. But I'll go with ""CRANE"" for now.

So my first guess will be: CRANE

But note: the problem requires the guess to be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

After this guess, we will get feedback that will help us narrow down.

Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback to go on.

Therefore, I'll guess: CRANE

For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for feedback. A strong starter word should include common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters in English and have no duplicate letters to cover more ground. I'll select ""CRANE"" as it contains two vowels (A and E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives a balanced chance of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. After this guess, the feedback on each letter (✓, -, or x) will guide future guesses.

Based on the previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with '-').

So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since CRANE has E at the end and it's marked wrong position). It does not contain C, R, A, or N.

Therefore, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes E (since E is in the word), but not at the end. Also, E could be in positions 1 to 4.
- Excludes letters C, R, A, N (as they are not in the word).
- Should use other common English letters to gather more information.

Since E is present, I should prioritize placing E in different positions to find its correct spot.

Possible positions for E: not 5th (as per CRANE guess). So it must be in positions 1-4.

Now, letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I should pick common letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with E and other vowels/common consonants to test more letters.

Since A and R are out, I need to avoid those.

First, list of disallowed letters: C, R, A, N

Also, the word must have E somewhere except position 5.

Possible second guesses could be: 
- Use E in position 1: e.g., ""ECHOS"" but E is in pos1, and C is forbidden – C is out, so no.
- Words starting with E: ""ELEGY"" – but E at start, and L, E, G, Y? But E could be duplicated? Wait, CRANE didn't have repeated letters, but secret word might. However, for now, avoiding repetition might be good to test more letters.

Better to avoid repeating E? But since we know E is in, it might be worth testing if E appears twice, but for second guess, perhaps stick to single E for now.

Try a word with E and other untested letters.

Common untested vowels: O, U (since A is out)
Consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A popular word is ""TOWEL"" – has T, O, W, E, L – but E is the fourth letter? Position: T1, O2, W3, E4, L5.

But in CRANE, E was at position 5, so position 4 might be different.

But E is in position 4 here. Since E was not at pos5 and present, putting E at pos4 could be good.

Letters: T, O, W, E, L – none are C, R, A, N, so allowed.

Another option: ""POUFE"" but that might not be common. Stick with common words.

""SPIEL"" – S, P, I, E, L – E at position 4? Positions: S1, P2, I3, E4, L5.

Or ""QUOTE"" – Q, U, O, T, E – E at end, but end position was wrong before, so E at end should be avoided? Not necessarily – E could be at end if multiple positions possible, but since it was wrong at pos5 in CRANE, it could be correct at pos5 if the word has multiple E's? But we don't know yet.

In feedback, E in CRANE was at position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So position 5 does not contain E, and E must be elsewhere.

Therefore, in my next guess, I should put E not in position 5 to respect that, but actually, I could put it elsewhere.

The secret word has E not at 5, so guessing E at 5 would be incorrect and useless? No, because feedback will show if it's present or not – but since we know it's present somewhere, wrong position might happen again.

To avoid wasting the position, better to avoid position 5 for E in guess.

Similarly, other positions are open.

Perhaps try E at position 1: e.g., ""ELOPE"" – E at 1 and 5? Position 1 might be E, but we know position 5 is not E, so E at 5 would be wrong position again. Also, duplicate E.

Avoid duplicates for now? Better to use distinct letters to maximize info.

So, let's look for words with E not at position 5 and no duplicate letters.

Possible words: 
- ""SPIEL"" (S,P,I,E,L) – E at position 4.
- ""TIGER"" – T,I,G,E,R – but R is forbidden! R was in CRANE and marked 'x', so R is not in the word. Cannot use R.

Similarly, A, C, N are out.

So, avoid C,R,A,N.

""TIGER"" has R – bad.

"" MODE L"" – MODEL: M,O,D,E,L – positions M1,O2,D3,E4,L5. But E at 4, and L at 5. Also, no forbidden letters.

MODEL: letters M,O,D,E,L – none are C,R,A,N.

Another good one: ""DOZEN"" – but N is forbidden, since N is in CRANE and 'x', so N is out. Do not use N.

Similarly, ""FEWER"" has E repeated and R – not good.

Let's think ""SLIME"" – S,L,I,M,E – E at end? Position 5, but position 5 is not E, so avoid E at 5.

SLIME has E at 5 – don't use.

""BEVEL"" – B,E,V,E,L – duplicates E, and E at position 5? Positions: B1 E2 V3 E4 L5? Duplicates.

Avoid.

""OILED"" – O,I,L,E,D – E at position 4, no forbidden letters? O,I,L,E,D: O1,I2,L3,E4,D5.

D5 – position 5, and we don't know about D.

But E not at 5 is good.

Another: ""GUISE"" – G,U,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.

""HEIST"" – H,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.

That could be good: H1,E2,I3,S4,T5.

No duplicates, and letters H,E,I,S,T. All unused, no forbidden.

S and T are very common.

Similarly, ""WEIST"" not common – stick to common words.

""HEIST"" is reasonable.

""DEIST"" – D,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.

Or ""EXIST"" – E1,X2,I3,S4,T5 – E at position 1.

But X is less common.

Better to use HEIST or DEIST.

DEIST: D,E,I,S,T.

Or how about ""TIMES"" – T,I,M,E,S – E at position 4? Positions T1,I2,M3,E4,S5.

E not at 5.

Letters T,I,M,E,S. Good.

I could use ""TIMES"" as the guess.

But let's see a word that might cover more vowels.

Since E is in, testing other vowels.

O or U or I.

I is in TIMES.

Another option: ""POISE"" – P,O,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.

""MOUTH"" – M,O,U,T,H – no E! But E must be in the word, so I need to include E in the guess.

Important: I know E is in the secret word, so I must include E in my guess to get better feedback. If I don't include E, I might miss information about its position or confuse if it appears again.

So, guesses should include E (since present) and try new letters.

Therefore, HEIST seems fine: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Or TIMES: T, I, M, E, S.

Both are common.

I'll go with TIMES: it tests T, I, M, E, S.

E is at position 4.

Guess: TIMES

Then, feedback will tell for each letter.

If E is correctly placed, but since position was wrong before, position 4 might be correct or wrong again.

But that's fine.

Another word: How about ""BELIE"" – B,E,L,I,E – duplicates and E at end? Not good.

""SPELT"" – S,P,E,L,T – E at position 3. positions S1,P2,E3,L4,T5.

E at 3.

That's another position.

SPELT is a word? Means grain or whatever, but valid.

However, TIMES or HEIST might be better.

Since the secret word has E not at 5, and common positions are 2,3,4 in English words.

I think TIMES is a solid choice.

So guess TIMES

But let's confirm no forbidden letters: TIMES has T,I,M,E,S – all not C,R,A,N.

Yes.

And E is at position 4.

So <guess>TIMES</guess>

But the response format is just the word.

Thinking through, is there a better word?

To test E in a different position, say position 1.

E.g., ""EQUAL"" – but Q,U,A – A is forbidden, cannot use A.

""EDIFY"" – E,D,I,F,Y – E at 1. Valid? No forbidden letters.

But Y is less common.

""ESTOP"" – legal term, not common.

""HELPS"" – H,E,L,P,S – E at position 2.

But TIMES seems fine.

I'll stick with TIMES.

<thinking>
Previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
Interpretation:  
- The letters C, R, A, and N are NOT in the secret word.  
- The letter E IS in the secret word, but NOT in position 5 (since it was guessed there and received ""-"", meaning wrong position).  

Thus:  
- The new guess must exclude C, R, A, and N.  
- It must include E (since it’s confirmed to be in the word), but not place E in position 5.  
- E should be placed in a new position (positions 1–4) to gather additional locational feedback.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., vowels like I, O, U, or high-frequency consonants like T, S, L, D).  

Possible Guesses Considered:  
- ""TIMES"": Positions E at 4; tests letters T, I, M, E, S. Favored because:  
  - No excluded letters (C,R,A,N absent).  
  - Includes E not in position 5.  
  - Uses high-frequency consonants (T,S) and vowel I for balanced coverage.  
- ""HEIST"": Positions E at 2; tests H,E,I,S,T. Valid alternative, but M in ""TIMES"" tests a less common letter which could yield useful info.  
- ""SPELT"": Positions E at 3; tests S,P,E,L,T, but P and L are slightly less common than S/T immediately.  

Selected Guess: ""TIMES""  
- Reasoning: Efficiently tests E in position 4 (new location) while introducing T, I, M, S—all common letters not yet tried. If E gets ""✓"" here, it confirms position 4. If ""-"", it rules out position 4 and suggests positions 1–3. The guess will also reveal if any of T, I, M, S are present/in position.

Or TIMES: T, I, M, E, S.

Both are common.

I'll go with TIMES: it tests T, I, M, E, S.

E is at position 4.

Guess: TIMES

Then, feedback will tell for each letter.

If E is correctly placed, but since position was wrong before, position 4 might be correct or wrong again.

But that's fine.

Another word: How about ""BELIE"" – B,E,L,I,E – duplicates and E at end? Not good.

""SPELT"" – S,P,E,L,T – E at position 3. positions S1,P2,E3,L4,T5.

E at 3.

That's another position.

SPELT is a word? Means grain or whatever, but valid.

However, TIMES or HEIST might be better.

Since the secret word has E not at 5, and common positions are 2,3,4 in English words.

I think TIMES is a solid choice.

So guess TIMES

But let's confirm no forbidden letters: TIMES has T,I,M,E,S – all not C,R,A,N.

Yes.

And E is at position 4.

So <guess>TIMES</guess>

But the response format is just the word.

Thinking through, is there a better word?

To test E in a different position, say position 1.

E.g., ""EQUAL"" – but Q,U,A – A is forbidden, cannot use A.

""EDIFY"" – E,D,I,F,Y – E at 1. Valid? No forbidden letters.

But Y is less common.

""ESTOP"" – legal term, not common.

""HELPS"" – H,E,L,P,S – E at position 2.

But TIMES seems fine.

I'll stick with TIMES.<thinking>
Previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
Interpretation:  
- The letters C, R, A, and N are NOT in the secret word.  
- The letter E IS in the secret word, but NOT in position 5 (since it was guessed there and received ""-"", meaning wrong position).  

Thus:  
- The new guess must exclude C, R, A, and N.  
- It must include E (since it’s confirmed to be in the word), but not place E in position 5.  
- E should be placed in a new position (positions 1–4) to gather additional locational feedback.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., vowels like I, O, U, or high-frequency consonants like T, S, L, D).  

Possible Guesses Considered:  
- ""TIMES"": Positions E at 4; tests letters T, I, M, E, S. Favored because:  
  - No excluded letters (C,R,A,N absent).  
  - Includes E not in position 5.  
  - Uses high-frequency consonants (T,S) and vowel I for balanced coverage.  
- ""HEIST"": Positions E at 2; tests H,E,I,S,T. Valid alternative, but M in ""TIMES"" tests a less common letter which could yield useful info.  
- ""SPELT"": Positions E at 3; tests S,P,E,L,T, but P and L are slightly less common than S/T immediately.  

Selected Guess: ""TIMES""  
- Reasoning: Efficiently tests E in position 4 (new location) while introducing T, I, M, S—all common letters not yet tried. If E gets ""✓"" here, it confirms position 4. If ""-"", it rules out position 4 and suggests positions 1–3. The guess will also reveal if any of T, I, M, S are present/in position.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,EPOXY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make our first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we should pick a word that maximizes information gain. Good starter words often have a variety of common letters and avoid repeating letters.

Commonly used letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, etc.

I'll choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has C, R, A, N, E — two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular one. But I'll go with ""CRANE"" for now.

So my first guess will be: CRANE

But note: the problem requires the guess to be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

After this guess, we will get feedback that will help us narrow down.

Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback to go on.

Therefore, I'll guess: CRANEFor the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for feedback. A strong starter word should include common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters in English and have no duplicate letters to cover more ground. I'll select ""CRANE"" as it contains two vowels (A and E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives a balanced chance of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. After this guess, the feedback on each letter (✓, -, or x) will guide future guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with '-').

So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since CRANE has E at the end and it's marked wrong position). It does not contain C, R, A, or N.

Therefore, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes E (since E is in the word), but not at the end. Also, E could be in positions 1 to 4.
- Excludes letters C, R, A, N (as they are not in the word).
- Should use other common English letters to gather more information.

Since E is present, I should prioritize placing E in different positions to find its correct spot.

Possible positions for E: not 5th (as per CRANE guess). So it must be in positions 1-4.

Now, letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I should pick common letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with E and other vowels/common consonants to test more letters.

Since A and R are out, I need to avoid those.

First, list of disallowed letters: C, R, A, N

Also, the word must have E somewhere except position 5.

Possible second guesses could be: 
- Use E in position 1: e.g., ""ECHOS"" but E is in pos1, and C is forbidden – C is out, so no.
- Words starting with E: ""ELEGY"" – but E at start, and L, E, G, Y? But E could be duplicated? Wait, CRANE didn't have repeated letters, but secret word might. However, for now, avoiding repetition might be good to test more letters.

Better to avoid repeating E? But since we know E is in, it might be worth testing if E appears twice, but for second guess, perhaps stick to single E for now.

Try a word with E and other untested letters.

Common untested vowels: O, U (since A is out)
Consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A popular word is ""TOWEL"" – has T, O, W, E, L – but E is the fourth letter? Position: T1, O2, W3, E4, L5.

But in CRANE, E was at position 5, so position 4 might be different.

But E is in position 4 here. Since E was not at pos5 and present, putting E at pos4 could be good.

Letters: T, O, W, E, L – none are C, R, A, N, so allowed.

Another option: ""POUFE"" but that might not be common. Stick with common words.

""SPIEL"" – S, P, I, E, L – E at position 4? Positions: S1, P2, I3, E4, L5.

Or ""QUOTE"" – Q, U, O, T, E – E at end, but end position was wrong before, so E at end should be avoided? Not necessarily – E could be at end if multiple positions possible, but since it was wrong at pos5 in CRANE, it could be correct at pos5 if the word has multiple E's? But we don't know yet.

In feedback, E in CRANE was at position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So position 5 does not contain E, and E must be elsewhere.

Therefore, in my next guess, I should put E not in position 5 to respect that, but actually, I could put it elsewhere.

The secret word has E not at 5, so guessing E at 5 would be incorrect and useless? No, because feedback will show if it's present or not – but since we know it's present somewhere, wrong position might happen again.

To avoid wasting the position, better to avoid position 5 for E in guess.

Similarly, other positions are open.

Perhaps try E at position 1: e.g., ""ELOPE"" – E at 1 and 5? Position 1 might be E, but we know position 5 is not E, so E at 5 would be wrong position again. Also, duplicate E.

Avoid duplicates for now? Better to use distinct letters to maximize info.

So, let's look for words with E not at position 5 and no duplicate letters.

Possible words: 
- ""SPIEL"" (S,P,I,E,L) – E at position 4.
- ""TIGER"" – T,I,G,E,R – but R is forbidden! R was in CRANE and marked 'x', so R is not in the word. Cannot use R.

Similarly, A, C, N are out.

So, avoid C,R,A,N.

""TIGER"" has R – bad.

"" MODE L"" – MODEL: M,O,D,E,L – positions M1,O2,D3,E4,L5. But E at 4, and L at 5. Also, no forbidden letters.

MODEL: letters M,O,D,E,L – none are C,R,A,N.

Another good one: ""DOZEN"" – but N is forbidden, since N is in CRANE and 'x', so N is out. Do not use N.

Similarly, ""FEWER"" has E repeated and R – not good.

Let's think ""SLIME"" – S,L,I,M,E – E at end? Position 5, but position 5 is not E, so avoid E at 5.

SLIME has E at 5 – don't use.

""BEVEL"" – B,E,V,E,L – duplicates E, and E at position 5? Positions: B1 E2 V3 E4 L5? Duplicates.

Avoid.

""OILED"" – O,I,L,E,D – E at position 4, no forbidden letters? O,I,L,E,D: O1,I2,L3,E4,D5.

D5 – position 5, and we don't know about D.

But E not at 5 is good.

Another: ""GUISE"" – G,U,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.

""HEIST"" – H,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.

That could be good: H1,E2,I3,S4,T5.

No duplicates, and letters H,E,I,S,T. All unused, no forbidden.

S and T are very common.

Similarly, ""WEIST"" not common – stick to common words.

""HEIST"" is reasonable.

""DEIST"" – D,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.

Or ""EXIST"" – E1,X2,I3,S4,T5 – E at position 1.

But X is less common.

Better to use HEIST or DEIST.

DEIST: D,E,I,S,T.

Or how about ""TIMES"" – T,I,M,E,S – E at position 4? Positions T1,I2,M3,E4,S5.

E not at 5.

Letters T,I,M,E,S. Good.

I could use ""TIMES"" as the guess.

But let's see a word that might cover more vowels.

Since E is in, testing other vowels.

O or U or I.

I is in TIMES.

Another option: ""POISE"" – P,O,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.

""MOUTH"" – M,O,U,T,H – no E! But E must be in the word, so I need to include E in the guess.

Important: I know E is in the secret word, so I must include E in my guess to get better feedback. If I don't include E, I might miss information about its position or confuse if it appears again.

So, guesses should include E (since present) and try new letters.

Therefore, HEIST seems fine: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Or TIMES: T, I, M, E, S.

Both are common.

I'll go with TIMES: it tests T, I, M, E, S.

E is at position 4.

Guess: TIMES

Then, feedback will tell for each letter.

If E is correctly placed, but since position was wrong before, position 4 might be correct or wrong again.

But that's fine.

Another word: How about ""BELIE"" – B,E,L,I,E – duplicates and E at end? Not good.

""SPELT"" – S,P,E,L,T – E at position 3. positions S1,P2,E3,L4,T5.

E at 3.

That's another position.

SPELT is a word? Means grain or whatever, but valid.

However, TIMES or HEIST might be better.

Since the secret word has E not at 5, and common positions are 2,3,4 in English words.

I think TIMES is a solid choice.

So guess TIMES

But let's confirm no forbidden letters: TIMES has T,I,M,E,S – all not C,R,A,N.

Yes.

And E is at position 4.

So <guess>TIMES</guess>

But the response format is just the word.

But Y is less common.

""ESTOP"" – legal term, not common.

""HELPS"" – H,E,L,P,S – E at position 2.

But TIMES seems fine.

Means grain or whatever, but valid.\n\nHowever, TIMES or HEIST might be better.\n\nSince the secret word has E not at 5, and common positions are 2,3,4 in English words.\n\nI think TIMES is a solid choice.\n\nSo guess TIMES\n\nBut let\'s confirm no forbidden letters: TIMES has T,I,M,E,S – all not C,R,A,N.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd E is at position 4.\n\nSo <guess>TIMES</guess>\n\nBut the response format is just the word.\n\nThinking through, is there a better word?\n\nTo test E in a different position, say position 1.\n\nE.g., ""EQUAL"" – but Q,U,A – A is forbidden, cannot use A.\n\n""EDIFY"" – E,D,I,F,Y – E at 1. Valid? No forbidden letters.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""ESTOP"" – legal term, not common.\n\n""HELPS"" – H,E,L,P,S – E at position 2.\n\nBut TIMES seems fine.\n\nI\'ll stick with TIMES.<thinking>\nPrevious guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \nInterpretation:  \n- The letters C, R, A, and N are NOT in the secret word.  \n- The letter E IS in the secret word, but NOT in position 5 (since it was guessed there and received ""-"", meaning wrong position).  \n\nThus:  \n- The new guess must exclude C, R, A, and N.  \n- It must include E (since it’s confirmed to be in the word), but not place E in position 5.  \n- E should be placed in a new position (positions 1–4) to gather additional locational feedback.  \n- Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., vowels like I, O, U, or high-frequency consonants like T, S, L, D).  \n\nPossible Guesses Considered:  \n- ""TIMES"": Positions E at 4; tests letters T, I, M, E, S. Favored because:  \n  - No excluded letters (C,R,A,N absent).  \n  - Includes E not in position 5.  \n  - Uses high-frequency consonants (T,S) and vowel I for balanced coverage.  \n- ""HEIST"": Positions E at 2; tests H,E,I,S,T. Valid alternative, but M in ""TIMES"" tests a less common letter which could yield useful info.  \n- ""SPELT"": Positions E at 3; tests S,P,E,L,T, but P and L are slightly less common than S/T immediately.  \n\nSelected Guess: ""TIMES""  \n- Reasoning: Efficiently tests E in position 4 (new location) while introducing T, I, M, S—all common letters not yet tried. If E gets ""✓"" here, it confirms position 4. If ""-"", it rules out position 4 and suggests positions 1–3. The guess will also reveal if any of T, I, M, S are present/in position.  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>TIMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TIMES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses so far:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. TIMES: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x) → E is still not in the correct position (since it's marked ""-"" again), and now we know that T, I, M, S are not in the word at all.

From this, we can deduce:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in position 4 or 5 (since in TIMES, E was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's not there, and from CRANE, not in position 5).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- Therefore, the secret word has E in one of the first three positions (1, 2, or 3).

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes E (since it's confirmed) and places it in a new position (either 1, 2, or 3) to test.
- Avoids all the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting other letters in the word.

Available letters: We have used C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S. So we should focus on the remaining common letters: 
Vowels: O, U (A, E, I are either out or known; E is in but position unknown, I is out)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes E and places it in position 1, 2, or 3.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., words starting with E
- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let's brainstorm some words:

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""ELOPE"" but has O and P, but also E repeated? We don't know if E is repeated, but to maximize info, avoid duplicates for now. Also, L and P are available.
  But ""ELOPE"" has E at 1 and 4? Positions: E1, L2, O3, P4, E5 → but E at 5 is not allowed because we know E is not in position 5. So invalid for that reason? Actually, we can have E at 5? No, because from CRANE, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, we must avoid placing E at position 5 in guesses to not waste a spot. So ""ELOPE"" has E at 5, which is bad.

- Better: ""EBONY"" - E1, B2, O3, N4, Y5 → but N is excluded (from CRANE, N(x)), so cannot use N.

- ""EDGES"" - E1, D2, G3, E4, S5 → S is excluded (from TIMES, S(x)), and duplicate E? Also, E at 4: we don't know if E is at 4, but in TIMES E was at 4 and got ""-"", so E is not at 4. So E at 4 would be wrong again. Also, S is out.

- ""EERIE"" - duplicates and E at 5? Not good.

- ""EQUAL"" - E1, Q2, U3, A4, L5 → A is excluded (from CRANE, A(x)), so invalid.

- ""EXILE"" - E1, X2, I3, L4, E5 → I is excluded (TIMES, I(x)), and E at 5.

Hard to find good E at 1 words without excluded letters.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- Example: ""BELOW"" - B1, E2, L3, O4, W5 → letters B, E, L, O, W. None excluded? Check: B, L, O, W not used before and not excluded. E is included. So valid.
- ""HELLO"" - H1, E2, L3, L4, O5 → duplicate L? But we don't care about duplicates, but it might reduce info. However, L is tested only once? Positions 3 and 4. But we can use it. But let's avoid duplicates if possible for more coverage. ""HELLO"" has two L's.

- ""DEUCE"" - D1, E2, U3, C4, E5 → C excluded (CRANE, C(x)), and E at 5.

- ""FEIGN"" - F1, E2, I3, G4, N5 → I and N excluded.

- ""LEPER"" - L1, E2, P3, E4, R5 → R excluded, and duplicate E.

- ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Example: ""PLUME"" - P1, L2, U3, M4, E5 → M excluded (TIMES, M(x)), and E at 5.
- ""ABYSS"" - but no E? Must include E.
- ""OWLED"" - O1, W2, L3, E4, D5 → E at 4? But E at 4 was already tried and wrong (in TIMES), so avoid. Also, positions: E is at 4, which we know is not correct.

- ""BOXED"" - B1, O2, X3, E4, D5 → E at 4 again, not good.

- ""QUEUE"" - Q1, U2, E3, U4, E5 → duplicates and E at 5.

- ""AGREE"" - A excluded.

- ""TREED"" - T and R excluded.

Hard to find E at 3 without hitting excluded letters or E at 4/5.

Therefore, E in position 2 seems more feasible.

Another E at 3: ""HOPED"" - H1, O2, P3, E4, D5 → E at 4, which we know is wrong.

""DOZED"" - D1, O2, Z3, E4, D5 → E at 4, and duplicate D? Also, E at 4 is bad.

Perhaps ""JUICY"" but no E.

So let's focus on E at 2.

Words with E at 2: 
- ""BELOW"" (B,E,L,O,W) - as above.
- ""HELPS"" - H1,E2,L3,P4,S5 → S excluded.
- ""DEMON"" - D1,E2,M3,O4,N5 → M and N excluded.
- ""FEWER"" - F1,E2,W3,E4,R5 → duplicate E, R excluded, and E at 4 is bad.
- ""LEVEL"" - L1,E2,V3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and L, and E at 4.
- ""NEWER"" - N excluded.

""BELOW"" seems the best so far.

Another one: ""BEVEL"" - B1,E2,V3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and E at 4.

""BEZEL"" - B1,E2,Z3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and E at 4.

""PEDAL"" - P1,E2,D3,A4,L5 → A excluded.

So ""BELOW"" is a strong candidate.

But we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 or 3, but we couldn't find good words without excluded letters.

What about E at 1? Let's try again.

""EBOOK"" - not 5 letters.

""EBBS"" - not 5.

""EDGED"" - duplicates.

""EDUCE"" - E1,D2,U3,C4,E5 → C excluded and E at 5.

""EGRET"" - E1,G2,R3,E4,T5 → R and T excluded.

""ELUDE"" - E1,L2,U3,D4,E5 → E at 5.

""EMCEE"" - not standard.

""EPOXY"" - E1,P2,O3,X4,Y5 → no excluded letters? E, P, O, X, Y. X is rare, but valid word. And no E at 5? Position 5 is Y. So E at 1.

But X is not common, so might not be ideal.

""EPOXY"" is a word, but let's see if better.

""EQUAL"" - A excluded.

""ESSAY"" - S excluded.

""ETHOS"" - E1,T2,H3,O4,S5 → T and S excluded.

So ""EPOXY"" is possible, but X is uncommon.

Now, E at 3: 
- ""ABYSM"" - no E.
- ""ADZES"" - A excluded.
- ""BOXES"" - S excluded.
- ""COPED"" - C excluded, E at 4? C1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4, which is bad.
- ""DOPED"" - D1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4.
- ""HOMED"" - H1,O2,M3,E4,D5 → M excluded, E at 4.
- ""JOKED"" - J1,O2,K3,E4,D5 → E at 4.
- ""LOBED"" - L1,O2,B3,E4,D5 → E at 4.

It seems difficult to avoid E at 4 when having E at 3? Not necessarily, but in 5-letter words, E often comes at the end.

""OILED"" - O1,I2,L3,E4,D5 → I excluded, E at 4.

""RIPED"" - not word.

""VOTED"" - V1,O2,T3,E4,D5 → T excluded.

""WIPED"" - W1,I2,P3,E4,D5 → I excluded.

So E at 3 without E at 4 or 5 is hard. For example, ""AXIOM"" no E.

""QUEEN"" - Q1,U2,E3,E4,N5 → duplicates and N excluded.

""STEEL"" - S and T excluded.

Therefore, E at 2 seems the most promising.

Another E at 2 word: ""WEARY"" - W1,E2,A3,R4,Y5 → A and R excluded.

""DEITY"" - D1,E2,I3,T4,Y5 → I and T excluded.

""LEAFY"" - L1,E2,A3,F4,Y5 → A excluded.

""BEFOG"" - B1,E2,F3,O4,G5 → no excluded letters? B, E, F, O, G. All new. And E at position 2.

""BEFOG"" is a word? Meaning to obscure, but valid.

Similarly, ""BEGET"" - B1,E2,G3,E4,T5 → duplicate E, T excluded.

""BEGIN"" - B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 → I and N excluded.

""BEGUN"" - B1,E2,G3,U4,N5 → N excluded.

""BEIGE"" - B1,E2,I3,G4,E5 → I excluded, E at 5.

""BELIE"" - B1,E2,L3,I4,E5 → I excluded, E at 5.

""BELLY"" - B1,E2,L3,L4,Y5 → duplicate L.

""BELOW"" is better than ""BEFOG"" because it has more common letters.

""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W.

""BEFOG"" uses B, E, F, O, G. F and G are less common than L and W? L is very common.

Common letters: L is more common than F or G.

So ""BELOW"" is preferable.

Another one: ""HELIO"" - not common.

""HELLO"" as before, but duplicate L.

""JELLO"" - J not common.

""CELLO"" - C excluded.

So I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: we need to place E in a new position. In CRANE, E was at 5; in TIMES, E was at 4; now in BELOW, E is at 2. So position 2 is new.

Also, we test B, L, O, W.

If E gets a ""✓"", we know position 2 is correct. If ""-"", then E is in the word but not at 2, so must be at 1 or 3. And if ""x"", but E cannot be x because we know it's in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.

Similarly, feedback on other letters.

So I'll go with ""BELOW"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - This means C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: TIMES** → Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)  
  - This means T, I, M, and S are **not** in the secret word. E is still not in the correct position (and since it was guessed in position 4, position 4 is also incorrect for E).

### Key Deductions:
- **E is in the secret word** but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (due to feedback from TIMES and CRANE). Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Strategy for the next guess**:
  - Must include E (since it's confirmed) and place it in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to narrow down its location. Position 2 is chosen here to test a middle position.
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on new common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y) to maximize information gain.
  - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters to increase the chance of hits.

### Selected Guess: BELOW
- **Why BELOW?**
  - Letters: B, E, L, O, W.
  - E is in position 2 (a new position not tested before).
  - All letters are new (no repeats from previous guesses) and not excluded.
  - Tests common consonants (B, L, W) and a vowel (O), which balances coverage.
  - If E is correct in position 2, we get a ""✓"". If not, we learn E is not in position 2 (narrowing it to position 1 or 3). Feedback on B, L, O, W will also reveal if any are present and in the right positions.

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

But let's confirm: we need to place E in a new position. In CRANE, E was at 5; in TIMES, E was at 4; now in BELOW, E is at 2. So position 2 is new.

Also, we test B, L, O, W.

If E gets a ""✓"", we know position 2 is correct. If ""-"", then E is in the word but not at 2, so must be at 1 or 3. And if ""x"", but E cannot be x because we know it's in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.

Similarly, feedback on other letters.

So I'll go with ""BELOW"".Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - This means C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: TIMES** → Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)  
  - This means T, I, M, and S are **not** in the secret word. E is still not in the correct position (and since it was guessed in position 4, position 4 is also incorrect for E).

### Key Deductions:
- **E is in the secret word** but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (due to feedback from TIMES and CRANE). Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Strategy for the next guess**:
  - Must include E (since it's confirmed) and place it in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to narrow down its location. Position 2 is chosen here to test a middle position.
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on new common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y) to maximize information gain.
  - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters to increase the chance of hits.

### Selected Guess: BELOW
- **Why BELOW?**
  - Letters: B, E, L, O, W.
  - E is in position 2 (a new position not tested before).
  - All letters are new (no repeats from previous guesses) and not excluded.
  - Tests common consonants (B, L, W) and a vowel (O), which balances coverage.
  - If E is correct in position 2, we get a ""✓"". If not, we learn E is not in position 2 (narrowing it to position 1 or 3). Feedback on B, L, O, W will also reveal if any are present and in the right positions.",Guess 3: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(x) O(-) W(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,EPOXY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make our first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we should pick a word that maximizes information gain. Good starter words often have a variety of common letters and avoid repeating letters.

Commonly used letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, etc.

I'll choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has C, R, A, N, E — two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular one. But I'll go with ""CRANE"" for now.

So my first guess will be: CRANE

But note: the problem requires the guess to be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

After this guess, we will get feedback that will help us narrow down.

Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback to go on.

Therefore, I'll guess: CRANEFor the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for feedback. A strong starter word should include common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters in English and have no duplicate letters to cover more ground. I'll select ""CRANE"" as it contains two vowels (A and E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives a balanced chance of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. After this guess, the feedback on each letter (✓, -, or x) will guide future guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with '-').

So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since CRANE has E at the end and it's marked wrong position). It does not contain C, R, A, or N.

Therefore, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes E (since E is in the word), but not at the end. Also, E could be in positions 1 to 4.
- Excludes letters C, R, A, N (as they are not in the word).
- Should use other common English letters to gather more information.

Since E is present, I should prioritize placing E in different positions to find its correct spot.

Possible positions for E: not 5th (as per CRANE guess). So it must be in positions 1-4.

Now, letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I should pick common letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with E and other vowels/common consonants to test more letters.

Since A and R are out, I need to avoid those.

First, list of disallowed letters: C, R, A, N

Also, the word must have E somewhere except position 5.

Possible second guesses could be: 
- Use E in position 1: e.g., ""ECHOS"" but E is in pos1, and C is forbidden – C is out, so no.
- Words starting with E: ""ELEGY"" – but E at start, and L, E, G, Y? But E could be duplicated? Wait, CRANE didn't have repeated letters, but secret word might. However, for now, avoiding repetition might be good to test more letters.

Better to avoid repeating E? But since we know E is in, it might be worth testing if E appears twice, but for second guess, perhaps stick to single E for now.

Try a word with E and other untested letters.

Common untested vowels: O, U (since A is out)
Consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A popular word is ""TOWEL"" – has T, O, W, E, L – but E is the fourth letter? Position: T1, O2, W3, E4, L5.

But in CRANE, E was at position 5, so position 4 might be different.

But E is in position 4 here. Since E was not at pos5 and present, putting E at pos4 could be good.

Letters: T, O, W, E, L – none are C, R, A, N, so allowed.

Another option: ""POUFE"" but that might not be common. Stick with common words.

""SPIEL"" – S, P, I, E, L – E at position 4? Positions: S1, P2, I3, E4, L5.

Or ""QUOTE"" – Q, U, O, T, E – E at end, but end position was wrong before, so E at end should be avoided? Not necessarily – E could be at end if multiple positions possible, but since it was wrong at pos5 in CRANE, it could be correct at pos5 if the word has multiple E's? But we don't know yet.

In feedback, E in CRANE was at position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So position 5 does not contain E, and E must be elsewhere.

Therefore, in my next guess, I should put E not in position 5 to respect that, but actually, I could put it elsewhere.

The secret word has E not at 5, so guessing E at 5 would be incorrect and useless? No, because feedback will show if it's present or not – but since we know it's present somewhere, wrong position might happen again.

To avoid wasting the position, better to avoid position 5 for E in guess.

Similarly, other positions are open.

Perhaps try E at position 1: e.g., ""ELOPE"" – E at 1 and 5? Position 1 might be E, but we know position 5 is not E, so E at 5 would be wrong position again. Also, duplicate E.

Avoid duplicates for now? Better to use distinct letters to maximize info.

So, let's look for words with E not at position 5 and no duplicate letters.

Possible words: 
- ""SPIEL"" (S,P,I,E,L) – E at position 4.
- ""TIGER"" – T,I,G,E,R – but R is forbidden! R was in CRANE and marked 'x', so R is not in the word. Cannot use R.

Similarly, A, C, N are out.

So, avoid C,R,A,N.

""TIGER"" has R – bad.

"" MODE L"" – MODEL: M,O,D,E,L – positions M1,O2,D3,E4,L5. But E at 4, and L at 5. Also, no forbidden letters.

MODEL: letters M,O,D,E,L – none are C,R,A,N.

Another good one: ""DOZEN"" – but N is forbidden, since N is in CRANE and 'x', so N is out. Do not use N.

Similarly, ""FEWER"" has E repeated and R – not good.

Let's think ""SLIME"" – S,L,I,M,E – E at end? Position 5, but position 5 is not E, so avoid E at 5.

SLIME has E at 5 – don't use.

""BEVEL"" – B,E,V,E,L – duplicates E, and E at position 5? Positions: B1 E2 V3 E4 L5? Duplicates.

Avoid.

""OILED"" – O,I,L,E,D – E at position 4, no forbidden letters? O,I,L,E,D: O1,I2,L3,E4,D5.

D5 – position 5, and we don't know about D.

But E not at 5 is good.

Another: ""GUISE"" – G,U,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.

""HEIST"" – H,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.

That could be good: H1,E2,I3,S4,T5.

No duplicates, and letters H,E,I,S,T. All unused, no forbidden.

S and T are very common.

Similarly, ""WEIST"" not common – stick to common words.

""HEIST"" is reasonable.

""DEIST"" – D,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.

Or ""EXIST"" – E1,X2,I3,S4,T5 – E at position 1.

But X is less common.

Better to use HEIST or DEIST.

DEIST: D,E,I,S,T.

Or how about ""TIMES"" – T,I,M,E,S – E at position 4? Positions T1,I2,M3,E4,S5.

E not at 5.

Letters T,I,M,E,S. Good.

I could use ""TIMES"" as the guess.

But let's see a word that might cover more vowels.

Since E is in, testing other vowels.

O or U or I.

I is in TIMES.

Another option: ""POISE"" – P,O,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.

""MOUTH"" – M,O,U,T,H – no E! But E must be in the word, so I need to include E in the guess.

Important: I know E is in the secret word, so I must include E in my guess to get better feedback. If I don't include E, I might miss information about its position or confuse if it appears again.

So, guesses should include E (since present) and try new letters.

Therefore, HEIST seems fine: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Or TIMES: T, I, M, E, S.

Both are common.

I'll go with TIMES: it tests T, I, M, E, S.

E is at position 4.

Guess: TIMES

Then, feedback will tell for each letter.

If E is correctly placed, but since position was wrong before, position 4 might be correct or wrong again.

But that's fine.

Another word: How about ""BELIE"" – B,E,L,I,E – duplicates and E at end? Not good.

""SPELT"" – S,P,E,L,T – E at position 3. positions S1,P2,E3,L4,T5.

E at 3.

That's another position.

SPELT is a word? Means grain or whatever, but valid.

However, TIMES or HEIST might be better.

Since the secret word has E not at 5, and common positions are 2,3,4 in English words.

I think TIMES is a solid choice.

So guess TIMES

But let's confirm no forbidden letters: TIMES has T,I,M,E,S – all not C,R,A,N.

Yes.

And E is at position 4.

So <guess>TIMES</guess>

But the response format is just the word.

Thinking through, is there a better word?

To test E in a different position, say position 1.

E.g., ""EQUAL"" – but Q,U,A – A is forbidden, cannot use A.

""EDIFY"" – E,D,I,F,Y – E at 1. Valid? No forbidden letters.

But Y is less common.

""ESTOP"" – legal term, not common.

""HELPS"" – H,E,L,P,S – E at position 2.

But TIMES seems fine.

I'll stick with TIMES.<thinking>
Previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
Interpretation:  
- The letters C, R, A, and N are NOT in the secret word.  
- The letter E IS in the secret word, but NOT in position 5 (since it was guessed there and received ""-"", meaning wrong position).  

Thus:  
- The new guess must exclude C, R, A, and N.  
- It must include E (since it’s confirmed to be in the word), but not place E in position 5.  
- E should be placed in a new position (positions 1–4) to gather additional locational feedback.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., vowels like I, O, U, or high-frequency consonants like T, S, L, D).  

Possible Guesses Considered:  
- ""TIMES"": Positions E at 4; tests letters T, I, M, E, S. Favored because:  
  - No excluded letters (C,R,A,N absent).  
  - Includes E not in position 5.  
  - Uses high-frequency consonants (T,S) and vowel I for balanced coverage.  
- ""HEIST"": Positions E at 2; tests H,E,I,S,T. Valid alternative, but M in ""TIMES"" tests a less common letter which could yield useful info.  
- ""SPELT"": Positions E at 3; tests S,P,E,L,T, but P and L are slightly less common than S/T immediately.  

Selected Guess: ""TIMES""  
- Reasoning: Efficiently tests E in position 4 (new location) while introducing T, I, M, S—all common letters not yet tried. If E gets ""✓"" here, it confirms position 4. If ""-"", it rules out position 4 and suggests positions 1–3. The guess will also reveal if any of T, I, M, S are present/in position.

<guess>TIMES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIMES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses so far:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. TIMES: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x) → E is still not in the correct position (since it's marked ""-"" again), and now we know that T, I, M, S are not in the word at all.

From this, we can deduce:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in position 4 or 5 (since in TIMES, E was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's not there, and from CRANE, not in position 5).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- Therefore, the secret word has E in one of the first three positions (1, 2, or 3).

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes E (since it's confirmed) and places it in a new position (either 1, 2, or 3) to test.
- Avoids all the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting other letters in the word.

Available letters: We have used C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S. So we should focus on the remaining common letters: 
Vowels: O, U (A, E, I are either out or known; E is in but position unknown, I is out)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes E and places it in position 1, 2, or 3.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., words starting with E
- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let's brainstorm some words:

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""ELOPE"" but has O and P, but also E repeated? We don't know if E is repeated, but to maximize info, avoid duplicates for now. Also, L and P are available.
  But ""ELOPE"" has E at 1 and 4? Positions: E1, L2, O3, P4, E5 → but E at 5 is not allowed because we know E is not in position 5. So invalid for that reason? Actually, we can have E at 5? No, because from CRANE, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, we must avoid placing E at position 5 in guesses to not waste a spot. So ""ELOPE"" has E at 5, which is bad.

- Better: ""EBONY"" - E1, B2, O3, N4, Y5 → but N is excluded (from CRANE, N(x)), so cannot use N.

- ""EDGES"" - E1, D2, G3, E4, S5 → S is excluded (from TIMES, S(x)), and duplicate E? Also, E at 4: we don't know if E is at 4, but in TIMES E was at 4 and got ""-"", so E is not at 4. So E at 4 would be wrong again. Also, S is out.

- ""EERIE"" - duplicates and E at 5? Not good.

- ""EQUAL"" - E1, Q2, U3, A4, L5 → A is excluded (from CRANE, A(x)), so invalid.

- ""EXILE"" - E1, X2, I3, L4, E5 → I is excluded (TIMES, I(x)), and E at 5.

Hard to find good E at 1 words without excluded letters.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- Example: ""BELOW"" - B1, E2, L3, O4, W5 → letters B, E, L, O, W. None excluded? Check: B, L, O, W not used before and not excluded. E is included. So valid.
- ""HELLO"" - H1, E2, L3, L4, O5 → duplicate L? But we don't care about duplicates, but it might reduce info. However, L is tested only once? Positions 3 and 4. But we can use it. But let's avoid duplicates if possible for more coverage. ""HELLO"" has two L's.

- ""DEUCE"" - D1, E2, U3, C4, E5 → C excluded (CRANE, C(x)), and E at 5.

- ""FEIGN"" - F1, E2, I3, G4, N5 → I and N excluded.

- ""LEPER"" - L1, E2, P3, E4, R5 → R excluded, and duplicate E.

- ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Example: ""PLUME"" - P1, L2, U3, M4, E5 → M excluded (TIMES, M(x)), and E at 5.
- ""ABYSS"" - but no E? Must include E.
- ""OWLED"" - O1, W2, L3, E4, D5 → E at 4? But E at 4 was already tried and wrong (in TIMES), so avoid. Also, positions: E is at 4, which we know is not correct.

- ""BOXED"" - B1, O2, X3, E4, D5 → E at 4 again, not good.

- ""QUEUE"" - Q1, U2, E3, U4, E5 → duplicates and E at 5.

- ""AGREE"" - A excluded.

- ""TREED"" - T and R excluded.

Hard to find E at 3 without hitting excluded letters or E at 4/5.

Therefore, E in position 2 seems more feasible.

Another E at 3: ""HOPED"" - H1, O2, P3, E4, D5 → E at 4, which we know is wrong.

""DOZED"" - D1, O2, Z3, E4, D5 → E at 4, and duplicate D? Also, E at 4 is bad.

Perhaps ""JUICY"" but no E.

So let's focus on E at 2.

Words with E at 2: 
- ""BELOW"" (B,E,L,O,W) - as above.
- ""HELPS"" - H1,E2,L3,P4,S5 → S excluded.
- ""DEMON"" - D1,E2,M3,O4,N5 → M and N excluded.
- ""FEWER"" - F1,E2,W3,E4,R5 → duplicate E, R excluded, and E at 4 is bad.
- ""LEVEL"" - L1,E2,V3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and L, and E at 4.
- ""NEWER"" - N excluded.

""BELOW"" seems the best so far.

Another one: ""BEVEL"" - B1,E2,V3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and E at 4.

""BEZEL"" - B1,E2,Z3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and E at 4.

""PEDAL"" - P1,E2,D3,A4,L5 → A excluded.

So ""BELOW"" is a strong candidate.

But we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 or 3, but we couldn't find good words without excluded letters.

What about E at 1? Let's try again.

""EBOOK"" - not 5 letters.

""EBBS"" - not 5.

""EDGED"" - duplicates.

""EDUCE"" - E1,D2,U3,C4,E5 → C excluded and E at 5.

""EGRET"" - E1,G2,R3,E4,T5 → R and T excluded.

""ELUDE"" - E1,L2,U3,D4,E5 → E at 5.

""EMCEE"" - not standard.

""EPOXY"" - E1,P2,O3,X4,Y5 → no excluded letters? E, P, O, X, Y. X is rare, but valid word. And no E at 5? Position 5 is Y. So E at 1.

But X is not common, so might not be ideal.

""EPOXY"" is a word, but let's see if better.

""EQUAL"" - A excluded.

""ESSAY"" - S excluded.

""ETHOS"" - E1,T2,H3,O4,S5 → T and S excluded.

So ""EPOXY"" is possible, but X is uncommon.

Now, E at 3: 
- ""ABYSM"" - no E.
- ""ADZES"" - A excluded.
- ""BOXES"" - S excluded.
- ""COPED"" - C excluded, E at 4? C1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4, which is bad.
- ""DOPED"" - D1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4.
- ""HOMED"" - H1,O2,M3,E4,D5 → M excluded, E at 4.
- ""JOKED"" - J1,O2,K3,E4,D5 → E at 4.
- ""LOBED"" - L1,O2,B3,E4,D5 → E at 4.

It seems difficult to avoid E at 4 when having E at 3? Not necessarily, but in 5-letter words, E often comes at the end.

""OILED"" - O1,I2,L3,E4,D5 → I excluded, E at 4.

""RIPED"" - not word.

""VOTED"" - V1,O2,T3,E4,D5 → T excluded.

""WIPED"" - W1,I2,P3,E4,D5 → I excluded.

So E at 3 without E at 4 or 5 is hard. For example, ""AXIOM"" no E.

""QUEEN"" - Q1,U2,E3,E4,N5 → duplicates and N excluded.

""STEEL"" - S and T excluded.

Therefore, E at 2 seems the most promising.

Another E at 2 word: ""WEARY"" - W1,E2,A3,R4,Y5 → A and R excluded.

""DEITY"" - D1,E2,I3,T4,Y5 → I and T excluded.

""LEAFY"" - L1,E2,A3,F4,Y5 → A excluded.

""BEFOG"" - B1,E2,F3,O4,G5 → no excluded letters? B, E, F, O, G. All new. And E at position 2.

""BEFOG"" is a word? Meaning to obscure, but valid.

Similarly, ""BEGET"" - B1,E2,G3,E4,T5 → duplicate E, T excluded.

""BEGIN"" - B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 → I and N excluded.

""BEGUN"" - B1,E2,G3,U4,N5 → N excluded.

""BEIGE"" - B1,E2,I3,G4,E5 → I excluded, E at 5.

""BELIE"" - B1,E2,L3,I4,E5 → I excluded, E at 5.

""BELLY"" - B1,E2,L3,L4,Y5 → duplicate L.

""BELOW"" is better than ""BEFOG"" because it has more common letters.

""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W.

""BEFOG"" uses B, E, F, O, G. F and G are less common than L and W? L is very common.

Common letters: L is more common than F or G.

So ""BELOW"" is preferable.

Another one: ""HELIO"" - not common.

""HELLO"" as before, but duplicate L.

""JELLO"" - J not common.

""CELLO"" - C excluded.

So I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: we need to place E in a new position. In CRANE, E was at 5; in TIMES, E was at 4; now in BELOW, E is at 2. So position 2 is new.

Also, we test B, L, O, W.

If E gets a ""✓"", we know position 2 is correct. If ""-"", then E is in the word but not at 2, so must be at 1 or 3. And if ""x"", but E cannot be x because we know it's in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.

Similarly, feedback on other letters.

So I'll go with ""BELOW"".Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - This means C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: TIMES** → Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)  
  - This means T, I, M, and S are **not** in the secret word. E is still not in the correct position (and since it was guessed in position 4, position 4 is also incorrect for E).

### Key Deductions:
- **E is in the secret word** but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (due to feedback from TIMES and CRANE). Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Strategy for the next guess**:
  - Must include E (since it's confirmed) and place it in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to narrow down its location. Position 2 is chosen here to test a middle position.
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on new common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y) to maximize information gain.
  - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters to increase the chance of hits.

### Selected Guess: BELOW
- **Why BELOW?**
  - Letters: B, E, L, O, W.
  - E is in position 2 (a new position not tested before).
  - All letters are new (no repeats from previous guesses) and not excluded.
  - Tests common consonants (B, L, W) and a vowel (O), which balances coverage.
  - If E is correct in position 2, we get a ""✓"". If not, we learn E is not in position 2 (narrowing it to position 1 or 3). Feedback on B, L, O, W will also reveal if any are present and in the right positions.

Since there\'s no prior feedback, we should pick a word that maximizes information gain. Good starter words often have a variety of common letters and avoid repeating letters.\n\nCommonly used letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, etc.\n\nI\'ll choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has C, R, A, N, E — two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular one. But I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for now.\n\nSo my first guess will be: CRANE\n\nBut note: the problem requires the guess to be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.\n\nAfter this guess, we will get feedback that will help us narrow down.\n\nSince it\'s the first guess, we don\'t have any feedback to go on.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess: CRANEFor the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for feedback. A strong starter word should include common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters in English and have no duplicate letters to cover more ground. I\'ll select ""CRANE"" as it contains two vowels (A and E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives a balanced chance of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. After this guess, the feedback on each letter (✓, -, or x) will guide future guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the previous guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n\nInterpretation:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with \'x\').\n- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with \'-\').\n\nSo, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since CRANE has E at the end and it\'s marked wrong position). It does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\nTherefore, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:\n- Includes E (since E is in the word), but not at the end. Also, E could be in positions 1 to 4.\n- Excludes letters C, R, A, N (as they are not in the word).\n- Should use other common English letters to gather more information.\n\nSince E is present, I should prioritize placing E in different positions to find its correct spot.\n\nPossible positions for E: not 5th (as per CRANE guess). So it must be in positions 1-4.\n\nNow, letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I should pick common letters.\n\nA good strategy is to use a word with E and other vowels/common consonants to test more letters.\n\nSince A and R are out, I need to avoid those.\n\nFirst, list of disallowed letters: C, R, A, N\n\nAlso, the word must have E somewhere except position 5.\n\nPossible second guesses could be: \n- Use E in position 1: e.g., ""ECHOS"" but E is in pos1, and C is forbidden – C is out, so no.\n- Words starting with E: ""ELEGY"" – but E at start, and L, E, G, Y? But E could be duplicated? Wait, CRANE didn\'t have repeated letters, but secret word might. However, for now, avoiding repetition might be good to test more letters.\n\nBetter to avoid repeating E? But since we know E is in, it might be worth testing if E appears twice, but for second guess, perhaps stick to single E for now.\n\nTry a word with E and other untested letters.\n\nCommon untested vowels: O, U (since A is out)\nConsonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nA popular word is ""TOWEL"" – has T, O, W, E, L – but E is the fourth letter? Position: T1, O2, W3, E4, L5.\n\nBut in CRANE, E was at position 5, so position 4 might be different.\n\nBut E is in position 4 here. Since E was not at pos5 and present, putting E at pos4 could be good.\n\nLetters: T, O, W, E, L – none are C, R, A, N, so allowed.\n\nAnother option: ""POUFE"" but that might not be common. Stick with common words.\n\n""SPIEL"" – S, P, I, E, L – E at position 4? Positions: S1, P2, I3, E4, L5.\n\nOr ""QUOTE"" – Q, U, O, T, E – E at end, but end position was wrong before, so E at end should be avoided? Not necessarily – E could be at end if multiple positions possible, but since it was wrong at pos5 in CRANE, it could be correct at pos5 if the word has multiple E\'s? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nIn feedback, E in CRANE was at position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So position 5 does not contain E, and E must be elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, in my next guess, I should put E not in position 5 to respect that, but actually, I could put it elsewhere.\n\nThe secret word has E not at 5, so guessing E at 5 would be incorrect and useless? No, because feedback will show if it\'s present or not – but since we know it\'s present somewhere, wrong position might happen again.\n\nTo avoid wasting the position, better to avoid position 5 for E in guess.\n\nSimilarly, other positions are open.\n\nPerhaps try E at position 1: e.g., ""ELOPE"" – E at 1 and 5? Position 1 might be E, but we know position 5 is not E, so E at 5 would be wrong position again. Also, duplicate E.\n\nAvoid duplicates for now? Better to use distinct letters to maximize info.\n\nSo, let\'s look for words with E not at position 5 and no duplicate letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SPIEL"" (S,P,I,E,L) – E at position 4.\n- ""TIGER"" – T,I,G,E,R – but R is forbidden! R was in CRANE and marked \'x\', so R is not in the word. Cannot use R.\n\nSimilarly, A, C, N are out.\n\nSo, avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n""TIGER"" has R – bad.\n\n"" MODE L"" – MODEL: M,O,D,E,L – positions M1,O2,D3,E4,L5. But E at 4, and L at 5. Also, no forbidden letters.\n\nMODEL: letters M,O,D,E,L – none are C,R,A,N.\n\nAnother good one: ""DOZEN"" – but N is forbidden, since N is in CRANE and \'x\', so N is out. Do not use N.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEWER"" has E repeated and R – not good.\n\nLet\'s think ""SLIME"" – S,L,I,M,E – E at end? Position 5, but position 5 is not E, so avoid E at 5.\n\nSLIME has E at 5 – don\'t use.\n\n""BEVEL"" – B,E,V,E,L – duplicates E, and E at position 5? Positions: B1 E2 V3 E4 L5? Duplicates.\n\nAvoid.\n\n""OILED"" – O,I,L,E,D – E at position 4, no forbidden letters? O,I,L,E,D: O1,I2,L3,E4,D5.\n\nD5 – position 5, and we don\'t know about D.\n\nBut E not at 5 is good.\n\nAnother: ""GUISE"" – G,U,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.\n\n""HEIST"" – H,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.\n\nThat could be good: H1,E2,I3,S4,T5.\n\nNo duplicates, and letters H,E,I,S,T. All unused, no forbidden.\n\nS and T are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""WEIST"" not common – stick to common words.\n\n""HEIST"" is reasonable.\n\n""DEIST"" – D,E,I,S,T – E at position 2.\n\nOr ""EXIST"" – E1,X2,I3,S4,T5 – E at position 1.\n\nBut X is less common.\n\nBetter to use HEIST or DEIST.\n\nDEIST: D,E,I,S,T.\n\nOr how about ""TIMES"" – T,I,M,E,S – E at position 4? Positions T1,I2,M3,E4,S5.\n\nE not at 5.\n\nLetters T,I,M,E,S. Good.\n\nI could use ""TIMES"" as the guess.\n\nBut let\'s see a word that might cover more vowels.\n\nSince E is in, testing other vowels.\n\nO or U or I.\n\nI is in TIMES.\n\nAnother option: ""POISE"" – P,O,I,S,E – E at 5, avoid.\n\n""MOUTH"" – M,O,U,T,H – no E! But E must be in the word, so I need to include E in the guess.\n\nImportant: I know E is in the secret word, so I must include E in my guess to get better feedback. If I don\'t include E, I might miss information about its position or confuse if it appears again.\n\nSo, guesses should include E (since present) and try new letters.\n\nTherefore, HEIST seems fine: letters H, E, I, S, T.\n\nOr TIMES: T, I, M, E, S.\n\nBoth are common.\n\nI\'ll go with TIMES: it tests T, I, M, E, S.\n\nE is at position 4.\n\nGuess: TIMES\n\nThen, feedback will tell for each letter.\n\nIf E is correctly placed, but since position was wrong before, position 4 might be correct or wrong again.\n\nBut that\'s fine.\n\nAnother word: How about ""BELIE"" – B,E,L,I,E – duplicates and E at end? Not good.\n\n""SPELT"" – S,P,E,L,T – E at position 3. positions S1,P2,E3,L4,T5.\n\nE at 3.\n\nThat\'s another position.\n\nSPELT is a word? Means grain or whatever, but valid.\n\nHowever, TIMES or HEIST might be better.\n\nSince the secret word has E not at 5, and common positions are 2,3,4 in English words.\n\nI think TIMES is a solid choice.\n\nSo guess TIMES\n\nBut let\'s confirm no forbidden letters: TIMES has T,I,M,E,S – all not C,R,A,N.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd E is at position 4.\n\nSo <guess>TIMES</guess>\n\nBut the response format is just the word.\n\nThinking through, is there a better word?\n\nTo test E in a different position, say position 1.\n\nE.g., ""EQUAL"" – but Q,U,A – A is forbidden, cannot use A.\n\n""EDIFY"" – E,D,I,F,Y – E at 1. Valid? No forbidden letters.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""ESTOP"" – legal term, not common.\n\n""HELPS"" – H,E,L,P,S – E at position 2.\n\nBut TIMES seems fine.\n\nI\'ll stick with TIMES.<thinking>\nPrevious guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \nInterpretation:  \n- The letters C, R, A, and N are NOT in the secret word.  \n- The letter E IS in the secret word, but NOT in position 5 (since it was guessed there and received ""-"", meaning wrong position).  \n\nThus:  \n- The new guess must exclude C, R, A, and N.  \n- It must include E (since it’s confirmed to be in the word), but not place E in position 5.  \n- E should be placed in a new position (positions 1–4) to gather additional locational feedback.  \n- Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., vowels like I, O, U, or high-frequency consonants like T, S, L, D).  \n\nPossible Guesses Considered:  \n- ""TIMES"": Positions E at 4; tests letters T, I, M, E, S. Favored because:  \n  - No excluded letters (C,R,A,N absent).  \n  - Includes E not in position 5.  \n  - Uses high-frequency consonants (T,S) and vowel I for balanced coverage.  \n- ""HEIST"": Positions E at 2; tests H,E,I,S,T. Valid alternative, but M in ""TIMES"" tests a less common letter which could yield useful info.  \n- ""SPELT"": Positions E at 3; tests S,P,E,L,T, but P and L are slightly less common than S/T immediately.  \n\nSelected Guess: ""TIMES""  \n- Reasoning: Efficiently tests E in position 4 (new location) while introducing T, I, M, S—all common letters not yet tried. If E gets ""✓"" here, it confirms position 4. If ""-"", it rules out position 4 and suggests positions 1–3. The guess will also reveal if any of T, I, M, S are present/in position.  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>TIMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TIMES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses so far:\n1.

We don\'t know if E is repeated, but to maximize info, avoid duplicates for now. Also, L and P are available.\n  But ""ELOPE"" has E at 1 and 4? Positions: E1, L2, O3, P4, E5 → but E at 5 is not allowed because we know E is not in position 5. So invalid for that reason? Actually, we can have E at 5? No, because from CRANE, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, we must avoid placing E at position 5 in guesses to not waste a spot. So ""ELOPE"" has E at 5, which is bad.\n\n- Better: ""EBONY"" - E1, B2, O3, N4, Y5 → but N is excluded (from CRANE, N(x)), so cannot use N.\n\n- ""EDGES"" - E1, D2, G3, E4, S5 → S is excluded (from TIMES, S(x)), and duplicate E? Also, E at 4: we don\'t know if E is at 4, but in TIMES E was at 4 and got ""-"", so E is not at 4. So E at 4 would be wrong again. Also, S is out.\n\n- ""EERIE"" - duplicates and E at 5? Not good.\n\n- ""EQUAL"" - E1, Q2, U3, A4, L5 → A is excluded (from CRANE, A(x)), so invalid.\n\n- ""EXILE"" - E1, X2, I3, L4, E5 → I is excluded (TIMES, I(x)), and E at 5.\n\nHard to find good E at 1 words without excluded letters.\n\nOption 2: E in position 2\n- Pattern: _ E _ _ _\n- Example: ""BELOW"" - B1, E2, L3, O4, W5 → letters B, E, L, O, W. None excluded? Check: B, L, O, W not used before and not excluded. E is included. So valid.\n- ""HELLO"" - H1, E2, L3, L4, O5 → duplicate L? But we don\'t care about duplicates, but it might reduce info. However, L is tested only once? Positions 3 and 4. But we can use it. But let\'s avoid duplicates if possible for more coverage. ""HELLO"" has two L\'s.\n\n- ""DEUCE"" - D1, E2, U3, C4, E5 → C excluded (CRANE, C(x)), and E at 5.\n\n- ""FEIGN"" - F1, E2, I3, G4, N5 → I and N excluded.\n\n- ""LEPER"" - L1, E2, P3, E4, R5 → R excluded, and duplicate E.\n\n- ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W.\n\nOption 3: E in position 3\n- Pattern: _ _ E _ _\n- Example: ""PLUME"" - P1, L2, U3, M4, E5 → M excluded (TIMES, M(x)), and E at 5.\n- ""ABYSS"" - but no E? Must include E.\n- ""OWLED"" - O1, W2, L3, E4, D5 → E at 4? But E at 4 was already tried and wrong (in TIMES), so avoid. Also, positions: E is at 4, which we know is not correct.\n\n- ""BOXED"" - B1, O2, X3, E4, D5 → E at 4 again, not good.\n\n- ""QUEUE"" - Q1, U2, E3, U4, E5 → duplicates and E at 5.\n\n- ""AGREE"" - A excluded.\n\n- ""TREED"" - T and R excluded.\n\nHard to find E at 3 without hitting excluded letters or E at 4/5.\n\nTherefore, E in position 2 seems more feasible.\n\nAnother E at 3: ""HOPED"" - H1, O2, P3, E4, D5 → E at 4, which we know is wrong.\n\n""DOZED"" - D1, O2, Z3, E4, D5 → E at 4, and duplicate D? Also, E at 4 is bad.\n\nPerhaps ""JUICY"" but no E.\n\nSo let\'s focus on E at 2.\n\nWords with E at 2: \n- ""BELOW"" (B,E,L,O,W) - as above.\n- ""HELPS"" - H1,E2,L3,P4,S5 → S excluded.\n- ""DEMON"" - D1,E2,M3,O4,N5 → M and N excluded.\n- ""FEWER"" - F1,E2,W3,E4,R5 → duplicate E, R excluded, and E at 4 is bad.\n- ""LEVEL"" - L1,E2,V3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and L, and E at 4.\n- ""NEWER"" - N excluded.\n\n""BELOW"" seems the best so far.\n\nAnother one: ""BEVEL"" - B1,E2,V3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and E at 4.\n\n""BEZEL"" - B1,E2,Z3,E4,L5 → duplicate E and E at 4.\n\n""PEDAL"" - P1,E2,D3,A4,L5 → A excluded.\n\nSo ""BELOW"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut we also have to consider that E might be in position 1 or 3, but we couldn\'t find good words without excluded letters.\n\nWhat about E at 1? Let\'s try again.\n\n""EBOOK"" - not 5 letters.\n\n""EBBS"" - not 5.\n\n""EDGED"" - duplicates.\n\n""EDUCE"" - E1,D2,U3,C4,E5 → C excluded and E at 5.\n\n""EGRET"" - E1,G2,R3,E4,T5 → R and T excluded.\n\n""ELUDE"" - E1,L2,U3,D4,E5 → E at 5.\n\n""EMCEE"" - not standard.\n\n""EPOXY"" - E1,P2,O3,X4,Y5 → no excluded letters? E, P, O, X, Y. X is rare, but valid word. And no E at 5? Position 5 is Y. So E at 1.\n\nBut X is not common, so might not be ideal.\n\n""EPOXY"" is a word, but let\'s see if better.\n\n""EQUAL"" - A excluded.\n\n""ESSAY"" - S excluded.\n\n""ETHOS"" - E1,T2,H3,O4,S5 → T and S excluded.\n\nSo ""EPOXY"" is possible, but X is uncommon.\n\nNow, E at 3: \n- ""ABYSM"" - no E.\n- ""ADZES"" - A excluded.\n- ""BOXES"" - S excluded.\n- ""COPED"" - C excluded, E at 4? C1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4, which is bad.\n- ""DOPED"" - D1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4.\n- ""HOMED"" - H1,O2,M3,E4,D5 → M excluded, E at 4.\n- ""JOKED"" - J1,O2,K3,E4,D5 → E at 4.\n- ""LOBED"" - L1,O2,B3,E4,D5 → E at 4.\n\nIt seems difficult to avoid E at 4 when having E at 3? Not necessarily, but in 5-letter words, E often comes at the end.\n\n""OILED"" - O1,I2,L3,E4,D5 → I excluded, E at 4.\n\n""RIPED"" - not word.\n\n""VOTED"" - V1,O2,T3,E4,D5 → T excluded.\n\n""WIPED"" - W1,I2,P3,E4,D5 → I excluded.\n\nSo E at 3 without E at 4 or 5 is hard. For example, ""AXIOM"" no E.\n\n""QUEEN"" - Q1,U2,E3,E4,N5 → duplicates and N excluded.\n\n""STEEL"" - S and T excluded.\n\nTherefore, E at 2 seems the most promising.\n\nAnother E at 2 word: ""WEARY"" - W1,E2,A3,R4,Y5 → A and R excluded.\n\n""DEITY"" - D1,E2,I3,T4,Y5 → I and T excluded.\n\n""LEAFY"" - L1,E2,A3,F4,Y5 → A excluded.\n\n""BEFOG"" - B1,E2,F3,O4,G5 → no excluded letters? B, E, F, O, G. All new. And E at position 2.\n\n""BEFOG"" is a word? Meaning to obscure, but valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEGET"" - B1,E2,G3,E4,T5 → duplicate E, T excluded.\n\n""BEGIN"" - B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 → I and N excluded.\n\n""BEGUN"" - B1,E2,G3,U4,N5 → N excluded.\n\n""BEIGE"" - B1,E2,I3,G4,E5 → I excluded, E at 5.\n\n""BELIE"" - B1,E2,L3,I4,E5 → I excluded, E at 5.\n\n""BELLY"" - B1,E2,L3,L4,Y5 → duplicate L.\n\n""BELOW"" is better than ""BEFOG"" because it has more common letters.\n\n""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W.\n\n""BEFOG"" uses B, E, F, O, G. F and G are less common than L and W? L is very common.\n\nCommon letters: L is more common than F or G.\n\nSo ""BELOW"" is preferable.\n\nAnother one: ""HELIO"" - not common.\n\n""HELLO"" as before, but duplicate L.\n\n""JELLO"" - J not common.\n\n""CELLO"" - C excluded.\n\nSo I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: we need to place E in a new position. In CRANE, E was at 5; in TIMES, E was at 4; now in BELOW, E is at 2. So position 2 is new.\n\nAlso, we test B, L, O, W.\n\nIf E gets a ""✓"", we know position 2 is correct. If ""-"", then E is in the word but not at 2, so must be at 1 or 3. And if ""x"", but E cannot be x because we know it\'s in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.\n\nSimilarly, feedback on other letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BELOW"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \n  - This means C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.

We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TIMES -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
Interpretation: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was placed there and got '-', meaning wrong position).

Guess 3: BELOW -> Feedback: B(x) E(-) L(x) O(-) W(x)
Interpretation: Letters B, L, W are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was placed there and got '-'). O is in the word but not in position 4? Let's check positions: BELOW has positions B1, E2, L3, O4, W5. So feedback says O(-) meaning O is in the word but not in position 4.

Now, consolidate known information:

- E is in the word, and we know it cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from BELOW, TIMES, and CRANE respectively). Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3.

- O is in the word (got '-' in BELOW at position 4), so O is present but not in position 4.

- We have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, L, W (all x in their guesses). So we cannot use these.

- Additionally, from BELOW, we know O is present, so we must use O in the next guess and place it in a position that is not 4 (since position 4 is wrong for O).

Also, we know E is present and must be at position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to form a guess that:
- Includes E (at either position 1 or 3) and places it accordingly.
- Includes O (since present) and does not place it in position 4.
- Avoids all excluded letters: C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S,B,L,W.

So available letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,M,S,B,L,W,O (O is in, but we've used it). We need to use new letters if possible, but since O and E are in, they must be included.

Available consonants/vowels: D, F, G, H, P, U, V, Y, perhaps less common letters like K, X, Z but avoid rare.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, P, U, V, Y.

Now, E must be at position 1 or 3.

Case 1: E at position 1.
Then, pattern: E _ _ _ _
We know position 4 cannot have O? Actually, O can be elsewhere, but position 4 for O is wrong, so O cannot be at position 4, but can be elsewhere.

We need to include O somewhere not position 4.

Possible words: E at 1, O at 2,3, or 5? But position 5: wait, we don't know about position 5.

Example: ""EBONY"" but E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5 → B and N excluded? B was excluded in BELOW, B(x). N excluded in CRANE.

So not.

""EDUCE"" → E1,D2,U3,C4,E5 → C excluded, E duplicate, E at 5 not allowed.

""EGRET"" → E1,G2,R3,E4,T5 → R and T excluded.

""HOW"" not 5.

Let's list possible words starting with E and including O, excluding bad letters.

Pattern: E _ _ O _ but if O is at position 4? No, because in BELOW, O was at position 4 and got '-', so position 4 is wrong for O, so we should not put O at 4 again.

So O should be at 1,2,3, or 5. But position 1 is E, so O at 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E at position 1: we can have O at 2, e.g., E O _ _ _

Or O at 3: E _ O _ _

Or O at 5: E _ _ _ O

But to maximize info, test O in new positions.

Also, E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _

With O somewhere not 4.

Let's try E at position 1 and O at a new position.

Word possibilities:

- ""EPOXY"" → E1,P2,O3,X4,Y5 → O at position 3. Letters E,P,O,X,Y. Check: P,X,Y not used yet? All seem valid. O is at position 3, which wasn't tested before.

But ""EPOXY"" contains O at position 3? Yes: E1, P2, O3, X4, Y5.

Now, position 4: we don't know, and X is tested.

But this is a valid word.

Another: ""ECHOS"" → C excluded.

""EMBOW"" → M,B excluded.

""ENDOW"" → N excluded.

""ENVOY"" → E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5 → N excluded? N is bad, and O at position 4! Which we know is wrong for O, so we must avoid position 4 for O.

In ""ENVOY"", O is at position 5? Wait: E1, N2, V3, O4? Position 4. But we know O cannot be at position 4, so guessing O at position 4 would be a waste. Feedback would give '-' again.

We should avoid position 4 for O in guesses.

Similarly, ""EPOXY"" has O at position 3, and positions: 4 is X, 5 is Y.

Now, alternative: E at position 3.

Pattern: _ _ E _ _

Include O not at position 4.

Possible: O at 1: O _ E _ _

Or O at 2: _ O E _ _

Or O at 5: _ _ E _ O

Or O at 3? Position 3 is E, so no.

Words:

- ""DOZED"" → E at 4? D1,O2,Z3,E4,D5 → E at 4 but we know E at 4 is wrong (from TIMES), so avoid E at 4. Also, duplicate D.

Better: ""HOPED"" → H1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4 wrong, and O at position 2? But E at position 4 is bad.

We have to avoid E at 4.

So E at position 3: positions 3 is E, so pattern _ _ E _ _

Then O can be at position 1,2,5.

Example: ""OPINE"" → O1,P2,I3,N4,E5 → I and N excluded.

""OFUSE"" not word.

""OUNCE"" → O1,U2,N3,C4,E5 → N and C excluded.

""DOUCE"" → D1,O2,U3,C4,E5 → C excluded.

""FOLEY"" → F1,O2,L3,E4,Y5 → L excluded, E at 4 wrong.

""HOVEL"" → H1,O2,V3,E4,L5 → L excluded, E at 4.

""COVET"" → C excluded.

""GOVEL"" not word.

""POWER"" → P1,O2,W3,E4,R5 → W and R excluded.

""VOTED"" → T excluded.

So harder.

Another possibility: O at position 5 with E at position 3: _ _ E _ O

Word: ""UDOES"" or something.

""DOGES"" → D1,O2,G3,E4,S5 → E at 4 bad.

""HOXES"" → H1,O2,X3,E4,S5 → S excluded.

""FUMED"" → F1,U2,M3,E4,D5 → M excluded.

It seems tricky.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" but Q not common.

Back to ""EPOXY"": E at position 1, O at position 3. We haven't tested position 1 for E or position 3 for O.

Moreover, it tests P, X, Y.

Since O is at position 3, which is not position 4 (forbidden for O).

Similarly, E at position 1: which hasn't been tested directly? In CRANE, E was at 5; TIMES, at 4; BELOW at 2; now E at 1 is new.

So that could be efficient.

Another word: ""EBOOK"" not 5 letters.

""DEBUG"" → D,E,B,U,G → B excluded.

""EDUCE"" → C excluded.

""EGYPT"" → G,Y,P,T → T excluded.

So ""EPOXY"" might be a good choice despite X being uncommon.

But is there a better word?

Consider E at position 1 and O at position 5: E _ _ _ O

Word: ""ECHOO"" not word.

""ELDOR"" not word.

""EMERO"" not.

""ENOLO"" not.

""ERGON"" → R excluded.

""EVRLO"" not.

So rare.

E at position 1 and O at position 2: E O _ _ _

Words: ""EOSIN"" → O2, S3, I4, N5 → S and I and N excluded.

""EOAN"" not.

""FOCI"" not 5.

No common.

Therefore, EPOXY is a candidate.

Perhaps E at position 3 and O at position 1.

Pattern: O _ E _ _

Words: ""OPERA"" → O1,P2,E3,R4,A5 → R and A excluded.

""OBESE"" → O1,B2,E3,S4,E5 → B and S excluded.

""OGEED"" not.

""OLEME"" not.

""OMEGA"" → O1,M2,E3,G4,A5 → M and A excluded? A is excluded, M also excluded.

""ONCER"" not.

""OUNCE"" → N and maybe C excluded? O1,U2,N3,C4,E5 → N excluded.

Not good.

O at position 2 and E at position 3: _ O E _ _

Words: ""DOZEN"" → N excluded.

""FOYER"" → F1,O2,Y3,E4,R5 → E at 4 bad, R excluded.

""GOFER"" → G1,O2,F3,E4,R5 → E at 4 bad.

""HOPED"" → E at 4 bad.

""JOKED"" → E at 4 bad.

""LOVES"" → L excluded, E at 4.

All have E at position 4? Because the structure _ O E _ _ often ends with E at 4 or something.

Not necessarily: ""COZED"" → C excluded.

So difficult.

Therefore, go with EPOXY.

But let's think: since E is at position 1 or 3, and O is present, we could prioritize O in a position that might be more likely.

Another word with E at position 3 and O at position 5: _ _ E _ O

Word: ""CHADO"" not.

""GAMBO"" not.

""PHOTO"" no E.

""BRIEO"" not.

So not common.

Also, we have other letters known: only E and O.

Perhaps we need to use other letters.

Another possibility: include other new common letters.

For example, with E at position 1: ""EDUCE"" invalid.

""EPOCH"" → E1,P2,O3,C4,H5 → C excluded.

""ERROR"" R excluded.

So EPOXY seems acceptable.

Perhaps ""EPODE"" but E duplicate and position 5? E1,P2,O3,D4,E5 → E at 5 bad.

No.

Alternatively, don't put O in this guess? But we know O is in the word, so it would be wasteful to exclude O.

We must include O to get positional info.

Therefore, ""EPOXY"" is a valid choice.

We'll guess ""EPOXY"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
From previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - Excludes C, R, A, N. E is in the word but not position 5.
- **Guess 2: TIMES** → Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)  
  - Excludes T, I, M, S. E is in the word but not position 4.
- **Guess 3: BELOW** → Feedback: B(x) E(-) L(x) O(-) W(x)  
  - Excludes B, L, W. E is in the word but not position 2. O is in the word but not position 4 (since O was guessed at position 4 and returned ""-"").

### Consolidated Information:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **E**: Must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3.  
   - **O**: Must be in the word but cannot be in position 4.  
   
2. **Excluded Letters**: All guesses combined rule out C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, L, W (11 letters total). These cannot appear in the secret word.  
   
3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include both **E** and **O** to gather positional feedback, as their presence is confirmed.  
   - **Place E in position 1 or 3**:  
     - Position 1 or 3 is untested for E (previously tested positions 5, 4, and 2 all returned ""-"").  
     - Position 1 is prioritized here to test a new location for E.  
   - **Avoid position 4 for O**: Since O at position 4 returned ""-"", place O elsewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
   - Include new high-frequency letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, P, U, V, Y (common choices).  
   - Prioritize words with letters like P, P+Y combo, or U/V for balanced coverage.  

### Word Selection Process:
- **""EPOXY""** was selected because:  
  - **E** is in position 1 (untested position).  
  - **O** is in position 3 (untested position; avoids position 4).  
  - Uses **P**, **X**, and **Y**, all new letters not excluded.  
  - Though ""X"" is less common, the word is valid and tests E+O positions efficiently.  
- **Why not alternatives?**  
  - E at position 3 words (e.g., ""OPERA"", ""OMEGA"") require O placement, but often conflict with exclusions or known wrong positions.  
  - Other E-at-1 words (e.g., ""EPOCH"") include excluded letters like ""C"".  
  - ""EPOXY"" maximizes new letter testing while honoring E/O constraints.  

### Expected Feedback Insight:
- If E is in position 1, it may return ""✓""; otherwise, ""-"" would indicate E is in position 3.  
- O in position 3 can return ""✓"" or ""-"" to clarify its position.  
- Letters P, X, Y will reveal if any are present or absent.  

<guess>EPOXY</guess>",EPOXY,"We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TIMES -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
Interpretation: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was placed there and got '-', meaning wrong position).

Guess 3: BELOW -> Feedback: B(x) E(-) L(x) O(-) W(x)
Interpretation: Letters B, L, W are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was placed there and got '-'). O is in the word but not in position 4? Let's check positions: BELOW has positions B1, E2, L3, O4, W5. So feedback says O(-) meaning O is in the word but not in position 4.

Now, consolidate known information:

- E is in the word, and we know it cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from BELOW, TIMES, and CRANE respectively). Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3.

- O is in the word (got '-' in BELOW at position 4), so O is present but not in position 4.

- We have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, L, W (all x in their guesses). So we cannot use these.

- Additionally, from BELOW, we know O is present, so we must use O in the next guess and place it in a position that is not 4 (since position 4 is wrong for O).

Also, we know E is present and must be at position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to form a guess that:
- Includes E (at either position 1 or 3) and places it accordingly.
- Includes O (since present) and does not place it in position 4.
- Avoids all excluded letters: C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S,B,L,W.

So available letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,M,S,B,L,W,O (O is in, but we've used it). We need to use new letters if possible, but since O and E are in, they must be included.

Available consonants/vowels: D, F, G, H, P, U, V, Y, perhaps less common letters like K, X, Z but avoid rare.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, P, U, V, Y.

Now, E must be at position 1 or 3.

Case 1: E at position 1.
Then, pattern: E _ _ _ _
We know position 4 cannot have O? Actually, O can be elsewhere, but position 4 for O is wrong, so O cannot be at position 4, but can be elsewhere.

We need to include O somewhere not position 4.

Possible words: E at 1, O at 2,3, or 5? But position 5: wait, we don't know about position 5.

Example: ""EBONY"" but E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5 → B and N excluded? B was excluded in BELOW, B(x). N excluded in CRANE.

So not.

""EDUCE"" → E1,D2,U3,C4,E5 → C excluded, E duplicate, E at 5 not allowed.

""EGRET"" → E1,G2,R3,E4,T5 → R and T excluded.

""HOW"" not 5.

Let's list possible words starting with E and including O, excluding bad letters.

Pattern: E _ _ O _ but if O is at position 4? No, because in BELOW, O was at position 4 and got '-', so position 4 is wrong for O, so we should not put O at 4 again.

So O should be at 1,2,3, or 5. But position 1 is E, so O at 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E at position 1: we can have O at 2, e.g., E O _ _ _

Or O at 3: E _ O _ _

Or O at 5: E _ _ _ O

But to maximize info, test O in new positions.

Better: ""HOPED"" → H1,O2,P3,E4,D5 → E at 4 wrong, and O at position 2? But E at position 4 is bad.

We have to avoid E at 4.

So E at position 3: positions 3 is E, so pattern _ _ E _ _

Then O can be at position 1,2,5.

Example: ""OPINE"" → O1,P2,I3,N4,E5 → I and N excluded.

   - Include new high-frequency letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, P, U, V, Y (common choices).  
   - Prioritize words with letters like P, P+Y combo, or U/V for balanced coverage.  

### Word Selection Process:
- **""EPOXY""** was selected because:  
  - **E** is in position 1 (untested position).  
  - **O** is in position 3 (untested position; avoids position 4).  
  - Uses **P**, **X**, and **Y**, all new letters not excluded.  
  - Though ""X"" is less common, the word is valid and tests E+O positions efficiently.  
- **Why not alternatives?**  
  - E at position 3 words (e.g., ""OPERA"", ""OMEGA"") require O placement, but often conflict with exclusions or known wrong positions.  
  - Other E-at-1 words (e.g., ""EPOCH"") include excluded letters like ""C"".  
  - ""EPOXY"" maximizes new letter testing while honoring E/O constraints.  

### Expected Feedback Insight:
- If E is in position 1, it may return ""✓""; otherwise, ""-"" would indicate E is in position 3.  
- O in position 3 can return ""✓"" or ""-"" to clarify its position.  
- Letters P, X, Y will reveal if any are present or absent.",Guess 4: EPOXY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) P(✓) O(✓) X(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
