We haven't received any feedback yet since this is the first guess. Therefore, we need to choose a good starting word.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible and to get maximum information.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are those with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""ADIEU"" are often used.

 Let's choose a word that:
   - Has 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage.
   - Includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

 One such word is ""ROAST"". It contains:
   - R, O, A, S, T: which are all common letters.
   - It has two vowels (O and A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but might leave out common consonants.

 Another consideration: the word should avoid repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Since we have to pick one, let's go with ""ROAST"".

 Therefore, our first guess is ""ROAST"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in a Wordle-like game, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word:
- Contains common vowels and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Uses letters that frequently appear in English words

After analyzing common Wordle strategies, words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"" are strong openers. I'll select ""SLATE"" because:
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- All letters are distinct, providing broader coverage
- S/T are among the most frequent consonants, A/E are common vowels
- Positions test common patterns (S-start, E-end)

This choice gives high probability for useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  L: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.
  - The word DOES contain L and A, but not in the positions they were guessed.

 Specifically:
  - L is not the second letter (since it was guessed in the second position and marked as wrong position).
  - A is not the third letter (since it was guessed in the third position and marked as wrong position).

 Also, since S, T, and E are absent, we can eliminate any words containing these letters.

 We have 5 more tries (now second guess).

 Now, our goal is to make a guess that:
  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
  - Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
  - Does not contain S, T, E.

 We should try to include other common letters to probe for more information.

 Since L and A are present, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think about where to put L and A.

 Possible positions for L: 
  - Cannot be position 2. So it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
  - Cannot be position 3. So it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (S, T, E).

 What are common letters that we haven't tried yet? 
  Let's consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

 We might also consider using a word that has L and A and three new letters to get more information.

 Let's try to form a word that includes L and A, plus three new consonants or vowels.

 Examples:

  We can try putting L in position 1 and A in position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, we have to avoid A in position 3 and L in position 2.

  Word candidate: ""BLACK"" -> but we cannot use S, T, E and here we have B, L, A, C, K. 
    But note: we have to check if it has S, T, E? It doesn't. Also, position of L is 2? No, in ""BLACK"":
      L is in position 2 -> but feedback told us L cannot be in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback was that L is not in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, we know that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in our new guess, we can put L in any position except we know it's not position 2? However, note: we are allowed to put L in position 2 again? But it would be marked as wrong position again? And we already know that's not the case. So to avoid wasting a letter, we should put L in a new position.

  Actually, we are allowed to put the same letter in the same position again? But it wouldn't be efficient because we know it's wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for L and position 3 for A.

  Let's avoid using L in position 2 and A in position 3.

  So ""BLACK"": 
      B at position 1
      L at position 2 -> but we know L is not in position 2 in the secret word, so this placement won't help us test L? Actually, if we put L in position 2, we would get a '-' again, but we already know that L is not in position 2. So it's better to put L in a different position to learn if it is elsewhere.

  Therefore, we should avoid position 2 for L.

  Alternative: put L in position 1? Then we have words starting with L.

  How about: ""LABOR"" -> but contains O and we don't know if O is present? Also, R? 
      But note: we don't know if O or R is in the word. However, we also have to avoid placing A in position 3? In ""LABOR"":
        L at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
        But we are placing A at position 2? That's allowed because earlier A was at 3 and now we are trying 2? And we haven't tested position 2 for A.

  However, we know that L must be somewhere else (not position 2) so putting L at 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at 2 is a new position.

  But the word must not contain S, T, E. ""LABOR"" doesn't have these.

  But wait: we have two letters we know are in the word: L and A. And we are introducing B, O, R. That might be okay.

  However, let's check the feedback rules: we want to get information about the positions of L and A, and also about the new letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and L in positions that we haven't tried and are possible.

  Since L can be in 1,3,4,5 and A can be in 1,2,4,5, let's try:

  Option: A at position 1 and L at position 4? Example: ""APPLE"" but E is not allowed.

  Without E: How about ""AUDIO"" -> but no L and we need L. 

  We must include both L and A.

  Let me try with L in position 1 and A in position 4? Example: ""LARVA"" -> but V? Also, we have double A? And we don't know if R and V are present.

  How about: ""CLAIM"" -> but C, L, A, I, M. 
    Positions: 
      1: C
      2: L -> but we know L is not at position 2? Then we are putting L at position 2? That's the same as before? And we will get a '-' again? So it doesn't help.

  So we avoid putting L at position 2.

  How about putting L at position 4 and A at position 1? Example: ""ALARM"" -> contains A and L? 
      A at 1, L at 2 -> again L at 2? We shouldn't.

  How about ""MANLY"": 
      M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
      A is at 2 -> which we haven't tried? and L is at 4 -> new position.

  Also, no S, T, E.

  This word uses two known letters (A and L) and introduces M, N, Y.

  We can also consider: ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N -> 
      L at position 2 again? Avoid.

  So ""MANLY"": 
      Letters are M, A, N, L, Y -> positions: 
        A at 2 (we haven't tried A at 2? Previously A was at 3 -> now we try 2) 
        L at 4 (previously at 2 -> now at 4)

  But note: in the secret word, L is not at position 2? That doesn't mean it can't be at 4? So we can test.

  Alternatively: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> 
      A at position 2? 
      L at position 3? 
      We haven't tried A at 2? or L at 3? 

  However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? In this word, A is at 2 and L at 3 -> that positions are allowed.

  But note: we don't know if A is allowed at 2? We only know it's not at 3? Similarly, L not at 2? So we can have L at 3? 

  Let me list the constraints:
    For L: not at position 2 -> so it can be 1,3,4,5.
    For A: not at position 3 -> so it can be 1,2,4,5? 

  So both A at 2 and L at 3 are possible? 

  So ""VALID"" is a candidate.

  Other candidate: ""RADAR"" -> has two A's? But we don't know if A is repeated? Also, has R and D? And we don't know.

  It might be better to avoid duplicate letters at this stage? So we can get information about more letters.

  I'm considering ""VALID"": 
      Letters: V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct and new? 

  We haven't tested V, I, D? 

  But note: we have only 5 letters? 

  How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1
        A at 2
        I at 3? 
        L at 4? 
        Y at 5
      This avoids L at 2 and A at 3? 
      But A at 2? and L at 4? 

  But we don't know if D, I, Y are present? 

  So ""DAILY"" is also a candidate.

  Let me compare:
    Requirements: must include L and A, and exclude S, T, E.

  Both ""DAILY"" and ""VALID"" fit.

  We want to maximize information? Which one uses more common letters? 

  Common letters in English: I is a common vowel? So ""DAILY"" has I. D and V are both common? 

  Or we can choose one that has vowels that we haven't tested? We haven't tested I, O, U? 

  Since we don't have any vowel information except A? And A is in the word? 

  We could also consider:

    ""CHAOS"" -> has S? which we know is absent -> invalid.

    ""QUAIL"" -> Q and U? and I? and L at the end? 
        Positions: Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3? -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we cannot put A at 3? 
        So we have to avoid A at 3? If we put A at 3, then we expect it to be wrong? 

        But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we get '-'. But we already know that A is not at 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' again? But we already know that? So it's wasting a letter? 

        Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid L in position 2? 

  So we need a word that puts A not in position 3? So ""QUAIL"" has A at 3 -> invalid because we are forced to avoid? 

  Therefore, let's choose one that puts A in a different position? 

  Back to ""DAILY"": A at 2? -> allowed? Because we don't know about position 2? 

  How about ""AWAIT"": has A at 1 and A at 4? But also W and I and T? T is absent? So not allowed? T is excluded.

  Let me try: ""OUIJA"" -> has J, and also repeats? Not ideal.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is good: 
      D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1 -> new
        A at 2 -> new position for A
        I at 3 -> new
        L at 4 -> new position for L (previously at 2, now at 4)
        Y at 5 -> new

  This tests:
    - A at position 2? 
    - L at position 4? 

  And introduces D, I, Y? 

  But note: we are also covering I? which is a common vowel? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses only consonants? But we have A which is vowel? 

  Another candidate: ""ALIGN"": A at 1? and L at 2? -> L at 2? We must avoid? So invalid.

  Or ""PLAIN"": P, L (at 2 again) -> avoid.

  So ""DAILY"" seems good? 

  But let me check the dictionary? We must ensure it's a valid word.

  Yes, ""daily"" is a common word.

  Another option: ""RALLY"" -> R, A, L, L, Y -> repeated L? And L is at position 3 and 4? But one of them might be correct? However, we don't know if L is repeated? And we have L at position 3? We haven't tried position 3? But also A at 2? 
      And R and Y? 

  However, repeated L might not be ideal? Because if the word has only one L, then we are wasting? 

  So ""DAILY"" is distinct? 

  Also note: ""daily"" has 5 distinct letters? 

  Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"" as the second guess.

  We'll get feedback on each letter? And then proceed? 

  So next guess: ""daily""

  Format: <guess>daily</guess>? 

  But the response must be: <guess>word</guess>? 

  So: <guess>daily</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from ""slate"":  
- S, T, E are **absent** (marked 'x')  
- L and A are **present** but in wrong positions (L not pos2, A not pos3)  

Goal for next guess:  
- Must include L and A while avoiding positions 2 for L and 3 for A  
- Exclude S, T, E  
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (D, I, Y) to maximize information  

Chose **""daily""**:  
- D (new letter) at position 1  
- A at position 2 (previously untested position for A)  
- I (new vowel) at position 3  
- L at position 4 (new position to test)  
- Y (new letter) at position 5  
- All letters distinct to cover more possibilities  

This tests new positions for L/A while probing common unconfirmed letters.  

<guess>daily</guess>",daily,"We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  L: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.
  - The word DOES contain L and A, but not in the positions they were guessed.

 Specifically:
  - L is not the second letter (since it was guessed in the second position and marked as wrong position).
  - A is not the third letter (since it was guessed in the third position and marked as wrong position).

 Also, since S, T, and E are absent, we can eliminate any words containing these letters.

  Let's avoid using L in position 2 and A in position 3.

  So ""BLACK"": 
      B at position 1
      L at position 2 -> but we know L is not in position 2 in the secret word, so this placement won't help us test L? Actually, if we put L in position 2, we would get a '-' again, but we already know that L is not in position 2. So it's better to put L in a different position to learn if it is elsewhere.

  Therefore, we should avoid position 2 for L.

  Alternative: put L in position 1? Then we have words starting with L.

  How about: ""LABOR"" -> but contains O and we don't know if O is present? Also, R? 
      But note: we don't know if O or R is in the word. However, we also have to avoid placing A in position 3? In ""LABOR"":
        L at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
        But we are placing A at position 2? That's allowed because earlier A was at 3 and now we are trying 2? And we haven't tested position 2 for A.

  However, we know that L must be somewhere else (not position 2) so putting L at 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at 2 is a new position.

  But the word must not contain S, T, E. ""LABOR"" doesn't have these.

  But wait: we have two letters we know are in the word: L and A. And we are introducing B, O, R. That might be okay.

  However, let's check the feedback rules: we want to get information about the positions of L and A, and also about the new letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and L in positions that we haven't tried and are possible.

  Since L can be in 1,3,4,5 and A can be in 1,2,4,5, let's try:

  Option: A at position 1 and L at position 4? Example: ""APPLE"" but E is not allowed.

  Without E: How about ""AUDIO"" -> but no L and we need L. 

  We must include both L and A.

  Let me try with L in position 1 and A in position 4? Example: ""LARVA"" -> but V? Also, we have double A? And we don't know if R and V are present.

  How about: ""CLAIM"" -> but C, L, A, I, M. 
    Positions: 
      1: C
      2: L -> but we know L is not at position 2? Then we are putting L at position 2? That's the same as before? And we will get a '-' again? So it doesn't help.

  So we avoid putting L at position 2.

  How about putting L at position 4 and A at position 1? Example: ""ALARM"" -> contains A and L? 
      A at 1, L at 2 -> again L at 2? We shouldn't.

  How about ""MANLY"": 
      M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
      A is at 2 -> which we haven't tried? and L is at 4 -> new position.

  Also, no S, T, E.

  This word uses two known letters (A and L) and introduces M, N, Y.

  We can also consider: ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N -> 
      L at position 2 again? Avoid.

  So ""MANLY"": 
      Letters are M, A, N, L, Y -> positions: 
        A at 2 (we haven't tried A at 2? Previously A was at 3 -> now we try 2) 
        L at 4 (previously at 2 -> now at 4)

  But note: in the secret word, L is not at position 2? That doesn't mean it can't be at 4? So we can test.

  Alternatively: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> 
      A at position 2? 
      L at position 3? 
      We haven't tried A at 2? or L at 3? 

  However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? In this word, A is at 2 and L at 3 -> that positions are allowed.

  But note: we don't know if A is allowed at 2? We only know it's not at 3? Similarly, L not at 2? So we can have L at 3? 

  Let me list the constraints:
    For L: not at position 2 -> so it can be 1,3,4,5.
    For A: not at position 3 -> so it can be 1,2,4,5? 

  So both A at 2 and L at 3 are possible? 

  So ""VALID"" is a candidate.

  Other candidate: ""RADAR"" -> has two A's? But we don't know if A is repeated? Also, has R and D? And we don't know.

  It might be better to avoid duplicate letters at this stage? So we can get information about more letters.

  I'm considering ""VALID"": 
      Letters: V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct and new? 

  We haven't tested V, I, D? 

  But note: we have only 5 letters? 

  How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1
        A at 2
        I at 3? 
        L at 4? 
        Y at 5
      This avoids L at 2 and A at 3? 
      But A at 2? and L at 4? 

  But we don't know if D, I, Y are present? 

  So ""DAILY"" is also a candidate.

  Let me compare:
    Requirements: must include L and A, and exclude S, T, E.

  Both ""DAILY"" and ""VALID"" fit.

  We want to maximize information? Which one uses more common letters? 

  Common letters in English: I is a common vowel? So ""DAILY"" has I. D and V are both common? 

  Or we can choose one that has vowels that we haven't tested? We haven't tested I, O, U? 

  Since we don't have any vowel information except A? And A is in the word? 

  We could also consider:

    ""CHAOS"" -> has S? which we know is absent -> invalid.

    ""QUAIL"" -> Q and U? and I? and L at the end? 
        Positions: Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3? -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we cannot put A at 3? 
        So we have to avoid A at 3? If we put A at 3, then we expect it to be wrong? 

        But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we get '-'. But we already know that A is not at 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' again? But we already know that? So it's wasting a letter? 

        Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid L in position 2? 

  So we need a word that puts A not in position 3? So ""QUAIL"" has A at 3 -> invalid because we are forced to avoid? 

  Therefore, let's choose one that puts A in a different position? 

  Back to ""DAILY"": A at 2? -> allowed? Because we don't know about position 2? 

  How about ""AWAIT"": has A at 1 and A at 4? But also W and I and T? T is absent? So not allowed? T is excluded.

  Let me try: ""OUIJA"" -> has J, and also repeats? Not ideal.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is good: 
      D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1 -> new
        A at 2 -> new position for A
        I at 3 -> new
        L at 4 -> new position for L (previously at 2, now at 4)
        Y at 5 -> new

  This tests:
    - A at position 2? 
    - L at position 4? 

  And introduces D, I, Y? 

  But note: we are also covering I? which is a common vowel? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses only consonants? But we have A which is vowel? 

  Another candidate: ""ALIGN"": A at 1? and L at 2? -> L at 2? We must avoid? So invalid.

  Or ""PLAIN"": P, L (at 2 again) -> avoid.

  So ""DAILY"" seems good? 

  But let me check the dictionary? We must ensure it's a valid word.

  Yes, ""daily"" is a common word.

  Another option: ""RALLY"" -> R, A, L, L, Y -> repeated L? And L is at position 3 and 4? But one of them might be correct? However, we don't know if L is repeated? And we have L at position 3? We haven't tried position 3? But also A at 2? 
      And R and Y? 

  However, repeated L might not be ideal? Because if the word has only one L, then we are wasting? 

  So ""DAILY"" is distinct? 

  Also note: ""daily"" has 5 distinct letters? 

  Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"" as the second guess.

  We'll get feedback on each letter? And then proceed? 

  So next guess: ""daily""

  Format: <guess>daily</guess>? 

  But the response must be: <guess>word</guess>? 

  So: <guess>daily</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""slate"":  
- S, T, E are **absent** (marked 'x')  
- L and A are **present** but in wrong positions (L not pos2, A not pos3)  

Goal for next guess:  
- Must include L and A while avoiding positions 2 for L and 3 for A  
- Exclude S, T, E  
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (D, I, Y) to maximize information  

Chose **""daily""**:  
- D (new letter) at position 1  
- A at position 2 (previously untested position for A)  
- I (new vowel) at position 3  
- L at position 4 (new position to test)  
- Y (new letter) at position 5  
- All letters distinct to cover more possibilities  

This tests new positions for L/A while probing common unconfirmed letters.",Guess 2: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(-) I(x) L(-) Y(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We haven't received any feedback yet since this is the first guess. Therefore, we need to choose a good starting word.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible and to get maximum information.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are those with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""ADIEU"" are often used.

 Let's choose a word that:
   - Has 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage.
   - Includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

 One such word is ""ROAST"". It contains:
   - R, O, A, S, T: which are all common letters.
   - It has two vowels (O and A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but might leave out common consonants.

 Another consideration: the word should avoid repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Since we have to pick one, let's go with ""ROAST"".

 Therefore, our first guess is ""ROAST"".<thinking>
For the first guess in a Wordle-like game, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word:
- Contains common vowels and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Uses letters that frequently appear in English words

After analyzing common Wordle strategies, words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"" are strong openers. I'll select ""SLATE"" because:
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- All letters are distinct, providing broader coverage
- S/T are among the most frequent consonants, A/E are common vowels
- Positions test common patterns (S-start, E-end)

This choice gives high probability for useful feedback regardless of the secret word.
</thinking>

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  L: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.
  - The word DOES contain L and A, but not in the positions they were guessed.

 Specifically:
  - L is not the second letter (since it was guessed in the second position and marked as wrong position).
  - A is not the third letter (since it was guessed in the third position and marked as wrong position).

 Also, since S, T, and E are absent, we can eliminate any words containing these letters.

 We have 5 more tries (now second guess).

 Now, our goal is to make a guess that:
  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
  - Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
  - Does not contain S, T, E.

 We should try to include other common letters to probe for more information.

 Since L and A are present, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think about where to put L and A.

 Possible positions for L: 
  - Cannot be position 2. So it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
  - Cannot be position 3. So it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (S, T, E).

 What are common letters that we haven't tried yet? 
  Let's consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

 We might also consider using a word that has L and A and three new letters to get more information.

 Let's try to form a word that includes L and A, plus three new consonants or vowels.

 Examples:

  We can try putting L in position 1 and A in position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, we have to avoid A in position 3 and L in position 2.

  Word candidate: ""BLACK"" -> but we cannot use S, T, E and here we have B, L, A, C, K. 
    But note: we have to check if it has S, T, E? It doesn't. Also, position of L is 2? No, in ""BLACK"":
      L is in position 2 -> but feedback told us L cannot be in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback was that L is not in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, we know that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in our new guess, we can put L in any position except we know it's not position 2? However, note: we are allowed to put L in position 2 again? But it would be marked as wrong position again? And we already know that's not the case. So to avoid wasting a letter, we should put L in a new position.

  Actually, we are allowed to put the same letter in the same position again? But it wouldn't be efficient because we know it's wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for L and position 3 for A.

  Let's avoid using L in position 2 and A in position 3.

  So ""BLACK"": 
      B at position 1
      L at position 2 -> but we know L is not in position 2 in the secret word, so this placement won't help us test L? Actually, if we put L in position 2, we would get a '-' again, but we already know that L is not in position 2. So it's better to put L in a different position to learn if it is elsewhere.

  Therefore, we should avoid position 2 for L.

  Alternative: put L in position 1? Then we have words starting with L.

  How about: ""LABOR"" -> but contains O and we don't know if O is present? Also, R? 
      But note: we don't know if O or R is in the word. However, we also have to avoid placing A in position 3? In ""LABOR"":
        L at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
        But we are placing A at position 2? That's allowed because earlier A was at 3 and now we are trying 2? And we haven't tested position 2 for A.

  However, we know that L must be somewhere else (not position 2) so putting L at 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at 2 is a new position.

  But the word must not contain S, T, E. ""LABOR"" doesn't have these.

  But wait: we have two letters we know are in the word: L and A. And we are introducing B, O, R. That might be okay.

  However, let's check the feedback rules: we want to get information about the positions of L and A, and also about the new letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and L in positions that we haven't tried and are possible.

  Since L can be in 1,3,4,5 and A can be in 1,2,4,5, let's try:

  Option: A at position 1 and L at position 4? Example: ""APPLE"" but E is not allowed.

  Without E: How about ""AUDIO"" -> but no L and we need L. 

  We must include both L and A.

  Let me try with L in position 1 and A in position 4? Example: ""LARVA"" -> but V? Also, we have double A? And we don't know if R and V are present.

  How about: ""CLAIM"" -> but C, L, A, I, M. 
    Positions: 
      1: C
      2: L -> but we know L is not at position 2? Then we are putting L at position 2? That's the same as before? And we will get a '-' again? So it doesn't help.

  So we avoid putting L at position 2.

  How about putting L at position 4 and A at position 1? Example: ""ALARM"" -> contains A and L? 
      A at 1, L at 2 -> again L at 2? We shouldn't.

  How about ""MANLY"": 
      M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
      A is at 2 -> which we haven't tried? and L is at 4 -> new position.

  Also, no S, T, E.

  This word uses two known letters (A and L) and introduces M, N, Y.

  We can also consider: ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N -> 
      L at position 2 again? Avoid.

  So ""MANLY"": 
      Letters are M, A, N, L, Y -> positions: 
        A at 2 (we haven't tried A at 2? Previously A was at 3 -> now we try 2) 
        L at 4 (previously at 2 -> now at 4)

  But note: in the secret word, L is not at position 2? That doesn't mean it can't be at 4? So we can test.

  Alternatively: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> 
      A at position 2? 
      L at position 3? 
      We haven't tried A at 2? or L at 3? 

  However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? In this word, A is at 2 and L at 3 -> that positions are allowed.

  But note: we don't know if A is allowed at 2? We only know it's not at 3? Similarly, L not at 2? So we can have L at 3? 

  Let me list the constraints:
    For L: not at position 2 -> so it can be 1,3,4,5.
    For A: not at position 3 -> so it can be 1,2,4,5? 

  So both A at 2 and L at 3 are possible? 

  So ""VALID"" is a candidate.

  Other candidate: ""RADAR"" -> has two A's? But we don't know if A is repeated? Also, has R and D? And we don't know.

  It might be better to avoid duplicate letters at this stage? So we can get information about more letters.

  I'm considering ""VALID"": 
      Letters: V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct and new? 

  We haven't tested V, I, D? 

  But note: we have only 5 letters? 

  How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1
        A at 2
        I at 3? 
        L at 4? 
        Y at 5
      This avoids L at 2 and A at 3? 
      But A at 2? and L at 4? 

  But we don't know if D, I, Y are present? 

  So ""DAILY"" is also a candidate.

  Let me compare:
    Requirements: must include L and A, and exclude S, T, E.

  Both ""DAILY"" and ""VALID"" fit.

  We want to maximize information? Which one uses more common letters? 

  Common letters in English: I is a common vowel? So ""DAILY"" has I. D and V are both common? 

  Or we can choose one that has vowels that we haven't tested? We haven't tested I, O, U? 

  Since we don't have any vowel information except A? And A is in the word? 

  We could also consider:

    ""CHAOS"" -> has S? which we know is absent -> invalid.

    ""QUAIL"" -> Q and U? and I? and L at the end? 
        Positions: Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3? -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we cannot put A at 3? 
        So we have to avoid A at 3? If we put A at 3, then we expect it to be wrong? 

        But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we get '-'. But we already know that A is not at 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' again? But we already know that? So it's wasting a letter? 

        Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid L in position 2? 

  So we need a word that puts A not in position 3? So ""QUAIL"" has A at 3 -> invalid because we are forced to avoid? 

  Therefore, let's choose one that puts A in a different position? 

  Back to ""DAILY"": A at 2? -> allowed? Because we don't know about position 2? 

  How about ""AWAIT"": has A at 1 and A at 4? But also W and I and T? T is absent? So not allowed? T is excluded.

  Let me try: ""OUIJA"" -> has J, and also repeats? Not ideal.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is good: 
      D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1 -> new
        A at 2 -> new position for A
        I at 3 -> new
        L at 4 -> new position for L (previously at 2, now at 4)
        Y at 5 -> new

  This tests:
    - A at position 2? 
    - L at position 4? 

  And introduces D, I, Y? 

  But note: we are also covering I? which is a common vowel? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses only consonants? But we have A which is vowel? 

  Another candidate: ""ALIGN"": A at 1? and L at 2? -> L at 2? We must avoid? So invalid.

  Or ""PLAIN"": P, L (at 2 again) -> avoid.

  So ""DAILY"" seems good? 

  But let me check the dictionary? We must ensure it's a valid word.

  Yes, ""daily"" is a common word.

  Another option: ""RALLY"" -> R, A, L, L, Y -> repeated L? And L is at position 3 and 4? But one of them might be correct? However, we don't know if L is repeated? And we have L at position 3? We haven't tried position 3? But also A at 2? 
      And R and Y? 

  However, repeated L might not be ideal? Because if the word has only one L, then we are wasting? 

  So ""DAILY"" is distinct? 

  Also note: ""daily"" has 5 distinct letters? 

  Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"" as the second guess.

  We'll get feedback on each letter? And then proceed? 

  So next guess: ""daily""

  Format: <guess>daily</guess>? 

  But the response must be: <guess>word</guess>? 

  So: <guess>daily</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""slate"":  
- S, T, E are **absent** (marked 'x')  
- L and A are **present** but in wrong positions (L not pos2, A not pos3)  

Goal for next guess:  
- Must include L and A while avoiding positions 2 for L and 3 for A  
- Exclude S, T, E  
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (D, I, Y) to maximize information  

Chose **""daily""**:  
- D (new letter) at position 1  
- A at position 2 (previously untested position for A)  
- I (new vowel) at position 3  
- L at position 4 (new position to test)  
- Y (new letter) at position 5  
- All letters distinct to cover more possibilities  

This tests new positions for L/A while probing common unconfirmed letters.

It contains:\n   - R, O, A, S, T: which are all common letters.\n   - It has two vowels (O and A) and three consonants (R, S, T).\n\n Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but might leave out common consonants.\n\n Another consideration: the word should avoid repeated letters to cover more ground.\n\n Since we have to pick one, let\'s go with ""ROAST"".\n\n Therefore, our first guess is ""ROAST"".<thinking>\nFor the first guess in a Wordle-like game, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain.

I\'ll select ""SLATE"" because:\n- It covers three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)\n- All letters are distinct, providing broader coverage\n- S/T are among the most frequent consonants, A/E are common vowels\n- Positions test common patterns (S-start, E-end)\n\nThis choice gives high probability for useful feedback regardless of the secret word.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"":\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  L: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\n So, from this feedback, we know:\n  - The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.\n  - The word DOES contain L and A, but not in the positions they were guessed.\n\n Specifically:\n  - L is not the second letter (since it was guessed in the second position and marked as wrong position).\n  - A is not the third letter (since it was guessed in the third position and marked as wrong position).\n\n Also, since S, T, and E are absent, we can eliminate any words containing these letters.\n\n We have 5 more tries (now second guess).\n\n Now, our goal is to make a guess that:\n  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n  - Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n  - Does not contain S, T, E.\n\n We should try to include other common letters to probe for more information.\n\n Since L and A are present, we can try to place them in different positions.\n\n Let\'s think about where to put L and A.\n\n Possible positions for L: \n  - Cannot be position 2. So it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Possible positions for A:\n  - Cannot be position 3. So it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (S, T, E).\n\n What are common letters that we haven\'t tried yet? \n  Let\'s consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n We might also consider using a word that has L and A and three new letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes L and A, plus three new consonants or vowels.\n\n Examples:\n\n  We can try putting L in position 1 and A in position 2? But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid A in position 3 and L in position 2.\n\n  Word candidate: ""BLACK"" -> but we cannot use S, T, E and here we have B, L, A, C, K. \n    But note: we have to check if it has S, T, E? It doesn\'t. Also, position of L is 2? No, in ""BLACK"":\n      L is in position 2 -> but feedback told us L cannot be in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback was that L is not in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, we know that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in our new guess, we can put L in any position except we know it\'s not position 2? However, note: we are allowed to put L in position 2 again? But it would be marked as wrong position again? And we already know that\'s not the case. So to avoid wasting a letter, we should put L in a new position.\n\n  Actually, we are allowed to put the same letter in the same position again? But it wouldn\'t be efficient because we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for L and position 3 for A.\n\n  Let\'s avoid using L in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\n  So ""BLACK"": \n      B at position 1\n      L at position 2 -> but we know L is not in position 2 in the secret word, so this placement won\'t help us test L? Actually, if we put L in position 2, we would get a \'-\' again, but we already know that L is not in position 2. So it\'s better to put L in a different position to learn if it is elsewhere.\n\n  Therefore, we should avoid position 2 for L.\n\n  Alternative: put L in position 1? Then we have words starting with L.\n\n  How about: ""LABOR"" -> but contains O and we don\'t know if O is present? Also, R? \n      But note: we don\'t know if O or R is in the word. However, we also have to avoid placing A in position 3? In ""LABOR"":\n        L at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, R at 5.\n        But we are placing A at position 2? That\'s allowed because earlier A was at 3 and now we are trying 2? And we haven\'t tested position 2 for A.\n\n  However, we know that L must be somewhere else (not position 2) so putting L at 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at 2 is a new position.\n\n  But the word must not contain S, T, E. ""LABOR"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n  But wait: we have two letters we know are in the word: L and A. And we are introducing B, O, R. That might be okay.\n\n  However, let\'s check the feedback rules: we want to get information about the positions of L and A, and also about the new letters.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and L in positions that we haven\'t tried and are possible.\n\n  Since L can be in 1,3,4,5 and A can be in 1,2,4,5, let\'s try:\n\n  Option: A at position 1 and L at position 4? Example: ""APPLE"" but E is not allowed.\n\n  Without E: How about ""AUDIO"" -> but no L and we need L. \n\n  We must include both L and A.\n\n  Let me try with L in position 1 and A in position 4? Example: ""LARVA"" -> but V? Also, we have double A? And we don\'t know if R and V are present.\n\n  How about: ""CLAIM"" -> but C, L, A, I, M. \n    Positions: \n      1: C\n      2: L -> but we know L is not at position 2? Then we are putting L at position 2? That\'s the same as before? And we will get a \'-\' again? So it doesn\'t help.\n\n  So we avoid putting L at position 2.\n\n  How about putting L at position 4 and A at position 1? Example: ""ALARM"" -> contains A and L? \n      A at 1, L at 2 -> again L at 2? We shouldn\'t.\n\n  How about ""MANLY"": \n      M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n      A is at 2 -> which we haven\'t tried? and L is at 4 -> new position.\n\n  Also, no S, T, E.\n\n  This word uses two known letters (A and L) and introduces M, N, Y.\n\n  We can also consider: ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N -> \n      L at position 2 again? Avoid.\n\n  So ""MANLY"": \n      Letters are M, A, N, L, Y -> positions: \n        A at 2 (we haven\'t tried A at 2? Previously A was at 3 -> now we try 2) \n        L at 4 (previously at 2 -> now at 4)\n\n  But note: in the secret word, L is not at position 2? That doesn\'t mean it can\'t be at 4? So we can test.\n\n  Alternatively: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> \n      A at position 2? \n      L at position 3? \n      We haven\'t tried A at 2? or L at 3? \n\n  However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? In this word, A is at 2 and L at 3 -> that positions are allowed.\n\n  But note: we don\'t know if A is allowed at 2? We only know it\'s not at 3? Similarly, L not at 2? So we can have L at 3? \n\n  Let me list the constraints:\n    For L: not at position 2 -> so it can be 1,3,4,5.\n    For A: not at position 3 -> so it can be 1,2,4,5? \n\n  So both A at 2 and L at 3 are possible? \n\n  So ""VALID"" is a candidate.\n\n  Other candidate: ""RADAR"" -> has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if A is repeated? Also, has R and D? And we don\'t know.\n\n  It might be better to avoid duplicate letters at this stage? So we can get information about more letters.\n\n  I\'m considering ""VALID"": \n      Letters: V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct and new? \n\n  We haven\'t tested V, I, D? \n\n  But note: we have only 5 letters? \n\n  How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> \n      Positions: \n        D at 1\n        A at 2\n        I at 3? \n        L at 4? \n        Y at 5\n      This avoids L at 2 and A at 3? \n      But A at 2? and L at 4? \n\n  But we don\'t know if D, I, Y are present? \n\n  So ""DAILY"" is also a candidate.\n\n  Let me compare:\n    Requirements: must include L and A, and exclude S, T, E.\n\n  Both ""DAILY"" and ""VALID"" fit.\n\n  We want to maximize information? Which one uses more common letters? \n\n  Common letters in English: I is a common vowel? So ""DAILY"" has I. D and V are both common? \n\n  Or we can choose one that has vowels that we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested I, O, U? \n\n  Since we don\'t have any vowel information except A? And A is in the word? \n\n  We could also consider:\n\n    ""CHAOS"" -> has S? which we know is absent -> invalid.\n\n    ""QUAIL"" -> Q and U? and I? and L at the end? \n        Positions: Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3? -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we cannot put A at 3? \n        So we have to avoid A at 3? If we put A at 3, then we expect it to be wrong? \n\n        But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we get \'-\'. But we already know that A is not at 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get \'-\' again? But we already know that? So it\'s wasting a letter? \n\n        Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid L in position 2? \n\n  So we need a word that puts A not in position 3? So ""QUAIL"" has A at 3 -> invalid because we are forced to avoid? \n\n  Therefore, let\'s choose one that puts A in a different position? \n\n  Back to ""DAILY"": A at 2? -> allowed? Because we don\'t know about position 2? \n\n  How about ""AWAIT"": has A at 1 and A at 4? But also W and I and T? T is absent? So not allowed? T is excluded.\n\n  Let me try: ""OUIJA"" -> has J, and also repeats? Not ideal.\n\n  So I think ""DAILY"" is good: \n      D, A, I, L, Y -> \n      Positions: \n        D at 1 -> new\n        A at 2 -> new position for A\n        I at 3 -> new\n        L at 4 -> new position for L (previously at 2, now at 4)\n        Y at 5 -> new\n\n  This tests:\n    - A at position 2? \n    - L at position 4? \n\n  And introduces D, I, Y? \n\n  But note: we are also covering I? which is a common vowel? \n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses only consonants? But we have A which is vowel? \n\n  Another candidate: ""ALIGN"": A at 1? and L at 2? -> L at 2? We must avoid? So invalid.\n\n  Or ""PLAIN"": P, L (at 2 again) -> avoid.\n\n  So ""DAILY"" seems good? \n\n  But let me check the dictionary? We must ensure it\'s a valid word.\n\n  Yes, ""daily"" is a common word.\n\n  Another option: ""RALLY"" -> R, A, L, L, Y -> repeated L? And L is at position 3 and 4? But one of them might be correct? However, we don\'t know if L is repeated? And we have L at position 3? We haven\'t tried position 3? But also A at 2? \n      And R and Y? \n\n  However, repeated L might not be ideal? Because if the word has only one L, then we are wasting? \n\n  So ""DAILY"" is distinct? \n\n  Also note: ""daily"" has 5 distinct letters? \n\n  Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"" as the second guess.\n\n  We\'ll get feedback on each letter? And then proceed? \n\n  So next guess: ""daily""\n\n  Format: <guess>daily</guess>? \n\n  But the response must be: <guess>word</guess>? \n\n  So: <guess>daily</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""slate"":  \n- S, T, E are **absent** (marked \'x\')  \n- L and A are **present** but in wrong positions (L not pos2, A not pos3)  \n\nGoal for next guess:  \n- Must include L and A while avoiding positions 2 for L and 3 for A  \n- Exclude S, T, E  \n- Introduce new high-frequency letters (D, I, Y) to maximize information  \n\nChose **""daily""**:  \n- D (new letter) at position 1  \n- A at position 2 (previously untested position for A)  \n- I (new vowel) at position 3  \n- L at position 4 (new position to test)  \n- Y (new letter) at position 5  \n- All letters distinct to cover more possibilities  \n\nThis tests new positions for L/A while probing common unconfirmed letters.\n\n<guess>daily</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(-) I(x) L(-) Y(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""slate""):
  S: x (absent)
  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2)
  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: x (absent)

From Guess 2 (""daily""):
  D: x (absent)
  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2 in this guess)
  I: x (absent)
  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 4 in this guess)
  Y: - (present but wrong position; originally position 5)

What we know:

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I (so letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, I)

Present letters: A, L, Y (each must appear at least once, with constraints on positions)

Constraints on positions:
- A is present but not in position 2 (from ""daily"") and not in position 3 (from ""slate"")
- L is present but not in position 2 (from ""slate"") and not in position 4 (from ""daily"")
- Y is present but not in position 5 (from ""daily"")

Also, note that the positions where A, L, Y cannot be:
- A cannot be at position 2 or 3
- L cannot be at position 2 or 4
- Y cannot be at position 5

Therefore, possible positions:
- A: can be at 1, 4, 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out)
- L: can be at 1, 3, 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out)
- Y: can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (since position 5 is ruled out)

Additionally, since these letters are present, we also must include them in the next guess.

We have two more known present letters: A, L, Y. And we know that the word does not contain S, T, E, D, I.

We have 6 letters known absent: S, T, E, D, I.

We have 3 known present letters: A, L, Y.

Since we have only 3 known present letters and the word is 5 letters, there must be two more letters that we don't know yet. So we need to introduce two new letters.

Our next guess should:
- Include A, L, Y in positions that are allowed (according to the constraints above)
- Exclude S, T, E, D, I
- Include two new letters to test for presence.

We should also consider common English letters.

Possible positions:

We need to assign A, L, Y to positions 1,3,5? But note we also have positions 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- A can be at 1,4,5
- L can be at 1,3,5
- Y can be at 1,2,3,4

But note: it's possible to have the same letter? Actually, no duplicates known yet? But note: we don't have information that forbids duplicates? So we cannot assume.

But so far the known letters are distinct: A, L, Y.

We also have to avoid positions:
- A: avoid 2,3
- L: avoid 2,4
- Y: avoid 5

Now, we need to assign them to the word.

We also have to introduce two new letters.

Let me try to assign the positions:

Option 1: 
  Position 1: A (since A can be at 1)
  Position 2: ? (must be a new letter? and cannot be one of the already absent)
  Position 3: L (since L can be at 3; and A is not at 3? Wait, but A is at 1, so we can have L at 3)
  Position 4: Y (Y can be at 4? But note: L cannot be at position 4? But Y can be at 4? Yes)
  Position 5: ? (must be a new letter? But wait, position 5: we haven't assigned any? But if we put A at 1, L at 3, Y at 4, then position 2 and 5 are free.)

But note: we also need to avoid putting Y at 5? So position 5 must be something else? So we cannot put Y at 5? So we have Y at 4? Then position 5: let's call it Z.

Then the word would be: A _ L Y _ 

For position 2, we need a letter that is not S,T,E,D,I, and must be new? And position 5: same.

But also, we have constraints: we cannot put L at 4? Wait, no: L is at 3, so that's okay? Y at 4: okay.

But wait: the word cannot have A at 3? But we have L at 3? So that's fine? 

But also, we are using Y at position 4? 

And A at position 1? 

So positions: 
  Pos1: A? and we know A cannot be at position 2 or 3? But we are putting at 1? Is it allowed? We haven't tested? Yes.

So we have A at 1? 

In the second guess, ""daily"", we had A at position 2? And it was marked as '-', meaning present but not at 2? So that doesn't tell us about position 1? 

Similarly, in the first guess? A was at position 3? and '-', so wrong? 

So A has not been at position 1? So we can try.

Another option: put A at 5? 

But let me list possible words:

Word structure: A _ L Y _ 
  We need two more letters: the blanks.

But we have constraints: 
  We cannot use S,T,E,D,I for the blanks? 

Let me think: starting with A: words starting with A with L at position 3? and Y at position 4? 

For example: ""AMPLY"": 
  A, M, P, L, Y -> 
  Positions: 
    1: A? 
    2: M? 
    3: L? 
    4: Y? 
    5: Y? No: AMPLY is A, M, P, L, Y? Actually, AMPLY? 
    A M P L Y? 
      Pos1: A
      Pos2: M
      Pos3: P? That's position 3? But we are trying to put L at position 3? Oh, I see: if the word is AMPLY, then L is at position 4? 

But I have L at position 3? 

What I have: A _ L Y _

So for example, position 1: A, position 3: L, position 4: Y? 

Then what words? At position 2, we have a letter? and position 5: a letter? 

We need a word: A _ L Y _

Some possibilities:

  With _ at 2: try letters? 

  Consider common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, etc.

But not including S,T,E,D,I.

Word: ""AULY_"" ? Not common.

How about: ""ALTER"" -> but T is absent? 

Another? ""AGLY?"" That's not 5 letters? 

We could try ""ALLY_"" but then L at position 3? And Y at 4? Then position 5? But ALLY with Y at position 4? But then we have the word ""ALLY"" is only 4 letters? 

Ah, we need 5 letters? 

So maybe: ""ALLEY"" -> but L repeated? And E absent? 

Wait, let me think? 

Perhaps ""A _ L Y _"" is not common? 

Alternative plan: Put L at position 3 and Y at position 2? But Y can be at 2? 

But then we need A? 

For example: put A at 4? So positions: 
  Pos4: A? allowed? 
  Pos2: Y? allowed? 

Then word: _ Y L A _

We haven't assigned the first position? 

Try words? ""CYLAR""? Not valid? 

Another: why don't we list possible assignments.

We know:
  A must be at 1,4,5
  L must be at 1,3,5
  Y must be at 1,2,3,4

But we cannot assign same position? 

Assign A at 1?
  Then L can be at 3 or 5? 
  Y must be at 2,3,4? 

But if L is at 3? Then Y can be at 2 or 4? 
  If Y at 2: word: A Y L _ _
  If Y at 4: word: A _ L Y _

But we need to fill the blanks? 

Assign A at 5?
  Then L must be at 1,3? (cannot be at 5 because A is there? unless same letter? but A and L are different? But both are present? So they can coexist? 
  But if A at 5, then L cannot be at 5? So L can be at 1 or 3? 
  Y at? 

Similarly? 

But let me try to find actual words.

Starting with A Y L: ""AYLUM"" -> but U, M? and M? Also? But is “Aylum” a word? No? 

Common words: ""ALLY"" is short? 

Word: ""ALKY"" only 4? 

With A at 1, L at 5? And Y at 4? Then word: A _ _ Y L? 
Example: ""AOKYL"" not word.

Another idea: put Y at position 2? And A at 4? Then L at 3? So positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: Y
  3: L
  4: A
  5: ? 

Which words: ... Then: _ Y L A _

Examples: ""GYLAD"" not word? 

Try a different assignment.

Put L at position 1? 

L can be at 1? 

So if L at 1: 
  Then A can be at 4 or 5? 
  Y at 2,3,4? 

But if A at 4: then word: L _ _ A _ 
  And Y can be at 2 or 3? 

Example: L at 1, Y at 2: ""L Y _ A _"" -> ""LYMFA"" not common? 

Or L at 1, Y at 3: ""L _ Y A _"" -> ""LARVA"" but R and V? And R? But A at position 4? And L at1, Y at3? 

But ""LARYA"" not word? 

What about: ""LOAMY"" -> L O A M Y? But O, M? 
  Positions: L at1, O at2, A at3? But A cannot be at position 3! Because from slate: A is at 3 and it was '-', so not at 3? 

So if we put A at 3, we know it should be '-', so not efficient? 

But we cannot avoid? Unless we put A at allowed places? 

Therefore, avoid A at 3? 

In ""LOAMY"": 
  L at1? 
  O at2? 
  A at3? -> but A cannot be at3? So if we guess ""LOAMY"", we must get A at3 marked as '-', but we already know it's '-'. So we learn nothing new about A? 

But we don't know? Unless we want to verify? Or we want to avoid known incorrect? 

So for efficiency, we should put A at positions we haven't tried: 1,4,5? 

Similarly, L at positions we haven't tried: 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4)? 

And Y at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

Back to L at 1: then A at4? Y at2? Example: ""LOAMY"" has A at3? Avoid.

Another: ""LUMAR""? But U, M? And Y not present? 

Perhaps ""LAYUP"": 
  L A Y U P -> 
  Positions: 
    L:1 (which is allowed? We haven't tried? But L cannot be at 2 or 4? So 1 is okay? 
    A:2? but A cannot be at2? Because in ""daily"", A was at2? and we got '-', so wrong position? So we cannot put A at2? 
    And A at2? will be '-', so waste? 

But we put A at2? Anyway? 

""LAYUP"": L at1, A at2? But A cannot be at position2? So we'll get no new information about A? 

So avoid? 

Therefore, we must avoid position2 for A and position4 for L? And position3 for A? And position2 for L? 

So let me list allowed positions again:
A: 1,4,5
L: 1,3,5
Y: 1,2,3,4

We want to try to put them in new positions? 

So possible assignments without conflict and new? 

Option 1: 
  A at1? -> then L cannot be at1? So L can be at3 or5? 
    If L at3: then Y can be at2 or4? 
      If Y at2: word A Y L _ ?: positions 1A,2Y,3L,4?,5? 
      If Y at4: word A _ L Y _: positions 1A,2?,3L,4Y,5?
    If L at5: then Y at2,3,4? 
      If Y at2: word A Y _ _ L
      etc.

Similarly, for L at position 1: must then A and Y not at1? So A at4 or5? Y at2,3,4? 
  If A at4: word L _ _ A _ -> which is: L, ?, ?, A, ?
      And Y could be at2 or3? etc.

Given the complexity, let's look for common words that include A,L,Y and avoid forbidden letters.

Specifically: what words contain A,L,Y and no S,T,E,D,I?

For example:
  ""GAYAL"" -> G,A,Y,A,L? 
      Letters: G, A, Y, A, L -> double A? 
      Positions: 
        1:G, 2:A, 3:Y, 4:A, 5:L? 
      But A at positions2 and4? 
      For A: we know A cannot be at2? So we would get A at2 as '-', but it is wrong? Yet we have A at4? 

This guess would be checking what?

  Let's see the feedback: if the secret word has A at1 or4 or5? and we put A at2 and4? Then the A at2 would be '-', and A at4 would be either 'x' or '-'? Or ✓? 

But we don't know? 

But note: the word as ""GAYAL"" has A at2 and at4? But secret word has only one A? Or two? We don't know? 

It might work? But let me check position constraints:

  For A: cannot be at2? In this guess and we have it at2? So expected '-' for that? And we at4 ? 

  But if in the secret word, A is at4? Then it might be ✓ for that? Wait, no? The letter I put at4 is A? So if secret has A at4, then ✓. Otherwise, ?

  Since A is present, and we have two As? but they might be evaluated independently? 

  But then, we have L at5? And we know L cannot be at4? But here it's at5? So if secret has L at5? Then ✓? 

  However, we haven't tested L at5? 

So overall, we would get:

  G: unknown? 
  A at2: '-' (since we know A cannot be at2? So always '-')? 
  Y at3: unknown? 
  A at4: depends? 
  L at5: depends? 

And G and Y are new? 

But this uses double A? And we don't know if A is repeated? It might be.

Now, but is ""GAYAL"" a word? Yes? 

Another common words: ""GAYLY"" -> 'GAYLY' has letters: G, A, Y, L, Y? 
  Double Y? 
  Positions:1G,2A,3Y,4L,5Y? 
  For L: cannot be at4? So if we put L at4? It should be '-', but we know L cannot be at4? 
  And A at2: no? 

Then Y at3 and at5? But Y cannot be at5? We cannot put Y at5? So avoid.

Another: ""RALLY"" -> R,A,L,L,Y? 
  Letters: R, A, L, L, Y? 
  But D is absent? R is new? 
  But positions: 
    1: R
    2: A? cannot (A cannot be at2? and if we put it? get '-')
    3: L? yes? (we can put L at3? allowed? because haven't tried? Only tried position 2 and 4? So position3 is new? 
    4: L? but L might be repeated? 
    5: Y? cannot? Y cannot be at5? 

So position2: A -> '-'
Position5: Y -> expected '-'? because we know Y not at5? 
So no? 

Another possibility: ""Y"" at position 1? 

Example: Y at1? 
Then Y at1 is allowed? 
So: Y _ _ _ _ 

Then A and L? 

For instance: ""YHALM""? Not valid.

Or ""YARAM""? Not common.

Perhaps: ""YAULK""? Not valid.

What about: ""POLARY""? Too long? 

We need 5 letters? 

Another common word: ""GHAUL"" -> G, H, A, U, L? 
  But where is Y? We need Y? 

We must include Y? 

Because Y is present? 

So all guesses must include all known present letters? 

Otherwise we can't win? 

So the guess must have A, L, Y.

But: from above, ""GAYAL"" is one option? 

But is it common enough? 

Alternatively: ""CALYX"" -> C, A, L, Y, X? 
  Letters: C, A, L, Y, X? 
  No S,T,E,D,I. 
  Positions: 
    1: C
    2: A? cannot A at2? so would be '-', 
    3: L? which is allowed? (L not at2 or4? so 3 is new? 
    4: Y
    5: X

Now:
  A is at2 -> known wrong position? so will be marked '-'? 
  L is at3 -> new, may be correct? 
  Y is at4 -> new position? (previously at5 in daily? and in daily it was at5? and we got '-' because not at5? now at4? may be correct? may be not? 

And C and X are new? 

Similarly, this word: ""CALYX"" is a botanical term? But valid? 

Also, this tests L at3 and Y at4? which are possible positions? 

Another word: ""MALAY"" -> M, A, L, A, Y? 
  Positions:1M,2A,3L,4A,5Y? 
  A at2: '-', A at4: ?, L at3: ?, Y at5: not allowed? 

Y at5: but we know Y not at5? So avoid this? Because Y at5 will be '-' and we know that? 

Therefore, ""CALYX"" is acceptable? 

Then there is ""ALAYA"" not common? 

Or ""LAGAN"" -> but no Y? 

So between ""GAYAL"" and ""CALYX"", which is better? 

Both have distinct new letters: G vs C and X? 

Both test positions we haven't tried? 

But ""GAYAL"" has a repeated A? So if A is present only once, we might not learn correctly? 

Whereas ""CALYX"" has distinct letters? 

Therefore, I think ""CALYX"" is better? 

Or another: ""FLAWY"" -> F, L, A, W, Y? 
  Positions:
    1: F
    2: L? but L cannot be at 2? So position2 would be marked '-'? But we know L is not at2? So wasted? 
    3: A? also cannot? A not at3? 
    4: W
    5: Y? not allowed? 

So no? 

Another: ""DAYL- but already tried? 

Let me think of ""OAKUM"" -> no Y? 

Perhaps ""YULAN"" -> letters: Y, U, L, A, N? 
  Positions: 
    1: Y -> allowed? 
    2: U -> new? 
    3: L -> allowed? 
    4: A -> A can be at4? 
    5: N -> new? 
  And no S,T,E,D,I. 

This is good? 
  Y at1: not tried before? 
  U at2: new? 
  L at3: new position? 
  A at4: new position? 
  N at5: new? 

Also, no repeated letters? 

And it uses only one of each known present letter? 

So ""YULAN"" is also a word? 

It means a tree? 

Is it valid? 

Another: ""NYALA"" -> N, Y, A, L, A? 
  Positions: 
    1: N? 
    2: Y? 
    3: A? but A not at3? 
    4: L? not at4? 
    5: A? 

But A at3 and at5? At3: cannot? and at5: may be? 

So not efficient? 

Therefore, let's consider ""YULAN"" or ""CALYX"" or ""GAYAL""?

""YULAN"": Y at1, L at3, A at4 -> all new positions? 

Similarly, ""CALYX"": C at1, A at2 (not new), L at3, Y at4, X at5? 

With ""YULAN"", we test each of the known letters at different positions than before? 

Y at position1? (previously at5? so not5? and now1? 
L at3? (previously at2 and4? so not tested at3? 
A at4? (previously at3 and2? ) 

So ""YULAN"" might be better because it tests three new positions for the three present letters? 

Similarly, in ""CALYX"", A is at2? which we already know is wrong? so it's '-' and we get no new information? We already know A is not at2? 

Whereas in ""YULAN"", none of the positions are known to be wrong? 

So better to choose ""YULAN""! 

Also, ""YULAN"" introduces U and N? new letters? 

So next guess: ""YULAN""

<thinking>
Current Feedback:
- S,T,E,D,I are absent
- A,L,Y are present but with position constraints:
  - A ≠ pos2, pos3 → possible: 1,4,5
  - L ≠ pos2, pos4 → possible: 1,3,5
  - Y ≠ pos5 → possible: 1,2,3,4

""yulan"" strategy:
- Places Y at pos1 (new position)
- L at pos3 (new position, previously untested)
- A at pos4 (new position)
- Uses U (new) and N (new)
- Maximizes new position tests for present letters
</thinking>

<guess>yulan</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights:
- **Absent Letters**: S, T, E, D, I (eliminated from future guesses)
- **Present Letters**: A, L, Y (must be included)
- **Position Constraints**:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).  
  - L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
  - Y cannot be in position 5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
1. **Include A, L, Y** in unprobed positions:
   - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5 (untried: position 4)  
   - L: Positions 1, 3, or 5 (untried: position 3)  
   - Y: Positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (untried: position 1)  
2. **Introduce new letters** to test: U and N (common consonants).  
3. **Avoid redundant placements** (e.g., A in position 2 or L in position 4).  

Chose **""YULAN""** (a valid English word):  
- Y at position 1 (tests new position for Y)  
- U (new letter) at position 2  
- L at position 3 (tests new position)  
- A at position 4 (tests new position)  
- N (new letter) at position 5  

<guess>yulan</guess>",yulan,"We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""slate""):
  S: x (absent)
  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2)
  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: x (absent)

From Guess 2 (""daily""):
  D: x (absent)
  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2 in this guess)
  I: x (absent)
  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 4 in this guess)
  Y: - (present but wrong position; originally position 5)

What we know:

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I (so letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, I)

Present letters: A, L, Y (each must appear at least once, with constraints on positions)

Constraints on positions:
- A is present but not in position 2 (from ""daily"") and not in position 3 (from ""slate"")
- L is present but not in position 2 (from ""slate"") and not in position 4 (from ""daily"")
- Y is present but not in position 5 (from ""daily"")

Also, note that the positions where A, L, Y cannot be:
- A cannot be at position 2 or 3
- L cannot be at position 2 or 4
- Y cannot be at position 5

Therefore, possible positions:
- A: can be at 1, 4, 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out)
- L: can be at 1, 3, 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out)
- Y: can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (since position 5 is ruled out)

Additionally, since these letters are present, we also must include them in the next guess.

We have two more known present letters: A, L, Y. And we know that the word does not contain S, T, E, D, I.

We have 6 letters known absent: S, T, E, D, I.

We have 3 known present letters: A, L, Y.

Since we have only 3 known present letters and the word is 5 letters, there must be two more letters that we don't know yet. So we need to introduce two new letters.

Our next guess should:
- Include A, L, Y in positions that are allowed (according to the constraints above)
- Exclude S, T, E, D, I
- Include two new letters to test for presence.

We should also consider common English letters.

Possible positions:

We need to assign A, L, Y to positions 1,3,5? But note we also have positions 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- A can be at 1,4,5
- L can be at 1,3,5
- Y can be at 1,2,3,4

But note: it's possible to have the same letter? Actually, no duplicates known yet? But note: we don't have information that forbids duplicates? So we cannot assume.

But so far the known letters are distinct: A, L, Y.

We also have to avoid positions:
- A: avoid 2,3
- L: avoid 2,4
- Y: avoid 5

Now, we need to assign them to the word.

We also have to introduce two new letters.

Let me try to assign the positions:

Option 1: 
  Position 1: A (since A can be at 1)
  Position 2: ? (must be a new letter? and cannot be one of the already absent)
  Position 3: L (since L can be at 3; and A is not at 3? Wait, but A is at 1, so we can have L at 3)
  Position 4: Y (Y can be at 4? But note: L cannot be at position 4? But Y can be at 4? Yes)
  Position 5: ? (must be a new letter? But wait, position 5: we haven't assigned any? But if we put A at 1, L at 3, Y at 4, then position 2 and 5 are free.)

But note: we also need to avoid putting Y at 5? So position 5 must be something else? So we cannot put Y at 5? So we have Y at 4? Then position 5: let's call it Z.

Then the word would be: A _ L Y _ 

For position 2, we need a letter that is not S,T,E,D,I, and must be new? And position 5: same.

But also, we have constraints: we cannot put L at 4? Wait, no: L is at 3, so that's okay? Y at 4: okay.

But wait: the word cannot have A at 3? But we have L at 3? So that's fine? 

But also, we are using Y at position 4? 

And A at position 1? 

So positions: 
  Pos1: A? and we know A cannot be at position 2 or 3? But we are putting at 1? Is it allowed? We haven't tested? Yes.

So we have A at 1? 

In the second guess, ""daily"", we had A at position 2? And it was marked as '-', meaning present but not at 2? So that doesn't tell us about position 1? 

Similarly, in the first guess? A was at position 3? and '-', so wrong? 

So A has not been at position 1? So we can try.

Another option: put A at 5? 

But let me list possible words:

Word structure: A _ L Y _ 
  We need two more letters: the blanks.

But we have constraints: 
  We cannot use S,T,E,D,I for the blanks? 

Let me think: starting with A: words starting with A with L at position 3? and Y at position 4? 

For example: ""AMPLY"": 
  A, M, P, L, Y -> 
  Positions: 
    1: A? 
    2: M? 
    3: L? 
    4: Y? 
    5: Y? No: AMPLY is A, M, P, L, Y? Actually, AMPLY? 
    A M P L Y? 
      Pos1: A
      Pos2: M
      Pos3: P? That's position 3? But we are trying to put L at position 3? Oh, I see: if the word is AMPLY, then L is at position 4? 

But I have L at position 3? 

What I have: A _ L Y _

So for example, position 1: A, position 3: L, position 4: Y? 

Then what words? At position 2, we have a letter? and position 5: a letter? 

We need a word: A _ L Y _

Some possibilities:

  With _ at 2: try letters? 

  Consider common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, etc.

But not including S,T,E,D,I.

Word: ""AULY_"" ? Not common.

How about: ""ALTER"" -> but T is absent? 

Another? ""AGLY?"" That's not 5 letters? 

We could try ""ALLY_"" but then L at position 3? And Y at 4? Then position 5? But ALLY with Y at position 4? But then we have the word ""ALLY"" is only 4 letters? 

Ah, we need 5 letters? 

So maybe: ""ALLEY"" -> but L repeated? And E absent? 

Wait, let me think? 

Perhaps ""A _ L Y _"" is not common? 

Alternative plan: Put L at position 3 and Y at position 2? But Y can be at 2? 

But then we need A? 

For example: put A at 4? So positions: 
  Pos4: A? allowed? 
  Pos2: Y? allowed? 

Then word: _ Y L A _

We haven't assigned the first position? 

Try words? ""CYLAR""? Not valid? 

Another: why don't we list possible assignments.

We know:
  A must be at 1,4,5
  L must be at 1,3,5
  Y must be at 1,2,3,4

But we cannot assign same position? 

Assign A at 1?
  Then L can be at 3 or 5? 
  Y must be at 2,3,4? 

But if L is at 3? Then Y can be at 2 or 4? 
  If Y at 2: word: A Y L _ _
  If Y at 4: word: A _ L Y _

But we need to fill the blanks? 

Assign A at 5?
  Then L must be at 1,3? (cannot be at 5 because A is there? unless same letter? but A and L are different? But both are present? So they can coexist? 
  But if A at 5, then L cannot be at 5? So L can be at 1 or 3? 
  Y at? 

Similarly? 

But let me try to find actual words.

Starting with A Y L: ""AYLUM"" -> but U, M? and M? Also? But is “Aylum” a word? No? 

Common words: ""ALLY"" is short? 

Word: ""ALKY"" only 4? 

With A at 1, L at 5? And Y at 4? Then word: A _ _ Y L? 
Example: ""AOKYL"" not word.

Another idea: put Y at position 2? And A at 4? Then L at 3? So positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: Y
  3: L
  4: A
  5: ? 

Which words: ... Then: _ Y L A _

Examples: ""GYLAD"" not word? 

Try a different assignment.

Put L at position 1? 

L can be at 1? 

So if L at 1: 
  Then A can be at 4 or 5? 
  Y at 2,3,4? 

But if A at 4: then word: L _ _ A _ 
  And Y can be at 2 or 3? 

Example: L at 1, Y at 2: ""L Y _ A _"" -> ""LYMFA"" not common? 

Or L at 1, Y at 3: ""L _ Y A _"" -> ""LARVA"" but R and V? And R? But A at position 4? And L at1, Y at3? 

But ""LARYA"" not word? 

What about: ""LOAMY"" -> L O A M Y? But O, M? 
  Positions: L at1, O at2, A at3? But A cannot be at position 3! Because from slate: A is at 3 and it was '-', so not at 3? 

So if we put A at 3, we know it should be '-', so not efficient? 

But we cannot avoid? Unless we put A at allowed places? 

Therefore, avoid A at 3? 

In ""LOAMY"": 
  L at1? 
  O at2? 
  A at3? -> but A cannot be at3? So if we guess ""LOAMY"", we must get A at3 marked as '-', but we already know it's '-'. So we learn nothing new about A? 

But we don't know? Unless we want to verify? Or we want to avoid known incorrect? 

So for efficiency, we should put A at positions we haven't tried: 1,4,5? 

Similarly, L at positions we haven't tried: 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4)? 

And Y at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

Back to L at 1: then A at4? Y at2? Example: ""LOAMY"" has A at3? Avoid.

Another: ""LUMAR""? But U, M? And Y not present? 

Perhaps ""LAYUP"": 
  L A Y U P -> 
  Positions: 
    L:1 (which is allowed? We haven't tried? But L cannot be at 2 or 4? So 1 is okay? 
    A:2? but A cannot be at2? Because in ""daily"", A was at2? and we got '-', so wrong position? So we cannot put A at2? 
    And A at2? will be '-', so waste? 

But we put A at2? Anyway? 

""LAYUP"": L at1, A at2? But A cannot be at position2? So we'll get no new information about A? 

So avoid? 

Therefore, we must avoid position2 for A and position4 for L? And position3 for A? And position2 for L? 

So let me list allowed positions again:
A: 1,4,5
L: 1,3,5
Y: 1,2,3,4

We want to try to put them in new positions? 

So possible assignments without conflict and new? 

Option 1: 
  A at1? -> then L cannot be at1? So L can be at3 or5? 
    If L at3: then Y can be at2 or4? 
      If Y at2: word A Y L _ ?: positions 1A,2Y,3L,4?,5? 
      If Y at4: word A _ L Y _: positions 1A,2?,3L,4Y,5?
    If L at5: then Y at2,3,4? 
      If Y at2: word A Y _ _ L
      etc.

Similarly, for L at position 1: must then A and Y not at1? So A at4 or5? Y at2,3,4? 
  If A at4: word L _ _ A _ -> which is: L, ?, ?, A, ?
      And Y could be at2 or3? etc.

Given the complexity, let's look for common words that include A,L,Y and avoid forbidden letters.

Specifically: what words contain A,L,Y and no S,T,E,D,I?

For example:
  ""GAYAL"" -> G,A,Y,A,L? 
      Letters: G, A, Y, A, L -> double A? 
      Positions: 
        1:G, 2:A, 3:Y, 4:A, 5:L? 
      But A at positions2 and4? 
      For A: we know A cannot be at2? So we would get A at2 as '-', but it is wrong? Yet we have A at4? 

This guess would be checking what?

  Let's see the feedback: if the secret word has A at1 or4 or5? and we put A at2 and4? Then the A at2 would be '-', and A at4 would be either 'x' or '-'? Or ✓? 

But we don't know? 

But note: the word as ""GAYAL"" has A at2 and at4? But secret word has only one A? Or two? We don't know? 

It might work? But let me check position constraints:

  For A: cannot be at2? In this guess and we have it at2? So expected '-' for that? And we at4 ? 

  But if in the secret word, A is at4? Then it might be ✓ for that? Wait, no? The letter I put at4 is A? So if secret has A at4, then ✓. Otherwise, ?

  Since A is present, and we have two As? but they might be evaluated independently? 

  But then, we have L at5? And we know L cannot be at4? But here it's at5? So if secret has L at5? Then ✓? 

  However, we haven't tested L at5? 

So overall, we would get:

  G: unknown? 
  A at2: '-' (since we know A cannot be at2? So always '-')? 
  Y at3: unknown? 
  A at4: depends? 
  L at5: depends? 

And G and Y are new? 

But this uses double A? And we don't know if A is repeated? It might be.

Now, but is ""GAYAL"" a word? Yes? 

Another common words: ""GAYLY"" -> 'GAYLY' has letters: G, A, Y, L, Y? 
  Double Y? 
  Positions:1G,2A,3Y,4L,5Y? 
  For L: cannot be at4? So if we put L at4? It should be '-', but we know L cannot be at4? 
  And A at2: no? 

Then Y at3 and at5? But Y cannot be at5? We cannot put Y at5? So avoid.

Another: ""RALLY"" -> R,A,L,L,Y? 
  Letters: R, A, L, L, Y? 
  But D is absent? R is new? 
  But positions: 
    1: R
    2: A? cannot (A cannot be at2? and if we put it? get '-')
    3: L? yes? (we can put L at3? allowed? because haven't tried? Only tried position 2 and 4? So position3 is new? 
    4: L? but L might be repeated? 
    5: Y? cannot? Y cannot be at5? 

So position2: A -> '-'
Position5: Y -> expected '-'? because we know Y not at5? 
So no? 

Another possibility: ""Y"" at position 1? 

Example: Y at1? 
Then Y at1 is allowed? 
So: Y _ _ _ _ 

Then A and L? 

For instance: ""YHALM""? Not valid.

Or ""YARAM""? Not common.

Perhaps: ""YAULK""? Not valid.

What about: ""POLARY""? Too long? 

We need 5 letters? 

Another common word: ""GHAUL"" -> G, H, A, U, L? 
  But where is Y? We need Y? 

We must include Y? 

Because Y is present? 

So all guesses must include all known present letters? 

Otherwise we can't win? 

So the guess must have A, L, Y.

But: from above, ""GAYAL"" is one option? 

But is it common enough? 

Alternatively: ""CALYX"" -> C, A, L, Y, X? 
  Letters: C, A, L, Y, X? 
  No S,T,E,D,I. 
  Positions: 
    1: C
    2: A? cannot A at2? so would be '-', 
    3: L? which is allowed? (L not at2 or4? so 3 is new? 
    4: Y
    5: X

Now:
  A is at2 -> known wrong position? so will be marked '-'? 
  L is at3 -> new, may be correct? 
  Y is at4 -> new position? (previously at5 in daily? and in daily it was at5? and we got '-' because not at5? now at4? may be correct? may be not? 

And C and X are new? 

Similarly, this word: ""CALYX"" is a botanical term? But valid? 

Also, this tests L at3 and Y at4? which are possible positions? 

Another word: ""MALAY"" -> M, A, L, A, Y? 
  Positions:1M,2A,3L,4A,5Y? 
  A at2: '-', A at4: ?, L at3: ?, Y at5: not allowed? 

Y at5: but we know Y not at5? So avoid this? Because Y at5 will be '-' and we know that? 

Therefore, ""CALYX"" is acceptable? 

Then there is ""ALAYA"" not common? 

Or ""LAGAN"" -> but no Y? 

So between ""GAYAL"" and ""CALYX"", which is better? 

Both have distinct new letters: G vs C and X? 

Both test positions we haven't tried? 

But ""GAYAL"" has a repeated A? So if A is present only once, we might not learn correctly? 

Whereas ""CALYX"" has distinct letters? 

Therefore, I think ""CALYX"" is better? 

Or another: ""FLAWY"" -> F, L, A, W, Y? 
  Positions:
    1: F
    2: L? but L cannot be at 2? So position2 would be marked '-'? But we know L is not at2? So wasted? 
    3: A? also cannot? A not at3? 
    4: W
    5: Y? not allowed? 

So no? 

Another: ""DAYL- but already tried? 

Let me think of ""OAKUM"" -> no Y? 

Perhaps ""YULAN"" -> letters: Y, U, L, A, N? 
  Positions: 
    1: Y -> allowed? 
    2: U -> new? 
    3: L -> allowed? 
    4: A -> A can be at4? 
    5: N -> new? 
  And no S,T,E,D,I. 

This is good? 
  Y at1: not tried before? 
  U at2: new? 
  L at3: new position? 
  A at4: new position? 
  N at5: new? 

Also, no repeated letters? 

And it uses only one of each known present letter? 

So ""YULAN"" is also a word? 

It means a tree? 

Is it valid? 

Another: ""NYALA"" -> N, Y, A, L, A? 
  Positions: 
    1: N? 
    2: Y? 
    3: A? but A not at3? 
    4: L? not at4? 
    5: A? 

But A at3 and at5? At3: cannot? and at5: may be? 

So not efficient? 

Therefore, let's consider ""YULAN"" or ""CALYX"" or ""GAYAL""?

""YULAN"": Y at1, L at3, A at4 -> all new positions? 

Similarly, ""CALYX"": C at1, A at2 (not new), L at3, Y at4, X at5? 

With ""YULAN"", we test each of the known letters at different positions than before? 

Y at position1? (previously at5? so not5? and now1? 
L at3? (previously at2 and4? so not tested at3? 
A at4? (previously at3 and2? ) 

So ""YULAN"" might be better because it tests three new positions for the three present letters? 

Similarly, in ""CALYX"", A is at2? which we already know is wrong? so it's '-' and we get no new information? We already know A is not at2? 

Whereas in ""YULAN"", none of the positions are known to be wrong? 

So better to choose ""YULAN""! 

Also, ""YULAN"" introduces U and N? new letters? 

So next guess: ""YULAN""

Current Feedback:
- S,T,E,D,I are absent
- A,L,Y are present but with position constraints:
  - A ≠ pos2, pos3 → possible: 1,4,5
  - L ≠ pos2, pos4 → possible: 1,3,5
  - Y ≠ pos5 → possible: 1,2,3,4

""yulan"" strategy:
- Places Y at pos1 (new position)
- L at pos3 (new position, previously untested)
- A at pos4 (new position)
- Uses U (new) and N (new)
- Maximizes new position tests for present letters

<guess>yulan</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights:
- **Absent Letters**: S, T, E, D, I (eliminated from future guesses)
- **Present Letters**: A, L, Y (must be included)
- **Position Constraints**:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).  
  - L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
  - Y cannot be in position 5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
1. **Include A, L, Y** in unprobed positions:
   - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5 (untried: position 4)  
   - L: Positions 1, 3, or 5 (untried: position 3)  
   - Y: Positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (untried: position 1)  
2. **Introduce new letters** to test: U and N (common consonants).  
3. **Avoid redundant placements** (e.g., A in position 2 or L in position 4).  

Chose **""YULAN""** (a valid English word):  
- Y at position 1 (tests new position for Y)  
- U (new letter) at position 2  
- L at position 3 (tests new position)  
- A at position 4 (tests new position)  
- N (new letter) at position 5",Guess 3: yulan -> FEEDBACK: Y(-) U(x) L(-) A(✓) N(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We haven't received any feedback yet since this is the first guess. Therefore, we need to choose a good starting word.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible and to get maximum information.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are those with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""ADIEU"" are often used.

 Let's choose a word that:
   - Has 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage.
   - Includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

 One such word is ""ROAST"". It contains:
   - R, O, A, S, T: which are all common letters.
   - It has two vowels (O and A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but might leave out common consonants.

 Another consideration: the word should avoid repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Since we have to pick one, let's go with ""ROAST"".

 Therefore, our first guess is ""ROAST"".<thinking>
For the first guess in a Wordle-like game, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word:
- Contains common vowels and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Uses letters that frequently appear in English words

After analyzing common Wordle strategies, words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"" are strong openers. I'll select ""SLATE"" because:
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- All letters are distinct, providing broader coverage
- S/T are among the most frequent consonants, A/E are common vowels
- Positions test common patterns (S-start, E-end)

This choice gives high probability for useful feedback regardless of the secret word.
</thinking>

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  L: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.
  - The word DOES contain L and A, but not in the positions they were guessed.

 Specifically:
  - L is not the second letter (since it was guessed in the second position and marked as wrong position).
  - A is not the third letter (since it was guessed in the third position and marked as wrong position).

 Also, since S, T, and E are absent, we can eliminate any words containing these letters.

 We have 5 more tries (now second guess).

 Now, our goal is to make a guess that:
  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
  - Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
  - Does not contain S, T, E.

 We should try to include other common letters to probe for more information.

 Since L and A are present, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think about where to put L and A.

 Possible positions for L: 
  - Cannot be position 2. So it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
  - Cannot be position 3. So it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (S, T, E).

 What are common letters that we haven't tried yet? 
  Let's consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

 We might also consider using a word that has L and A and three new letters to get more information.

 Let's try to form a word that includes L and A, plus three new consonants or vowels.

 Examples:

  We can try putting L in position 1 and A in position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, we have to avoid A in position 3 and L in position 2.

  Word candidate: ""BLACK"" -> but we cannot use S, T, E and here we have B, L, A, C, K. 
    But note: we have to check if it has S, T, E? It doesn't. Also, position of L is 2? No, in ""BLACK"":
      L is in position 2 -> but feedback told us L cannot be in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback was that L is not in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, we know that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in our new guess, we can put L in any position except we know it's not position 2? However, note: we are allowed to put L in position 2 again? But it would be marked as wrong position again? And we already know that's not the case. So to avoid wasting a letter, we should put L in a new position.

  Actually, we are allowed to put the same letter in the same position again? But it wouldn't be efficient because we know it's wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for L and position 3 for A.

  Let's avoid using L in position 2 and A in position 3.

  So ""BLACK"": 
      B at position 1
      L at position 2 -> but we know L is not in position 2 in the secret word, so this placement won't help us test L? Actually, if we put L in position 2, we would get a '-' again, but we already know that L is not in position 2. So it's better to put L in a different position to learn if it is elsewhere.

  Therefore, we should avoid position 2 for L.

  Alternative: put L in position 1? Then we have words starting with L.

  How about: ""LABOR"" -> but contains O and we don't know if O is present? Also, R? 
      But note: we don't know if O or R is in the word. However, we also have to avoid placing A in position 3? In ""LABOR"":
        L at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
        But we are placing A at position 2? That's allowed because earlier A was at 3 and now we are trying 2? And we haven't tested position 2 for A.

  However, we know that L must be somewhere else (not position 2) so putting L at 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at 2 is a new position.

  But the word must not contain S, T, E. ""LABOR"" doesn't have these.

  But wait: we have two letters we know are in the word: L and A. And we are introducing B, O, R. That might be okay.

  However, let's check the feedback rules: we want to get information about the positions of L and A, and also about the new letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and L in positions that we haven't tried and are possible.

  Since L can be in 1,3,4,5 and A can be in 1,2,4,5, let's try:

  Option: A at position 1 and L at position 4? Example: ""APPLE"" but E is not allowed.

  Without E: How about ""AUDIO"" -> but no L and we need L. 

  We must include both L and A.

  Let me try with L in position 1 and A in position 4? Example: ""LARVA"" -> but V? Also, we have double A? And we don't know if R and V are present.

  How about: ""CLAIM"" -> but C, L, A, I, M. 
    Positions: 
      1: C
      2: L -> but we know L is not at position 2? Then we are putting L at position 2? That's the same as before? And we will get a '-' again? So it doesn't help.

  So we avoid putting L at position 2.

  How about putting L at position 4 and A at position 1? Example: ""ALARM"" -> contains A and L? 
      A at 1, L at 2 -> again L at 2? We shouldn't.

  How about ""MANLY"": 
      M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
      A is at 2 -> which we haven't tried? and L is at 4 -> new position.

  Also, no S, T, E.

  This word uses two known letters (A and L) and introduces M, N, Y.

  We can also consider: ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N -> 
      L at position 2 again? Avoid.

  So ""MANLY"": 
      Letters are M, A, N, L, Y -> positions: 
        A at 2 (we haven't tried A at 2? Previously A was at 3 -> now we try 2) 
        L at 4 (previously at 2 -> now at 4)

  But note: in the secret word, L is not at position 2? That doesn't mean it can't be at 4? So we can test.

  Alternatively: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> 
      A at position 2? 
      L at position 3? 
      We haven't tried A at 2? or L at 3? 

  However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? In this word, A is at 2 and L at 3 -> that positions are allowed.

  But note: we don't know if A is allowed at 2? We only know it's not at 3? Similarly, L not at 2? So we can have L at 3? 

  Let me list the constraints:
    For L: not at position 2 -> so it can be 1,3,4,5.
    For A: not at position 3 -> so it can be 1,2,4,5? 

  So both A at 2 and L at 3 are possible? 

  So ""VALID"" is a candidate.

  Other candidate: ""RADAR"" -> has two A's? But we don't know if A is repeated? Also, has R and D? And we don't know.

  It might be better to avoid duplicate letters at this stage? So we can get information about more letters.

  I'm considering ""VALID"": 
      Letters: V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct and new? 

  We haven't tested V, I, D? 

  But note: we have only 5 letters? 

  How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1
        A at 2
        I at 3? 
        L at 4? 
        Y at 5
      This avoids L at 2 and A at 3? 
      But A at 2? and L at 4? 

  But we don't know if D, I, Y are present? 

  So ""DAILY"" is also a candidate.

  Let me compare:
    Requirements: must include L and A, and exclude S, T, E.

  Both ""DAILY"" and ""VALID"" fit.

  We want to maximize information? Which one uses more common letters? 

  Common letters in English: I is a common vowel? So ""DAILY"" has I. D and V are both common? 

  Or we can choose one that has vowels that we haven't tested? We haven't tested I, O, U? 

  Since we don't have any vowel information except A? And A is in the word? 

  We could also consider:

    ""CHAOS"" -> has S? which we know is absent -> invalid.

    ""QUAIL"" -> Q and U? and I? and L at the end? 
        Positions: Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3? -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we cannot put A at 3? 
        So we have to avoid A at 3? If we put A at 3, then we expect it to be wrong? 

        But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we get '-'. But we already know that A is not at 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' again? But we already know that? So it's wasting a letter? 

        Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid L in position 2? 

  So we need a word that puts A not in position 3? So ""QUAIL"" has A at 3 -> invalid because we are forced to avoid? 

  Therefore, let's choose one that puts A in a different position? 

  Back to ""DAILY"": A at 2? -> allowed? Because we don't know about position 2? 

  How about ""AWAIT"": has A at 1 and A at 4? But also W and I and T? T is absent? So not allowed? T is excluded.

  Let me try: ""OUIJA"" -> has J, and also repeats? Not ideal.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is good: 
      D, A, I, L, Y -> 
      Positions: 
        D at 1 -> new
        A at 2 -> new position for A
        I at 3 -> new
        L at 4 -> new position for L (previously at 2, now at 4)
        Y at 5 -> new

  This tests:
    - A at position 2? 
    - L at position 4? 

  And introduces D, I, Y? 

  But note: we are also covering I? which is a common vowel? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses only consonants? But we have A which is vowel? 

  Another candidate: ""ALIGN"": A at 1? and L at 2? -> L at 2? We must avoid? So invalid.

  Or ""PLAIN"": P, L (at 2 again) -> avoid.

  So ""DAILY"" seems good? 

  But let me check the dictionary? We must ensure it's a valid word.

  Yes, ""daily"" is a common word.

  Another option: ""RALLY"" -> R, A, L, L, Y -> repeated L? And L is at position 3 and 4? But one of them might be correct? However, we don't know if L is repeated? And we have L at position 3? We haven't tried position 3? But also A at 2? 
      And R and Y? 

  However, repeated L might not be ideal? Because if the word has only one L, then we are wasting? 

  So ""DAILY"" is distinct? 

  Also note: ""daily"" has 5 distinct letters? 

  Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"" as the second guess.

  We'll get feedback on each letter? And then proceed? 

  So next guess: ""daily""

  Format: <guess>daily</guess>? 

  But the response must be: <guess>word</guess>? 

  So: <guess>daily</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""slate"":  
- S, T, E are **absent** (marked 'x')  
- L and A are **present** but in wrong positions (L not pos2, A not pos3)  

Goal for next guess:  
- Must include L and A while avoiding positions 2 for L and 3 for A  
- Exclude S, T, E  
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (D, I, Y) to maximize information  

Chose **""daily""**:  
- D (new letter) at position 1  
- A at position 2 (previously untested position for A)  
- I (new vowel) at position 3  
- L at position 4 (new position to test)  
- Y (new letter) at position 5  
- All letters distinct to cover more possibilities  

This tests new positions for L/A while probing common unconfirmed letters.

<guess>daily</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(-) I(x) L(-) Y(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""slate""):
  S: x (absent)
  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2)
  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: x (absent)

From Guess 2 (""daily""):
  D: x (absent)
  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2 in this guess)
  I: x (absent)
  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 4 in this guess)
  Y: - (present but wrong position; originally position 5)

What we know:

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I (so letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, I)

Present letters: A, L, Y (each must appear at least once, with constraints on positions)

Constraints on positions:
- A is present but not in position 2 (from ""daily"") and not in position 3 (from ""slate"")
- L is present but not in position 2 (from ""slate"") and not in position 4 (from ""daily"")
- Y is present but not in position 5 (from ""daily"")

Also, note that the positions where A, L, Y cannot be:
- A cannot be at position 2 or 3
- L cannot be at position 2 or 4
- Y cannot be at position 5

Therefore, possible positions:
- A: can be at 1, 4, 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out)
- L: can be at 1, 3, 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out)
- Y: can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (since position 5 is ruled out)

Additionally, since these letters are present, we also must include them in the next guess.

We have two more known present letters: A, L, Y. And we know that the word does not contain S, T, E, D, I.

We have 6 letters known absent: S, T, E, D, I.

We have 3 known present letters: A, L, Y.

Since we have only 3 known present letters and the word is 5 letters, there must be two more letters that we don't know yet. So we need to introduce two new letters.

Our next guess should:
- Include A, L, Y in positions that are allowed (according to the constraints above)
- Exclude S, T, E, D, I
- Include two new letters to test for presence.

We should also consider common English letters.

Possible positions:

We need to assign A, L, Y to positions 1,3,5? But note we also have positions 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- A can be at 1,4,5
- L can be at 1,3,5
- Y can be at 1,2,3,4

But note: it's possible to have the same letter? Actually, no duplicates known yet? But note: we don't have information that forbids duplicates? So we cannot assume.

But so far the known letters are distinct: A, L, Y.

We also have to avoid positions:
- A: avoid 2,3
- L: avoid 2,4
- Y: avoid 5

Now, we need to assign them to the word.

We also have to introduce two new letters.

Let me try to assign the positions:

Option 1: 
  Position 1: A (since A can be at 1)
  Position 2: ? (must be a new letter? and cannot be one of the already absent)
  Position 3: L (since L can be at 3; and A is not at 3? Wait, but A is at 1, so we can have L at 3)
  Position 4: Y (Y can be at 4? But note: L cannot be at position 4? But Y can be at 4? Yes)
  Position 5: ? (must be a new letter? But wait, position 5: we haven't assigned any? But if we put A at 1, L at 3, Y at 4, then position 2 and 5 are free.)

But note: we also need to avoid putting Y at 5? So position 5 must be something else? So we cannot put Y at 5? So we have Y at 4? Then position 5: let's call it Z.

Then the word would be: A _ L Y _ 

For position 2, we need a letter that is not S,T,E,D,I, and must be new? And position 5: same.

But also, we have constraints: we cannot put L at 4? Wait, no: L is at 3, so that's okay? Y at 4: okay.

But wait: the word cannot have A at 3? But we have L at 3? So that's fine? 

But also, we are using Y at position 4? 

And A at position 1? 

So positions: 
  Pos1: A? and we know A cannot be at position 2 or 3? But we are putting at 1? Is it allowed? We haven't tested? Yes.

So we have A at 1? 

In the second guess, ""daily"", we had A at position 2? And it was marked as '-', meaning present but not at 2? So that doesn't tell us about position 1? 

Similarly, in the first guess? A was at position 3? and '-', so wrong? 

So A has not been at position 1? So we can try.

Another option: put A at 5? 

But let me list possible words:

Word structure: A _ L Y _ 
  We need two more letters: the blanks.

But we have constraints: 
  We cannot use S,T,E,D,I for the blanks? 

Let me think: starting with A: words starting with A with L at position 3? and Y at position 4? 

For example: ""AMPLY"": 
  A, M, P, L, Y -> 
  Positions: 
    1: A? 
    2: M? 
    3: L? 
    4: Y? 
    5: Y? No: AMPLY is A, M, P, L, Y? Actually, AMPLY? 
    A M P L Y? 
      Pos1: A
      Pos2: M
      Pos3: P? That's position 3? But we are trying to put L at position 3? Oh, I see: if the word is AMPLY, then L is at position 4? 

But I have L at position 3? 

What I have: A _ L Y _

So for example, position 1: A, position 3: L, position 4: Y? 

Then what words? At position 2, we have a letter? and position 5: a letter? 

We need a word: A _ L Y _

Some possibilities:

  With _ at 2: try letters? 

  Consider common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, etc.

But not including S,T,E,D,I.

Word: ""AULY_"" ? Not common.

How about: ""ALTER"" -> but T is absent? 

Another? ""AGLY?"" That's not 5 letters? 

We could try ""ALLY_"" but then L at position 3? And Y at 4? Then position 5? But ALLY with Y at position 4? But then we have the word ""ALLY"" is only 4 letters? 

Ah, we need 5 letters? 

So maybe: ""ALLEY"" -> but L repeated? And E absent? 

Wait, let me think? 

Perhaps ""A _ L Y _"" is not common? 

Alternative plan: Put L at position 3 and Y at position 2? But Y can be at 2? 

But then we need A? 

For example: put A at 4? So positions: 
  Pos4: A? allowed? 
  Pos2: Y? allowed? 

Then word: _ Y L A _

We haven't assigned the first position? 

Try words? ""CYLAR""? Not valid? 

Another: why don't we list possible assignments.

We know:
  A must be at 1,4,5
  L must be at 1,3,5
  Y must be at 1,2,3,4

But we cannot assign same position? 

Assign A at 1?
  Then L can be at 3 or 5? 
  Y must be at 2,3,4? 

But if L is at 3? Then Y can be at 2 or 4? 
  If Y at 2: word: A Y L _ _
  If Y at 4: word: A _ L Y _

But we need to fill the blanks? 

Assign A at 5?
  Then L must be at 1,3? (cannot be at 5 because A is there? unless same letter? but A and L are different? But both are present? So they can coexist? 
  But if A at 5, then L cannot be at 5? So L can be at 1 or 3? 
  Y at? 

Similarly? 

But let me try to find actual words.

Starting with A Y L: ""AYLUM"" -> but U, M? and M? Also? But is “Aylum” a word? No? 

Common words: ""ALLY"" is short? 

Word: ""ALKY"" only 4? 

With A at 1, L at 5? And Y at 4? Then word: A _ _ Y L? 
Example: ""AOKYL"" not word.

Another idea: put Y at position 2? And A at 4? Then L at 3? So positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: Y
  3: L
  4: A
  5: ? 

Which words: ... Then: _ Y L A _

Examples: ""GYLAD"" not word? 

Try a different assignment.

Put L at position 1? 

L can be at 1? 

So if L at 1: 
  Then A can be at 4 or 5? 
  Y at 2,3,4? 

But if A at 4: then word: L _ _ A _ 
  And Y can be at 2 or 3? 

Example: L at 1, Y at 2: ""L Y _ A _"" -> ""LYMFA"" not common? 

Or L at 1, Y at 3: ""L _ Y A _"" -> ""LARVA"" but R and V? And R? But A at position 4? And L at1, Y at3? 

But ""LARYA"" not word? 

What about: ""LOAMY"" -> L O A M Y? But O, M? 
  Positions: L at1, O at2, A at3? But A cannot be at position 3! Because from slate: A is at 3 and it was '-', so not at 3? 

So if we put A at 3, we know it should be '-', so not efficient? 

But we cannot avoid? Unless we put A at allowed places? 

Therefore, avoid A at 3? 

In ""LOAMY"": 
  L at1? 
  O at2? 
  A at3? -> but A cannot be at3? So if we guess ""LOAMY"", we must get A at3 marked as '-', but we already know it's '-'. So we learn nothing new about A? 

But we don't know? Unless we want to verify? Or we want to avoid known incorrect? 

So for efficiency, we should put A at positions we haven't tried: 1,4,5? 

Similarly, L at positions we haven't tried: 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4)? 

And Y at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

Back to L at 1: then A at4? Y at2? Example: ""LOAMY"" has A at3? Avoid.

Another: ""LUMAR""? But U, M? And Y not present? 

Perhaps ""LAYUP"": 
  L A Y U P -> 
  Positions: 
    L:1 (which is allowed? We haven't tried? But L cannot be at 2 or 4? So 1 is okay? 
    A:2? but A cannot be at2? Because in ""daily"", A was at2? and we got '-', so wrong position? So we cannot put A at2? 
    And A at2? will be '-', so waste? 

But we put A at2? Anyway? 

""LAYUP"": L at1, A at2? But A cannot be at position2? So we'll get no new information about A? 

So avoid? 

Therefore, we must avoid position2 for A and position4 for L? And position3 for A? And position2 for L? 

So let me list allowed positions again:
A: 1,4,5
L: 1,3,5
Y: 1,2,3,4

We want to try to put them in new positions? 

So possible assignments without conflict and new? 

Option 1: 
  A at1? -> then L cannot be at1? So L can be at3 or5? 
    If L at3: then Y can be at2 or4? 
      If Y at2: word A Y L _ ?: positions 1A,2Y,3L,4?,5? 
      If Y at4: word A _ L Y _: positions 1A,2?,3L,4Y,5?
    If L at5: then Y at2,3,4? 
      If Y at2: word A Y _ _ L
      etc.

Similarly, for L at position 1: must then A and Y not at1? So A at4 or5? Y at2,3,4? 
  If A at4: word L _ _ A _ -> which is: L, ?, ?, A, ?
      And Y could be at2 or3? etc.

Given the complexity, let's look for common words that include A,L,Y and avoid forbidden letters.

Specifically: what words contain A,L,Y and no S,T,E,D,I?

For example:
  ""GAYAL"" -> G,A,Y,A,L? 
      Letters: G, A, Y, A, L -> double A? 
      Positions: 
        1:G, 2:A, 3:Y, 4:A, 5:L? 
      But A at positions2 and4? 
      For A: we know A cannot be at2? So we would get A at2 as '-', but it is wrong? Yet we have A at4? 

This guess would be checking what?

  Let's see the feedback: if the secret word has A at1 or4 or5? and we put A at2 and4? Then the A at2 would be '-', and A at4 would be either 'x' or '-'? Or ✓? 

But we don't know? 

But note: the word as ""GAYAL"" has A at2 and at4? But secret word has only one A? Or two? We don't know? 

It might work? But let me check position constraints:

  For A: cannot be at2? In this guess and we have it at2? So expected '-' for that? And we at4 ? 

  But if in the secret word, A is at4? Then it might be ✓ for that? Wait, no? The letter I put at4 is A? So if secret has A at4, then ✓. Otherwise, ?

  Since A is present, and we have two As? but they might be evaluated independently? 

  But then, we have L at5? And we know L cannot be at4? But here it's at5? So if secret has L at5? Then ✓? 

  However, we haven't tested L at5? 

So overall, we would get:

  G: unknown? 
  A at2: '-' (since we know A cannot be at2? So always '-')? 
  Y at3: unknown? 
  A at4: depends? 
  L at5: depends? 

And G and Y are new? 

But this uses double A? And we don't know if A is repeated? It might be.

Now, but is ""GAYAL"" a word? Yes? 

Another common words: ""GAYLY"" -> 'GAYLY' has letters: G, A, Y, L, Y? 
  Double Y? 
  Positions:1G,2A,3Y,4L,5Y? 
  For L: cannot be at4? So if we put L at4? It should be '-', but we know L cannot be at4? 
  And A at2: no? 

Then Y at3 and at5? But Y cannot be at5? We cannot put Y at5? So avoid.

Another: ""RALLY"" -> R,A,L,L,Y? 
  Letters: R, A, L, L, Y? 
  But D is absent? R is new? 
  But positions: 
    1: R
    2: A? cannot (A cannot be at2? and if we put it? get '-')
    3: L? yes? (we can put L at3? allowed? because haven't tried? Only tried position 2 and 4? So position3 is new? 
    4: L? but L might be repeated? 
    5: Y? cannot? Y cannot be at5? 

So position2: A -> '-'
Position5: Y -> expected '-'? because we know Y not at5? 
So no? 

Another possibility: ""Y"" at position 1? 

Example: Y at1? 
Then Y at1 is allowed? 
So: Y _ _ _ _ 

Then A and L? 

For instance: ""YHALM""? Not valid.

Or ""YARAM""? Not common.

Perhaps: ""YAULK""? Not valid.

What about: ""POLARY""? Too long? 

We need 5 letters? 

Another common word: ""GHAUL"" -> G, H, A, U, L? 
  But where is Y? We need Y? 

We must include Y? 

Because Y is present? 

So all guesses must include all known present letters? 

Otherwise we can't win? 

So the guess must have A, L, Y.

But: from above, ""GAYAL"" is one option? 

But is it common enough? 

Alternatively: ""CALYX"" -> C, A, L, Y, X? 
  Letters: C, A, L, Y, X? 
  No S,T,E,D,I. 
  Positions: 
    1: C
    2: A? cannot A at2? so would be '-', 
    3: L? which is allowed? (L not at2 or4? so 3 is new? 
    4: Y
    5: X

Now:
  A is at2 -> known wrong position? so will be marked '-'? 
  L is at3 -> new, may be correct? 
  Y is at4 -> new position? (previously at5 in daily? and in daily it was at5? and we got '-' because not at5? now at4? may be correct? may be not? 

And C and X are new? 

Similarly, this word: ""CALYX"" is a botanical term? But valid? 

Also, this tests L at3 and Y at4? which are possible positions? 

Another word: ""MALAY"" -> M, A, L, A, Y? 
  Positions:1M,2A,3L,4A,5Y? 
  A at2: '-', A at4: ?, L at3: ?, Y at5: not allowed? 

Y at5: but we know Y not at5? So avoid this? Because Y at5 will be '-' and we know that? 

Therefore, ""CALYX"" is acceptable? 

Then there is ""ALAYA"" not common? 

Or ""LAGAN"" -> but no Y? 

So between ""GAYAL"" and ""CALYX"", which is better? 

Both have distinct new letters: G vs C and X? 

Both test positions we haven't tried? 

But ""GAYAL"" has a repeated A? So if A is present only once, we might not learn correctly? 

Whereas ""CALYX"" has distinct letters? 

Therefore, I think ""CALYX"" is better? 

Or another: ""FLAWY"" -> F, L, A, W, Y? 
  Positions:
    1: F
    2: L? but L cannot be at 2? So position2 would be marked '-'? But we know L is not at2? So wasted? 
    3: A? also cannot? A not at3? 
    4: W
    5: Y? not allowed? 

So no? 

Another: ""DAYL- but already tried? 

Let me think of ""OAKUM"" -> no Y? 

Perhaps ""YULAN"" -> letters: Y, U, L, A, N? 
  Positions: 
    1: Y -> allowed? 
    2: U -> new? 
    3: L -> allowed? 
    4: A -> A can be at4? 
    5: N -> new? 
  And no S,T,E,D,I. 

This is good? 
  Y at1: not tried before? 
  U at2: new? 
  L at3: new position? 
  A at4: new position? 
  N at5: new? 

Also, no repeated letters? 

And it uses only one of each known present letter? 

So ""YULAN"" is also a word? 

It means a tree? 

Is it valid? 

Another: ""NYALA"" -> N, Y, A, L, A? 
  Positions: 
    1: N? 
    2: Y? 
    3: A? but A not at3? 
    4: L? not at4? 
    5: A? 

But A at3 and at5? At3: cannot? and at5: may be? 

So not efficient? 

Therefore, let's consider ""YULAN"" or ""CALYX"" or ""GAYAL""?

""YULAN"": Y at1, L at3, A at4 -> all new positions? 

Similarly, ""CALYX"": C at1, A at2 (not new), L at3, Y at4, X at5? 

With ""YULAN"", we test each of the known letters at different positions than before? 

Y at position1? (previously at5? so not5? and now1? 
L at3? (previously at2 and4? so not tested at3? 
A at4? (previously at3 and2? ) 

So ""YULAN"" might be better because it tests three new positions for the three present letters? 

Similarly, in ""CALYX"", A is at2? which we already know is wrong? so it's '-' and we get no new information? We already know A is not at2? 

Whereas in ""YULAN"", none of the positions are known to be wrong? 

So better to choose ""YULAN""! 

Also, ""YULAN"" introduces U and N? new letters? 

So next guess: ""YULAN""

<thinking>
Current Feedback:
- S,T,E,D,I are absent
- A,L,Y are present but with position constraints:
  - A ≠ pos2, pos3 → possible: 1,4,5
  - L ≠ pos2, pos4 → possible: 1,3,5
  - Y ≠ pos5 → possible: 1,2,3,4

""yulan"" strategy:
- Places Y at pos1 (new position)
- L at pos3 (new position, previously untested)
- A at pos4 (new position)
- Uses U (new) and N (new)
- Maximizes new position tests for present letters
</thinking>

<guess>yulan</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights:
- **Absent Letters**: S, T, E, D, I (eliminated from future guesses)
- **Present Letters**: A, L, Y (must be included)
- **Position Constraints**:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).  
  - L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
  - Y cannot be in position 5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
1. **Include A, L, Y** in unprobed positions:
   - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5 (untried: position 4)  
   - L: Positions 1, 3, or 5 (untried: position 3)  
   - Y: Positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (untried: position 1)  
2. **Introduce new letters** to test: U and N (common consonants).  
3. **Avoid redundant placements** (e.g., A in position 2 or L in position 4).  

Chose **""YULAN""** (a valid English word):  
- Y at position 1 (tests new position for Y)  
- U (new letter) at position 2  
- L at position 3 (tests new position)  
- A at position 4 (tests new position)  
- N (new letter) at position 5

But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid A in position 3 and L in position 2.\n\n  Word candidate: ""BLACK"" -> but we cannot use S, T, E and here we have B, L, A, C, K. \n    But note: we have to check if it has S, T, E? It doesn\'t. Also, position of L is 2? No, in ""BLACK"":\n      L is in position 2 -> but feedback told us L cannot be in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback was that L is not in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, we know that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in our new guess, we can put L in any position except we know it\'s not position 2? However, note: we are allowed to put L in position 2 again? But it would be marked as wrong position again? And we already know that\'s not the case. So to avoid wasting a letter, we should put L in a new position.\n\n  Actually, we are allowed to put the same letter in the same position again? But it wouldn\'t be efficient because we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for L and position 3 for A.\n\n  Let\'s avoid using L in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\n  So ""BLACK"": \n      B at position 1\n      L at position 2 -> but we know L is not in position 2 in the secret word, so this placement won\'t help us test L? Actually, if we put L in position 2, we would get a \'-\' again, but we already know that L is not in position 2. So it\'s better to put L in a different position to learn if it is elsewhere.\n\n  Therefore, we should avoid position 2 for L.\n\n  Alternative: put L in position 1? Then we have words starting with L.\n\n  How about: ""LABOR"" -> but contains O and we don\'t know if O is present? Also, R? \n      But note: we don\'t know if O or R is in the word. However, we also have to avoid placing A in position 3? In ""LABOR"":\n        L at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, R at 5.\n        But we are placing A at position 2? That\'s allowed because earlier A was at 3 and now we are trying 2? And we haven\'t tested position 2 for A.\n\n  However, we know that L must be somewhere else (not position 2) so putting L at 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at 2 is a new position.\n\n  But the word must not contain S, T, E. ""LABOR"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n  But wait: we have two letters we know are in the word: L and A. And we are introducing B, O, R. That might be okay.\n\n  However, let\'s check the feedback rules: we want to get information about the positions of L and A, and also about the new letters.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and L in positions that we haven\'t tried and are possible.\n\n  Since L can be in 1,3,4,5 and A can be in 1,2,4,5, let\'s try:\n\n  Option: A at position 1 and L at position 4? Example: ""APPLE"" but E is not allowed.\n\n  Without E: How about ""AUDIO"" -> but no L and we need L. \n\n  We must include both L and A.\n\n  Let me try with L in position 1 and A in position 4? Example: ""LARVA"" -> but V? Also, we have double A? And we don\'t know if R and V are present.\n\n  How about: ""CLAIM"" -> but C, L, A, I, M. \n    Positions: \n      1: C\n      2: L -> but we know L is not at position 2? Then we are putting L at position 2? That\'s the same as before? And we will get a \'-\' again? So it doesn\'t help.\n\n  So we avoid putting L at position 2.\n\n  How about putting L at position 4 and A at position 1? Example: ""ALARM"" -> contains A and L? \n      A at 1, L at 2 -> again L at 2? We shouldn\'t.\n\n  How about ""MANLY"": \n      M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n      A is at 2 -> which we haven\'t tried? and L is at 4 -> new position.\n\n  Also, no S, T, E.\n\n  This word uses two known letters (A and L) and introduces M, N, Y.\n\n  We can also consider: ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N -> \n      L at position 2 again? Avoid.\n\n  So ""MANLY"": \n      Letters are M, A, N, L, Y -> positions: \n        A at 2 (we haven\'t tried A at 2? Previously A was at 3 -> now we try 2) \n        L at 4 (previously at 2 -> now at 4)\n\n  But note: in the secret word, L is not at position 2? That doesn\'t mean it can\'t be at 4? So we can test.\n\n  Alternatively: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> \n      A at position 2? \n      L at position 3? \n      We haven\'t tried A at 2? or L at 3? \n\n  However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? In this word, A is at 2 and L at 3 -> that positions are allowed.\n\n  But note: we don\'t know if A is allowed at 2? We only know it\'s not at 3? Similarly, L not at 2? So we can have L at 3? \n\n  Let me list the constraints:\n    For L: not at position 2 -> so it can be 1,3,4,5.\n    For A: not at position 3 -> so it can be 1,2,4,5? \n\n  So both A at 2 and L at 3 are possible? \n\n  So ""VALID"" is a candidate.\n\n  Other candidate: ""RADAR"" -> has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if A is repeated? Also, has R and D? And we don\'t know.\n\n  It might be better to avoid duplicate letters at this stage? So we can get information about more letters.\n\n  I\'m considering ""VALID"": \n      Letters: V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct and new? \n\n  We haven\'t tested V, I, D? \n\n  But note: we have only 5 letters? \n\n  How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> \n      Positions: \n        D at 1\n        A at 2\n        I at 3? \n        L at 4? \n        Y at 5\n      This avoids L at 2 and A at 3? \n      But A at 2? and L at 4? \n\n  But we don\'t know if D, I, Y are present? \n\n  So ""DAILY"" is also a candidate.\n\n  Let me compare:\n    Requirements: must include L and A, and exclude S, T, E.\n\n  Both ""DAILY"" and ""VALID"" fit.\n\n  We want to maximize information? Which one uses more common letters? \n\n  Common letters in English: I is a common vowel? So ""DAILY"" has I. D and V are both common? \n\n  Or we can choose one that has vowels that we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested I, O, U? \n\n  Since we don\'t have any vowel information except A? And A is in the word? \n\n  We could also consider:\n\n    ""CHAOS"" -> has S? which we know is absent -> invalid.\n\n    ""QUAIL"" -> Q and U? and I? and L at the end? \n        Positions: Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3? -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we cannot put A at 3? \n        So we have to avoid A at 3? If we put A at 3, then we expect it to be wrong? \n\n        But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we get \'-\'. But we already know that A is not at 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get \'-\' again? But we already know that? So it\'s wasting a letter? \n\n        Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid L in position 2? \n\n  So we need a word that puts A not in position 3? So ""QUAIL"" has A at 3 -> invalid because we are forced to avoid? \n\n  Therefore, let\'s choose one that puts A in a different position? \n\n  Back to ""DAILY"": A at 2? -> allowed? Because we don\'t know about position 2? \n\n  How about ""AWAIT"": has A at 1 and A at 4? But also W and I and T? T is absent? So not allowed? T is excluded.\n\n  Let me try: ""OUIJA"" -> has J, and also repeats? Not ideal.\n\n  So I think ""DAILY"" is good: \n      D, A, I, L, Y -> \n      Positions: \n        D at 1 -> new\n        A at 2 -> new position for A\n        I at 3 -> new\n        L at 4 -> new position for L (previously at 2, now at 4)\n        Y at 5 -> new\n\n  This tests:\n    - A at position 2? \n    - L at position 4? \n\n  And introduces D, I, Y? \n\n  But note: we are also covering I? which is a common vowel? \n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses only consonants? But we have A which is vowel? \n\n  Another candidate: ""ALIGN"": A at 1? and L at 2? -> L at 2? We must avoid? So invalid.\n\n  Or ""PLAIN"": P, L (at 2 again) -> avoid.\n\n  So ""DAILY"" seems good? \n\n  But let me check the dictionary? We must ensure it\'s a valid word.\n\n  Yes, ""daily"" is a common word.\n\n  Another option: ""RALLY"" -> R, A, L, L, Y -> repeated L? And L is at position 3 and 4? But one of them might be correct? However, we don\'t know if L is repeated? And we have L at position 3? We haven\'t tried position 3? But also A at 2? \n      And R and Y? \n\n  However, repeated L might not be ideal? Because if the word has only one L, then we are wasting? \n\n  So ""DAILY"" is distinct? \n\n  Also note: ""daily"" has 5 distinct letters? \n\n  Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"" as the second guess.\n\n  We\'ll get feedback on each letter? And then proceed? \n\n  So next guess: ""daily""\n\n  Format: <guess>daily</guess>? \n\n  But the response must be: <guess>word</guess>? \n\n  So: <guess>daily</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""slate"":  \n- S, T, E are **absent** (marked \'x\')  \n- L and A are **present** but in wrong positions (L not pos2, A not pos3)  \n\nGoal for next guess:  \n- Must include L and A while avoiding positions 2 for L and 3 for A  \n- Exclude S, T, E  \n- Introduce new high-frequency letters (D, I, Y) to maximize information  \n\nChose **""daily""**:  \n- D (new letter) at position 1  \n- A at position 2 (previously untested position for A)  \n- I (new vowel) at position 3  \n- L at position 4 (new position to test)  \n- Y (new letter) at position 5  \n- All letters distinct to cover more possibilities  \n\nThis tests new positions for L/A while probing common unconfirmed letters.\n\n<guess>daily</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(-) I(x) L(-) Y(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""slate""):\n  S: x (absent)\n  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2)\n  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 3)\n  T: x (absent)\n  E: x (absent)\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""daily""):\n  D: x (absent)\n  A: - (present but wrong position; originally position 2 in this guess)\n  I: x (absent)\n  L: - (present but wrong position; originally position 4 in this guess)\n  Y: - (present but wrong position; originally position 5)\n\nWhat we know:\n\nAbsent letters: S, T, E, D, I (so letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, I)\n\nPresent letters: A, L, Y (each must appear at least once, with constraints on positions)\n\nConstraints on positions:\n- A is present but not in position 2 (from ""daily"") and not in position 3 (from ""slate"")\n- L is present but not in position 2 (from ""slate"") and not in position 4 (from ""daily"")\n- Y is present but not in position 5 (from ""daily"")\n\nAlso, note that the positions where A, L, Y cannot be:\n- A cannot be at position 2 or 3\n- L cannot be at position 2 or 4\n- Y cannot be at position 5\n\nTherefore, possible positions:\n- A: can be at 1, 4, 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out)\n- L: can be at 1, 3, 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out)\n- Y: can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (since position 5 is ruled out)\n\nAdditionally, since these letters are present, we also must include them in the next guess.\n\nWe have two more known present letters: A, L, Y. And we know that the word does not contain S, T, E, D, I.\n\nWe have 6 letters known absent: S, T, E, D, I.\n\nWe have 3 known present letters: A, L, Y.\n\nSince we have only 3 known present letters and the word is 5 letters, there must be two more letters that we don\'t know yet. So we need to introduce two new letters.\n\nOur next guess should:\n- Include A, L, Y in positions that are allowed (according to the constraints above)\n- Exclude S, T, E, D, I\n- Include two new letters to test for presence.\n\nWe should also consider common English letters.\n\nPossible positions:\n\nWe need to assign A, L, Y to positions 1,3,5? But note we also have positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe know:\n- A can be at 1,4,5\n- L can be at 1,3,5\n- Y can be at 1,2,3,4\n\nBut note: it\'s possible to have the same letter? Actually, no duplicates known yet? But note: we don\'t have information that forbids duplicates? So we cannot assume.\n\nBut so far the known letters are distinct: A, L, Y.\n\nWe also have to avoid positions:\n- A: avoid 2,3\n- L: avoid 2,4\n- Y: avoid 5\n\nNow, we need to assign them to the word.\n\nWe also have to introduce two new letters.\n\nLet me try to assign the positions:\n\nOption 1: \n  Position 1: A (since A can be at 1)\n  Position 2: ? (must be a new letter? and cannot be one of the already absent)\n  Position 3: L (since L can be at 3; and A is not at 3? Wait, but A is at 1, so we can have L at 3)\n  Position 4: Y (Y can be at 4? But note: L cannot be at position 4? But Y can be at 4? Yes)\n  Position 5: ? (must be a new letter? But wait, position 5: we haven\'t assigned any? But if we put A at 1, L at 3, Y at 4, then position 2 and 5 are free.)\n\nBut note: we also need to avoid putting Y at 5? So position 5 must be something else? So we cannot put Y at 5? So we have Y at 4? Then position 5: let\'s call it Z.\n\nThen the word would be: A _ L Y _ \n\nFor position 2, we need a letter that is not S,T,E,D,I, and must be new? And position 5: same.\n\nBut also, we have constraints: we cannot put L at 4? Wait, no: L is at 3, so that\'s okay? Y at 4: okay.\n\nBut wait: the word cannot have A at 3? But we have L at 3? So that\'s fine? \n\nBut also, we are using Y at position 4? \n\nAnd A at position 1? \n\nSo positions: \n  Pos1: A? and we know A cannot be at position 2 or 3? But we are putting at 1? Is it allowed? We haven\'t tested? Yes.\n\nSo we have A at 1? \n\nIn the second guess, ""daily"", we had A at position 2? And it was marked as \'-\', meaning present but not at 2? So that doesn\'t tell us about position 1? \n\nSimilarly, in the first guess? A was at position 3? and \'-\', so wrong? \n\nSo A has not been at position 1? So we can try.\n\nAnother option: put A at 5? \n\nBut let me list possible words:\n\nWord structure: A _ L Y _ \n  We need two more letters: the blanks.\n\nBut we have constraints: \n  We cannot use S,T,E,D,I for the blanks? \n\nLet me think: starting with A: words starting with A with L at position 3? and Y at position 4? \n\nFor example: ""AMPLY"": \n  A, M, P, L, Y -> \n  Positions: \n    1: A? \n    2: M? \n    3: L? \n    4: Y? \n    5: Y? No: AMPLY is A, M, P, L, Y? Actually, AMPLY? \n    A M P L Y? \n      Pos1: A\n      Pos2: M\n      Pos3: P? That\'s position 3? But we are trying to put L at position 3? Oh, I see: if the word is AMPLY, then L is at position 4? \n\nBut I have L at position 3? \n\nWhat I have: A _ L Y _\n\nSo for example, position 1: A, position 3: L, position 4: Y? \n\nThen what words? At position 2, we have a letter? and position 5: a letter? \n\nWe need a word: A _ L Y _\n\nSome possibilities:\n\n  With _ at 2: try letters? \n\n  Consider common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, etc.\n\nBut not including S,T,E,D,I.\n\nWord: ""AULY_"" ? Not common.\n\nHow about: ""ALTER"" -> but T is absent? \n\nAnother? ""AGLY?"" That\'s not 5 letters? \n\nWe could try ""ALLY_"" but then L at position 3? And Y at 4? Then position 5? But ALLY with Y at position 4? But then we have the word ""ALLY"" is only 4 letters? \n\nAh, we need 5 letters? \n\nSo maybe: ""ALLEY"" -> but L repeated? And E absent? \n\nWait, let me think? \n\nPerhaps ""A _ L Y _"" is not common? \n\nAlternative plan: Put L at position 3 and Y at position 2? But Y can be at 2? \n\nBut then we need A? \n\nFor example: put A at 4? So positions: \n  Pos4: A? allowed? \n  Pos2: Y? allowed? \n\nThen word: _ Y L A _\n\nWe haven\'t assigned the first position? \n\nTry words? ""CYLAR""? Not valid? \n\nAnother: why don\'t we list possible assignments.\n\nWe know:\n  A must be at 1,4,5\n  L must be at 1,3,5\n  Y must be at 1,2,3,4\n\nBut we cannot assign same position? \n\nAssign A at 1?\n  Then L can be at 3 or 5? \n  Y must be at 2,3,4? \n\nBut if L is at 3? Then Y can be at 2 or 4? \n  If Y at 2: word: A Y L _ _\n  If Y at 4: word: A _ L Y _\n\nBut we need to fill the blanks? \n\nAssign A at 5?\n  Then L must be at 1,3? (cannot be at 5 because A is there? unless same letter? but A and L are different? But both are present? So they can coexist? \n  But if A at 5, then L cannot be at 5? So L can be at 1 or 3? \n  Y at? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut let me try to find actual words.\n\nStarting with A Y L: ""AYLUM"" -> but U, M? and M? Also? But is “Aylum” a word? No? \n\nCommon words: ""ALLY"" is short? \n\nWord: ""ALKY"" only 4? \n\nWith A at 1, L at 5? And Y at 4? Then word: A _ _ Y L? \nExample: ""AOKYL"" not word.\n\nAnother idea: put Y at position 2? And A at 4? Then L at 3? So positions: \n  1: ? \n  2: Y\n  3: L\n  4: A\n  5: ? \n\nWhich words: ... Then: _ Y L A _\n\nExamples: ""GYLAD"" not word? \n\nTry a different assignment.\n\nPut L at position 1? \n\nL can be at 1? \n\nSo if L at 1: \n  Then A can be at 4 or 5? \n  Y at 2,3,4? \n\nBut if A at 4: then word: L _ _ A _ \n  And Y can be at 2 or 3? \n\nExample: L at 1, Y at 2: ""L Y _ A _"" -> ""LYMFA"" not common? \n\nOr L at 1, Y at 3: ""L _ Y A _"" -> ""LARVA"" but R and V? And R? But A at position 4? And L at1, Y at3? \n\nBut ""LARYA"" not word? \n\nWhat about: ""LOAMY"" -> L O A M Y? But O, M? \n  Positions: L at1, O at2, A at3? But A cannot be at position 3! Because from slate: A is at 3 and it was \'-\', so not at 3? \n\nSo if we put A at 3, we know it should be \'-\', so not efficient? \n\nBut we cannot avoid? Unless we put A at allowed places? \n\nTherefore, avoid A at 3? \n\nIn ""LOAMY"": \n  L at1? \n  O at2? \n  A at3? -> but A cannot be at3? So if we guess ""LOAMY"", we must get A at3 marked as \'-\', but we already know it\'s \'-\'. So we learn nothing new about A? \n\nBut we don\'t know? Unless we want to verify? Or we want to avoid known incorrect? \n\nSo for efficiency, we should put A at positions we haven\'t tried: 1,4,5? \n\nSimilarly, L at positions we haven\'t tried: 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4)? \n\nAnd Y at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\nBack to L at 1: then A at4? Y at2? Example: ""LOAMY"" has A at3? Avoid.\n\nAnother: ""LUMAR""? But U, M? And Y not present? \n\nPerhaps ""LAYUP"": \n  L A Y U P -> \n  Positions: \n    L:1 (which is allowed? We haven\'t tried? But L cannot be at 2 or 4? So 1 is okay? \n    A:2? but A cannot be at2? Because in ""daily"", A was at2? and we got \'-\', so wrong position? So we cannot put A at2? \n    And A at2? will be \'-\', so waste? \n\nBut we put A at2? Anyway? \n\n""LAYUP"": L at1, A at2? But A cannot be at position2? So we\'ll get no new information about A? \n\nSo avoid? \n\nTherefore, we must avoid position2 for A and position4 for L? And position3 for A? And position2 for L? \n\nSo let me list allowed positions again:\nA: 1,4,5\nL: 1,3,5\nY: 1,2,3,4\n\nWe want to try to put them in new positions? \n\nSo possible assignments without conflict and new? \n\nOption 1: \n  A at1? -> then L cannot be at1? So L can be at3 or5? \n    If L at3: then Y can be at2 or4? \n      If Y at2: word A Y L _ ?: positions 1A,2Y,3L,4?,5? \n      If Y at4: word A _ L Y _: positions 1A,2?,3L,4Y,5?\n    If L at5: then Y at2,3,4? \n      If Y at2: word A Y _ _ L\n      etc.\n\nSimilarly, for L at position 1: must then A and Y not at1? So A at4 or5? Y at2,3,4? \n  If A at4: word L _ _ A _ -> which is: L, ?, ?, A, ?\n      And Y could be at2 or3? etc.\n\nGiven the complexity, let\'s look for common words that include A,L,Y and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSpecifically: what words contain A,L,Y and no S,T,E,D,I?\n\nFor example:\n  ""GAYAL"" -> G,A,Y,A,L? \n      Letters: G, A, Y, A, L -> double A? \n      Positions: \n        1:G, 2:A, 3:Y, 4:A, 5:L? \n      But A at positions2 and4? \n      For A: we know A cannot be at2? So we would get A at2 as \'-\', but it is wrong? Yet we have A at4? \n\nThis guess would be checking what?\n\n  Let\'s see the feedback: if the secret word has A at1 or4 or5? and we put A at2 and4? Then the A at2 would be \'-\', and A at4 would be either \'x\' or \'-\'? Or ✓? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBut note: the word as ""GAYAL"" has A at2 and at4? But secret word has only one A? Or two? We don\'t know? \n\nIt might work? But let me check position constraints:\n\n  For A: cannot be at2? In this guess and we have it at2? So expected \'-\' for that? And we at4 ? \n\n  But if in the secret word, A is at4? Then it might be ✓ for that? Wait, no? The letter I put at4 is A? So if secret has A at4, then ✓. Otherwise, ?\n\n  Since A is present, and we have two As? but they might be evaluated independently? \n\n  But then, we have L at5? And we know L cannot be at4? But here it\'s at5? So if secret has L at5? Then ✓? \n\n  However, we haven\'t tested L at5? \n\nSo overall, we would get:\n\n  G: unknown? \n  A at2: \'-\' (since we know A cannot be at2? So always \'-\')? \n  Y at3: unknown? \n  A at4: depends? \n  L at5: depends? \n\nAnd G and Y are new? \n\nBut this uses double A? And we don\'t know if A is repeated? It might be.\n\nNow, but is ""GAYAL"" a word? Yes? \n\nAnother common words: ""GAYLY"" -> \'GAYLY\' has letters: G, A, Y, L, Y? \n  Double Y? \n  Positions:1G,2A,3Y,4L,5Y? \n  For L: cannot be at4? So if we put L at4? It should be \'-\', but we know L cannot be at4? \n  And A at2: no? \n\nThen Y at3 and at5? But Y cannot be at5? We cannot put Y at5? So avoid.\n\nAnother: ""RALLY"" -> R,A,L,L,Y? \n  Letters: R, A, L, L, Y? \n  But D is absent? R is new? \n  But positions: \n    1: R\n    2: A? cannot (A cannot be at2? and if we put it? get \'-\')\n    3: L? yes? (we can put L at3? allowed? because haven\'t tried? Only tried position 2 and 4? So position3 is new? \n    4: L? but L might be repeated? \n    5: Y? cannot? Y cannot be at5? \n\nSo position2: A -> \'-\'\nPosition5: Y -> expected \'-\'? because we know Y not at5? \nSo no? \n\nAnother possibility: ""Y"" at position 1? \n\nExample: Y at1? \nThen Y at1 is allowed? \nSo: Y _ _ _ _ \n\nThen A and L? \n\nFor instance: ""YHALM""? Not valid.\n\nOr ""YARAM""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps: ""YAULK""? Not valid.\n\nWhat about: ""POLARY""? Too long? \n\nWe need 5 letters? \n\nAnother common word: ""GHAUL"" -> G, H, A, U, L? \n  But where is Y? We need Y? \n\nWe must include Y? \n\nBecause Y is present? \n\nSo all guesses must include all known present letters? \n\nOtherwise we can\'t win? \n\nSo the guess must have A, L, Y.\n\nBut: from above, ""GAYAL"" is one option? \n\nBut is it common enough? \n\nAlternatively: ""CALYX"" -> C, A, L, Y, X? \n  Letters: C, A, L, Y, X? \n  No S,T,E,D,I. \n  Positions: \n    1: C\n    2: A? cannot A at2? so would be \'-\', \n    3: L? which is allowed? (L not at2 or4? so 3 is new? \n    4: Y\n    5: X\n\nNow:\n  A is at2 -> known wrong position? so will be marked \'-\'? \n  L is at3 -> new, may be correct? \n  Y is at4 -> new position? (previously at5 in daily? and in daily it was at5? and we got \'-\' because not at5? now at4? may be correct? may be not? \n\nAnd C and X are new? \n\nSimilarly, this word: ""CALYX"" is a botanical term? But valid? \n\nAlso, this tests L at3 and Y at4? which are possible positions? \n\nAnother word: ""MALAY"" -> M, A, L, A, Y? \n  Positions:1M,2A,3L,4A,5Y? \n  A at2: \'-\', A at4: ?, L at3: ?, Y at5: not allowed? \n\nY at5: but we know Y not at5? So avoid this? Because Y at5 will be \'-\' and we know that? \n\nTherefore, ""CALYX"" is acceptable? \n\nThen there is ""ALAYA"" not common? \n\nOr ""LAGAN"" -> but no Y? \n\nSo between ""GAYAL"" and ""CALYX"", which is better? \n\nBoth have distinct new letters: G vs C and X? \n\nBoth test positions we haven\'t tried? \n\nBut ""GAYAL"" has a repeated A? So if A is present only once, we might not learn correctly? \n\nWhereas ""CALYX"" has distinct letters? \n\nTherefore, I think ""CALYX"" is better? \n\nOr another: ""FLAWY"" -> F, L, A, W, Y? \n  Positions:\n    1: F\n    2: L? but L cannot be at 2? So position2 would be marked \'-\'? But we know L is not at2? So wasted? \n    3: A? also cannot? A not at3? \n    4: W\n    5: Y? not allowed? \n\nSo no? \n\nAnother: ""DAYL- but already tried? \n\nLet me think of ""OAKUM"" -> no Y? \n\nPerhaps ""YULAN"" -> letters: Y, U, L, A, N? \n  Positions: \n    1: Y -> allowed? \n    2: U -> new? \n    3: L -> allowed? \n    4: A -> A can be at4? \n    5: N -> new? \n  And no S,T,E,D,I. \n\nThis is good? \n  Y at1: not tried before? \n  U at2: new? \n  L at3: new position? \n  A at4: new position? \n  N at5: new? \n\nAlso, no repeated letters? \n\nAnd it uses only one of each known present letter? \n\nSo ""YULAN"" is also a word? \n\nIt means a tree? \n\nIs it valid? \n\nAnother: ""NYALA"" -> N, Y, A, L, A? \n  Positions: \n    1: N? \n    2: Y? \n    3: A? but A not at3? \n    4: L? not at4? \n    5: A? \n\nBut A at3 and at5? At3: cannot? and at5: may be? \n\nSo not efficient? \n\nTherefore, let\'s consider ""YULAN"" or ""CALYX"" or ""GAYAL""?\n\n""YULAN"": Y at1, L at3, A at4 -> all new positions? \n\nSimilarly, ""CALYX"": C at1, A at2 (not new), L at3, Y at4, X at5? \n\nWith ""YULAN"", we test each of the known letters at different positions than before? \n\nY at position1?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""slate"" -> S(x), L(-), A(-), T(x), E(x)
  Meaning: 
    S and T and E are absent.
    L is present but not in position 2.
    A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""daily"" -> D(x), A(-), I(x), L(-), Y(-)
  Meaning:
    D and I are absent.
    A is present but not in position 2.
    L is present but not in position 4.
    Y is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""yulan"" -> Y(-), U(x), L(-), A(✓), N(x)
  Meaning:
    Y is present but not in position 1.
    U is absent.
    L is present but not in position 3.
    A is present and in the correct position (position 4).
    N is absent.

So now we know:

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I, U, N

Present letters: A, L, Y (and we know A is at position 4)

Additionally, we have position constraints:
- A: we now know it is at position 4 (correctly placed).
- L: cannot be at position 2 (from guess1), position 4 (from guess2), or position 3 (from guess3). So L must be at position 1 or 5.
- Y: cannot be at position 5 (from guess2) and not at position 1 (from guess3). So Y must be at position 2 or 3.

Also, we know the word has the form: _ _ _ A _

We have two more letters to find? Actually, we have:
  Position 4: A (fixed)
  We need to assign L and Y to two of the remaining positions? But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have three known present letters: A, L, Y. So the other two letters must be new? 

But we also know that L must be at 1 or 5, and Y at 2 or 3.

So the word can be:

Option 1: L at 1, Y at 2: then word: L Y _ A _
Option 2: L at 1, Y at 3: then word: L _ Y A _
Option 3: L at 5, Y at 2: then word: _ Y _ A L
Option 4: L at 5, Y at 3: then word: _ _ Y A L

We also need to fill the remaining blank(s) with letters that are not absent and not A, L, Y? 

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I, U, N

So available letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, R, V, W, X, Z, etc. (common ones)

We have two more letters to find? Actually, in each option, there is one or two blanks? 

But note: in option 1: two blanks? Actually, no: in option 1: positions 1,2,4 are filled? Then positions 3 and 5 are open? So two letters? 

Similarly, in option 2: positions 1,3,4 filled? positions 2 and 5 open? 

Option 3: positions 2,4,5 filled? positions 1 and 3 open? 

Option 4: positions 3,4,5 filled? positions 1 and 2 open? 

So we need to fill two letters? 

But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have more tries? But we want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters? 

But note: we have A at 4, and we know L and Y must be in the word? 

So let's list possible words for each pattern? 

First, pattern: L at 1, Y at 2: word: L Y _ A _

We need to fill position 3 and 5? 

Possible words: 
  LYCEA? not a word? 
  LYRA? too short? 
  LYRAE? but E is absent? 
  LYRAD? D absent? 
  LYRAH? H? 
  Not common? 

  How about ""LYCRA""? 
      L Y C R A? 
      But position 5 is A? but we have A at4? and then position5? 
      Actually, the pattern is L Y _ A _ -> so position5 is the last? 
      ""LYCRA"" is L Y C R A -> so positions: 
          1:L, 2:Y, 3:C, 4:R, 5:A? 
      But we know A is at position4? So this has A at5? not matching? 

  We must have A at4? So the word must have A at4? 

  So for pattern L Y _ A _ : the fifth letter is not A? 

  Example: ""LYMPA""? not word? 

  ""LYTTA""? T absent? 

  ""LYSOA""? S absent? 

  It's hard? 

Second pattern: L at 1, Y at 3: word: L _ Y A _

Fill position2 and position5? 

Example: ""LARYA""? not word? 
  ""LAPYA""? not? 
  ""LAVYA""? not? 
  ""LACKA""? C and K? but A at4? 
      L A C K A? -> but A at2 and A at5? and we have A at4? so three A? 
      But we don't know if A is repeated? 

  But we know A is at4? So if we have A at2? that would be a different A? 

  However, we have to avoid absent letters? 

  ""LABYA""? B? 
  ""LAGYA""? G? 
  ""LAMYA""? M? 
  ""LARVA"": L A R V A? -> but A at2 and A at5? and we have A at4? 
      So the word would be L A R V A? 
      But then we have A at2,4,5? 
      And we know A is at4? so the A at2 and A at5 would be extra? 

  But is ""LARVA"" a word? Yes? 

  But let's check: 
      Position2: A? but we know A cannot be at2? from guess2? 
      So if we guess ""LARVA"", we would get A at2 as '-'? and A at4 as '✓'? and A at5 as '-'? 

  But we already know A is not at2? So we don't learn new? 

  And we have L at1? which is allowed? and Y? but in this pattern we put Y at3? but in ""LARVA"", position3 is R? not Y? 

  So we need Y at3? 

  So ""LARYA""? not word? 

  ""LAYIA""? but Y at2? not at3? 

  We need Y at3? 

  So: L _ Y A _ 

  For example: ""L O Y A L"" -> but L at5? and we have L at1? so repeated L? 
      ""LOYAL"": L at1, O at2, Y at3, A at4, L at5? 
      This has L at1 and L at5? 
      We know L is present? but we don't know if repeated? 

  And O is new? 

  Also, we have Y at3? 

  And A at4? 

  So ""LOYAL"" is a valid word? 

  And it fits: 
      L at1: we don't know if correct? 
      O at2: new? 
      Y at3: we don't know? 
      A at4: correct? 
      L at5: we don't know? 

  But we have constraints: 
      L must be at1 or5? Here it is at both? 
      And Y must be at2 or3? Here at3? 

  So it fits the constraints? 

  Also, no absent letters? 

  So ""LOYAL"" is a candidate? 

Third pattern: L at5, Y at2: word: _ Y _ A L

Fill position1 and position3? 

Example: ""C Y M A L"" -> ""CYMAL""? not word? 
  ""PYGAL""? P,Y,G,A,L -> positions: 
      1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:A, 5:L? 
      So ""PYGAL"" is a word? 

  But we have Y at2? and L at5? 

  And A at4? 

  So ""PYGAL"" is a candidate? 

  Also, ""RYMAL""? not word? 

  ""HYMAL""? not? 

  ""SYNAL""? S absent? 

  ""BYLAW"": B,Y,L,A,W -> but then positions: 
      1:B, 2:Y, 3:L? but L is at3? but we have L at5? 
      And we are putting L at3? but we also have L at5? 
      But the pattern is _ Y _ A L? so L at5? 
      So in ""BYLAW"", we have L at3? which is not in the pattern? 

  We need the third letter to be not L? 

  So ""PYGAL"" is one? 

Fourth pattern: L at5, Y at3: word: _ _ Y A L

Fill position1 and position2? 

Example: ""B O Y A L"" -> ""BOYAL""? not word? 
  ""COYAL""? not? 
  ""FOYAL""? not? 
  ""GOYAL""? not? 
  ""HOYAL""? not? 
  ""MOYAL""? not? 
  ""ROYAL""? R,O,Y,A,L -> 
      Positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:A, 5:L? 
      So ""ROYAL"" is a word? 

  And it fits: 
      R at1? 
      O at2? 
      Y at3? 
      A at4? 
      L at5? 

  And we have L at5? and Y at3? 

  So ""ROYAL"" is a candidate? 

Now, we have three candidates: 
  Candidate 1: ""LOYAL"" (pattern L at1, Y at3)
  Candidate 2: ""PYGAL"" (pattern L at5, Y at2)
  Candidate 3: ""ROYAL"" (pattern L at5, Y at3)

But note: in ""ROYAL"", L is at5? and Y at3? 

We also have ""PYGAL"" with L at5 and Y at2? 

Now, we need to choose one? 

But note: we have only one more guess? Actually, we have 3 guesses left? But we want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer? 

But let's see what we can learn? 

We know A is fixed at4? 

For L: it must be at1 or5? 
For Y: at2 or3? 

In ""LOYAL"": 
  If we guess ""LOYAL"", then:
    If L is at1 and correct? then we get ✓ for L at1? 
    If L is at5 and correct? then we get ✓ for L at5? 
    But in ""LOYAL"", we have L at1 and L at5? 
    So if the secret word has L only once? then one of them will be ✓ and the other might be '-'? or if both are present? 

But we don't know if L is repeated? 

Similarly, Y at3? 

But we might get lucky and get the word? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests one of the possibilities? 

But we have to include L and Y? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has L at1 and Y at2? but we couldn't find a common word? 

Or we can choose a word that has L at5 and Y at2? like ""PYGAL""? 

But ""PYGAL"" is less common? 

""ROYAL"" is very common? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

If we guess ""LOYAL"": 
  Positions:
    1: L -> if L is at1 in secret? then ✓? else if L is at5? then this L at1 would be '-'? 
    2: O -> new letter? 
    3: Y -> if Y is at3? then ✓? else if Y is at2? then this would be '-'? 
    4: A -> ✓ (we know)
    5: L -> if L is at5? then ✓? else if L is at1? then this would be '-'? 

But note: L cannot be at both? So if L is at1, then the L at5 would be '-'? and vice versa? 

Similarly, for Y: if Y is at3? then ✓? if not? then it must be at2? and we get '-'? 

So we can deduce? 

But we might get the word? 

Similarly, if we guess ""ROYAL"": 
  1: R -> new? 
  2: O -> new? 
  3: Y -> if Y at3? then ✓? 
  4: A -> ✓
  5: L -> if L at5? then ✓? 

And we know L must be at1 or5? and Y at2 or3? 

So if we get:
  If Y at3 is correct? and L at5 is correct? then we win? 
  Otherwise, we get feedback? 

But we have only two possibilities for L and two for Y? 

After this guess, we can deduce? 

But we have more guesses? 

But let's choose ""ROYAL"" because it is a common word? 

But wait: we have to avoid absent letters? 

In ""ROYAL"": R, O, Y, A, L? 
  R and O are new? 

But we don't know if they are present? 

Similarly, in ""LOYAL"": O is new? 

But we have to choose? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses the same pattern but with letters that are more common? 

But ""ROYAL"" is fine? 

But note: we have not tested many letters? 

We can also consider: we know A is at4? and we need to find L and Y? 

But we have two positions for L and two for Y? 

We can also try to guess a word that has L at1 and Y at2? but we couldn't find? 

Another word for pattern 1: L Y _ A _ 
  ""LYCRA"" doesn't fit? 
  ""LYTTA"" not? 
  ""LYSSA""? S absent? 

  ""LYCEE""? E absent? 

  ""LYARD""? 
      L Y A R D? -> but A at3? but we have A at4? 
      So not? 

  ""LYART""? T absent? 

  ""LYASE""? E absent? 

  ""LYTED""? T and E absent? 

So no? 

For pattern 2: L _ Y A _ 
  ""LOYAL"" is one? 

  ""LAVAY""? V? 
  ""LAMYA""? M? 
  ""LABYA""? B? 
  ""LACYA""? C? 

  But not common? 

For pattern 3: _ Y _ A L 
  ""PYGAL"" is one? 
  ""HYMAL""? not? 
  ""CYMAT""? T absent? 
  ""RYBAT""? not? 
  ""WYNDS""? D and S absent? 

For pattern 4: _ _ Y A L 
  ""ROYAL"" is one? 
  ""LOYAL"" is not? because L at1? 
  ""FOYAL""? not? 
  ""GOYAL""? not? 
  ""HOYAL""? not? 
  ""MOYAL""? not? 
  ""NOYAL""? N absent? 
  ""POYAL""? not? 
  ""SOYAL""? S absent? 
  ""TOYAL""? T absent? 
  ""VOYAL""? not? 
  ""WOYAL""? not? 

So the only common words we have are ""LOYAL"" and ""ROYAL"". 

Now, which one to choose? 

In ""LOYAL"", we have L at both 1 and 5? So if the secret word has only one L, then one of them will be marked as absent? But we know L is present? So if the secret word has L only once, then one of the L's in ""LOYAL"" will be in the correct position and the other will be marked as absent? But wait, no: if the secret word has L at1, then the L at1 is ✓ and the L at5 is not in the word? so marked x? but we know L is present? so if we see an x on L at5, that would be a problem? 

Actually, the feedback: 
  If the secret word has L only at position1, then in ""LOYAL"":
    Position1: L -> ✓
    Position5: L -> not in the word? so x? 
  But we know L is present? and we see an x? that would be inconsistent? 

But the secret word has L only at1? so the L at5 is extra? so it is not present? so x is correct? 

But we know from previous feedback that L is present? so if we get an x on L at5, that means that L is not at5? but we already know that? 

But the problem is: if the secret word has L only at1, then we get:
  L at1: ✓
  L at5: x (because there's no L at5 and no extra L? since only one L)

But we know L is present? so the x at5 doesn't mean L is absent? it means that particular L is not in the word? but we have another L at1 that is correct? 

So it's okay? 

Similarly, if the secret word has L only at5, then:
  L at1: not present? so x? 
  L at5: ✓

But we know L is present? so the x at1 is okay? 

If the secret word has L at both 1 and5? then both ✓? 

So it's acceptable? 

But we don't know if L is repeated? 

Similarly for ""ROYAL"": 
  It has L only at5? and Y at3? 

So if we guess ""ROYAL"", then:
  If the secret word is ""ROYAL"", we win? 
  Otherwise, we get feedback? 

But we have two possibilities for L and two for Y? 

We can also consider: we have not used many common letters? 

But let's choose ""ROYAL"" because it is a common word? 

Or ""LOYAL""? 

But note: in ""LOYAL"", we are testing two positions for L? and one for Y? 

In ""ROYAL"", we are testing one position for L (at5) and one for Y (at3)? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think both are valid? 

But let's look at the feedback we got: 

In guess3, we had A at4 correct? 

Now, we can try to guess ""ROYAL"" and see? 

But we have to make a choice? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have L repeated? 

For example, for pattern 3: ""PYGAL"" is not common? 

For pattern 4: ""ROYAL"" is common? 

So I choose ""ROYAL"". 

But let's check if it fits all constraints? 
  A at4: ✓
  L at5: allowed? 
  Y at3: allowed? 
  Letters: R, O, Y, A, L? 
  Absent letters: R and O are not in the absent list? 

So it's valid? 

Therefore, next guess: ""ROYAL""

But note: we have to consider that Y might be at2? and L might be at1? 

But if we guess ""ROYAL"", and the secret is not that? we get feedback? 

We have more guesses? 

So let's do it? 

<guess>royal</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (slate)**:  
  - S, T, E absent (x)  
  - L and A present but wrong positions (-) → L ≠ pos2, A ≠ pos3  
- **Guess 2 (daily)**:  
  - D, I absent (x)  
  - A, L, Y present but wrong positions (-) → A ≠ pos2, L ≠ pos4, Y ≠ pos5  
- **Guess 3 (yulan)**:  
  - U, N absent (x)  
  - Y and L present but wrong positions (-) → Y ≠ pos1, L ≠ pos3  
  - A correct (✓) at position 4  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **A** is **correctly placed at position 4**.  
   - **L** and **Y** are present but constrained:  
     - L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → must be in **position 1 or 5**.  
     - Y cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → must be in **position 2 or 3**.  
2. **Absent Letters**: S, T, E, D, I, U, N (excluded from guesses).  
3. **Word Structure**: `_ _ _ A _`  
   - Position 4 is fixed as **A**.  
   - Positions 1 and 5: One must contain **L** (if not repeated).  
   - Positions 2 or 3: One must contain **Y**.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test critical positions** for L (1 or 5) and Y (2 or 3) while introducing new letters.  
- **""ROYAL"" fits perfectly**:  
  - R (new) at position 1 → tests if L is at position 1 (if not, R is new data).  
  - O (new) at position 2 → tests if Y is at position 2.  
  - Y at position 3 → tests Y in position 3 (if correct, ✓; if not, Y must be at position 2).  
  - A at position 4 (✓ confirmed).  
  - L at position 5 → tests L in position 5 (if correct, ✓; if not, L must be at position 1).  
- Uses common letters (R, O) to maximize information if incorrect.  

<guess>royal</guess>",royal,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""slate"" -> S(x), L(-), A(-), T(x), E(x)
  Meaning: 
    S and T and E are absent.
    L is present but not in position 2.
    A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""daily"" -> D(x), A(-), I(x), L(-), Y(-)
  Meaning:
    D and I are absent.
    A is present but not in position 2.
    L is present but not in position 4.
    Y is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""yulan"" -> Y(-), U(x), L(-), A(✓), N(x)
  Meaning:
    Y is present but not in position 1.
    U is absent.
    L is present but not in position 3.
    A is present and in the correct position (position 4).
    N is absent.

So now we know:

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I, U, N

Present letters: A, L, Y (and we know A is at position 4)

Additionally, we have position constraints:
- A: we now know it is at position 4 (correctly placed).
- L: cannot be at position 2 (from guess1), position 4 (from guess2), or position 3 (from guess3). So L must be at position 1 or 5.
- Y: cannot be at position 5 (from guess2) and not at position 1 (from guess3). So Y must be at position 2 or 3.

Also, we know the word has the form: _ _ _ A _

We have two more letters to find? Actually, we have:
  Position 4: A (fixed)
  We need to assign L and Y to two of the remaining positions? But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have three known present letters: A, L, Y. So the other two letters must be new? 

But we also know that L must be at 1 or 5, and Y at 2 or 3.

So the word can be:

Option 1: L at 1, Y at 2: then word: L Y _ A _
Option 2: L at 1, Y at 3: then word: L _ Y A _
Option 3: L at 5, Y at 2: then word: _ Y _ A L
Option 4: L at 5, Y at 3: then word: _ _ Y A L

We also need to fill the remaining blank(s) with letters that are not absent and not A, L, Y? 

Absent letters: S, T, E, D, I, U, N

So available letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, R, V, W, X, Z, etc. (common ones)

We have two more letters to find? Actually, in each option, there is one or two blanks? 

But note: in option 1: two blanks? Actually, no: in option 1: positions 1,2,4 are filled? Then positions 3 and 5 are open? So two letters? 

Similarly, in option 2: positions 1,3,4 filled? positions 2 and 5 open? 

Option 3: positions 2,4,5 filled? positions 1 and 3 open? 

Option 4: positions 3,4,5 filled? positions 1 and 2 open? 

So we need to fill two letters? 

But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have more tries? But we want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters? 

But note: we have A at 4, and we know L and Y must be in the word? 

So let's list possible words for each pattern? 

First, pattern: L at 1, Y at 2: word: L Y _ A _

We need to fill position 3 and 5? 

Possible words: 
  LYCEA? not a word? 
  LYRA? too short? 
  LYRAE? but E is absent? 
  LYRAD? D absent? 
  LYRAH? H? 
  Not common? 

  How about ""LYCRA""? 
      L Y C R A? 
      But position 5 is A? but we have A at4? and then position5? 
      Actually, the pattern is L Y _ A _ -> so position5 is the last? 
      ""LYCRA"" is L Y C R A -> so positions: 
          1:L, 2:Y, 3:C, 4:R, 5:A? 
      But we know A is at position4? So this has A at5? not matching? 

  We must have A at4? So the word must have A at4? 

  So for pattern L Y _ A _ : the fifth letter is not A? 

  Example: ""LYMPA""? not word? 

  ""LYTTA""? T absent? 

  ""LYSOA""? S absent? 

  It's hard? 

Second pattern: L at 1, Y at 3: word: L _ Y A _

Fill position2 and position5? 

Example: ""LARYA""? not word? 
  ""LAPYA""? not? 
  ""LAVYA""? not? 
  ""LACKA""? C and K? but A at4? 
      L A C K A? -> but A at2 and A at5? and we have A at4? so three A? 
      But we don't know if A is repeated? 

  But we know A is at4? So if we have A at2? that would be a different A? 

  However, we have to avoid absent letters? 

  ""LABYA""? B? 
  ""LAGYA""? G? 
  ""LAMYA""? M? 
  ""LARVA"": L A R V A? -> but A at2 and A at5? and we have A at4? 
      So the word would be L A R V A? 
      But then we have A at2,4,5? 
      And we know A is at4? so the A at2 and A at5 would be extra? 

  But is ""LARVA"" a word? Yes? 

  But let's check: 
      Position2: A? but we know A cannot be at2? from guess2? 
      So if we guess ""LARVA"", we would get A at2 as '-'? and A at4 as '✓'? and A at5 as '-'? 

  But we already know A is not at2? So we don't learn new? 

  And we have L at1? which is allowed? and Y? but in this pattern we put Y at3? but in ""LARVA"", position3 is R? not Y? 

  So we need Y at3? 

  So ""LARYA""? not word? 

  ""LAYIA""? but Y at2? not at3? 

  We need Y at3? 

  So: L _ Y A _ 

  For example: ""L O Y A L"" -> but L at5? and we have L at1? so repeated L? 
      ""LOYAL"": L at1, O at2, Y at3, A at4, L at5? 
      This has L at1 and L at5? 
      We know L is present? but we don't know if repeated? 

  And O is new? 

  Also, we have Y at3? 

  And A at4? 

  So ""LOYAL"" is a valid word? 

  And it fits: 
      L at1: we don't know if correct? 
      O at2: new? 
      Y at3: we don't know? 
      A at4: correct? 
      L at5: we don't know? 

  But we have constraints: 
      L must be at1 or5? Here it is at both? 
      And Y must be at2 or3? Here at3? 

  So it fits the constraints? 

  Also, no absent letters? 

  So ""LOYAL"" is a candidate? 

Third pattern: L at5, Y at2: word: _ Y _ A L

Fill position1 and position3? 

Example: ""C Y M A L"" -> ""CYMAL""? not word? 
  ""PYGAL""? P,Y,G,A,L -> positions: 
      1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:A, 5:L? 
      So ""PYGAL"" is a word? 

  But we have Y at2? and L at5? 

  And A at4? 

  So ""PYGAL"" is a candidate? 

  Also, ""RYMAL""? not word? 

  ""HYMAL""? not? 

  ""SYNAL""? S absent? 

  ""BYLAW"": B,Y,L,A,W -> but then positions: 
      1:B, 2:Y, 3:L? but L is at3? but we have L at5? 
      And we are putting L at3? but we also have L at5? 
      But the pattern is _ Y _ A L? so L at5? 
      So in ""BYLAW"", we have L at3? which is not in the pattern? 

  We need the third letter to be not L? 

  So ""PYGAL"" is one? 

Fourth pattern: L at5, Y at3: word: _ _ Y A L

Fill position1 and position2? 

Example: ""B O Y A L"" -> ""BOYAL""? not word? 
  ""COYAL""? not? 
  ""FOYAL""? not? 
  ""GOYAL""? not? 
  ""HOYAL""? not? 
  ""MOYAL""? not? 
  ""ROYAL""? R,O,Y,A,L -> 
      Positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:A, 5:L? 
      So ""ROYAL"" is a word? 

  And it fits: 
      R at1? 
      O at2? 
      Y at3? 
      A at4? 
      L at5? 

  And we have L at5? and Y at3? 

  So ""ROYAL"" is a candidate? 

Now, we have three candidates: 
  Candidate 1: ""LOYAL"" (pattern L at1, Y at3)
  Candidate 2: ""PYGAL"" (pattern L at5, Y at2)
  Candidate 3: ""ROYAL"" (pattern L at5, Y at3)

But note: in ""ROYAL"", L is at5? and Y at3? 

We also have ""PYGAL"" with L at5 and Y at2? 

Now, we need to choose one? 

But note: we have only one more guess? Actually, we have 3 guesses left? But we want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer? 

But let's see what we can learn? 

We know A is fixed at4? 

For L: it must be at1 or5? 
For Y: at2 or3? 

In ""LOYAL"": 
  If we guess ""LOYAL"", then:
    If L is at1 and correct? then we get ✓ for L at1? 
    If L is at5 and correct? then we get ✓ for L at5? 
    But in ""LOYAL"", we have L at1 and L at5? 
    So if the secret word has L only once? then one of them will be ✓ and the other might be '-'? or if both are present? 

But we don't know if L is repeated? 

Similarly, Y at3? 

But we might get lucky and get the word? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests one of the possibilities? 

But we have to include L and Y? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has L at1 and Y at2? but we couldn't find a common word? 

Or we can choose a word that has L at5 and Y at2? like ""PYGAL""? 

But ""PYGAL"" is less common? 

""ROYAL"" is very common? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

If we guess ""LOYAL"": 
  Positions:
    1: L -> if L is at1 in secret? then ✓? else if L is at5? then this L at1 would be '-'? 
    2: O -> new letter? 
    3: Y -> if Y is at3? then ✓? else if Y is at2? then this would be '-'? 
    4: A -> ✓ (we know)
    5: L -> if L is at5? then ✓? else if L is at1? then this would be '-'? 

But note: L cannot be at both? So if L is at1, then the L at5 would be '-'? and vice versa? 

Similarly, for Y: if Y is at3? then ✓? if not? then it must be at2? and we get '-'? 

So we can deduce? 

But we might get the word? 

Similarly, if we guess ""ROYAL"": 
  1: R -> new? 
  2: O -> new? 
  3: Y -> if Y at3? then ✓? 
  4: A -> ✓
  5: L -> if L at5? then ✓? 

And we know L must be at1 or5? and Y at2 or3? 

So if we get:
  If Y at3 is correct? and L at5 is correct? then we win? 
  Otherwise, we get feedback? 

But we have only two possibilities for L and two for Y? 

After this guess, we can deduce? 

But we have more guesses? 

But let's choose ""ROYAL"" because it is a common word? 

But wait: we have to avoid absent letters? 

In ""ROYAL"": R, O, Y, A, L? 
  R and O are new? 

But we don't know if they are present? 

Similarly, in ""LOYAL"": O is new? 

But we have to choose? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses the same pattern but with letters that are more common? 

But ""ROYAL"" is fine? 

But note: we have not tested many letters? 

We can also consider: we know A is at4? and we need to find L and Y? 

But we have two positions for L and two for Y? 

We can also try to guess a word that has L at1 and Y at2? but we couldn't find? 

Another word for pattern 1: L Y _ A _ 
  ""LYCRA"" doesn't fit? 
  ""LYTTA"" not? 
  ""LYSSA""? S absent? 

  ""LYCEE""? E absent? 

  ""LYARD""? 
      L Y A R D? -> but A at3? but we have A at4? 
      So not? 

  ""LYART""? T absent? 

  ""LYASE""? E absent? 

  ""LYTED""? T and E absent? 

So no? 

For pattern 2: L _ Y A _ 
  ""LOYAL"" is one? 

  ""LAVAY""? V? 
  ""LAMYA""? M? 
  ""LABYA""? B? 
  ""LACYA""? C? 

  But not common? 

For pattern 3: _ Y _ A L 
  ""PYGAL"" is one? 
  ""HYMAL""? not? 
  ""CYMAT""? T absent? 
  ""RYBAT""? not? 
  ""WYNDS""? D and S absent? 

For pattern 4: _ _ Y A L 
  ""ROYAL"" is one? 
  ""LOYAL"" is not? because L at1? 
  ""FOYAL""? not? 
  ""GOYAL""? not? 
  ""HOYAL""? not? 
  ""MOYAL""? not? 
  ""NOYAL""? N absent? 
  ""POYAL""? not? 
  ""SOYAL""? S absent? 
  ""TOYAL""? T absent? 
  ""VOYAL""? not? 
  ""WOYAL""? not? 

So the only common words we have are ""LOYAL"" and ""ROYAL"". 

Now, which one to choose? 

In ""LOYAL"", we have L at both 1 and 5? So if the secret word has only one L, then one of them will be marked as absent? But we know L is present? So if the secret word has L only once, then one of the L's in ""LOYAL"" will be in the correct position and the other will be marked as absent? But wait, no: if the secret word has L at1, then the L at1 is ✓ and the L at5 is not in the word? so marked x? but we know L is present? so if we see an x on L at5, that would be a problem? 

Actually, the feedback: 
  If the secret word has L only at position1, then in ""LOYAL"":
    Position1: L -> ✓
    Position5: L -> not in the word? so x? 
  But we know L is present? and we see an x? that would be inconsistent? 

But the secret word has L only at1? so the L at5 is extra? so it is not present? so x is correct? 

But we know from previous feedback that L is present? so if we get an x on L at5, that means that L is not at5? but we already know that? 

But the problem is: if the secret word has L only at1, then we get:
  L at1: ✓
  L at5: x (because there's no L at5 and no extra L? since only one L)

But we know L is present? so the x at5 doesn't mean L is absent? it means that particular L is not in the word? but we have another L at1 that is correct? 

So it's okay? 

Similarly, if the secret word has L only at5, then:
  L at1: not present? so x? 
  L at5: ✓

But we know L is present? so the x at1 is okay? 

If the secret word has L at both 1 and5? then both ✓? 

So it's acceptable? 

But we don't know if L is repeated? 

Similarly for ""ROYAL"": 
  It has L only at5? and Y at3? 

So if we guess ""ROYAL"", then:
  If the secret word is ""ROYAL"", we win? 
  Otherwise, we get feedback? 

But we have two possibilities for L and two for Y? 

We can also consider: we have not used many common letters? 

But let's choose ""ROYAL"" because it is a common word? 

Or ""LOYAL""? 

But note: in ""LOYAL"", we are testing two positions for L? and one for Y? 

In ""ROYAL"", we are testing one position for L (at5) and one for Y (at3)? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think both are valid? 

But let's look at the feedback we got: 

In guess3, we had A at4 correct? 

Now, we can try to guess ""ROYAL"" and see? 

But we have to make a choice? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have L repeated? 

For example, for pattern 3: ""PYGAL"" is not common? 

For pattern 4: ""ROYAL"" is common? 

So I choose ""ROYAL"". 

But let's check if it fits all constraints? 
  A at4: ✓
  L at5: allowed? 
  Y at3: allowed? 
  Letters: R, O, Y, A, L? 
  Absent letters: R and O are not in the absent list? 

So it's valid? 

Therefore, next guess: ""ROYAL""

But note: we have to consider that Y might be at2? and L might be at1? 

But if we guess ""ROYAL"", and the secret is not that? we get feedback? 

We have more guesses? 

So let's do it? 

<guess>royal</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (slate)**:  
  - S, T, E absent (x)  
  - L and A present but wrong positions (-) → L ≠ pos2, A ≠ pos3  
- **Guess 2 (daily)**:  
  - D, I absent (x)  
  - A, L, Y present but wrong positions (-) → A ≠ pos2, L ≠ pos4, Y ≠ pos5  
- **Guess 3 (yulan)**:  
  - U, N absent (x)  
  - Y and L present but wrong positions (-) → Y ≠ pos1, L ≠ pos3  
  - A correct (✓) at position 4  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **A** is **correctly placed at position 4**.  
   - **L** and **Y** are present but constrained:  
     - L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → must be in **position 1 or 5**.  
     - Y cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → must be in **position 2 or 3**.  
2. **Absent Letters**: S, T, E, D, I, U, N (excluded from guesses).  
3. **Word Structure**: `_ _ _ A _`  
   - Position 4 is fixed as **A**.  
   - Positions 1 and 5: One must contain **L** (if not repeated).  
   - Positions 2 or 3: One must contain **Y**.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test critical positions** for L (1 or 5) and Y (2 or 3) while introducing new letters.  
- **""ROYAL"" fits perfectly**:  
  - R (new) at position 1 → tests if L is at position 1 (if not, R is new data).  
  - O (new) at position 2 → tests if Y is at position 2.  
  - Y at position 3 → tests Y in position 3 (if correct, ✓; if not, Y must be at position 2).  
  - A at position 4 (✓ confirmed).  
  - L at position 5 → tests L in position 5 (if correct, ✓; if not, L must be at position 1).  
- Uses common letters (R, O) to maximize information if incorrect.",Guess 4: royal -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) Y(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
