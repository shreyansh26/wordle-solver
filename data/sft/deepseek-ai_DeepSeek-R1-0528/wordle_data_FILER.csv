We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - N: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.
 - The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"".

 Positions in ""CRANE"":
   C: position 1
   R: position 2
   A: position 3
   N: position 4
   E: position 5

 Therefore:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 Also, since A, C, N are absent, we can avoid words containing these letters.

 We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N.
   - Contains R and E.
   - Places R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Moreover, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Considering the absence of A, C, N and the presence of R and E, let's think of words.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many new common letters as possible, while ensuring R and E are included and in acceptable positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try placing R and E in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 5, that might be acceptable since the feedback only said R wasn't at position 2. Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we are not restricted on other positions, so we could have R at 1,3,4,5 and E at 1,2,3,4.

 Let's list some words that have R and E, and no A, C, N.

 Some candidates:
 - ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because of previous feedback? Wait, in ""CRANE"", R was at position 2 and that was wrong, so in the new word, we must avoid R at position 2.

 ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but we cannot have R at position 2. So skip.

 - ""ROUTE"": R at 1, O, U, T, E at 5 -> E at position 5 is not allowed? Because in ""CRANE"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. So we cannot have E at position 5. Therefore, ""ROUTE"" would have E at position 5 -> invalid for E position.

 - ""RIDER"": R at 1, I, D, E at 4, R at 5 -> has E at position 4? Then E is not at 5. And R at 1: which is a new position. But note: the word has two R's? That's acceptable if the secret word has two R's. However, our feedback only indicated one R? Wait, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed one R and one E. But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

 However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed:
   R: in the word but wrong position (only one R was present and it was at position 2). If the word had two R's, then one of them might have been in the right position? But in ""CRANE"" we only had one R. So the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates because we only provided one R. The secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

 Since the feedback only marked one R as present (with wrong position), it's possible the secret word has at least one R. Similarly for E.

 So when guessing, we can use words with duplicate letters if needed, but to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now to check more letters.

 Let's avoid duplicates for this guess.

 Try words with letters: R, E, and three new letters.

 Words:
 - ""RIPER""? Duplicate R -> avoid.
 - ""POLER""? P, O, L, E, R -> but E at position 4? and R at 5? Then E is not at 5? Wait: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> E at 4, R at 5. And R at 5: we don't know if that's acceptable because previous feedback only forbade R at position 2. So R at 5 is new. Also E at 4: not position 5, so okay. But the word ""POLER"" is not very common? Maybe not.

 Looking for common words:
 - ""ROBES"": R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S -> E at position 4 is acceptable (not 5). R at position 1 (new). Letters: R, O, B, E, S -> all new except R and E, and no A, C, N.

 ""ROBES"": 
   Position 1: R -> hasn't been tried at position 1? We haven't tested position 1 because our first guess had C at position 1 and it was absent. But that doesn't mean R cannot be at position 1. Actually, we know the secret word contains R, but not at position 2. Position 1 is a candidate.

 - ""RODEO""? But that has O at the end? Wait, 5 letters? Yes, R-O-D-E-O -> but that has two O's? Not ideal for information. Also, E at position 4? Then O at 5? But we don't have information about O.

 Alternatively: ""SERVE""? S, E, R, V, E -> duplicate E? Avoid.

 ""TIMER"": T, I, M, E, R -> E at position 4? and R at position 5. So E is at 4 (not 5) and R at 5 (not 2). Letters: T, I, M, E, R -> all new? Yes, and no duplicates.

 ""TIMER"": 
   T at 1, I at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if M is in the word? We'll get information.

 Another common word: ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at position 3, E at position 4. Let's check positions:
   Position 1: T (new)
   Position 2: I (new)
   Position 3: R -> we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 3? It's a new position, so okay.
   Position 4: E -> not position 5, okay.
   Position 5: D (new)

 Also, ""TIRED"" has distinct letters and avoids A,C,N.

 Which one is better? ""TIMER"" or ""TIRED""?

 Both have T, I, and then either M or D. Both are good.

 Alternatively, let's think: we want to cover more common letters? S is a very common letter that we haven't tested.

 Consider ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> 
   Position 1: R (okay, not position 2)
   Position 2: O (new)
   Position 3: U (new)
   Position 4: S (new)
   Position 5: E -> but E at position 5 is forbidden! Because previous feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at position 5 in any guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position for E. However, if we put E at 5, we expect it to be marked as '-' again? But we want to avoid known wrong positions to potentially find a right position.

 So it's better not to put E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is invalid because it has E at position 5.

 What about ""RISKY""? But E is required? We must use E because we know it's in the word.

 How about ""RIDER""? We decided to avoid duplicates, but let's see: R at 1 and another R at 4? Then E would be missing. We must include E.

 So, back to:

 Option 1: ""TIMER"" -> T,I,M,E,R -> E at 4 and R at 5: both in new positions.
 Option 2: ""TIRED"" -> T,I,R,E,D -> R at 3 and E at 4: both in new positions.

 Which letters are more common? 
   T: very common, I: common, M: less common than D? D is more common? 
   Actually, we don't know, but D and M are both worth testing.

 However, note that we also have E to test in a new position (currently at 4 in both). 

 Another option: ""BREED""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> 
   Position 1: D (new), 
   Position 2: R -> we cannot have R at position 2? So forbidden? Yes, because previous feedback said R is not at position 2.

 So we cannot use any word with R at position 2.

 Similarly, in ""TIRED"", R is at position 3 -> okay.
 In ""TIMER"", R is at position 5 -> okay.

 Another idea: ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D -> 
   Position 3: R -> okay? 
   Position 4: E -> okay? 
   But has S and H which are common.

 However, ""SHRED"" has R at position 3 and E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has S, H, R, E, D.

 We are free to choose. I think ""SHRED"" is a good word? Let me check: common, distinct letters.

 But wait: we haven't tested S or H? So yes, that would be good.

 However, compare to ""TIRED"": 
   ""TIRED"": T (new), I (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> we test T, I, D and confirm R and E are still present but in new positions.
   ""SHRED"": S (new), H (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> tests S, H, D.

 D is common, but S and H are also common.

 Another candidate: ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   Position 1: P? 
   Position 2: E -> This is a new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at position 2. That's acceptable? Yes, because E cannot be at 5 only. Position 2 might be correct? 
   Position 3: R -> acceptable? Yes.

 But note: in ""PERKY"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3. However, we must avoid R at position 2, but E at position 2 is new.

 Letters: P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct? Yes.

 So ""PERKY"" is also acceptable and tests P, K, Y.

 Now, what's the best? We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, L, N (but N is out), D, M, etc. Since we haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words (without A,C,N):

 We can try:

 - Words with S, T, or L.

 ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: T? 
   Position 3: O? 
   Position 4: R? -> But R: we know R is in the word, but can we put it at position 4? That's acceptable. 
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? E at position 5 is not allowed. So no.

 ""STARE"": but A is forbidden? A is in ""STARE"", which is not allowed because we know A is absent? But we must use words without A? That's right, the word we guess must not contain letters we know are absent to avoid wasting a guess? Actually, we can guess words with absent letters? But that would be inefficient because we'll get 'x' and learn nothing new? Therefore, it's better to avoid known absent letters (A, C, N).

 So we avoid words with A, C, N.

 Replace ""STARE"" with ""STORE"": but E at 5 -> invalid.

 ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 ""STONE"": contains N -> skip.

 ""SLATE"": contains A -> skip.

 Another idea: ""DRIVE"": but R at position 2 -> forbidden.

 ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> 
   Positions: D at1, R at2? -> no, R at2 forbidden.

 How about ""RIFLE"": R at1, I, F, L, E -> 
   Position 1: R -> okay
   Position 2: I -> not R, okay
   Position 3: F
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? Yes, cannot have E at position 5. So skip.

 Then, let's consider words that end with a letter other than E? So E must be at positions 1-4.

 We can try:

 - ""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at5 -> skip.
 - ""RUDER"": R at1, U, D, E at4, R at5 -> duplicate R? Skip.

 How about ""RESIN"": but has N -> skip.

 ""REBUS"": R at1, E at2, B, U, S -> 
   Position 2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? And R at position 1: acceptable? 
   Because R was previously only excluded from position 2? Position 1 is new.

 Also, the word ""REBUS"" exists? Yes.

 But note: we must check that it doesn't contain A,C,N? It has R,E,B,U,S -> no forbidden letters.

 Positions:
   R: position 1 -> new position? Previously in ""CRANE"" R was at 2, so position 1 is open.
   E: position 2 -> we haven't tried E at this position? And we know E is not at position 5, but position 2? Could be correct? We don't know.

 However, we are testing E at a new position (position 2) which is good.

 Letters: R (known), E (known), B (new), U (new), S (new).

 That gives us three new letters: B, U, S.

 This is a good option.

 But let's see another word: ""RESET""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""REIGN"": but G and N? N is forbidden -> skip.

 ""RISEN"": contains N -> skip.

 After considering several words, I found:
   ""REBUS"": R,E,B,U,S -> positions: (1)R, (2)E, (3)B, (4)U, (5)S -> E is at position 2? That's acceptable? But wait: E is at position 2, which is a new position? And we avoid E at position 5.

 But how about the R at position 1? We don't know if that's correct? It might be.

 However, note that we are allowed to have E at position 2? There's no restriction from previous feedback? We only know that E is not at position 5.

 So ""REBUS"" seems valid.

 But compare to ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> positions: R at3, E at4.

 Which one tests more common letters? 
   ""REBUS"" tests: B,U,S (and R,E)
   ""TIRED"" tests: T,I,D (and R,E)

 Common letters: Among the new letters in ""REBUS"": S is very common, B and U less so? 
 In ""TIRED"": T and I are very common, D moderately common.

 Another word: ""LOWER"": L,O,W,E,R -> 
   Positions: L1, O2, W3, E4, R5 -> 
     E at4? okay (not 5). R at5? new position? okay? 
   Letters: L,O,W,E,R -> distinct, and avoids forbidden.

 Tests L, O, W.

 But L, O, W are not as common as S and T? 

 Considering the frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... but A,C,N are already out, so next are O, I, S.

 We haven't tested T, I, O, S, L, etc.

 The word ""TIRED"" has T and I, which are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SERVE"" has duplicate E -> skip.

 ""PIECE""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 Another word: ""QUEST"": Q is rare? Not ideal.

 After consideration, I think both ""REBUS"" and ""TIRED"" are good. Let me choose ""TIRED"" because T and I are more common than B and U? And we test D.

 Also, in ""CRANE"", E was at the end and now we're trying E at a different position? Position 4? That's good.

 So let's go with ""TIRED"".

 Summary: 
   We are guessing ""TIRED"".

<guess>tired</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌ R❓ A❌ N❌ E❓), we know:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.
- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent.
- The new guess must include **R** and **E**, avoid **A/C/N**, and prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) while placing R and E in unverified positions.

I chose **""tired""** because:
- Positions: R is at position 3 (new, avoiding position 2) and E is at position 4 (new, avoiding position 5).
- Letters: Tests new common consonants (**T, I, D**) while confirming **R** and **E** presence.
- Efficiency: Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.

<guess>tired</guess>",tired,"We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - N: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.
 - The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"".

 Positions in ""CRANE"":
   C: position 1
   R: position 2
   A: position 3
   N: position 4
   E: position 5

 Therefore:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 Also, since A, C, N are absent, we can avoid words containing these letters.

 We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N.
   - Contains R and E.
   - Places R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Moreover, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Considering the absence of A, C, N and the presence of R and E, let's think of words.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many new common letters as possible, while ensuring R and E are included and in acceptable positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try placing R and E in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 5, that might be acceptable since the feedback only said R wasn't at position 2. Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we are not restricted on other positions, so we could have R at 1,3,4,5 and E at 1,2,3,4.

 Let's list some words that have R and E, and no A, C, N.

 Some candidates:
 - ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because of previous feedback? Wait, in ""CRANE"", R was at position 2 and that was wrong, so in the new word, we must avoid R at position 2.

 ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but we cannot have R at position 2. So skip.

 - ""ROUTE"": R at 1, O, U, T, E at 5 -> E at position 5 is not allowed? Because in ""CRANE"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. So we cannot have E at position 5. Therefore, ""ROUTE"" would have E at position 5 -> invalid for E position.

 - ""RIDER"": R at 1, I, D, E at 4, R at 5 -> has E at position 4? Then E is not at 5. And R at 1: which is a new position. But note: the word has two R's? That's acceptable if the secret word has two R's. However, our feedback only indicated one R? Wait, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed one R and one E. But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

 However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed:
   R: in the word but wrong position (only one R was present and it was at position 2). If the word had two R's, then one of them might have been in the right position? But in ""CRANE"" we only had one R. So the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates because we only provided one R. The secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

 Since the feedback only marked one R as present (with wrong position), it's possible the secret word has at least one R. Similarly for E.

 So when guessing, we can use words with duplicate letters if needed, but to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now to check more letters.

 Let's avoid duplicates for this guess.

 Try words with letters: R, E, and three new letters.

 Words:
 - ""RIPER""? Duplicate R -> avoid.
 - ""POLER""? P, O, L, E, R -> but E at position 4? and R at 5? Then E is not at 5? Wait: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> E at 4, R at 5. And R at 5: we don't know if that's acceptable because previous feedback only forbade R at position 2. So R at 5 is new. Also E at 4: not position 5, so okay. But the word ""POLER"" is not very common? Maybe not.

 Looking for common words:
 - ""ROBES"": R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S -> E at position 4 is acceptable (not 5). R at position 1 (new). Letters: R, O, B, E, S -> all new except R and E, and no A, C, N.

 ""ROBES"": 
   Position 1: R -> hasn't been tried at position 1? We haven't tested position 1 because our first guess had C at position 1 and it was absent. But that doesn't mean R cannot be at position 1. Actually, we know the secret word contains R, but not at position 2. Position 1 is a candidate.

 - ""RODEO""? But that has O at the end? Wait, 5 letters? Yes, R-O-D-E-O -> but that has two O's? Not ideal for information. Also, E at position 4? Then O at 5? But we don't have information about O.

 Alternatively: ""SERVE""? S, E, R, V, E -> duplicate E? Avoid.

 ""TIMER"": T, I, M, E, R -> E at position 4? and R at position 5. So E is at 4 (not 5) and R at 5 (not 2). Letters: T, I, M, E, R -> all new? Yes, and no duplicates.

 ""TIMER"": 
   T at 1, I at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if M is in the word? We'll get information.

 Another common word: ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at position 3, E at position 4. Let's check positions:
   Position 1: T (new)
   Position 2: I (new)
   Position 3: R -> we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 3? It's a new position, so okay.
   Position 4: E -> not position 5, okay.
   Position 5: D (new)

 Also, ""TIRED"" has distinct letters and avoids A,C,N.

 Which one is better? ""TIMER"" or ""TIRED""?

 Both have T, I, and then either M or D. Both are good.

 Alternatively, let's think: we want to cover more common letters? S is a very common letter that we haven't tested.

 Consider ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> 
   Position 1: R (okay, not position 2)
   Position 2: O (new)
   Position 3: U (new)
   Position 4: S (new)
   Position 5: E -> but E at position 5 is forbidden! Because previous feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at position 5 in any guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position for E. However, if we put E at 5, we expect it to be marked as '-' again? But we want to avoid known wrong positions to potentially find a right position.

 So it's better not to put E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is invalid because it has E at position 5.

 What about ""RISKY""? But E is required? We must use E because we know it's in the word.

 How about ""RIDER""? We decided to avoid duplicates, but let's see: R at 1 and another R at 4? Then E would be missing. We must include E.

 So, back to:

 Option 1: ""TIMER"" -> T,I,M,E,R -> E at 4 and R at 5: both in new positions.
 Option 2: ""TIRED"" -> T,I,R,E,D -> R at 3 and E at 4: both in new positions.

 Which letters are more common? 
   T: very common, I: common, M: less common than D? D is more common? 
   Actually, we don't know, but D and M are both worth testing.

 However, note that we also have E to test in a new position (currently at 4 in both). 

 Another option: ""BREED""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> 
   Position 1: D (new), 
   Position 2: R -> we cannot have R at position 2? So forbidden? Yes, because previous feedback said R is not at position 2.

 So we cannot use any word with R at position 2.

 Similarly, in ""TIRED"", R is at position 3 -> okay.
 In ""TIMER"", R is at position 5 -> okay.

 Another idea: ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D -> 
   Position 3: R -> okay? 
   Position 4: E -> okay? 
   But has S and H which are common.

 However, ""SHRED"" has R at position 3 and E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has S, H, R, E, D.

 We are free to choose. I think ""SHRED"" is a good word? Let me check: common, distinct letters.

 But wait: we haven't tested S or H? So yes, that would be good.

 However, compare to ""TIRED"": 
   ""TIRED"": T (new), I (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> we test T, I, D and confirm R and E are still present but in new positions.
   ""SHRED"": S (new), H (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> tests S, H, D.

 D is common, but S and H are also common.

 Another candidate: ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   Position 1: P? 
   Position 2: E -> This is a new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at position 2. That's acceptable? Yes, because E cannot be at 5 only. Position 2 might be correct? 
   Position 3: R -> acceptable? Yes.

 But note: in ""PERKY"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3. However, we must avoid R at position 2, but E at position 2 is new.

 Letters: P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct? Yes.

 So ""PERKY"" is also acceptable and tests P, K, Y.

 Now, what's the best? We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, L, N (but N is out), D, M, etc. Since we haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words (without A,C,N):

 We can try:

 - Words with S, T, or L.

 ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: T? 
   Position 3: O? 
   Position 4: R? -> But R: we know R is in the word, but can we put it at position 4? That's acceptable. 
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? E at position 5 is not allowed. So no.

 ""STARE"": but A is forbidden? A is in ""STARE"", which is not allowed because we know A is absent? But we must use words without A? That's right, the word we guess must not contain letters we know are absent to avoid wasting a guess? Actually, we can guess words with absent letters? But that would be inefficient because we'll get 'x' and learn nothing new? Therefore, it's better to avoid known absent letters (A, C, N).

 So we avoid words with A, C, N.

 Replace ""STARE"" with ""STORE"": but E at 5 -> invalid.

 ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 ""STONE"": contains N -> skip.

 ""SLATE"": contains A -> skip.

 Another idea: ""DRIVE"": but R at position 2 -> forbidden.

 ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> 
   Positions: D at1, R at2? -> no, R at2 forbidden.

 How about ""RIFLE"": R at1, I, F, L, E -> 
   Position 1: R -> okay
   Position 2: I -> not R, okay
   Position 3: F
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? Yes, cannot have E at position 5. So skip.

 Then, let's consider words that end with a letter other than E? So E must be at positions 1-4.

 We can try:

 - ""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at5 -> skip.
 - ""RUDER"": R at1, U, D, E at4, R at5 -> duplicate R? Skip.

 How about ""RESIN"": but has N -> skip.

 ""REBUS"": R at1, E at2, B, U, S -> 
   Position 2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? And R at position 1: acceptable? 
   Because R was previously only excluded from position 2? Position 1 is new.

 Also, the word ""REBUS"" exists? Yes.

 But note: we must check that it doesn't contain A,C,N? It has R,E,B,U,S -> no forbidden letters.

 Positions:
   R: position 1 -> new position? Previously in ""CRANE"" R was at 2, so position 1 is open.
   E: position 2 -> we haven't tried E at this position? And we know E is not at position 5, but position 2? Could be correct? We don't know.

 However, we are testing E at a new position (position 2) which is good.

 Letters: R (known), E (known), B (new), U (new), S (new).

 That gives us three new letters: B, U, S.

 This is a good option.

 But let's see another word: ""RESET""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""REIGN"": but G and N? N is forbidden -> skip.

 ""RISEN"": contains N -> skip.

 After considering several words, I found:
   ""REBUS"": R,E,B,U,S -> positions: (1)R, (2)E, (3)B, (4)U, (5)S -> E is at position 2? That's acceptable? But wait: E is at position 2, which is a new position? And we avoid E at position 5.

 But how about the R at position 1? We don't know if that's correct? It might be.

 However, note that we are allowed to have E at position 2? There's no restriction from previous feedback? We only know that E is not at position 5.

 So ""REBUS"" seems valid.

 But compare to ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> positions: R at3, E at4.

 Which one tests more common letters? 
   ""REBUS"" tests: B,U,S (and R,E)
   ""TIRED"" tests: T,I,D (and R,E)

 Common letters: Among the new letters in ""REBUS"": S is very common, B and U less so? 
 In ""TIRED"": T and I are very common, D moderately common.

 Another word: ""LOWER"": L,O,W,E,R -> 
   Positions: L1, O2, W3, E4, R5 -> 
     E at4? okay (not 5). R at5? new position? okay? 
   Letters: L,O,W,E,R -> distinct, and avoids forbidden.

 Tests L, O, W.

 But L, O, W are not as common as S and T? 

 Considering the frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... but A,C,N are already out, so next are O, I, S.

 We haven't tested T, I, O, S, L, etc.

 The word ""TIRED"" has T and I, which are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SERVE"" has duplicate E -> skip.

 ""PIECE""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 Another word: ""QUEST"": Q is rare? Not ideal.

 After consideration, I think both ""REBUS"" and ""TIRED"" are good. Let me choose ""TIRED"" because T and I are more common than B and U? And we test D.

 Also, in ""CRANE"", E was at the end and now we're trying E at a different position? Position 4? That's good.

 So let's go with ""TIRED"".

 Summary: 
   We are guessing ""TIRED"".

<guess>tired</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌ R❓ A❌ N❌ E❓), we know:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.
- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent.
- The new guess must include **R** and **E**, avoid **A/C/N**, and prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) while placing R and E in unverified positions.

I chose **""tired""** because:
- Positions: R is at position 3 (new, avoiding position 2) and E is at position 4 (new, avoiding position 5).
- Letters: Tests new common consonants (**T, I, D**) while confirming **R** and **E** presence.
- Efficiency: Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.",Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FILER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - N: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.
 - The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"".

 Positions in ""CRANE"":
   C: position 1
   R: position 2
   A: position 3
   N: position 4
   E: position 5

 Therefore:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 Also, since A, C, N are absent, we can avoid words containing these letters.

 We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N.
   - Contains R and E.
   - Places R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Moreover, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Considering the absence of A, C, N and the presence of R and E, let's think of words.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many new common letters as possible, while ensuring R and E are included and in acceptable positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try placing R and E in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 5, that might be acceptable since the feedback only said R wasn't at position 2. Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we are not restricted on other positions, so we could have R at 1,3,4,5 and E at 1,2,3,4.

 Let's list some words that have R and E, and no A, C, N.

 Some candidates:
 - ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because of previous feedback? Wait, in ""CRANE"", R was at position 2 and that was wrong, so in the new word, we must avoid R at position 2.

 ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but we cannot have R at position 2. So skip.

 - ""ROUTE"": R at 1, O, U, T, E at 5 -> E at position 5 is not allowed? Because in ""CRANE"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. So we cannot have E at position 5. Therefore, ""ROUTE"" would have E at position 5 -> invalid for E position.

 - ""RIDER"": R at 1, I, D, E at 4, R at 5 -> has E at position 4? Then E is not at 5. And R at 1: which is a new position. But note: the word has two R's? That's acceptable if the secret word has two R's. However, our feedback only indicated one R? Wait, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed one R and one E. But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

 However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed:
   R: in the word but wrong position (only one R was present and it was at position 2). If the word had two R's, then one of them might have been in the right position? But in ""CRANE"" we only had one R. So the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates because we only provided one R. The secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

 Since the feedback only marked one R as present (with wrong position), it's possible the secret word has at least one R. Similarly for E.

 So when guessing, we can use words with duplicate letters if needed, but to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now to check more letters.

 Let's avoid duplicates for this guess.

 Try words with letters: R, E, and three new letters.

 Words:
 - ""RIPER""? Duplicate R -> avoid.
 - ""POLER""? P, O, L, E, R -> but E at position 4? and R at 5? Then E is not at 5? Wait: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> E at 4, R at 5. And R at 5: we don't know if that's acceptable because previous feedback only forbade R at position 2. So R at 5 is new. Also E at 4: not position 5, so okay. But the word ""POLER"" is not very common? Maybe not.

 Looking for common words:
 - ""ROBES"": R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S -> E at position 4 is acceptable (not 5). R at position 1 (new). Letters: R, O, B, E, S -> all new except R and E, and no A, C, N.

 ""ROBES"": 
   Position 1: R -> hasn't been tried at position 1? We haven't tested position 1 because our first guess had C at position 1 and it was absent. But that doesn't mean R cannot be at position 1. Actually, we know the secret word contains R, but not at position 2. Position 1 is a candidate.

 - ""RODEO""? But that has O at the end? Wait, 5 letters? Yes, R-O-D-E-O -> but that has two O's? Not ideal for information. Also, E at position 4? Then O at 5? But we don't have information about O.

 Alternatively: ""SERVE""? S, E, R, V, E -> duplicate E? Avoid.

 ""TIMER"": T, I, M, E, R -> E at position 4? and R at position 5. So E is at 4 (not 5) and R at 5 (not 2). Letters: T, I, M, E, R -> all new? Yes, and no duplicates.

 ""TIMER"": 
   T at 1, I at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if M is in the word? We'll get information.

 Another common word: ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at position 3, E at position 4. Let's check positions:
   Position 1: T (new)
   Position 2: I (new)
   Position 3: R -> we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 3? It's a new position, so okay.
   Position 4: E -> not position 5, okay.
   Position 5: D (new)

 Also, ""TIRED"" has distinct letters and avoids A,C,N.

 Which one is better? ""TIMER"" or ""TIRED""?

 Both have T, I, and then either M or D. Both are good.

 Alternatively, let's think: we want to cover more common letters? S is a very common letter that we haven't tested.

 Consider ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> 
   Position 1: R (okay, not position 2)
   Position 2: O (new)
   Position 3: U (new)
   Position 4: S (new)
   Position 5: E -> but E at position 5 is forbidden! Because previous feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at position 5 in any guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position for E. However, if we put E at 5, we expect it to be marked as '-' again? But we want to avoid known wrong positions to potentially find a right position.

 So it's better not to put E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is invalid because it has E at position 5.

 What about ""RISKY""? But E is required? We must use E because we know it's in the word.

 How about ""RIDER""? We decided to avoid duplicates, but let's see: R at 1 and another R at 4? Then E would be missing. We must include E.

 So, back to:

 Option 1: ""TIMER"" -> T,I,M,E,R -> E at 4 and R at 5: both in new positions.
 Option 2: ""TIRED"" -> T,I,R,E,D -> R at 3 and E at 4: both in new positions.

 Which letters are more common? 
   T: very common, I: common, M: less common than D? D is more common? 
   Actually, we don't know, but D and M are both worth testing.

 However, note that we also have E to test in a new position (currently at 4 in both). 

 Another option: ""BREED""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> 
   Position 1: D (new), 
   Position 2: R -> we cannot have R at position 2? So forbidden? Yes, because previous feedback said R is not at position 2.

 So we cannot use any word with R at position 2.

 Similarly, in ""TIRED"", R is at position 3 -> okay.
 In ""TIMER"", R is at position 5 -> okay.

 Another idea: ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D -> 
   Position 3: R -> okay? 
   Position 4: E -> okay? 
   But has S and H which are common.

 However, ""SHRED"" has R at position 3 and E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has S, H, R, E, D.

 We are free to choose. I think ""SHRED"" is a good word? Let me check: common, distinct letters.

 But wait: we haven't tested S or H? So yes, that would be good.

 However, compare to ""TIRED"": 
   ""TIRED"": T (new), I (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> we test T, I, D and confirm R and E are still present but in new positions.
   ""SHRED"": S (new), H (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> tests S, H, D.

 D is common, but S and H are also common.

 Another candidate: ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   Position 1: P? 
   Position 2: E -> This is a new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at position 2. That's acceptable? Yes, because E cannot be at 5 only. Position 2 might be correct? 
   Position 3: R -> acceptable? Yes.

 But note: in ""PERKY"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3. However, we must avoid R at position 2, but E at position 2 is new.

 Letters: P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct? Yes.

 So ""PERKY"" is also acceptable and tests P, K, Y.

 Now, what's the best? We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, L, N (but N is out), D, M, etc. Since we haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words (without A,C,N):

 We can try:

 - Words with S, T, or L.

 ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: T? 
   Position 3: O? 
   Position 4: R? -> But R: we know R is in the word, but can we put it at position 4? That's acceptable. 
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? E at position 5 is not allowed. So no.

 ""STARE"": but A is forbidden? A is in ""STARE"", which is not allowed because we know A is absent? But we must use words without A? That's right, the word we guess must not contain letters we know are absent to avoid wasting a guess? Actually, we can guess words with absent letters? But that would be inefficient because we'll get 'x' and learn nothing new? Therefore, it's better to avoid known absent letters (A, C, N).

 So we avoid words with A, C, N.

 Replace ""STARE"" with ""STORE"": but E at 5 -> invalid.

 ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 ""STONE"": contains N -> skip.

 ""SLATE"": contains A -> skip.

 Another idea: ""DRIVE"": but R at position 2 -> forbidden.

 ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> 
   Positions: D at1, R at2? -> no, R at2 forbidden.

 How about ""RIFLE"": R at1, I, F, L, E -> 
   Position 1: R -> okay
   Position 2: I -> not R, okay
   Position 3: F
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? Yes, cannot have E at position 5. So skip.

 Then, let's consider words that end with a letter other than E? So E must be at positions 1-4.

 We can try:

 - ""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at5 -> skip.
 - ""RUDER"": R at1, U, D, E at4, R at5 -> duplicate R? Skip.

 How about ""RESIN"": but has N -> skip.

 ""REBUS"": R at1, E at2, B, U, S -> 
   Position 2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? And R at position 1: acceptable? 
   Because R was previously only excluded from position 2? Position 1 is new.

 Also, the word ""REBUS"" exists? Yes.

 But note: we must check that it doesn't contain A,C,N? It has R,E,B,U,S -> no forbidden letters.

 Positions:
   R: position 1 -> new position? Previously in ""CRANE"" R was at 2, so position 1 is open.
   E: position 2 -> we haven't tried E at this position? And we know E is not at position 5, but position 2? Could be correct? We don't know.

 However, we are testing E at a new position (position 2) which is good.

 Letters: R (known), E (known), B (new), U (new), S (new).

 That gives us three new letters: B, U, S.

 This is a good option.

 But let's see another word: ""RESET""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""REIGN"": but G and N? N is forbidden -> skip.

 ""RISEN"": contains N -> skip.

 After considering several words, I found:
   ""REBUS"": R,E,B,U,S -> positions: (1)R, (2)E, (3)B, (4)U, (5)S -> E is at position 2? That's acceptable? But wait: E is at position 2, which is a new position? And we avoid E at position 5.

 But how about the R at position 1? We don't know if that's correct? It might be.

 However, note that we are allowed to have E at position 2? There's no restriction from previous feedback? We only know that E is not at position 5.

 So ""REBUS"" seems valid.

 But compare to ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> positions: R at3, E at4.

 Which one tests more common letters? 
   ""REBUS"" tests: B,U,S (and R,E)
   ""TIRED"" tests: T,I,D (and R,E)

 Common letters: Among the new letters in ""REBUS"": S is very common, B and U less so? 
 In ""TIRED"": T and I are very common, D moderately common.

 Another word: ""LOWER"": L,O,W,E,R -> 
   Positions: L1, O2, W3, E4, R5 -> 
     E at4? okay (not 5). R at5? new position? okay? 
   Letters: L,O,W,E,R -> distinct, and avoids forbidden.

 Tests L, O, W.

 But L, O, W are not as common as S and T? 

 Considering the frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... but A,C,N are already out, so next are O, I, S.

 We haven't tested T, I, O, S, L, etc.

 The word ""TIRED"" has T and I, which are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SERVE"" has duplicate E -> skip.

 ""PIECE""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 Another word: ""QUEST"": Q is rare? Not ideal.

 After consideration, I think both ""REBUS"" and ""TIRED"" are good. Let me choose ""TIRED"" because T and I are more common than B and U? And we test D.

 Also, in ""CRANE"", E was at the end and now we're trying E at a different position? Position 4? That's good.

 So let's go with ""TIRED"".

 Summary: 
   We are guessing ""TIRED"".

<guess>tired</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌ R❓ A❌ N❌ E❓), we know:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.
- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent.
- The new guess must include **R** and **E**, avoid **A/C/N**, and prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) while placing R and E in unverified positions.

I chose **""tired""** because:
- Positions: R is at position 3 (new, avoiding position 2) and E is at position 4 (new, avoiding position 5).
- Letters: Tests new common consonants (**T, I, D**) while confirming **R** and **E** presence.
- Efficiency: Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.

But note: if we put R at position 5, that might be acceptable since the feedback only said R wasn\'t at position 2. Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, we are not restricted on other positions, so we could have R at 1,3,4,5 and E at 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let\'s list some words that have R and E, and no A, C, N.\n\n Some candidates:\n - ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because of previous feedback? Wait, in ""CRANE"", R was at position 2 and that was wrong, so in the new word, we must avoid R at position 2.\n\n ""TRIBE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2 -> but we cannot have R at position 2. So skip.\n\n - ""ROUTE"": R at 1, O, U, T, E at 5 -> E at position 5 is not allowed? Because in ""CRANE"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. So we cannot have E at position 5. Therefore, ""ROUTE"" would have E at position 5 -> invalid for E position.\n\n - ""RIDER"": R at 1, I, D, E at 4, R at 5 -> has E at position 4? Then E is not at 5. And R at 1: which is a new position. But note: the word has two R\'s? That\'s acceptable if the secret word has two R\'s. However, our feedback only indicated one R? Wait, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed one R and one E. But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don\'t know.\n\n However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed:\n   R: in the word but wrong position (only one R was present and it was at position 2). If the word had two R\'s, then one of them might have been in the right position? But in ""CRANE"" we only had one R. So the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates because we only provided one R. The secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Since the feedback only marked one R as present (with wrong position), it\'s possible the secret word has at least one R. Similarly for E.\n\n So when guessing, we can use words with duplicate letters if needed, but to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now to check more letters.\n\n Let\'s avoid duplicates for this guess.\n\n Try words with letters: R, E, and three new letters.\n\n Words:\n - ""RIPER""? Duplicate R -> avoid.\n - ""POLER""? P, O, L, E, R -> but E at position 4? and R at 5? Then E is not at 5? Wait: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> E at 4, R at 5. And R at 5: we don\'t know if that\'s acceptable because previous feedback only forbade R at position 2. So R at 5 is new. Also E at 4: not position 5, so okay. But the word ""POLER"" is not very common? Maybe not.\n\n Looking for common words:\n - ""ROBES"": R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S -> E at position 4 is acceptable (not 5). R at position 1 (new). Letters: R, O, B, E, S -> all new except R and E, and no A, C, N.\n\n ""ROBES"": \n   Position 1: R -> hasn\'t been tried at position 1? We haven\'t tested position 1 because our first guess had C at position 1 and it was absent. But that doesn\'t mean R cannot be at position 1. Actually, we know the secret word contains R, but not at position 2. Position 1 is a candidate.\n\n - ""RODEO""? But that has O at the end? Wait, 5 letters? Yes, R-O-D-E-O -> but that has two O\'s? Not ideal for information. Also, E at position 4? Then O at 5? But we don\'t have information about O.\n\n Alternatively: ""SERVE""? S, E, R, V, E -> duplicate E? Avoid.\n\n ""TIMER"": T, I, M, E, R -> E at position 4? and R at position 5. So E is at 4 (not 5) and R at 5 (not 2). Letters: T, I, M, E, R -> all new? Yes, and no duplicates.\n\n ""TIMER"": \n   T at 1, I at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if M is in the word? We\'ll get information.\n\n Another common word: ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at position 3, E at position 4. Let\'s check positions:\n   Position 1: T (new)\n   Position 2: I (new)\n   Position 3: R -> we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 3? It\'s a new position, so okay.\n   Position 4: E -> not position 5, okay.\n   Position 5: D (new)\n\n Also, ""TIRED"" has distinct letters and avoids A,C,N.\n\n Which one is better? ""TIMER"" or ""TIRED""?\n\n Both have T, I, and then either M or D. Both are good.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think: we want to cover more common letters? S is a very common letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\n Consider ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> \n   Position 1: R (okay, not position 2)\n   Position 2: O (new)\n   Position 3: U (new)\n   Position 4: S (new)\n   Position 5: E -> but E at position 5 is forbidden! Because previous feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at position 5 in any guess? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not the correct position for E. However, if we put E at 5, we expect it to be marked as \'-\' again? But we want to avoid known wrong positions to potentially find a right position.\n\n So it\'s better not to put E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is invalid because it has E at position 5.\n\n What about ""RISKY""? But E is required? We must use E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n How about ""RIDER""? We decided to avoid duplicates, but let\'s see: R at 1 and another R at 4? Then E would be missing. We must include E.\n\n So, back to:\n\n Option 1: ""TIMER"" -> T,I,M,E,R -> E at 4 and R at 5: both in new positions.\n Option 2: ""TIRED"" -> T,I,R,E,D -> R at 3 and E at 4: both in new positions.\n\n Which letters are more common? \n   T: very common, I: common, M: less common than D? D is more common? \n   Actually, we don\'t know, but D and M are both worth testing.\n\n However, note that we also have E to test in a new position (currently at 4 in both). \n\n Another option: ""BREED""? Duplicate E -> skip.\n\n ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> \n   Position 1: D (new), \n   Position 2: R -> we cannot have R at position 2? So forbidden? Yes, because previous feedback said R is not at position 2.\n\n So we cannot use any word with R at position 2.\n\n Similarly, in ""TIRED"", R is at position 3 -> okay.\n In ""TIMER"", R is at position 5 -> okay.\n\n Another idea: ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D -> \n   Position 3: R -> okay? \n   Position 4: E -> okay? \n   But has S and H which are common.\n\n However, ""SHRED"" has R at position 3 and E at position 4 -> acceptable.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has S, H, R, E, D.\n\n We are free to choose. I think ""SHRED"" is a good word? Let me check: common, distinct letters.\n\n But wait: we haven\'t tested S or H? So yes, that would be good.\n\n However, compare to ""TIRED"": \n   ""TIRED"": T (new), I (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> we test T, I, D and confirm R and E are still present but in new positions.\n   ""SHRED"": S (new), H (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> tests S, H, D.\n\n D is common, but S and H are also common.\n\n Another candidate: ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> \n   Position 1: P? \n   Position 2: E -> This is a new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at position 2. That\'s acceptable? Yes, because E cannot be at 5 only. Position 2 might be correct? \n   Position 3: R -> acceptable? Yes.\n\n But note: in ""PERKY"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3. However, we must avoid R at position 2, but E at position 2 is new.\n\n Letters: P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct? Yes.\n\n So ""PERKY"" is also acceptable and tests P, K, Y.\n\n Now, what\'s the best? We need to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, R, L, N (but N is out), D, M, etc. Since we haven\'t tested S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words (without A,C,N):\n\n We can try:\n\n - Words with S, T, or L.\n\n ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> \n   Position 1: S? \n   Position 2: T? \n   Position 3: O? \n   Position 4: R? -> But R: we know R is in the word, but can we put it at position 4? That\'s acceptable. \n   Position 5: E -> forbidden? E at position 5 is not allowed. So no.\n\n ""STARE"": but A is forbidden? A is in ""STARE"", which is not allowed because we know A is absent? But we must use words without A? That\'s right, the word we guess must not contain letters we know are absent to avoid wasting a guess? Actually, we can guess words with absent letters? But that would be inefficient because we\'ll get \'x\' and learn nothing new? Therefore, it\'s better to avoid known absent letters (A, C, N).\n\n So we avoid words with A, C, N.\n\n Replace ""STARE"" with ""STORE"": but E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n ""STONE"": contains N -> skip.\n\n ""SLATE"": contains A -> skip.\n\n Another idea: ""DRIVE"": but R at position 2 -> forbidden.\n\n ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> \n   Positions: D at1, R at2? -> no, R at2 forbidden.\n\n How about ""RIFLE"": R at1, I, F, L, E -> \n   Position 1: R -> okay\n   Position 2: I -> not R, okay\n   Position 3: F\n   Position 4: L\n   Position 5: E -> forbidden? Yes, cannot have E at position 5. So skip.\n\n Then, let\'s consider words that end with a letter other than E? So E must be at positions 1-4.\n\n We can try:\n\n - ""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at5 -> skip.\n - ""RUDER"": R at1, U, D, E at4, R at5 -> duplicate R? Skip.\n\n How about ""RESIN"": but has N -> skip.\n\n ""REBUS"": R at1, E at2, B, U, S -> \n   Position 2: E -> we haven\'t tried E at position 2? And R at position 1: acceptable? \n   Because R was previously only excluded from position 2? Position 1 is new.\n\n Also, the word ""REBUS"" exists? Yes.\n\n But note: we must check that it doesn\'t contain A,C,N? It has R,E,B,U,S -> no forbidden letters.\n\n Positions:\n   R: position 1 -> new position? Previously in ""CRANE"" R was at 2, so position 1 is open.\n   E: position 2 -> we haven\'t tried E at this position? And we know E is not at position 5, but position 2? Could be correct? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing E at a new position (position 2) which is good.\n\n Letters: R (known), E (known), B (new), U (new), S (new).\n\n That gives us three new letters: B, U, S.\n\n This is a good option.\n\n But let\'s see another word: ""RESET""? Duplicate E -> skip.\n\n ""REIGN"": but G and N? N is forbidden -> skip.\n\n ""RISEN"": contains N -> skip.\n\n After considering several words, I found:\n   ""REBUS"": R,E,B,U,S -> positions: (1)R, (2)E, (3)B, (4)U, (5)S -> E is at position 2? That\'s acceptable? But wait: E is at position 2, which is a new position? And we avoid E at position 5.\n\n But how about the R at position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? It might be.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to have E at position 2? There\'s no restriction from previous feedback? We only know that E is not at position 5.\n\n So ""REBUS"" seems valid.\n\n But compare to ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> positions: R at3, E at4.\n\n Which one tests more common letters? \n   ""REBUS"" tests: B,U,S (and R,E)\n   ""TIRED"" tests: T,I,D (and R,E)\n\n Common letters: Among the new letters in ""REBUS"": S is very common, B and U less so? \n In ""TIRED"": T and I are very common, D moderately common.\n\n Another word: ""LOWER"": L,O,W,E,R -> \n   Positions: L1, O2, W3, E4, R5 -> \n     E at4? okay (not 5). R at5? new position? okay? \n   Letters: L,O,W,E,R -> distinct, and avoids forbidden.\n\n Tests L, O, W.\n\n But L, O, W are not as common as S and T? \n\n Considering the frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... but A,C,N are already out, so next are O, I, S.\n\n We haven\'t tested T, I, O, S, L, etc.\n\n The word ""TIRED"" has T and I, which are high frequency.\n\n Alternatively, ""SERVE"" has duplicate E -> skip.\n\n ""PIECE""? Duplicate E -> skip.\n\n Another word: ""QUEST"": Q is rare? Not ideal.\n\n After consideration, I think both ""REBUS"" and ""TIRED"" are good. Let me choose ""TIRED"" because T and I are more common than B and U? And we test D.\n\n Also, in ""CRANE"", E was at the end and now we\'re trying E at a different position? Position 4? That\'s good.\n\n So let\'s go with ""TIRED"".\n\n Summary: \n   We are guessing ""TIRED"".\n\n<guess>tired</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌ R❓ A❌ N❌ E❓), we know:\n- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.\n- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent.\n- The new guess must include **R** and **E**, avoid **A/C/N**, and prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) while placing R and E in unverified positions.\n\nI chose **""tired""** because:\n- Positions: R is at position 3 (new, avoiding position 2) and E is at position 4 (new, avoiding position 5).\n- Letters: Tests new common consonants (**T, I, D**) while confirming **R** and **E** presence.\n- Efficiency: Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the second guess ""tired"":
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position, not position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- D: x (not in the word)

So, combining with the first guess ""crane"":
- Correct letters: 
  - I is in the word and at position 2.
  - E is in the word and at position 4.
- Misplaced letters:
  - R is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3 are ruled out, and position 4 is taken by E? Position 4 is E, so R cannot be at 4. So R must be at position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: 
  - From first guess: C, A, N
  - From second guess: T, D
  - So absent: C, A, N, T, D

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and we have:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- R must be present and at position 1 or 5.

Now, the word structure so far:
Position 1: ? (could be R or something else, but R is a candidate for position 1 or 5)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: ? (could be R or something else)

But note: R is misplaced in both guesses, so it must be in one of the remaining positions: 1 or 5.

We also have two more letters to find: one for position 1 or 5 (if R is not there) and one for position 3.

But if R is at position 1, then position 5 is open. Similarly, if R is at position 5, then position 1 is open. And position 3 is always open.

So the word pattern: 
Option A: R I ? E ? 
Option B: ? I ? E R 

And the ? must be filled with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D and also not I or E (since I and E are already placed, but they could appear again? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we cannot assume. However, to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now.

But note: we have only two known letters: I and E. The rest are unknown.

We also know the word must contain R, and we have two positions for it.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has I at position 2 and E at position 4.
- Includes R (since it's still missing) and places it at either position 1 or 5 (to test which one).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, T, D.
- Tries to test new common letters for the remaining positions.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

First, consider the pattern: _ I _ E _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D.

And one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) must be R? Actually, R must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5 must be R? Or could R be at position 3? But wait, in the second guess, we had R at position 3 and it was marked as misplaced? That means R is in the word but not at position 3. So R cannot be at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.

So the two possibilities:
Pattern 1: R I _ E ? 
Pattern 2: ? I _ E R 

Now, the third position is open and must be a letter that is not C, A, N, T, D, and not I or E? But I and E are already in the word, but they could be duplicated? We don't know. But if we avoid duplicates, we can test more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

We need to test both possibilities and also test the third position.

We can design a guess that can help distinguish between the two patterns.

For example, if we guess a word with R at position 1, then if the feedback shows R at position 1 is correct, then pattern 1. If not, then pattern 2? But we don't have to do both at once.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a letter at position 1 that is not R and at position 5 that is not R? But then we wouldn't be testing R? But we must include R because it's a known letter? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we must include it in the guess? Otherwise, we might get a false absent? But the rules: we must include all known present letters? Not necessarily, but if we don't include R, we won't get information about its position. And we have limited guesses.

So it's better to include R in the guess.

Therefore, we must include R and place it at either position 1 or 5.

We can choose to test one of the patterns.

But we also have to test the third position.

Let me list possible words.

First, pattern 1: R I ? E ? 
We need a letter for position 3 and position 5. The letter at position 3 must not be C,A,N,T,D, and at position 5 must not be C,A,N,T,D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common ones: S, L, O, P, M, etc.

Possible words:
- R I P E ? -> but ""RIPER"" has duplicate R? And what for position 5? ""RIPER"" is 5 letters? R-I-P-E-R -> duplicate R. Not ideal? But let's see if it's a word? Yes, but we avoid duplicates for now? Because we don't know if duplicates exist.

Better: ""RIPEN"" -> but N is absent? Skip.

""RIPED"" -> D is absent? Skip.

""RICES"" -> C and S? C is absent? Skip.

""RILES"": R I L E S -> 
  Position 1: R
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

This avoids absent letters? Yes: L and S are new.

Similarly, ""RIDES"" -> D is absent? Skip.

""RIFLE"" -> F and L? But E is at position 5? But in this pattern, we have E at position 4? So ""RIFLE"" would be R-I-F-L-E? Then position 4 is L? But we need E at position 4? So that doesn't fit.

We must have E at position 4 and I at position 2.

So for pattern 1: R I ? E ? 
We need a word like: R I X E Y, where X and Y are new letters.

""RILES"": as above, X=L, Y=S -> ""RILES""

""RIPES"": R I P E S -> P and S? But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

""RIVES"": R I V E S -> V and S.

""RIDES"": D absent -> skip.

""RIGES"": not common? But ""RIG"" is a word? ""RIGES"" might not be standard.

""RICES"": C absent -> skip.

""RIFLE"": doesn't fit because E is at 5? And position 4 would be L? But we need E at 4.

So ""RILES"" and ""RIPES"" are candidates.

Now, pattern 2: ? I ? E R 
We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

For example:
- ? I ? E R

Words:
""WIPER"": W I P E R -> 
  Position 1: W
  Position 3: P

""WIDER"": D absent -> skip.

""WISER"": W I S E R -> S at position 3.

""MINER"": M I N E R -> N absent -> skip.

""LIKER"": L I K E R -> K at position 3.

""LIBER"": L I B E R -> B at position 3.

""LINER"": N absent -> skip.

""LIVER"": L I V E R -> V at position 3.

""PIPER"": P I P E R -> duplicate P? Skip? Or not? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But to test, we can avoid.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> L at position 3.

Now, we have two patterns. We need to choose a guess that can help us determine which pattern is correct.

We can choose a word that fits one pattern and see the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 (pattern 2) and then if we get R at position 5 correct, then we know. If not, then pattern 1 must be true? But we have to include R.

But note: if we guess a word with R at position 5, and if the feedback shows R at position 5 is correct, then we know pattern 2. If it shows R is misplaced, then R must be at position 1? Because position 3 is already ruled out? And position 2 and 4 are taken? So if R is misplaced at position 5, then it must be at position 1? But position 1 is the only other possibility? Yes, because positions 2,3,4 are either fixed or ruled out for R.

Similarly, if we put R at position 1 and it's correct, then pattern 1. If misplaced, then pattern 2.

So we can test by placing R at one of the positions.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me choose to test pattern 2: put R at position 5.

So guess a word of the form: ? I ? E R

And we need to choose letters for position 1 and 3 that are new and common.

For example, ""WISER"": W at1, I at2, S at3, E at4, R at5.

This tests:
- W at position 1: if correct, then W is in the word and at position 1? But if pattern 2 is correct, then position 1 is not R, so it could be W? But if pattern 2 is not correct, then position 1 should be R? So if we get W as absent, then pattern 2 is false? But if W is present but wrong position? Then it might be complicated.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and a new letter at position 3, and a letter at position 1 that we don't care about? But we have to use valid words.

Another idea: use a word that has the same letter at position 1 and 5? But that would be duplicate? Not necessary.

Let's think about the feedback we'll get.

If we guess ""WISER"":
- If the word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and the ? are W and S, then we get all correct? But we don't know.
- If the word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:
   - Position 1: we have W, but should be R -> so W is absent? Or if the word has W? But we don't know.
   - Position 5: we have R, but in pattern 1, position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be misplaced? But in pattern 1, R is at position 1, so position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be marked as absent? Or misplaced? 

Wait, if the word is pattern 1: R I ? E ? (with R at1), then in ""WISER"":
   - W at position 1: not R, and if W is not in the word, then W: x
   - I at2: correct -> ✓
   - S at3: ? 
   - E at4: correct -> ✓
   - R at5: but the word has R at position 1, so R is in the word? But at position 5? It's not at position 5? So R would be marked as '-' (misplaced) because it's in the word but not at position 5? But the word already has R at position 1? So the feedback for R at5: since the word has one R (at position 1) and we put R at position 5, it should be marked as '-' (misplaced) because the R is present but not at that position? But what if the word has two R's? We don't know.

The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences? Actually, in Wordle, if there is one R and we put two R's, then one might be correct and the other misplaced? But in this case, if the word has only one R (at position 1), then in ""WISER"", the R at position 5 would be marked as '-'? Or if the word has two R's? But we don't know.

This might be ambiguous.

To avoid confusion, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? So that the feedback is clear.

So for pattern 2 guess, let's choose a word with distinct letters.

For example, ""WISER"" has distinct letters? W,I,S,E,R -> distinct.

Similarly, for pattern 1, ""RILES"" has distinct letters.

But we are going to guess one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that's hard.

Given that we have two possibilities for R, we can choose to test R at position 1.

Let me choose to test pattern 1: R at position 1.

Guess a word like ""R I ? E ?"" with distinct letters.

For example, ""RILES"": R I L E S

If we guess ""RILES"":
- If the word is pattern 1 (R at1) and the third letter is L and fifth is S, then we win? But we don't know.
- If the word is pattern 1 but L or S is wrong, we get feedback.
- If the word is pattern 2 (R not at1, but at5), then:
   - Position 1: R -> but the word has R at5, so R at1 is misplaced? So we get R: '-' at position 1.
   - Position 2: I: ✓
   - Position 3: L: ? 
   - Position 4: E: ✓
   - Position 5: S: ? 

But if the word is pattern 2, then position 5 is R, so S at position 5 would be wrong? And if the word has S? Then S might be misplaced or absent.

This might also be ambiguous.

But note: we have to make a choice.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and also tests a common letter at position 1 and 3.

But let's look for a word that might be more informative.

We know that position 3 is unknown and we haven't tested many letters.

We can choose a word that has a common letter at position 3 and then R at position 5.

For example, ""P I ? E R"" -> ""PIPER"" has duplicate P? Skip.

""L I ? E R"" -> ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> distinct letters.

""LIVER"" is a word.

If we guess ""LIVER"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I (correct)
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R

Now, if the secret word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:
   - L at1: absent or misplaced? 
   - V at3: ?
   - R at5: since the word has R at1, R at5 would be misplaced? But if the word has only one R, then R at5 is misplaced? And L and V are new.

If the secret word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and if the word is ""LIVER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

But if we get feedback for ""LIVER"":
- If I and E are correct (which they will be), and R at5 is correct, then we know it's pattern 2 and the word is ""LIVER"" if V and L are also correct.
- If R at5 is misplaced, then it must be pattern 1 (R at1) and then L and V are to be checked.

Also, if R at5 is correct, then we know the word ends with R, and we have L and V to consider.

But if R at5 is misplaced, then we know R must be at position 1, and then we have L and V to check.

So ""LIVER"" seems like a good guess because it tests both R positions and two new letters.

Similarly, we could choose ""WISER"" or ""RILES"", but ""LIVER"" is also good.

Another common word: ""S I ? E R"" -> ""SIVER""? Not a word. ""SIZER"": S I Z E R -> Z is less common.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> distinct.

But ""LIVER"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""LIVER"".

But let's confirm the absent letters: we must avoid C,A,N,T,D. ""LIVER"" has L,I,V,E,R -> no absent letters? I and E are allowed, and L,V,R are new and not absent.

So guess: ""LIVER""

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(absent), R(misplaced), A(absent), N(absent), E(misplaced)  
  → **Key insights**:  
    - R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 5.  
    - C, A, N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: TIRED**  
  Feedback: T(absent), I(correct position), R(misplaced), E(correct position), D(absent)  
  → **Key insights**:  
    - I is confirmed at position 2.  
    - E is confirmed at position 4.  
    - R is misplaced (not in position 3, and previously not in position 2).  
    - T and D are absent.  
    - R must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are invalid for R).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **I**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
- **Misplaced letter**:  
  - **R** (must be at position 1 or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, D (avoid these).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 5 (if R is not at 5).  
- **Untested common letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include R** to test its position (1 or 5).  
- **Test new common letters** for unknown positions (e.g., L, V).  
- **Avoid absent letters** and duplicates (maximize information).  
- **Prioritize words** that fit the pattern `_ I _ E _` with R at position 5 (to resolve ambiguity quickly).  

Chose **LIVER** because:  
- Fits the pattern: `L I V E R` → Tests R at position 5.  
- Tests **L** (position 1) and **V** (position 3), two new common letters.  
- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback.  
- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, T, D).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If R is at position 5 (correct), the word ends with R.  
- If R is misplaced, it must be at position 1 (since positions 2–4 are invalid).  
- Feedback on L and V will reveal their presence/absence.  

<guess>liver</guess>",liver,"We have feedback from the second guess ""tired"":
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position, not position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- D: x (not in the word)

So, combining with the first guess ""crane"":
- Correct letters: 
  - I is in the word and at position 2.
  - E is in the word and at position 4.
- Misplaced letters:
  - R is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3 are ruled out, and position 4 is taken by E? Position 4 is E, so R cannot be at 4. So R must be at position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: 
  - From first guess: C, A, N
  - From second guess: T, D
  - So absent: C, A, N, T, D

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and we have:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- R must be present and at position 1 or 5.

Now, the word structure so far:
Position 1: ? (could be R or something else, but R is a candidate for position 1 or 5)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: ? (could be R or something else)

But note: R is misplaced in both guesses, so it must be in one of the remaining positions: 1 or 5.

We also have two more letters to find: one for position 1 or 5 (if R is not there) and one for position 3.

But if R is at position 1, then position 5 is open. Similarly, if R is at position 5, then position 1 is open. And position 3 is always open.

So the word pattern: 
Option A: R I ? E ? 
Option B: ? I ? E R 

And the ? must be filled with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D and also not I or E (since I and E are already placed, but they could appear again? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we cannot assume. However, to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now.

But note: we have only two known letters: I and E. The rest are unknown.

We also know the word must contain R, and we have two positions for it.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has I at position 2 and E at position 4.
- Includes R (since it's still missing) and places it at either position 1 or 5 (to test which one).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, T, D.
- Tries to test new common letters for the remaining positions.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

First, consider the pattern: _ I _ E _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D.

And one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) must be R? Actually, R must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5 must be R? Or could R be at position 3? But wait, in the second guess, we had R at position 3 and it was marked as misplaced? That means R is in the word but not at position 3. So R cannot be at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.

So the two possibilities:
Pattern 1: R I _ E ? 
Pattern 2: ? I _ E R 

Now, the third position is open and must be a letter that is not C, A, N, T, D, and not I or E? But I and E are already in the word, but they could be duplicated? We don't know. But if we avoid duplicates, we can test more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

We need to test both possibilities and also test the third position.

We can design a guess that can help distinguish between the two patterns.

For example, if we guess a word with R at position 1, then if the feedback shows R at position 1 is correct, then pattern 1. If not, then pattern 2? But we don't have to do both at once.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a letter at position 1 that is not R and at position 5 that is not R? But then we wouldn't be testing R? But we must include R because it's a known letter? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we must include it in the guess? Otherwise, we might get a false absent? But the rules: we must include all known present letters? Not necessarily, but if we don't include R, we won't get information about its position. And we have limited guesses.

So it's better to include R in the guess.

Therefore, we must include R and place it at either position 1 or 5.

We can choose to test one of the patterns.

But we also have to test the third position.

Let me list possible words.

First, pattern 1: R I ? E ? 
We need a letter for position 3 and position 5. The letter at position 3 must not be C,A,N,T,D, and at position 5 must not be C,A,N,T,D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common ones: S, L, O, P, M, etc.

Possible words:
- R I P E ? -> but ""RIPER"" has duplicate R? And what for position 5? ""RIPER"" is 5 letters? R-I-P-E-R -> duplicate R. Not ideal? But let's see if it's a word? Yes, but we avoid duplicates for now? Because we don't know if duplicates exist.

Better: ""RIPEN"" -> but N is absent? Skip.

""RIPED"" -> D is absent? Skip.

""RICES"" -> C and S? C is absent? Skip.

""RILES"": R I L E S -> 
  Position 1: R
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

This avoids absent letters? Yes: L and S are new.

Similarly, ""RIDES"" -> D is absent? Skip.

""RIFLE"" -> F and L? But E is at position 5? But in this pattern, we have E at position 4? So ""RIFLE"" would be R-I-F-L-E? Then position 4 is L? But we need E at position 4? So that doesn't fit.

We must have E at position 4 and I at position 2.

So for pattern 1: R I ? E ? 
We need a word like: R I X E Y, where X and Y are new letters.

""RILES"": as above, X=L, Y=S -> ""RILES""

""RIPES"": R I P E S -> P and S? But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

""RIVES"": R I V E S -> V and S.

""RIDES"": D absent -> skip.

""RIGES"": not common? But ""RIG"" is a word? ""RIGES"" might not be standard.

""RICES"": C absent -> skip.

""RIFLE"": doesn't fit because E is at 5? And position 4 would be L? But we need E at 4.

So ""RILES"" and ""RIPES"" are candidates.

Now, pattern 2: ? I ? E R 
We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

For example:
- ? I ? E R

Words:
""WIPER"": W I P E R -> 
  Position 1: W
  Position 3: P

""WIDER"": D absent -> skip.

""WISER"": W I S E R -> S at position 3.

""MINER"": M I N E R -> N absent -> skip.

""LIKER"": L I K E R -> K at position 3.

""LIBER"": L I B E R -> B at position 3.

""LINER"": N absent -> skip.

""LIVER"": L I V E R -> V at position 3.

""PIPER"": P I P E R -> duplicate P? Skip? Or not? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But to test, we can avoid.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> L at position 3.

Now, we have two patterns. We need to choose a guess that can help us determine which pattern is correct.

We can choose a word that fits one pattern and see the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 (pattern 2) and then if we get R at position 5 correct, then we know. If not, then pattern 1 must be true? But we have to include R.

But note: if we guess a word with R at position 5, and if the feedback shows R at position 5 is correct, then we know pattern 2. If it shows R is misplaced, then R must be at position 1? Because position 3 is already ruled out? And position 2 and 4 are taken? So if R is misplaced at position 5, then it must be at position 1? But position 1 is the only other possibility? Yes, because positions 2,3,4 are either fixed or ruled out for R.

Similarly, if we put R at position 1 and it's correct, then pattern 1. If misplaced, then pattern 2.

So we can test by placing R at one of the positions.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me choose to test pattern 2: put R at position 5.

So guess a word of the form: ? I ? E R

And we need to choose letters for position 1 and 3 that are new and common.

For example, ""WISER"": W at1, I at2, S at3, E at4, R at5.

This tests:
- W at position 1: if correct, then W is in the word and at position 1? But if pattern 2 is correct, then position 1 is not R, so it could be W? But if pattern 2 is not correct, then position 1 should be R? So if we get W as absent, then pattern 2 is false? But if W is present but wrong position? Then it might be complicated.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and a new letter at position 3, and a letter at position 1 that we don't care about? But we have to use valid words.

Another idea: use a word that has the same letter at position 1 and 5? But that would be duplicate? Not necessary.

Let's think about the feedback we'll get.

If we guess ""WISER"":
- If the word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and the ? are W and S, then we get all correct? But we don't know.
- If the word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:
   - Position 1: we have W, but should be R -> so W is absent? Or if the word has W? But we don't know.
   - Position 5: we have R, but in pattern 1, position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be misplaced? But in pattern 1, R is at position 1, so position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be marked as absent? Or misplaced? 

Wait, if the word is pattern 1: R I ? E ? (with R at1), then in ""WISER"":
   - W at position 1: not R, and if W is not in the word, then W: x
   - I at2: correct -> ✓
   - S at3: ? 
   - E at4: correct -> ✓
   - R at5: but the word has R at position 1, so R is in the word? But at position 5? It's not at position 5? So R would be marked as '-' (misplaced) because it's in the word but not at position 5? But the word already has R at position 1? So the feedback for R at5: since the word has one R (at position 1) and we put R at position 5, it should be marked as '-' (misplaced) because the R is present but not at that position? But what if the word has two R's? We don't know.

The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences? Actually, in Wordle, if there is one R and we put two R's, then one might be correct and the other misplaced? But in this case, if the word has only one R (at position 1), then in ""WISER"", the R at position 5 would be marked as '-'? Or if the word has two R's? But we don't know.

This might be ambiguous.

To avoid confusion, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? So that the feedback is clear.

So for pattern 2 guess, let's choose a word with distinct letters.

For example, ""WISER"" has distinct letters? W,I,S,E,R -> distinct.

Similarly, for pattern 1, ""RILES"" has distinct letters.

But we are going to guess one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that's hard.

Given that we have two possibilities for R, we can choose to test R at position 1.

Let me choose to test pattern 1: R at position 1.

Guess a word like ""R I ? E ?"" with distinct letters.

For example, ""RILES"": R I L E S

If we guess ""RILES"":
- If the word is pattern 1 (R at1) and the third letter is L and fifth is S, then we win? But we don't know.
- If the word is pattern 1 but L or S is wrong, we get feedback.
- If the word is pattern 2 (R not at1, but at5), then:
   - Position 1: R -> but the word has R at5, so R at1 is misplaced? So we get R: '-' at position 1.
   - Position 2: I: ✓
   - Position 3: L: ? 
   - Position 4: E: ✓
   - Position 5: S: ? 

But if the word is pattern 2, then position 5 is R, so S at position 5 would be wrong? And if the word has S? Then S might be misplaced or absent.

This might also be ambiguous.

But note: we have to make a choice.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and also tests a common letter at position 1 and 3.

But let's look for a word that might be more informative.

We know that position 3 is unknown and we haven't tested many letters.

We can choose a word that has a common letter at position 3 and then R at position 5.

For example, ""P I ? E R"" -> ""PIPER"" has duplicate P? Skip.

""L I ? E R"" -> ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> distinct letters.

""LIVER"" is a word.

If we guess ""LIVER"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I (correct)
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R

Now, if the secret word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:
   - L at1: absent or misplaced? 
   - V at3: ?
   - R at5: since the word has R at1, R at5 would be misplaced? But if the word has only one R, then R at5 is misplaced? And L and V are new.

If the secret word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and if the word is ""LIVER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

But if we get feedback for ""LIVER"":
- If I and E are correct (which they will be), and R at5 is correct, then we know it's pattern 2 and the word is ""LIVER"" if V and L are also correct.
- If R at5 is misplaced, then it must be pattern 1 (R at1) and then L and V are to be checked.

Also, if R at5 is correct, then we know the word ends with R, and we have L and V to consider.

But if R at5 is misplaced, then we know R must be at position 1, and then we have L and V to check.

So ""LIVER"" seems like a good guess because it tests both R positions and two new letters.

Similarly, we could choose ""WISER"" or ""RILES"", but ""LIVER"" is also good.

Another common word: ""S I ? E R"" -> ""SIVER""? Not a word. ""SIZER"": S I Z E R -> Z is less common.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> distinct.

But ""LIVER"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""LIVER"".

But let's confirm the absent letters: we must avoid C,A,N,T,D. ""LIVER"" has L,I,V,E,R -> no absent letters? I and E are allowed, and L,V,R are new and not absent.

So guess: ""LIVER""

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - N: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.
 - The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"".

 Positions in ""CRANE"":
   C: position 1
   R: position 2
   A: position 3
   N: position 4
   E: position 5

 Therefore:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 Also, since A, C, N are absent, we can avoid words containing these letters.

 We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N.
   - Contains R and E.
   - Places R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Moreover, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Considering the absence of A, C, N and the presence of R and E, let's think of words.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many new common letters as possible, while ensuring R and E are included and in acceptable positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try placing R and E in other positions.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 5, that might be acceptable since the feedback only said R wasn't at position 2. Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we are not restricted on other positions, so we could have R at 1,3,4,5 and E at 1,2,3,4.

 Let's list some words that have R and E, and no A, C, N.

 Some candidates:
 - ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because of previous feedback? Wait, in ""CRANE"", R was at position 2 and that was wrong, so in the new word, we must avoid R at position 2.

 ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2 -> but we cannot have R at position 2. So skip.

 - ""ROUTE"": R at 1, O, U, T, E at 5 -> E at position 5 is not allowed? Because in ""CRANE"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. So we cannot have E at position 5. Therefore, ""ROUTE"" would have E at position 5 -> invalid for E position.

 - ""RIDER"": R at 1, I, D, E at 4, R at 5 -> has E at position 4? Then E is not at 5. And R at 1: which is a new position. But note: the word has two R's? That's acceptable if the secret word has two R's. However, our feedback only indicated one R? Wait, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed one R and one E. But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

 However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed:
   R: in the word but wrong position (only one R was present and it was at position 2). If the word had two R's, then one of them might have been in the right position? But in ""CRANE"" we only had one R. So the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates because we only provided one R. The secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

 Since the feedback only marked one R as present (with wrong position), it's possible the secret word has at least one R. Similarly for E.

 So when guessing, we can use words with duplicate letters if needed, but to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now to check more letters.

 Let's avoid duplicates for this guess.

 Try words with letters: R, E, and three new letters.

 Words:
 - ""RIPER""? Duplicate R -> avoid.
 - ""POLER""? P, O, L, E, R -> but E at position 4? and R at 5? Then E is not at 5? Wait: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> E at 4, R at 5. And R at 5: we don't know if that's acceptable because previous feedback only forbade R at position 2. So R at 5 is new. Also E at 4: not position 5, so okay. But the word ""POLER"" is not very common? Maybe not.

 Looking for common words:
 - ""ROBES"": R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S -> E at position 4 is acceptable (not 5). R at position 1 (new). Letters: R, O, B, E, S -> all new except R and E, and no A, C, N.

 ""ROBES"": 
   Position 1: R -> hasn't been tried at position 1? We haven't tested position 1 because our first guess had C at position 1 and it was absent. But that doesn't mean R cannot be at position 1. Actually, we know the secret word contains R, but not at position 2. Position 1 is a candidate.

 - ""RODEO""? But that has O at the end? Wait, 5 letters? Yes, R-O-D-E-O -> but that has two O's? Not ideal for information. Also, E at position 4? Then O at 5? But we don't have information about O.

 Alternatively: ""SERVE""? S, E, R, V, E -> duplicate E? Avoid.

 ""TIMER"": T, I, M, E, R -> E at position 4? and R at position 5. So E is at 4 (not 5) and R at 5 (not 2). Letters: T, I, M, E, R -> all new? Yes, and no duplicates.

 ""TIMER"": 
   T at 1, I at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if M is in the word? We'll get information.

 Another common word: ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at position 3, E at position 4. Let's check positions:
   Position 1: T (new)
   Position 2: I (new)
   Position 3: R -> we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 3? It's a new position, so okay.
   Position 4: E -> not position 5, okay.
   Position 5: D (new)

 Also, ""TIRED"" has distinct letters and avoids A,C,N.

 Which one is better? ""TIMER"" or ""TIRED""?

 Both have T, I, and then either M or D. Both are good.

 Alternatively, let's think: we want to cover more common letters? S is a very common letter that we haven't tested.

 Consider ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> 
   Position 1: R (okay, not position 2)
   Position 2: O (new)
   Position 3: U (new)
   Position 4: S (new)
   Position 5: E -> but E at position 5 is forbidden! Because previous feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at position 5 in any guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position for E. However, if we put E at 5, we expect it to be marked as '-' again? But we want to avoid known wrong positions to potentially find a right position.

 So it's better not to put E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is invalid because it has E at position 5.

 What about ""RISKY""? But E is required? We must use E because we know it's in the word.

 How about ""RIDER""? We decided to avoid duplicates, but let's see: R at 1 and another R at 4? Then E would be missing. We must include E.

 So, back to:

 Option 1: ""TIMER"" -> T,I,M,E,R -> E at 4 and R at 5: both in new positions.
 Option 2: ""TIRED"" -> T,I,R,E,D -> R at 3 and E at 4: both in new positions.

 Which letters are more common? 
   T: very common, I: common, M: less common than D? D is more common? 
   Actually, we don't know, but D and M are both worth testing.

 However, note that we also have E to test in a new position (currently at 4 in both). 

 Another option: ""BREED""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> 
   Position 1: D (new), 
   Position 2: R -> we cannot have R at position 2? So forbidden? Yes, because previous feedback said R is not at position 2.

 So we cannot use any word with R at position 2.

 Similarly, in ""TIRED"", R is at position 3 -> okay.
 In ""TIMER"", R is at position 5 -> okay.

 Another idea: ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D -> 
   Position 3: R -> okay? 
   Position 4: E -> okay? 
   But has S and H which are common.

 However, ""SHRED"" has R at position 3 and E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has S, H, R, E, D.

 We are free to choose. I think ""SHRED"" is a good word? Let me check: common, distinct letters.

 But wait: we haven't tested S or H? So yes, that would be good.

 However, compare to ""TIRED"": 
   ""TIRED"": T (new), I (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> we test T, I, D and confirm R and E are still present but in new positions.
   ""SHRED"": S (new), H (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> tests S, H, D.

 D is common, but S and H are also common.

 Another candidate: ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   Position 1: P? 
   Position 2: E -> This is a new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at position 2. That's acceptable? Yes, because E cannot be at 5 only. Position 2 might be correct? 
   Position 3: R -> acceptable? Yes.

 But note: in ""PERKY"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3. However, we must avoid R at position 2, but E at position 2 is new.

 Letters: P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct? Yes.

 So ""PERKY"" is also acceptable and tests P, K, Y.

 Now, what's the best? We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, L, N (but N is out), D, M, etc. Since we haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words (without A,C,N):

 We can try:

 - Words with S, T, or L.

 ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: T? 
   Position 3: O? 
   Position 4: R? -> But R: we know R is in the word, but can we put it at position 4? That's acceptable. 
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? E at position 5 is not allowed. So no.

 ""STARE"": but A is forbidden? A is in ""STARE"", which is not allowed because we know A is absent? But we must use words without A? That's right, the word we guess must not contain letters we know are absent to avoid wasting a guess? Actually, we can guess words with absent letters? But that would be inefficient because we'll get 'x' and learn nothing new? Therefore, it's better to avoid known absent letters (A, C, N).

 So we avoid words with A, C, N.

 Replace ""STARE"" with ""STORE"": but E at 5 -> invalid.

 ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 ""STONE"": contains N -> skip.

 ""SLATE"": contains A -> skip.

 Another idea: ""DRIVE"": but R at position 2 -> forbidden.

 ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> 
   Positions: D at1, R at2? -> no, R at2 forbidden.

 How about ""RIFLE"": R at1, I, F, L, E -> 
   Position 1: R -> okay
   Position 2: I -> not R, okay
   Position 3: F
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> forbidden? Yes, cannot have E at position 5. So skip.

 Then, let's consider words that end with a letter other than E? So E must be at positions 1-4.

 We can try:

 - ""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at5 -> skip.
 - ""RUDER"": R at1, U, D, E at4, R at5 -> duplicate R? Skip.

 How about ""RESIN"": but has N -> skip.

 ""REBUS"": R at1, E at2, B, U, S -> 
   Position 2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? And R at position 1: acceptable? 
   Because R was previously only excluded from position 2? Position 1 is new.

 Also, the word ""REBUS"" exists? Yes.

 But note: we must check that it doesn't contain A,C,N? It has R,E,B,U,S -> no forbidden letters.

 Positions:
   R: position 1 -> new position? Previously in ""CRANE"" R was at 2, so position 1 is open.
   E: position 2 -> we haven't tried E at this position? And we know E is not at position 5, but position 2? Could be correct? We don't know.

 However, we are testing E at a new position (position 2) which is good.

 Letters: R (known), E (known), B (new), U (new), S (new).

 That gives us three new letters: B, U, S.

 This is a good option.

 But let's see another word: ""RESET""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 ""REIGN"": but G and N? N is forbidden -> skip.

 ""RISEN"": contains N -> skip.

 After considering several words, I found:
   ""REBUS"": R,E,B,U,S -> positions: (1)R, (2)E, (3)B, (4)U, (5)S -> E is at position 2? That's acceptable? But wait: E is at position 2, which is a new position? And we avoid E at position 5.

 But how about the R at position 1? We don't know if that's correct? It might be.

 However, note that we are allowed to have E at position 2? There's no restriction from previous feedback? We only know that E is not at position 5.

 So ""REBUS"" seems valid.

 But compare to ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> positions: R at3, E at4.

 Which one tests more common letters? 
   ""REBUS"" tests: B,U,S (and R,E)
   ""TIRED"" tests: T,I,D (and R,E)

 Common letters: Among the new letters in ""REBUS"": S is very common, B and U less so? 
 In ""TIRED"": T and I are very common, D moderately common.

 Another word: ""LOWER"": L,O,W,E,R -> 
   Positions: L1, O2, W3, E4, R5 -> 
     E at4? okay (not 5). R at5? new position? okay? 
   Letters: L,O,W,E,R -> distinct, and avoids forbidden.

 Tests L, O, W.

 But L, O, W are not as common as S and T? 

 Considering the frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... but A,C,N are already out, so next are O, I, S.

 We haven't tested T, I, O, S, L, etc.

 The word ""TIRED"" has T and I, which are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""SERVE"" has duplicate E -> skip.

 ""PIECE""? Duplicate E -> skip.

 Another word: ""QUEST"": Q is rare? Not ideal.

 After consideration, I think both ""REBUS"" and ""TIRED"" are good. Let me choose ""TIRED"" because T and I are more common than B and U? And we test D.

 Also, in ""CRANE"", E was at the end and now we're trying E at a different position? Position 4? That's good.

 So let's go with ""TIRED"".

 Summary: 
   We are guessing ""TIRED"".

<guess>tired</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌ R❓ A❌ N❌ E❓), we know:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.
- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent.
- The new guess must include **R** and **E**, avoid **A/C/N**, and prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) while placing R and E in unverified positions.

I chose **""tired""** because:
- Positions: R is at position 3 (new, avoiding position 2) and E is at position 4 (new, avoiding position 5).
- Letters: Tests new common consonants (**T, I, D**) while confirming **R** and **E** presence.
- Efficiency: Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.

<guess>tired</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the second guess ""tired"":
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position, not position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- D: x (not in the word)

So, combining with the first guess ""crane"":
- Correct letters: 
  - I is in the word and at position 2.
  - E is in the word and at position 4.
- Misplaced letters:
  - R is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3 are ruled out, and position 4 is taken by E? Position 4 is E, so R cannot be at 4. So R must be at position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: 
  - From first guess: C, A, N
  - From second guess: T, D
  - So absent: C, A, N, T, D

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and we have:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- R must be present and at position 1 or 5.

Now, the word structure so far:
Position 1: ? (could be R or something else, but R is a candidate for position 1 or 5)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: ? (could be R or something else)

But note: R is misplaced in both guesses, so it must be in one of the remaining positions: 1 or 5.

We also have two more letters to find: one for position 1 or 5 (if R is not there) and one for position 3.

But if R is at position 1, then position 5 is open. Similarly, if R is at position 5, then position 1 is open. And position 3 is always open.

So the word pattern: 
Option A: R I ? E ? 
Option B: ? I ? E R 

And the ? must be filled with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D and also not I or E (since I and E are already placed, but they could appear again? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we cannot assume. However, to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now.

But note: we have only two known letters: I and E. The rest are unknown.

We also know the word must contain R, and we have two positions for it.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has I at position 2 and E at position 4.
- Includes R (since it's still missing) and places it at either position 1 or 5 (to test which one).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, T, D.
- Tries to test new common letters for the remaining positions.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

First, consider the pattern: _ I _ E _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D.

And one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) must be R? Actually, R must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5 must be R? Or could R be at position 3? But wait, in the second guess, we had R at position 3 and it was marked as misplaced? That means R is in the word but not at position 3. So R cannot be at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.

So the two possibilities:
Pattern 1: R I _ E ? 
Pattern 2: ? I _ E R 

Now, the third position is open and must be a letter that is not C, A, N, T, D, and not I or E? But I and E are already in the word, but they could be duplicated? We don't know. But if we avoid duplicates, we can test more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

We need to test both possibilities and also test the third position.

We can design a guess that can help distinguish between the two patterns.

For example, if we guess a word with R at position 1, then if the feedback shows R at position 1 is correct, then pattern 1. If not, then pattern 2? But we don't have to do both at once.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a letter at position 1 that is not R and at position 5 that is not R? But then we wouldn't be testing R? But we must include R because it's a known letter? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we must include it in the guess? Otherwise, we might get a false absent? But the rules: we must include all known present letters? Not necessarily, but if we don't include R, we won't get information about its position. And we have limited guesses.

So it's better to include R in the guess.

Therefore, we must include R and place it at either position 1 or 5.

We can choose to test one of the patterns.

But we also have to test the third position.

Let me list possible words.

First, pattern 1: R I ? E ? 
We need a letter for position 3 and position 5. The letter at position 3 must not be C,A,N,T,D, and at position 5 must not be C,A,N,T,D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common ones: S, L, O, P, M, etc.

Possible words:
- R I P E ? -> but ""RIPER"" has duplicate R? And what for position 5? ""RIPER"" is 5 letters? R-I-P-E-R -> duplicate R. Not ideal? But let's see if it's a word? Yes, but we avoid duplicates for now? Because we don't know if duplicates exist.

Better: ""RIPEN"" -> but N is absent? Skip.

""RIPED"" -> D is absent? Skip.

""RICES"" -> C and S? C is absent? Skip.

""RILES"": R I L E S -> 
  Position 1: R
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

This avoids absent letters? Yes: L and S are new.

Similarly, ""RIDES"" -> D is absent? Skip.

""RIFLE"" -> F and L? But E is at position 5? But in this pattern, we have E at position 4? So ""RIFLE"" would be R-I-F-L-E? Then position 4 is L? But we need E at position 4? So that doesn't fit.

We must have E at position 4 and I at position 2.

So for pattern 1: R I ? E ? 
We need a word like: R I X E Y, where X and Y are new letters.

""RILES"": as above, X=L, Y=S -> ""RILES""

""RIPES"": R I P E S -> P and S? But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

""RIVES"": R I V E S -> V and S.

""RIDES"": D absent -> skip.

""RIGES"": not common? But ""RIG"" is a word? ""RIGES"" might not be standard.

""RICES"": C absent -> skip.

""RIFLE"": doesn't fit because E is at 5? And position 4 would be L? But we need E at 4.

So ""RILES"" and ""RIPES"" are candidates.

Now, pattern 2: ? I ? E R 
We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

For example:
- ? I ? E R

Words:
""WIPER"": W I P E R -> 
  Position 1: W
  Position 3: P

""WIDER"": D absent -> skip.

""WISER"": W I S E R -> S at position 3.

""MINER"": M I N E R -> N absent -> skip.

""LIKER"": L I K E R -> K at position 3.

""LIBER"": L I B E R -> B at position 3.

""LINER"": N absent -> skip.

""LIVER"": L I V E R -> V at position 3.

""PIPER"": P I P E R -> duplicate P? Skip? Or not? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But to test, we can avoid.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> L at position 3.

Now, we have two patterns. We need to choose a guess that can help us determine which pattern is correct.

We can choose a word that fits one pattern and see the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 (pattern 2) and then if we get R at position 5 correct, then we know. If not, then pattern 1 must be true? But we have to include R.

But note: if we guess a word with R at position 5, and if the feedback shows R at position 5 is correct, then we know pattern 2. If it shows R is misplaced, then R must be at position 1? Because position 3 is already ruled out? And position 2 and 4 are taken? So if R is misplaced at position 5, then it must be at position 1? But position 1 is the only other possibility? Yes, because positions 2,3,4 are either fixed or ruled out for R.

Similarly, if we put R at position 1 and it's correct, then pattern 1. If misplaced, then pattern 2.

So we can test by placing R at one of the positions.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me choose to test pattern 2: put R at position 5.

So guess a word of the form: ? I ? E R

And we need to choose letters for position 1 and 3 that are new and common.

For example, ""WISER"": W at1, I at2, S at3, E at4, R at5.

This tests:
- W at position 1: if correct, then W is in the word and at position 1? But if pattern 2 is correct, then position 1 is not R, so it could be W? But if pattern 2 is not correct, then position 1 should be R? So if we get W as absent, then pattern 2 is false? But if W is present but wrong position? Then it might be complicated.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and a new letter at position 3, and a letter at position 1 that we don't care about? But we have to use valid words.

Another idea: use a word that has the same letter at position 1 and 5? But that would be duplicate? Not necessary.

Let's think about the feedback we'll get.

If we guess ""WISER"":
- If the word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and the ? are W and S, then we get all correct? But we don't know.
- If the word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:
   - Position 1: we have W, but should be R -> so W is absent? Or if the word has W? But we don't know.
   - Position 5: we have R, but in pattern 1, position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be misplaced? But in pattern 1, R is at position 1, so position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be marked as absent? Or misplaced? 

Wait, if the word is pattern 1: R I ? E ? (with R at1), then in ""WISER"":
   - W at position 1: not R, and if W is not in the word, then W: x
   - I at2: correct -> ✓
   - S at3: ? 
   - E at4: correct -> ✓
   - R at5: but the word has R at position 1, so R is in the word? But at position 5? It's not at position 5? So R would be marked as '-' (misplaced) because it's in the word but not at position 5? But the word already has R at position 1? So the feedback for R at5: since the word has one R (at position 1) and we put R at position 5, it should be marked as '-' (misplaced) because the R is present but not at that position? But what if the word has two R's? We don't know.

The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences? Actually, in Wordle, if there is one R and we put two R's, then one might be correct and the other misplaced? But in this case, if the word has only one R (at position 1), then in ""WISER"", the R at position 5 would be marked as '-'? Or if the word has two R's? But we don't know.

This might be ambiguous.

To avoid confusion, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? So that the feedback is clear.

So for pattern 2 guess, let's choose a word with distinct letters.

For example, ""WISER"" has distinct letters? W,I,S,E,R -> distinct.

Similarly, for pattern 1, ""RILES"" has distinct letters.

But we are going to guess one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that's hard.

Given that we have two possibilities for R, we can choose to test R at position 1.

Let me choose to test pattern 1: R at position 1.

Guess a word like ""R I ? E ?"" with distinct letters.

For example, ""RILES"": R I L E S

If we guess ""RILES"":
- If the word is pattern 1 (R at1) and the third letter is L and fifth is S, then we win? But we don't know.
- If the word is pattern 1 but L or S is wrong, we get feedback.
- If the word is pattern 2 (R not at1, but at5), then:
   - Position 1: R -> but the word has R at5, so R at1 is misplaced? So we get R: '-' at position 1.
   - Position 2: I: ✓
   - Position 3: L: ? 
   - Position 4: E: ✓
   - Position 5: S: ? 

But if the word is pattern 2, then position 5 is R, so S at position 5 would be wrong? And if the word has S? Then S might be misplaced or absent.

This might also be ambiguous.

But note: we have to make a choice.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and also tests a common letter at position 1 and 3.

But let's look for a word that might be more informative.

We know that position 3 is unknown and we haven't tested many letters.

We can choose a word that has a common letter at position 3 and then R at position 5.

For example, ""P I ? E R"" -> ""PIPER"" has duplicate P? Skip.

""L I ? E R"" -> ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> distinct letters.

""LIVER"" is a word.

If we guess ""LIVER"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I (correct)
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R

Now, if the secret word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:
   - L at1: absent or misplaced? 
   - V at3: ?
   - R at5: since the word has R at1, R at5 would be misplaced? But if the word has only one R, then R at5 is misplaced? And L and V are new.

If the secret word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and if the word is ""LIVER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

But if we get feedback for ""LIVER"":
- If I and E are correct (which they will be), and R at5 is correct, then we know it's pattern 2 and the word is ""LIVER"" if V and L are also correct.
- If R at5 is misplaced, then it must be pattern 1 (R at1) and then L and V are to be checked.

Also, if R at5 is correct, then we know the word ends with R, and we have L and V to consider.

But if R at5 is misplaced, then we know R must be at position 1, and then we have L and V to check.

So ""LIVER"" seems like a good guess because it tests both R positions and two new letters.

Similarly, we could choose ""WISER"" or ""RILES"", but ""LIVER"" is also good.

Another common word: ""S I ? E R"" -> ""SIVER""? Not a word. ""SIZER"": S I Z E R -> Z is less common.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> distinct.

But ""LIVER"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""LIVER"".

But let's confirm the absent letters: we must avoid C,A,N,T,D. ""LIVER"" has L,I,V,E,R -> no absent letters? I and E are allowed, and L,V,R are new and not absent.

So guess: ""LIVER""

<guess>liver</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(absent), R(misplaced), A(absent), N(absent), E(misplaced)  
  → **Key insights**:  
    - R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 5.  
    - C, A, N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: TIRED**  
  Feedback: T(absent), I(correct position), R(misplaced), E(correct position), D(absent)  
  → **Key insights**:  
    - I is confirmed at position 2.  
    - E is confirmed at position 4.  
    - R is misplaced (not in position 3, and previously not in position 2).  
    - T and D are absent.  
    - R must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are invalid for R).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **I**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
- **Misplaced letter**:  
  - **R** (must be at position 1 or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, D (avoid these).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 5 (if R is not at 5).  
- **Untested common letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include R** to test its position (1 or 5).  
- **Test new common letters** for unknown positions (e.g., L, V).  
- **Avoid absent letters** and duplicates (maximize information).  
- **Prioritize words** that fit the pattern `_ I _ E _` with R at position 5 (to resolve ambiguity quickly).  

Chose **LIVER** because:  
- Fits the pattern: `L I V E R` → Tests R at position 5.  
- Tests **L** (position 1) and **V** (position 3), two new common letters.  
- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback.  
- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, T, D).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If R is at position 5 (correct), the word ends with R.  
- If R is misplaced, it must be at position 1 (since positions 2–4 are invalid).  
- Feedback on L and V will reveal their presence/absence.

But note: if we put R at position 5, that might be acceptable since the feedback only said R wasn\'t at position 2. Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, we are not restricted on other positions, so we could have R at 1,3,4,5 and E at 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let\'s list some words that have R and E, and no A, C, N.\n\n Some candidates:\n - ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because of previous feedback? Wait, in ""CRANE"", R was at position 2 and that was wrong, so in the new word, we must avoid R at position 2.\n\n ""TRIBE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2 -> but we cannot have R at position 2. So skip.\n\n - ""ROUTE"": R at 1, O, U, T, E at 5 -> E at position 5 is not allowed? Because in ""CRANE"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. So we cannot have E at position 5. Therefore, ""ROUTE"" would have E at position 5 -> invalid for E position.\n\n - ""RIDER"": R at 1, I, D, E at 4, R at 5 -> has E at position 4? Then E is not at 5. And R at 1: which is a new position. But note: the word has two R\'s? That\'s acceptable if the secret word has two R\'s. However, our feedback only indicated one R? Wait, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed one R and one E. But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don\'t know.\n\n However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed:\n   R: in the word but wrong position (only one R was present and it was at position 2). If the word had two R\'s, then one of them might have been in the right position? But in ""CRANE"" we only had one R. So the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates because we only provided one R. The secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Since the feedback only marked one R as present (with wrong position), it\'s possible the secret word has at least one R. Similarly for E.\n\n So when guessing, we can use words with duplicate letters if needed, but to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now to check more letters.\n\n Let\'s avoid duplicates for this guess.\n\n Try words with letters: R, E, and three new letters.\n\n Words:\n - ""RIPER""? Duplicate R -> avoid.\n - ""POLER""? P, O, L, E, R -> but E at position 4? and R at 5? Then E is not at 5? Wait: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> E at 4, R at 5. And R at 5: we don\'t know if that\'s acceptable because previous feedback only forbade R at position 2. So R at 5 is new. Also E at 4: not position 5, so okay. But the word ""POLER"" is not very common? Maybe not.\n\n Looking for common words:\n - ""ROBES"": R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S -> E at position 4 is acceptable (not 5). R at position 1 (new). Letters: R, O, B, E, S -> all new except R and E, and no A, C, N.\n\n ""ROBES"": \n   Position 1: R -> hasn\'t been tried at position 1? We haven\'t tested position 1 because our first guess had C at position 1 and it was absent. But that doesn\'t mean R cannot be at position 1. Actually, we know the secret word contains R, but not at position 2. Position 1 is a candidate.\n\n - ""RODEO""? But that has O at the end? Wait, 5 letters? Yes, R-O-D-E-O -> but that has two O\'s? Not ideal for information. Also, E at position 4? Then O at 5? But we don\'t have information about O.\n\n Alternatively: ""SERVE""? S, E, R, V, E -> duplicate E? Avoid.\n\n ""TIMER"": T, I, M, E, R -> E at position 4? and R at position 5. So E is at 4 (not 5) and R at 5 (not 2). Letters: T, I, M, E, R -> all new? Yes, and no duplicates.\n\n ""TIMER"": \n   T at 1, I at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if M is in the word? We\'ll get information.\n\n Another common word: ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at position 3, E at position 4. Let\'s check positions:\n   Position 1: T (new)\n   Position 2: I (new)\n   Position 3: R -> we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 3? It\'s a new position, so okay.\n   Position 4: E -> not position 5, okay.\n   Position 5: D (new)\n\n Also, ""TIRED"" has distinct letters and avoids A,C,N.\n\n Which one is better? ""TIMER"" or ""TIRED""?\n\n Both have T, I, and then either M or D. Both are good.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think: we want to cover more common letters? S is a very common letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\n Consider ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> \n   Position 1: R (okay, not position 2)\n   Position 2: O (new)\n   Position 3: U (new)\n   Position 4: S (new)\n   Position 5: E -> but E at position 5 is forbidden! Because previous feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at position 5 in any guess? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not the correct position for E. However, if we put E at 5, we expect it to be marked as \'-\' again? But we want to avoid known wrong positions to potentially find a right position.\n\n So it\'s better not to put E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is invalid because it has E at position 5.\n\n What about ""RISKY""? But E is required? We must use E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n How about ""RIDER""? We decided to avoid duplicates, but let\'s see: R at 1 and another R at 4? Then E would be missing. We must include E.\n\n So, back to:\n\n Option 1: ""TIMER"" -> T,I,M,E,R -> E at 4 and R at 5: both in new positions.\n Option 2: ""TIRED"" -> T,I,R,E,D -> R at 3 and E at 4: both in new positions.\n\n Which letters are more common? \n   T: very common, I: common, M: less common than D? D is more common? \n   Actually, we don\'t know, but D and M are both worth testing.\n\n However, note that we also have E to test in a new position (currently at 4 in both). \n\n Another option: ""BREED""? Duplicate E -> skip.\n\n ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> \n   Position 1: D (new), \n   Position 2: R -> we cannot have R at position 2? So forbidden? Yes, because previous feedback said R is not at position 2.\n\n So we cannot use any word with R at position 2.\n\n Similarly, in ""TIRED"", R is at position 3 -> okay.\n In ""TIMER"", R is at position 5 -> okay.\n\n Another idea: ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D -> \n   Position 3: R -> okay? \n   Position 4: E -> okay? \n   But has S and H which are common.\n\n However, ""SHRED"" has R at position 3 and E at position 4 -> acceptable.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has S, H, R, E, D.\n\n We are free to choose. I think ""SHRED"" is a good word? Let me check: common, distinct letters.\n\n But wait: we haven\'t tested S or H? So yes, that would be good.\n\n However, compare to ""TIRED"": \n   ""TIRED"": T (new), I (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> we test T, I, D and confirm R and E are still present but in new positions.\n   ""SHRED"": S (new), H (new), R (known), E (known), D (new) -> tests S, H, D.\n\n D is common, but S and H are also common.\n\n Another candidate: ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> \n   Position 1: P? \n   Position 2: E -> This is a new position for E? Previously E was at 5, now at position 2. That\'s acceptable? Yes, because E cannot be at 5 only. Position 2 might be correct? \n   Position 3: R -> acceptable? Yes.\n\n But note: in ""PERKY"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3. However, we must avoid R at position 2, but E at position 2 is new.\n\n Letters: P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct? Yes.\n\n So ""PERKY"" is also acceptable and tests P, K, Y.\n\n Now, what\'s the best? We need to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, R, L, N (but N is out), D, M, etc. Since we haven\'t tested S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words (without A,C,N):\n\n We can try:\n\n - Words with S, T, or L.\n\n ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> \n   Position 1: S? \n   Position 2: T? \n   Position 3: O? \n   Position 4: R? -> But R: we know R is in the word, but can we put it at position 4? That\'s acceptable. \n   Position 5: E -> forbidden? E at position 5 is not allowed. So no.\n\n ""STARE"": but A is forbidden? A is in ""STARE"", which is not allowed because we know A is absent? But we must use words without A? That\'s right, the word we guess must not contain letters we know are absent to avoid wasting a guess? Actually, we can guess words with absent letters? But that would be inefficient because we\'ll get \'x\' and learn nothing new? Therefore, it\'s better to avoid known absent letters (A, C, N).\n\n So we avoid words with A, C, N.\n\n Replace ""STARE"" with ""STORE"": but E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n ""STONE"": contains N -> skip.\n\n ""SLATE"": contains A -> skip.\n\n Another idea: ""DRIVE"": but R at position 2 -> forbidden.\n\n ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> \n   Positions: D at1, R at2? -> no, R at2 forbidden.\n\n How about ""RIFLE"": R at1, I, F, L, E -> \n   Position 1: R -> okay\n   Position 2: I -> not R, okay\n   Position 3: F\n   Position 4: L\n   Position 5: E -> forbidden? Yes, cannot have E at position 5. So skip.\n\n Then, let\'s consider words that end with a letter other than E? So E must be at positions 1-4.\n\n We can try:\n\n - ""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at5 -> skip.\n - ""RUDER"": R at1, U, D, E at4, R at5 -> duplicate R? Skip.\n\n How about ""RESIN"": but has N -> skip.\n\n ""REBUS"": R at1, E at2, B, U, S -> \n   Position 2: E -> we haven\'t tried E at position 2? And R at position 1: acceptable? \n   Because R was previously only excluded from position 2? Position 1 is new.\n\n Also, the word ""REBUS"" exists? Yes.\n\n But note: we must check that it doesn\'t contain A,C,N? It has R,E,B,U,S -> no forbidden letters.\n\n Positions:\n   R: position 1 -> new position? Previously in ""CRANE"" R was at 2, so position 1 is open.\n   E: position 2 -> we haven\'t tried E at this position? And we know E is not at position 5, but position 2? Could be correct? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing E at a new position (position 2) which is good.\n\n Letters: R (known), E (known), B (new), U (new), S (new).\n\n That gives us three new letters: B, U, S.\n\n This is a good option.\n\n But let\'s see another word: ""RESET""? Duplicate E -> skip.\n\n ""REIGN"": but G and N? N is forbidden -> skip.\n\n ""RISEN"": contains N -> skip.\n\n After considering several words, I found:\n   ""REBUS"": R,E,B,U,S -> positions: (1)R, (2)E, (3)B, (4)U, (5)S -> E is at position 2? That\'s acceptable? But wait: E is at position 2, which is a new position? And we avoid E at position 5.\n\n But how about the R at position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? It might be.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to have E at position 2? There\'s no restriction from previous feedback? We only know that E is not at position 5.\n\n So ""REBUS"" seems valid.\n\n But compare to ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> positions: R at3, E at4.\n\n Which one tests more common letters? \n   ""REBUS"" tests: B,U,S (and R,E)\n   ""TIRED"" tests: T,I,D (and R,E)\n\n Common letters: Among the new letters in ""REBUS"": S is very common, B and U less so? \n In ""TIRED"": T and I are very common, D moderately common.\n\n Another word: ""LOWER"": L,O,W,E,R -> \n   Positions: L1, O2, W3, E4, R5 -> \n     E at4? okay (not 5). R at5? new position? okay? \n   Letters: L,O,W,E,R -> distinct, and avoids forbidden.\n\n Tests L, O, W.\n\n But L, O, W are not as common as S and T? \n\n Considering the frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... but A,C,N are already out, so next are O, I, S.\n\n We haven\'t tested T, I, O, S, L, etc.\n\n The word ""TIRED"" has T and I, which are high frequency.\n\n Alternatively, ""SERVE"" has duplicate E -> skip.\n\n ""PIECE""? Duplicate E -> skip.\n\n Another word: ""QUEST"": Q is rare? Not ideal.\n\n After consideration, I think both ""REBUS"" and ""TIRED"" are good. Let me choose ""TIRED"" because T and I are more common than B and U? And we test D.\n\n Also, in ""CRANE"", E was at the end and now we\'re trying E at a different position? Position 4? That\'s good.\n\n So let\'s go with ""TIRED"".\n\n Summary: \n   We are guessing ""TIRED"".\n\n<guess>tired</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌ R❓ A❌ N❌ E❓), we know:\n- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.\n- The letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent.\n- The new guess must include **R** and **E**, avoid **A/C/N**, and prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) while placing R and E in unverified positions.\n\nI chose **""tired""** because:\n- Positions: R is at position 3 (new, avoiding position 2) and E is at position 4 (new, avoiding position 5).\n- Letters: Tests new common consonants (**T, I, D**) while confirming **R** and **E** presence.\n- Efficiency: Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the second guess ""tired"":\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- I: ✓ (correct position, position 2)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position, not position 3)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, combining with the first guess ""crane"":\n- Correct letters: \n  - I is in the word and at position 2.\n  - E is in the word and at position 4.\n- Misplaced letters:\n  - R is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3 are ruled out, and position 4 is taken by E? Position 4 is E, so R cannot be at 4.

(could be R or something else)\n\nBut note: R is misplaced in both guesses, so it must be in one of the remaining positions: 1 or 5.\n\nWe also have two more letters to find: one for position 1 or 5 (if R is not there) and one for position 3.\n\nBut if R is at position 1, then position 5 is open. Similarly, if R is at position 5, then position 1 is open. And position 3 is always open.\n\nSo the word pattern: \nOption A: R I ? E ? \nOption B: ? I ? E R \n\nAnd the ? must be filled with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D and also not I or E (since I and E are already placed, but they could appear again? However, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far. But we cannot assume. However, to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut note: we have only two known letters: I and E. The rest are unknown.\n\nWe also know the word must contain R, and we have two positions for it.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess that:\n- Has I at position 2 and E at position 4.\n- Includes R (since it\'s still missing) and places it at either position 1 or 5 (to test which one).\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, T, D.\n- Tries to test new common letters for the remaining positions.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern.\n\nFirst, consider the pattern: _ I _ E _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, T, D.\n\nAnd one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) must be R? Actually, R must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5 must be R? Or could R be at position 3? But wait, in the second guess, we had R at position 3 and it was marked as misplaced? That means R is in the word but not at position 3. So R cannot be at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nSo the two possibilities:\nPattern 1: R I _ E ? \nPattern 2: ? I _ E R \n\nNow, the third position is open and must be a letter that is not C, A, N, T, D, and not I or E? But I and E are already in the word, but they could be duplicated? We don\'t know. But if we avoid duplicates, we can test more letters.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nWe need to test both possibilities and also test the third position.\n\nWe can design a guess that can help distinguish between the two patterns.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word with R at position 1, then if the feedback shows R at position 1 is correct, then pattern 1. If not, then pattern 2? But we don\'t have to do both at once.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has a letter at position 1 that is not R and at position 5 that is not R? But then we wouldn\'t be testing R? But we must include R because it\'s a known letter? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we must include it in the guess? Otherwise, we might get a false absent? But the rules: we must include all known present letters? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t include R, we won\'t get information about its position. And we have limited guesses.\n\nSo it\'s better to include R in the guess.\n\nTherefore, we must include R and place it at either position 1 or 5.\n\nWe can choose to test one of the patterns.\n\nBut we also have to test the third position.\n\nLet me list possible words.\n\nFirst, pattern 1: R I ? E ? \nWe need a letter for position 3 and position 5. The letter at position 3 must not be C,A,N,T,D, and at position 5 must not be C,A,N,T,D.\n\nCommon letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common ones: S, L, O, P, M, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- R I P E ? -> but ""RIPER"" has duplicate R? And what for position 5? ""RIPER"" is 5 letters? R-I-P-E-R -> duplicate R. Not ideal? But let\'s see if it\'s a word? Yes, but we avoid duplicates for now? Because we don\'t know if duplicates exist.\n\nBetter: ""RIPEN"" -> but N is absent? Skip.\n\n""RIPED"" -> D is absent? Skip.\n\n""RICES"" -> C and S? C is absent? Skip.\n\n""RILES"": R I L E S -> \n  Position 1: R\n  Position 2: I\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: S\n\nThis avoids absent letters? Yes: L and S are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""RIDES"" -> D is absent? Skip.\n\n""RIFLE"" -> F and L? But E is at position 5? But in this pattern, we have E at position 4? So ""RIFLE"" would be R-I-F-L-E? Then position 4 is L? But we need E at position 4? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have E at position 4 and I at position 2.\n\nSo for pattern 1: R I ? E ? \nWe need a word like: R I X E Y, where X and Y are new letters.\n\n""RILES"": as above, X=L, Y=S -> ""RILES""\n\n""RIPES"": R I P E S -> P and S? But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.\n\n""RIVES"": R I V E S -> V and S.\n\n""RIDES"": D absent -> skip.\n\n""RIGES"": not common? But ""RIG"" is a word? ""RIGES"" might not be standard.\n\n""RICES"": C absent -> skip.\n\n""RIFLE"": doesn\'t fit because E is at 5? And position 4 would be L? But we need E at 4.\n\nSo ""RILES"" and ""RIPES"" are candidates.\n\nNow, pattern 2: ? I ? E R \nWe need a letter for position 1 and position 3.\n\nFor example:\n- ? I ? E R\n\nWords:\n""WIPER"": W I P E R -> \n  Position 1: W\n  Position 3: P\n\n""WIDER"": D absent -> skip.\n\n""WISER"": W I S E R -> S at position 3.\n\n""MINER"": M I N E R -> N absent -> skip.\n\n""LIKER"": L I K E R -> K at position 3.\n\n""LIBER"": L I B E R -> B at position 3.\n\n""LINER"": N absent -> skip.\n\n""LIVER"": L I V E R -> V at position 3.\n\n""PIPER"": P I P E R -> duplicate P? Skip? Or not? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But to test, we can avoid.\n\n""FILER"": F I L E R -> L at position 3.\n\nNow, we have two patterns. We need to choose a guess that can help us determine which pattern is correct.\n\nWe can choose a word that fits one pattern and see the feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 (pattern 2) and then if we get R at position 5 correct, then we know. If not, then pattern 1 must be true? But we have to include R.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word with R at position 5, and if the feedback shows R at position 5 is correct, then we know pattern 2. If it shows R is misplaced, then R must be at position 1? Because position 3 is already ruled out? And position 2 and 4 are taken? So if R is misplaced at position 5, then it must be at position 1? But position 1 is the only other possibility? Yes, because positions 2,3,4 are either fixed or ruled out for R.\n\nSimilarly, if we put R at position 1 and it\'s correct, then pattern 1. If misplaced, then pattern 2.\n\nSo we can test by placing R at one of the positions.\n\nBut we also need to test the other positions.\n\nLet me choose to test pattern 2: put R at position 5.\n\nSo guess a word of the form: ? I ? E R\n\nAnd we need to choose letters for position 1 and 3 that are new and common.\n\nFor example, ""WISER"": W at1, I at2, S at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nThis tests:\n- W at position 1: if correct, then W is in the word and at position 1? But if pattern 2 is correct, then position 1 is not R, so it could be W? But if pattern 2 is not correct, then position 1 should be R? So if we get W as absent, then pattern 2 is false? But if W is present but wrong position? Then it might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and a new letter at position 3, and a letter at position 1 that we don\'t care about? But we have to use valid words.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has the same letter at position 1 and 5? But that would be duplicate? Not necessary.\n\nLet\'s think about the feedback we\'ll get.\n\nIf we guess ""WISER"":\n- If the word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and the ? are W and S, then we get all correct? But we don\'t know.\n- If the word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:\n   - Position 1: we have W, but should be R -> so W is absent? Or if the word has W? But we don\'t know.\n   - Position 5: we have R, but in pattern 1, position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be misplaced? But in pattern 1, R is at position 1, so position 5 is not R? So R at position 5 would be marked as absent? Or misplaced? \n\nWait, if the word is pattern 1: R I ? E ? (with R at1), then in ""WISER"":\n   - W at position 1: not R, and if W is not in the word, then W: x\n   - I at2: correct -> ✓\n   - S at3: ? \n   - E at4: correct -> ✓\n   - R at5: but the word has R at position 1, so R is in the word? But at position 5? It\'s not at position 5? So R would be marked as \'-\' (misplaced) because it\'s in the word but not at position 5? But the word already has R at position 1? So the feedback for R at5: since the word has one R (at position 1) and we put R at position 5, it should be marked as \'-\' (misplaced) because the R is present but not at that position? But what if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nThe feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences? Actually, in Wordle, if there is one R and we put two R\'s, then one might be correct and the other misplaced? But in this case, if the word has only one R (at position 1), then in ""WISER"", the R at position 5 would be marked as \'-\'? Or if the word has two R\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis might be ambiguous.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have duplicate letters? So that the feedback is clear.\n\nSo for pattern 2 guess, let\'s choose a word with distinct letters.\n\nFor example, ""WISER"" has distinct letters? W,I,S,E,R -> distinct.\n\nSimilarly, for pattern 1, ""RILES"" has distinct letters.\n\nBut we are going to guess one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that\'s hard.\n\nGiven that we have two possibilities for R, we can choose to test R at position 1.\n\nLet me choose to test pattern 1: R at position 1.\n\nGuess a word like ""R I ? E ?"" with distinct letters.\n\nFor example, ""RILES"": R I L E S\n\nIf we guess ""RILES"":\n- If the word is pattern 1 (R at1) and the third letter is L and fifth is S, then we win? But we don\'t know.\n- If the word is pattern 1 but L or S is wrong, we get feedback.\n- If the word is pattern 2 (R not at1, but at5), then:\n   - Position 1: R -> but the word has R at5, so R at1 is misplaced? So we get R: \'-\' at position 1.\n   - Position 2: I: ✓\n   - Position 3: L: ? \n   - Position 4: E: ✓\n   - Position 5: S: ? \n\nBut if the word is pattern 2, then position 5 is R, so S at position 5 would be wrong? And if the word has S? Then S might be misplaced or absent.\n\nThis might also be ambiguous.\n\nBut note: we have to make a choice.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has R at position 5 and also tests a common letter at position 1 and 3.\n\nBut let\'s look for a word that might be more informative.\n\nWe know that position 3 is unknown and we haven\'t tested many letters.\n\nWe can choose a word that has a common letter at position 3 and then R at position 5.\n\nFor example, ""P I ? E R"" -> ""PIPER"" has duplicate P? Skip.\n\n""L I ? E R"" -> ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> distinct letters.\n\n""LIVER"" is a word.\n\nIf we guess ""LIVER"":\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: I (correct)\n- Position 3: V\n- Position 4: E (correct)\n- Position 5: R\n\nNow, if the secret word is pattern 1 (R I ? E ?), then:\n   - L at1: absent or misplaced? \n   - V at3: ?\n   - R at5: since the word has R at1, R at5 would be misplaced? But if the word has only one R, then R at5 is misplaced? And L and V are new.\n\nIf the secret word is pattern 2 (e.g., ? I ? E R) and if the word is ""LIVER"", then we get all correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut if we get feedback for ""LIVER"":\n- If I and E are correct (which they will be), and R at5 is correct, then we know it\'s pattern 2 and the word is ""LIVER"" if V and L are also correct.\n- If R at5 is misplaced, then it must be pattern 1 (R at1) and then L and V are to be checked.\n\nAlso, if R at5 is correct, then we know the word ends with R, and we have L and V to consider.\n\nBut if R at5 is misplaced, then we know R must be at position 1, and then we have L and V to check.\n\nSo ""LIVER"" seems like a good guess because it tests both R positions and two new letters.\n\nSimilarly, we could choose ""WISER"" or ""RILES"", but ""LIVER"" is also good.\n\nAnother common word: ""S I ? E R"" -> ""SIVER""? Not a word. ""SIZER"": S I Z E R -> Z is less common.\n\n""FILER"": F I L E R -> distinct.\n\nBut ""LIVER"" is more common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LIVER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the absent letters: we must avoid C,A,N,T,D. ""LIVER"" has L,I,V,E,R -> no absent letters? I and E are allowed, and L,V,R are new and not absent.\n\nSo guess: ""LIVER""\n\n<guess>liver</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(absent), R(misplaced), A(absent), N(absent), E(misplaced)  \n  → **Key insights**:  \n    - R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 5.  \n    - C, A, N are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: TIRED**  \n  Feedback: T(absent), I(correct position), R(misplaced), E(correct position), D(absent)  \n  → **Key insights**:  \n    - I is confirmed at position 2.  \n    - E is confirmed at position 4.  \n    - R is misplaced (not in position 3, and previously not in position 2).  \n    - T and D are absent.  \n    - R must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are invalid for R).  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed positions**:  \n  - Position 2: **I**  \n  - Position 4: **E**  \n- **Misplaced letter**:  \n  - **R** (must be at position 1 or 5).  \n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, D (avoid these).  \n- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 5 (if R is not at 5).  \n- **Untested common letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include R** to test its position (1 or 5).  \n- **Test new common letters** for unknown positions (e.g., L, V).  \n- **Avoid absent letters** and duplicates (maximize information).  \n- **Prioritize words** that fit the pattern `_ I _ E _` with R at position 5 (to resolve ambiguity quickly).  \n\nChose **LIVER** because:  \n- Fits the pattern: `L I V E R` → Tests R at position 5.  \n- Tests **L** (position 1) and **V** (position 3), two new common letters.  \n- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback.  \n- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, T, D).  \n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n- If R is at position 5 (correct), the word ends with R.  \n- If R is misplaced, it must be at position 1 (since positions 2–4 are invalid).  \n- Feedback on L and V will reveal their presence/absence.\n\n<guess>liver</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: liver -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from Guess 3: ""liver"" -> L(-) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Breaking this down:
- L: misplaced (in the word but wrong position)
- I: correct position (position 2)
- V: absent (not in the word)
- E: correct position (position 4)
- R: correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L, but not at position 1.
- V is not in the word.
- I is at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.
- From previous guesses:
  - We know the word contains R (now at position 5), E (position 4), I (position 2), and L (somewhere not position 1).
  - We also know from Guess 1 that R was not at position 2, and now we know it's at position 5.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, D, V.

The word structure so far:
Position 1: ? (cannot be L, and must not be absent letters, but L is present though misplaced at position 1)
Position 2: I
Position 3: ? (we don't know yet)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Because L is in the word but not at position 1, and since positions 2,4,5 are fixed (I,E,R), L must be at position 3? Or could it be duplicated elsewhere? But we don't have any duplication indicated so far.

Let's list the positions:
- Pos 2: I (fixed)
- Pos 4: E (fixed)
- Pos 5: R (fixed)
- Pos 1: unknown, but cannot be L (since L is misplaced at pos1) and not absent letters.
- Pos 3: unknown, but L must be in the word, so it could be at position 3? Or possibly duplicated? But let's assume no duplicates for now to minimize risk.

So the secret word pattern: _ I ? E R

And we know L is in the word, so it must be at position 3? Because the other positions:
- Pos 1: cannot be L because L was guessed at position 1 and marked misplaced? So L is not at position 1.
- Pos 2: I, so not L.
- Pos 4: E, not L.
- Pos 5: R, not L.

Therefore, L must be at position 3? That seems forced.

But could there be duplicate L? Maybe, but if not, then position 3 must be L.

Moreover, position 1 is the only other unknown, and we need a letter that is not in the absent list and not L? But if L is at position 3, then position 1 must be another letter.

Absent letters: C, A, N, T, D, V.

So possible letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L is at position 3? Or we suspect.

Let me confirm with the feedback.

The word must have the letter L. Since in ""liver"" we had L at position 1 and it was marked as misplaced, meaning L is in the word but not at position 1. So L must be in one of the other positions. But positions 2,4,5 are occupied by I,E,R respectively? So position 3 is the only position left? Therefore, L must be at position 3.

Yes, unless there is duplication? For example, if the word has two L's? But we have no evidence. Moreover, in previous guesses, we have not seen duplication. But to be safe, we can consider that L might be duplicated? But it's less likely.

Therefore, the word is: _ I L E R

Position 1 is the only letter left to find.

So the secret word is: ? I L E R

We need to guess a word of the form X I L E R, where X is a letter not in absent list and not L? L is already at position 3.

Position 1 must be a letter that is present? Not necessarily, but it must complete the word.

The word XILER? That might not be a word? Let's think.

Common words ending with ""ILER"": 
- ""SILER""? Not common.
- ""FILER""? We had that? But F is not absent? 
- ""WILER""? Not common.
- ""MILER""? Yes, a miler is a runner? But let's confirm: MILER.

So ""MILER"": M I L E R

Similarly, ""FILER"": F I L E R
""TILER"": T is absent? Skip.
""BILER""? Not common.

So candidates: ""FILER"", ""MILER"", ""SILER"" (but rare), ""HILER"" (rare).

But in our pattern, position 3 is L? But in ""FILER"", the letters are F, I, L, E, R -> which matches.

Similarly, ""MILER"": M, I, L, E, R.

Now, we need to test position 1? We have two options: F or M? Or others? But we don't know which one? We need to guess.

We have 4 guesses left? Let's see: after guess 3, we have guesses 4,5,6.

We can guess one of these.

But we also want to confirm if L is indeed at position 3? In our reasoning, it must be? But let's double-check.

After ""liver"":
- L is misplaced at position 1 -> so L is in the word at another position? 
- Positions 2,4,5 are fixed? So position 3 is the only possibility? So yes.

Moreover, V is absent? So we can ignore.

So the word must be * I L E R

Now, to guess between ""FILER"", ""MILER"", etc., we need to choose one.

Since we haven't tested F or M? We can choose one? Or we can guess a word that tests both? But we can only guess one word.

So let's choose ""FILER"" because F is a common letter.

But ""MILER"" is also valid? 

Alternatively, we can think of more words.

""OILER""? O I L E R -> which is a word (as in ship or something).

""OILER"" is valid? 

So possible words: FILER, MILER, OILER, SILER (if accepted).

But SILER might not be standard? 

We should stick to common words.

Now, which one? 

We have not tested F, M, O, etc.

We can guess any? 

But if we guess ""FILER"", then if F is correct, we win? Or if not, it will tell us.

Similarly, we are taking a risk.

But we have three unknown letters? No, only one letter? Position 1.

So we can guess ""FILER"" and if F is correct, we win? If not, feedback will show misplaced or absent? But if absent, then we know F is not the letter? And then we can guess another.

With one letter to find? We can guess systematically.

But note: we have guesses 4,5,6? So three guesses? But we can narrow down.

Moreover, we know the letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily? Vowels: O is vowel? But let's list possible letters? From the absent list, we avoid C,A,N,T,D,V? So many possibilities.

We need to reduce the options? Or test with a guess.

But the word must be a valid English word? And common.

So possible words: FILER, MILER, OILER, HILER? (rare), WILER? (rare), SILER? (rare), etc.

More commonly: 
- FILER (one who files)
- MILER (one who runs miles)
- OILER (an oil tanker or something)

Also, ""SILER"" is rare? Perhaps avoid.

""BILER""? Not common? Skip.

So three candidates: F, M, O.

We can guess ""FILER"". Why? Because F is a common letter? Or we can choose ""OILER"" to test a vowel? 

But we don't have much information? 

Another word: ""KILER""? Not common? ""JILER""? Not common.

So best to guess one of these three? 

But in our previous guess ""liver"", we tested L? And now we know L must be at position 3? So we can safely guess one of these.

But to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can guess a word that tests multiple? But we can only use one guess.

Alternatively, we can guess ""FILER""? Then if F is absent, we know it must be M or O? Then we guess ""MILER"" next? Or vice versa.

Since we have 4 tries left? We are at guess 4? We can afford to test.

Let me choose ""FILER""? Because F is higher frequency than M or O? Actually, F is not the most common? But we can take a chance.

But we have O as a vowel, which might be less likely? 

Position 1: we need a letter? We have no information about other letters? So we can choose arbitrary.

I'll go with ""FILER"".

But ""FILER"": F I L E R

If the secret word is ""FILER"", then we win? Else, if F is absent, then it must be another letter? Like M or O.

Then we can guess accordingly.

So guess: ""FILER""

But note: in ""FILER"", we have F at position 1, which hasn't been tested? And if the word is ""MILER"", then F would be absent? And L is at position 3? Same for both.

Another thing: we need to ensure that we are not guessing a word with absent letters? ""FILER"" has no absent letters: F not absent, I, L, E, R are known? 

Similarly, ""MILER"" is safe? 

So yes.

Therefore, we guess ""FILER"".

<guess>filer</guess>After analyzing all feedback:

### Feedback Recap:
1. **CRANE**:  
   - R and E are in secret word (misplaced).  
   - C, A, N absent.  
2. **TIRED**:  
   - I confirmed position 2.  
   - E confirmed position 4.  
   - R misplaced (not position 3).  
   - T, D absent.  
3. **LIVER**:  
   - I (position 2) ✓, E (position 4) ✓, R (position 5) ✓ → Fixed positions.  
   - L misplaced (not position 1).  
   - V absent.  

### Insights:
- **Fixed letters/positions**:  
  - **I** at position 2.  
  - **E** at position 4.  
  - **R** at position 5.  
- **Misplaced letters**:  
  - **L** must be in the secret word, but not at position 1. The only remaining untested position is **position 3** (since positions 2/4/5 are fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, D, V.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I L E R` (L inferred at position 3).  
- **Position 1** must be a letter **not absent** and **not L**.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Guess a valid word fitting `_ I L E R` pattern.  
- Test likely candidates: Common words include **FILER**, **MILER**, **OILER**.  
- Prioritize **FILER** because:  
  - **F** is a common untested consonant.  
  - Avoids redundancies and absent letters.  
- If wrong, feedback will confirm absence/presence of **F**, narrowing options to **MILER**/**OILER**.

Based on the feedback from all guesses, the secret word pattern is `_ I L E R`, where:

- Position 3 must be **L** (it was misplaced in position 1 and is the only possible slot).
- Position 4 is **E** (fixed).
- Position 5 is **R** (fixed).
- Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter not in `C, A, N, T, D, V` (absent letters) and not **L**.

Possible words fitting this pattern include **FILER**, **MILER**, and **OILER**. I chose **FILER** because:
- **F** is a common untested consonant that maximizes information gain.
- If **F** is correct, we solve the word; if absent, it eliminates one candidate (narrowing to **MILER**/**OILER**).

<guess>filer</guess>",filer,"We have the feedback from Guess 3: ""liver"" -> L(-) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Breaking this down:
- L: misplaced (in the word but wrong position)
- I: correct position (position 2)
- V: absent (not in the word)
- E: correct position (position 4)
- R: correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L, but not at position 1.
- V is not in the word.
- I is at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.
- From previous guesses:
  - We know the word contains R (now at position 5), E (position 4), I (position 2), and L (somewhere not position 1).
  - We also know from Guess 1 that R was not at position 2, and now we know it's at position 5.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, D, V.

The word structure so far:
Position 1: ? (cannot be L, and must not be absent letters, but L is present though misplaced at position 1)
Position 2: I
Position 3: ? (we don't know yet)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Because L is in the word but not at position 1, and since positions 2,4,5 are fixed (I,E,R), L must be at position 3? Or could it be duplicated elsewhere? But we don't have any duplication indicated so far.

Let's list the positions:
- Pos 2: I (fixed)
- Pos 4: E (fixed)
- Pos 5: R (fixed)
- Pos 1: unknown, but cannot be L (since L is misplaced at pos1) and not absent letters.
- Pos 3: unknown, but L must be in the word, so it could be at position 3? Or possibly duplicated? But let's assume no duplicates for now to minimize risk.

So the secret word pattern: _ I ? E R

And we know L is in the word, so it must be at position 3? Because the other positions:
- Pos 1: cannot be L because L was guessed at position 1 and marked misplaced? So L is not at position 1.
- Pos 2: I, so not L.
- Pos 4: E, not L.
- Pos 5: R, not L.

Therefore, L must be at position 3? That seems forced.

But could there be duplicate L? Maybe, but if not, then position 3 must be L.

Moreover, position 1 is the only other unknown, and we need a letter that is not in the absent list and not L? But if L is at position 3, then position 1 must be another letter.

Absent letters: C, A, N, T, D, V.

So possible letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L is at position 3? Or we suspect.

Let me confirm with the feedback.

The word must have the letter L. Since in ""liver"" we had L at position 1 and it was marked as misplaced, meaning L is in the word but not at position 1. So L must be in one of the other positions. But positions 2,4,5 are occupied by I,E,R respectively? So position 3 is the only position left? Therefore, L must be at position 3.

Yes, unless there is duplication? For example, if the word has two L's? But we have no evidence. Moreover, in previous guesses, we have not seen duplication. But to be safe, we can consider that L might be duplicated? But it's less likely.

Therefore, the word is: _ I L E R

Position 1 is the only letter left to find.

So the secret word is: ? I L E R

We need to guess a word of the form X I L E R, where X is a letter not in absent list and not L? L is already at position 3.

Position 1 must be a letter that is present? Not necessarily, but it must complete the word.

The word XILER? That might not be a word? Let's think.

Common words ending with ""ILER"": 
- ""SILER""? Not common.
- ""FILER""? We had that? But F is not absent? 
- ""WILER""? Not common.
- ""MILER""? Yes, a miler is a runner? But let's confirm: MILER.

So ""MILER"": M I L E R

Similarly, ""FILER"": F I L E R
""TILER"": T is absent? Skip.
""BILER""? Not common.

So candidates: ""FILER"", ""MILER"", ""SILER"" (but rare), ""HILER"" (rare).

But in our pattern, position 3 is L? But in ""FILER"", the letters are F, I, L, E, R -> which matches.

Similarly, ""MILER"": M, I, L, E, R.

Now, we need to test position 1? We have two options: F or M? Or others? But we don't know which one? We need to guess.

We have 4 guesses left? Let's see: after guess 3, we have guesses 4,5,6.

We can guess one of these.

But we also want to confirm if L is indeed at position 3? In our reasoning, it must be? But let's double-check.

After ""liver"":
- L is misplaced at position 1 -> so L is in the word at another position? 
- Positions 2,4,5 are fixed? So position 3 is the only possibility? So yes.

Moreover, V is absent? So we can ignore.

So the word must be * I L E R

Now, to guess between ""FILER"", ""MILER"", etc., we need to choose one.

Since we haven't tested F or M? We can choose one? Or we can guess a word that tests both? But we can only guess one word.

So let's choose ""FILER"" because F is a common letter.

But ""MILER"" is also valid? 

Alternatively, we can think of more words.

""OILER""? O I L E R -> which is a word (as in ship or something).

""OILER"" is valid? 

So possible words: FILER, MILER, OILER, SILER (if accepted).

But SILER might not be standard? 

We should stick to common words.

Now, which one? 

We have not tested F, M, O, etc.

We can guess any? 

But if we guess ""FILER"", then if F is correct, we win? Or if not, it will tell us.

Similarly, we are taking a risk.

But we have three unknown letters? No, only one letter? Position 1.

So we can guess ""FILER"" and if F is correct, we win? If not, feedback will show misplaced or absent? But if absent, then we know F is not the letter? And then we can guess another.

With one letter to find? We can guess systematically.

But note: we have guesses 4,5,6? So three guesses? But we can narrow down.

Moreover, we know the letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily? Vowels: O is vowel? But let's list possible letters? From the absent list, we avoid C,A,N,T,D,V? So many possibilities.

We need to reduce the options? Or test with a guess.

But the word must be a valid English word? And common.

So possible words: FILER, MILER, OILER, HILER? (rare), WILER? (rare), SILER? (rare), etc.

More commonly: 
- FILER (one who files)
- MILER (one who runs miles)
- OILER (an oil tanker or something)

Also, ""SILER"" is rare? Perhaps avoid.

""BILER""? Not common? Skip.

So three candidates: F, M, O.

We can guess ""FILER"". Why? Because F is a common letter? Or we can choose ""OILER"" to test a vowel? 

But we don't have much information? 

Another word: ""KILER""? Not common? ""JILER""? Not common.

So best to guess one of these three? 

But in our previous guess ""liver"", we tested L? And now we know L must be at position 3? So we can safely guess one of these.

But to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can guess a word that tests multiple? But we can only use one guess.

Alternatively, we can guess ""FILER""? Then if F is absent, we know it must be M or O? Then we guess ""MILER"" next? Or vice versa.

Since we have 4 tries left? We are at guess 4? We can afford to test.

Let me choose ""FILER""? Because F is higher frequency than M or O? Actually, F is not the most common? But we can take a chance.

But we have O as a vowel, which might be less likely? 

Position 1: we need a letter? We have no information about other letters? So we can choose arbitrary.

I'll go with ""FILER"".

But ""FILER"": F I L E R

If the secret word is ""FILER"", then we win? Else, if F is absent, then it must be another letter? Like M or O.

Then we can guess accordingly.

So guess: ""FILER""

But note: in ""FILER"", we have F at position 1, which hasn't been tested? And if the word is ""MILER"", then F would be absent? And L is at position 3? Same for both.

Another thing: we need to ensure that we are not guessing a word with absent letters? ""FILER"" has no absent letters: F not absent, I, L, E, R are known? 

Similarly, ""MILER"" is safe? 

So yes.

Therefore, we guess ""FILER"".

<guess>filer</guess>After analyzing all feedback:

### Feedback Recap:
1. **CRANE**:  
   - R and E are in secret word (misplaced).  
   - C, A, N absent.  
2. **TIRED**:  
   - I confirmed position 2.  
   - E confirmed position 4.  
   - R misplaced (not position 3).  
   - T, D absent.  
3. **LIVER**:  
   - I (position 2) ✓, E (position 4) ✓, R (position 5) ✓ → Fixed positions.  
   - L misplaced (not position 1).  
   - V absent.  

### Insights:
- **Fixed letters/positions**:  
  - **I** at position 2.  
  - **E** at position 4.  
  - **R** at position 5.  
- **Misplaced letters**:  
  - **L** must be in the secret word, but not at position 1. The only remaining untested position is **position 3** (since positions 2/4/5 are fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, D, V.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I L E R` (L inferred at position 3).  
- **Position 1** must be a letter **not absent** and **not L**.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Guess a valid word fitting `_ I L E R` pattern.  
- Test likely candidates: Common words include **FILER**, **MILER**, **OILER**.  
- Prioritize **FILER** because:  
  - **F** is a common untested consonant.  
  - Avoids redundancies and absent letters.  
- If wrong, feedback will confirm absence/presence of **F**, narrowing options to **MILER**/**OILER**.  

<guess>filer</guess>Based on the feedback from all guesses, the secret word pattern is `_ I L E R`, where:
- Position 2 is **I** (fixed).
- Position 3 must be **L** (it was misplaced in position 1 and is the only possible slot).
- Position 4 is **E** (fixed).
- Position 5 is **R** (fixed).
- Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter not in `C, A, N, T, D, V` (absent letters) and not **L**.

Possible words fitting this pattern include **FILER**, **MILER**, and **OILER**. I chose **FILER** because:
- **F** is a common untested consonant that maximizes information gain.
- If **F** is correct, we solve the word; if absent, it eliminates one candidate (narrowing to **MILER**/**OILER**).",Guess 4: filer -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
