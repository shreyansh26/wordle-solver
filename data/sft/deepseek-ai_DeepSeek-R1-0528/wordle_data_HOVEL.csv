We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:
C: x (C is not in the word)
R: x (R is not in the word)
A: x (A is not in the word)
N: x (N is not in the word)
E: - (E is in the word but in the wrong position)

So, from guess 1, we know:
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was the 5th letter in ""crane"").
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N.

For the second guess, we should choose a word that:
1. Contains the letter E (since we know it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N since they are not in the word.
3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

We need a 5-letter word that has E, but not in the last position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, N.

Possible positions for E: it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E that are not ending with E, and without the forbidden letters.

Common letters to try: we can use S, T, L, O, D, U, etc.

A common word that comes to mind is ""SPITE"", but it ends with E — that's position 5, so we should avoid having E at the end. But we know E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, the feedback was for position 5: E was at the end and got a dash meaning E is in the word but not necessarily in the last position? Actually, the dash indicates that E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So, in our next guess, we can put E in any position except 5. But note, we don't know where E is, so we should put it in a different position to test.

Moreover, we should try to eliminate other vowels? Since A is out, we have E already, but we can try other vowels: O, U, I?

I recall that a good second guess might be ""HOUSE"", but that ends with E — again position 5. So not good.

Another idea: ""TIMES"" — but S is common and E is in position 4? Actually, ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? T=1, I=2, M=3, E=4, S=5. But E is not at position 5? Position 5 is S. Actually, position 5 is the last letter.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5. Now, we need to avoid putting E at position 5 in the next guess? But that's not necessary for testing; we can put E at a different position to learn more about its location.

Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tested. Since in ""crane"", E was at pos5 and we know it's not at pos5, we should avoid putting it at pos5 to avoid wasting the position.

Let's list positions: 
Position 1: no information (we had C, which is wrong)
Position 2: we had R, wrong
Position 3: we had A, wrong
Position 4: we had N, wrong
Position 5: we had E and it is in the word, but not here.

So, for E, we know it's in the word but not at position 5.

Possible words: let me think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and avoid C,R,A,N.

Examples:

- E in position 1: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" but J might be rare. Or ""ETHOS""
- E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"", ""BETEL"", ""SETUP""
- E in position 3: e.g., ""TREAD"" — but R and A are invalid, so no. ""STEEP"" — S, T, E at 3? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, P at 5. But then we have double E? Not the best. ""STEEM""? Not a common word. Also, we need to avoid R and A and N? Wait, ""STEEP"" has no C,R,A,N? R is not allowed? We must avoid R? Yes, because R is out.

Constraints: cannot have C,A,R,N.

So, what about ""BELIE"" — but that ends with E? Position 5 is E, so not good. ""BELIE"" spelling: B-E-L-I-E, so position 5 is E. We shouldn't put E at position 5.

Better: ""BILLE"" — that's not a word.

Let me consider ""STELE"", but E at position 5? STELE: S-T-E-L-E? Standard spelling: STELE is S-T-E-L-E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E — that has two E's and ends with E? We know E is not at position 5, so having E at position 5 in a guess would be useless because we already know it's not there. So, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in any guess to save positions for testing other letters.

So, next guess should have E in one of positions 1-4, and no letter in position 5 that we know is not E? Actually, we don't know about position 5; it could be any letter except E? Not necessarily: we just know E is not at pos5, but other letters? We don't know.

But to avoid wasting the feedback, it's better to put E at one of positions 1-4 and put a new letter at position 5.

So, let's choose words without E at position 5.

Word: ""STOLE"" — S-T-O-L-E? Position 5 is E. So that has E at the end. Avoid.

""SPINE"": S-P-I-N-E? N is out because we know N is not in the word. Feedback for ""crane"": N was at position 4 and got an x, meaning N not in word. So we must not use N.

Similarly, avoid N.

Therefore, no N.

Possible word: ""SLICE"" — ends with E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

I'm stuck with E falling at the end. Consider words where E is earlier.

How about ""DEBT"" — too short? Must be 5 letters.

""DEBTS"": D-E-B-T-S? Then E is at position 2? And avoid position 5? Position 5 is S. And no C,A,R,N? D not used before, E we know, B not used, T not used, S common? Sounds good.

But ""DEBTS"" is a word? Yes, meaning debts as in money owed.

Another: ""DOZES"" — E at position 4? D-O-Z-E-S, so E at pos4, S at pos5. Z is not very common, but possible.

But we want common letters to get more hits.

Another idea: ""QUOTE"" — ends with E? Q-U-O-T-E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

""TIMEX"" — brand name? Not ideal.

""TEPID"": T-E-P-I-D? Positions: T=1, E=2, P=3, I=4, D=5. E is at pos2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes. Also, T and D are new.

Similarly, ""LEAPT"" — L-E-A-P-T? But A is out? We cannot use A? A is not in the word. So must avoid A.

""LEAPT"" has A? Yes, L,E,A,P,T? So contains A? Not allowed because A is not in word.

Therefore, must avoid A.

So ""TEPID"" is valid: T,E,P,I,D.

Check letters: T (new), E (in word, but we don't know position), P (new), I (new), D (new). Also, no C,R,A,N.

Another candidate: ""SPELT"" — S-P-E-L-T. E at pos3? Again, S,P,L,T new? But S,P,L,T are useful.

But wait, ""SPELT"" has L? Yes. We don't know about L.

We could include commonly used consonants: S,T,L etc.

Let's pick one that maximizes new information.

We know E is present, so by putting E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""TEPID"", E at pos2: 
- If we get ✓ for E, then it's correct position at pos2.
- If -, then E is in word and in wrong position (so either pos1,3,4? The word is 5 letters, but we don't have E at pos5? Wait, we know E is not at pos5 already? No, we only know E is somewhere else? We know E is in the word and not at pos5, but could be at pos1,2,3,4? After first guess, we know E exists but not at pos5. So in ""TEPID"", if E is at pos2, and if pos2 is correct, we get a ✓. Else, we might get a dash meaning it's in another position.

Similarly, we are testing T at the start? But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""TIMED"" — T-I-M-E-D? Position 4 E? Avoids C,A,R,N, and no E at end. But M and D?

Both are fine.

But ""TIMED"" might be better than ""TEPID"" because ""TIMED"" has M and D, while ""TEPID"" has P and D? Both good.

A common approach is to use a word with E and other vowels? But A is out already. We have I and O,U to consider? In ""TIMED"", there is I.

We also know that in Wordle, T, S, L, etc., are very common.

Another candidate: ""QUIET"" — but Q? Less common. Avoid.

""PIECE"" — P-I-E-C-E? But C is out? C not allowed. Also, ends with E? Avoid.

""SHIED"": S-H-I-E-D? E at position 4? S,H,I,E,D.

That could work: avoid C,R,A,N? Yes.

Also, S is very common.

Similarly, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D? Same concept.

But F might be less common? Not necessarily.

I think ""TIMED"" is good: T, I, M, E, D.

We don't know about any of these except E is in the word.

So, let's go with ""TIMED"".

Position by position:

If the feedback shows E is at position 4? Then we know it because ✓ or dash? Wait, but we have E at position 4? We don't know if position 4 is the right one? We will see.

Moreover, if E gets a dash, it means E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But we have T at1, I at2, M at3 — so if one of those is E? Then we get a dash for E? Let me think.

Actually, the feedback for each letter separately.

So, for ""TIMED"":

- T: if the first letter of secret word is T, ✓; else if T is in word at another position, -; else x.
- Similarly for I, M, E, D.

In the case of E at pos4: if E is not at pos4, then we get a dash meaning E exists (which we know) and at non-4 position? But we already know E exists. Actually, if E is at pos4 and we guess E at pos4, ✓. If E is at say pos2 and we guess E at pos4, we get - for E? And also if E is at pos2, then for I we might get something? But I at pos2: if I is not the letter? This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""TOOTH"" — but no E? No, we must include E? Actually not mandatory? Including E helps us narrow down its position? We don't have to. But since we know E is in the word, including E in the guess can give position information? But we are already limited to positions 1-4? No, we can guess words without E? But that would waste an opportunity to figure out where E is.

For example, if we don't include E and get no dash for E? That can't happen since E is in word? Actually, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, then at least one other letter would be E? But we would get an x for every letter? And we know E is present? So to find E and its position, we ought to include E in our guess? Yes.

Hence, include E but not at position 5.

Considering these, ""TIMED"" seems reasonable.

Another common approach: use a word that has E and many other common letters we haven't tried? We can think of letters: B,D,G,H,I,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z? Since C,A,R,N are out.

So, S,T,L,M,D,P etc.

Word: ""MEDIA"" — but A is out? Must avoid A.

""TOPED"" — not common? TOPED meaning? Might not be well-known. Avoid.

""STOLE"" — ends with E? Avoid.

How about ""STYLE"": S-T-Y-L-E? E at position 5? Avoid.

Do you see the problem? Many common words end with E.

Another idea: ""EXPEL"" — E at start? Position 1 is E? Then X is not common.

""EVITE"" — V is less common? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""BEIGE"" — ends with E? Not good.

""PETIT"" — P-E-T-I-T? But T repeated? Positions: P at1, E at2, T at3, I at4, T at5? Then E at2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes? But T? We have two T's? That might be useful? No, the word has T twice? We don't know about T yet.

But ""PETIT"" is a word? Yes.

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me choose ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D.

""TIMED"" is a valid English word.

So, I'll go with ""TIMED"".

Feedback: we'll see what happens.

Therefore, the guessed word is ""TIMED"".

But before that, let me think if there is a better choice.

Another candidate: ""COULD"" — but C is out? Cannot use C.

""DWELL"" — only four letters? Or ""DWELL"" is 5? D-W-E-L-L? E at position 3? And L's? Valid? Avoids C,A,R,N? Yes.

But we have double L? That might be inefficient? Not necessarily.

But ""TIMED"" seems more standard.

We can try ""SPEND"" — but S,P,E,N,D? N is out because we know N is not in the word? First guess feedback N was wrong? So we must avoid N? ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? So invalid because N is not in the secret word? Therefore, we cannot guess words with N? That's correct: since N is not in the word, if we guess a word with N, we'll get an x? So we avoid letters known to be absent? Yes? So no N in any guesses.

Similarly, no C, R, A, N.

Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid because it contains N.

Back to ""TIMED"": no C,R,A,N? T,I,M,E,D — all allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DIETS""? D-I-E-T-S? Ends with S? E at position 3? Better than ""TIMED""?

""DIETS"" has E at position 3? D=1, I=2, E=3, T=4, S=5? Then E at 3? And avoids C,A,R,N? Also common letters.

Yes, and S is at the end? We haven't tested position 5? Since E was not at 5, but position 5 could be S? So we are testing S at the end.

Similarly, ""TIMED"" tests D at the end.

But both are fine. I'll stick with ""TIMED"".

So guess: TIMED

But wait, ""TIMED"" has T at the beginning? And position 1 was previously C, which was not in the word? So T is new? So might reveal something? Yes.

Another word: ""LIVES"" — L,I,V,E,S? E at position 4? Not end? But V? Not common? And L? Fine.

I think ""TIMED"" is suitable.

So, final decision: guess ""TIMED"".

In the response format, we need to output <guess>timed</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess:
- ""crane"" had feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- This means: 
  - C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess:
- Must include E (since it's in the word), but not in position 5.
- Must avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (like T, I, M, D) to gather new information and narrow down E's position.

Selecting ""timed"" as the guess:
- Places E in position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: T, I, M, D.
- A invalid letters (C, R, A, N not present).
- Maximizes information potential by testing E's position and new letters at untested positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 were untouched for non-E letters).

<guess>timed</guess>",timed,"We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:
C: x (C is not in the word)
R: x (R is not in the word)
A: x (A is not in the word)
N: x (N is not in the word)
E: - (E is in the word but in the wrong position)

So, from guess 1, we know:
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was the 5th letter in ""crane"").
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N.

For the second guess, we should choose a word that:
1. Contains the letter E (since we know it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N since they are not in the word.
3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

We need a 5-letter word that has E, but not in the last position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, N.

Possible positions for E: it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E that are not ending with E, and without the forbidden letters.

Common letters to try: we can use S, T, L, O, D, U, etc.

A common word that comes to mind is ""SPITE"", but it ends with E — that's position 5, so we should avoid having E at the end. But we know E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, the feedback was for position 5: E was at the end and got a dash meaning E is in the word but not necessarily in the last position? Actually, the dash indicates that E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So, in our next guess, we can put E in any position except 5. But note, we don't know where E is, so we should put it in a different position to test.

Moreover, we should try to eliminate other vowels? Since A is out, we have E already, but we can try other vowels: O, U, I?

I recall that a good second guess might be ""HOUSE"", but that ends with E — again position 5. So not good.

Another idea: ""TIMES"" — but S is common and E is in position 4? Actually, ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? T=1, I=2, M=3, E=4, S=5. But E is not at position 5? Position 5 is S. Actually, position 5 is the last letter.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5. Now, we need to avoid putting E at position 5 in the next guess? But that's not necessary for testing; we can put E at a different position to learn more about its location.

Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tested. Since in ""crane"", E was at pos5 and we know it's not at pos5, we should avoid putting it at pos5 to avoid wasting the position.

Let's list positions: 
Position 1: no information (we had C, which is wrong)
Position 2: we had R, wrong
Position 3: we had A, wrong
Position 4: we had N, wrong
Position 5: we had E and it is in the word, but not here.

So, for E, we know it's in the word but not at position 5.

Possible words: let me think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and avoid C,R,A,N.

Examples:

- E in position 1: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" but J might be rare. Or ""ETHOS""
- E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"", ""BETEL"", ""SETUP""
- E in position 3: e.g., ""TREAD"" — but R and A are invalid, so no. ""STEEP"" — S, T, E at 3? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, P at 5. But then we have double E? Not the best. ""STEEM""? Not a common word. Also, we need to avoid R and A and N? Wait, ""STEEP"" has no C,R,A,N? R is not allowed? We must avoid R? Yes, because R is out.

Constraints: cannot have C,A,R,N.

So, what about ""BELIE"" — but that ends with E? Position 5 is E, so not good. ""BELIE"" spelling: B-E-L-I-E, so position 5 is E. We shouldn't put E at position 5.

Better: ""BILLE"" — that's not a word.

Let me consider ""STELE"", but E at position 5? STELE: S-T-E-L-E? Standard spelling: STELE is S-T-E-L-E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E — that has two E's and ends with E? We know E is not at position 5, so having E at position 5 in a guess would be useless because we already know it's not there. So, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in any guess to save positions for testing other letters.

So, next guess should have E in one of positions 1-4, and no letter in position 5 that we know is not E? Actually, we don't know about position 5; it could be any letter except E? Not necessarily: we just know E is not at pos5, but other letters? We don't know.

But to avoid wasting the feedback, it's better to put E at one of positions 1-4 and put a new letter at position 5.

So, let's choose words without E at position 5.

Word: ""STOLE"" — S-T-O-L-E? Position 5 is E. So that has E at the end. Avoid.

""SPINE"": S-P-I-N-E? N is out because we know N is not in the word. Feedback for ""crane"": N was at position 4 and got an x, meaning N not in word. So we must not use N.

Similarly, avoid N.

Therefore, no N.

Possible word: ""SLICE"" — ends with E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

I'm stuck with E falling at the end. Consider words where E is earlier.

How about ""DEBT"" — too short? Must be 5 letters.

""DEBTS"": D-E-B-T-S? Then E is at position 2? And avoid position 5? Position 5 is S. And no C,A,R,N? D not used before, E we know, B not used, T not used, S common? Sounds good.

But ""DEBTS"" is a word? Yes, meaning debts as in money owed.

Another: ""DOZES"" — E at position 4? D-O-Z-E-S, so E at pos4, S at pos5. Z is not very common, but possible.

But we want common letters to get more hits.

Another idea: ""QUOTE"" — ends with E? Q-U-O-T-E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

""TIMEX"" — brand name? Not ideal.

""TEPID"": T-E-P-I-D? Positions: T=1, E=2, P=3, I=4, D=5. E is at pos2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes. Also, T and D are new.

Similarly, ""LEAPT"" — L-E-A-P-T? But A is out? We cannot use A? A is not in the word. So must avoid A.

""LEAPT"" has A? Yes, L,E,A,P,T? So contains A? Not allowed because A is not in word.

Therefore, must avoid A.

So ""TEPID"" is valid: T,E,P,I,D.

Check letters: T (new), E (in word, but we don't know position), P (new), I (new), D (new). Also, no C,R,A,N.

Another candidate: ""SPELT"" — S-P-E-L-T. E at pos3? Again, S,P,L,T new? But S,P,L,T are useful.

But wait, ""SPELT"" has L? Yes. We don't know about L.

We could include commonly used consonants: S,T,L etc.

Let's pick one that maximizes new information.

We know E is present, so by putting E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""TEPID"", E at pos2: 
- If we get ✓ for E, then it's correct position at pos2.
- If -, then E is in word and in wrong position (so either pos1,3,4? The word is 5 letters, but we don't have E at pos5? Wait, we know E is not at pos5 already? No, we only know E is somewhere else? We know E is in the word and not at pos5, but could be at pos1,2,3,4? After first guess, we know E exists but not at pos5. So in ""TEPID"", if E is at pos2, and if pos2 is correct, we get a ✓. Else, we might get a dash meaning it's in another position.

Similarly, we are testing T at the start? But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""TIMED"" — T-I-M-E-D? Position 4 E? Avoids C,A,R,N, and no E at end. But M and D?

Both are fine.

But ""TIMED"" might be better than ""TEPID"" because ""TIMED"" has M and D, while ""TEPID"" has P and D? Both good.

A common approach is to use a word with E and other vowels? But A is out already. We have I and O,U to consider? In ""TIMED"", there is I.

We also know that in Wordle, T, S, L, etc., are very common.

Another candidate: ""QUIET"" — but Q? Less common. Avoid.

""PIECE"" — P-I-E-C-E? But C is out? C not allowed. Also, ends with E? Avoid.

""SHIED"": S-H-I-E-D? E at position 4? S,H,I,E,D.

That could work: avoid C,R,A,N? Yes.

Also, S is very common.

Similarly, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D? Same concept.

But F might be less common? Not necessarily.

I think ""TIMED"" is good: T, I, M, E, D.

We don't know about any of these except E is in the word.

So, let's go with ""TIMED"".

Position by position:

If the feedback shows E is at position 4? Then we know it because ✓ or dash? Wait, but we have E at position 4? We don't know if position 4 is the right one? We will see.

Moreover, if E gets a dash, it means E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But we have T at1, I at2, M at3 — so if one of those is E? Then we get a dash for E? Let me think.

Actually, the feedback for each letter separately.

So, for ""TIMED"":

- T: if the first letter of secret word is T, ✓; else if T is in word at another position, -; else x.
- Similarly for I, M, E, D.

In the case of E at pos4: if E is not at pos4, then we get a dash meaning E exists (which we know) and at non-4 position? But we already know E exists. Actually, if E is at pos4 and we guess E at pos4, ✓. If E is at say pos2 and we guess E at pos4, we get - for E? And also if E is at pos2, then for I we might get something? But I at pos2: if I is not the letter? This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""TOOTH"" — but no E? No, we must include E? Actually not mandatory? Including E helps us narrow down its position? We don't have to. But since we know E is in the word, including E in the guess can give position information? But we are already limited to positions 1-4? No, we can guess words without E? But that would waste an opportunity to figure out where E is.

For example, if we don't include E and get no dash for E? That can't happen since E is in word? Actually, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, then at least one other letter would be E? But we would get an x for every letter? And we know E is present? So to find E and its position, we ought to include E in our guess? Yes.

Hence, include E but not at position 5.

Considering these, ""TIMED"" seems reasonable.

Another common approach: use a word that has E and many other common letters we haven't tried? We can think of letters: B,D,G,H,I,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z? Since C,A,R,N are out.

So, S,T,L,M,D,P etc.

Word: ""MEDIA"" — but A is out? Must avoid A.

""TOPED"" — not common? TOPED meaning? Might not be well-known. Avoid.

""STOLE"" — ends with E? Avoid.

How about ""STYLE"": S-T-Y-L-E? E at position 5? Avoid.

Do you see the problem? Many common words end with E.

Another idea: ""EXPEL"" — E at start? Position 1 is E? Then X is not common.

""EVITE"" — V is less common? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""BEIGE"" — ends with E? Not good.

""PETIT"" — P-E-T-I-T? But T repeated? Positions: P at1, E at2, T at3, I at4, T at5? Then E at2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes? But T? We have two T's? That might be useful? No, the word has T twice? We don't know about T yet.

But ""PETIT"" is a word? Yes.

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me choose ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D.

""TIMED"" is a valid English word.

So, I'll go with ""TIMED"".

Feedback: we'll see what happens.

Therefore, the guessed word is ""TIMED"".

But before that, let me think if there is a better choice.

Another candidate: ""COULD"" — but C is out? Cannot use C.

""DWELL"" — only four letters? Or ""DWELL"" is 5? D-W-E-L-L? E at position 3? And L's? Valid? Avoids C,A,R,N? Yes.

But we have double L? That might be inefficient? Not necessarily.

But ""TIMED"" seems more standard.

We can try ""SPEND"" — but S,P,E,N,D? N is out because we know N is not in the word? First guess feedback N was wrong? So we must avoid N? ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? So invalid because N is not in the secret word? Therefore, we cannot guess words with N? That's correct: since N is not in the word, if we guess a word with N, we'll get an x? So we avoid letters known to be absent? Yes? So no N in any guesses.

Similarly, no C, R, A, N.

Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid because it contains N.

Back to ""TIMED"": no C,R,A,N? T,I,M,E,D — all allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DIETS""? D-I-E-T-S? Ends with S? E at position 3? Better than ""TIMED""?

""DIETS"" has E at position 3? D=1, I=2, E=3, T=4, S=5? Then E at 3? And avoids C,A,R,N? Also common letters.

Yes, and S is at the end? We haven't tested position 5? Since E was not at 5, but position 5 could be S? So we are testing S at the end.

Similarly, ""TIMED"" tests D at the end.

But both are fine. I'll stick with ""TIMED"".

So guess: TIMED

But wait, ""TIMED"" has T at the beginning? And position 1 was previously C, which was not in the word? So T is new? So might reveal something? Yes.

Another word: ""LIVES"" — L,I,V,E,S? E at position 4? Not end? But V? Not common? And L? Fine.

I think ""TIMED"" is suitable.

So, final decision: guess ""TIMED"".

In the response format, we need to output <guess>timed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess:
- ""crane"" had feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- This means: 
  - C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess:
- Must include E (since it's in the word), but not in position 5.
- Must avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (like T, I, M, D) to gather new information and narrow down E's position.

Selecting ""timed"" as the guess:
- Places E in position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: T, I, M, D.
- A invalid letters (C, R, A, N not present).
- Maximizes information potential by testing E's position and new letters at untested positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 were untouched for non-E letters).",Guess 2: timed -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,HOVEL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:
C: x (C is not in the word)
R: x (R is not in the word)
A: x (A is not in the word)
N: x (N is not in the word)
E: - (E is in the word but in the wrong position)

So, from guess 1, we know:
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was the 5th letter in ""crane"").
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N.

For the second guess, we should choose a word that:
1. Contains the letter E (since we know it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N since they are not in the word.
3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

We need a 5-letter word that has E, but not in the last position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, N.

Possible positions for E: it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E that are not ending with E, and without the forbidden letters.

Common letters to try: we can use S, T, L, O, D, U, etc.

A common word that comes to mind is ""SPITE"", but it ends with E — that's position 5, so we should avoid having E at the end. But we know E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, the feedback was for position 5: E was at the end and got a dash meaning E is in the word but not necessarily in the last position? Actually, the dash indicates that E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So, in our next guess, we can put E in any position except 5. But note, we don't know where E is, so we should put it in a different position to test.

Moreover, we should try to eliminate other vowels? Since A is out, we have E already, but we can try other vowels: O, U, I?

I recall that a good second guess might be ""HOUSE"", but that ends with E — again position 5. So not good.

Another idea: ""TIMES"" — but S is common and E is in position 4? Actually, ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? T=1, I=2, M=3, E=4, S=5. But E is not at position 5? Position 5 is S. Actually, position 5 is the last letter.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5. Now, we need to avoid putting E at position 5 in the next guess? But that's not necessary for testing; we can put E at a different position to learn more about its location.

Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tested. Since in ""crane"", E was at pos5 and we know it's not at pos5, we should avoid putting it at pos5 to avoid wasting the position.

Let's list positions: 
Position 1: no information (we had C, which is wrong)
Position 2: we had R, wrong
Position 3: we had A, wrong
Position 4: we had N, wrong
Position 5: we had E and it is in the word, but not here.

So, for E, we know it's in the word but not at position 5.

Possible words: let me think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and avoid C,R,A,N.

Examples:

- E in position 1: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" but J might be rare. Or ""ETHOS""
- E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"", ""BETEL"", ""SETUP""
- E in position 3: e.g., ""TREAD"" — but R and A are invalid, so no. ""STEEP"" — S, T, E at 3? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, P at 5. But then we have double E? Not the best. ""STEEM""? Not a common word. Also, we need to avoid R and A and N? Wait, ""STEEP"" has no C,R,A,N? R is not allowed? We must avoid R? Yes, because R is out.

Constraints: cannot have C,A,R,N.

So, what about ""BELIE"" — but that ends with E? Position 5 is E, so not good. ""BELIE"" spelling: B-E-L-I-E, so position 5 is E. We shouldn't put E at position 5.

Better: ""BILLE"" — that's not a word.

Let me consider ""STELE"", but E at position 5? STELE: S-T-E-L-E? Standard spelling: STELE is S-T-E-L-E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E — that has two E's and ends with E? We know E is not at position 5, so having E at position 5 in a guess would be useless because we already know it's not there. So, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in any guess to save positions for testing other letters.

So, next guess should have E in one of positions 1-4, and no letter in position 5 that we know is not E? Actually, we don't know about position 5; it could be any letter except E? Not necessarily: we just know E is not at pos5, but other letters? We don't know.

But to avoid wasting the feedback, it's better to put E at one of positions 1-4 and put a new letter at position 5.

So, let's choose words without E at position 5.

Word: ""STOLE"" — S-T-O-L-E? Position 5 is E. So that has E at the end. Avoid.

""SPINE"": S-P-I-N-E? N is out because we know N is not in the word. Feedback for ""crane"": N was at position 4 and got an x, meaning N not in word. So we must not use N.

Similarly, avoid N.

Therefore, no N.

Possible word: ""SLICE"" — ends with E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

I'm stuck with E falling at the end. Consider words where E is earlier.

How about ""DEBT"" — too short? Must be 5 letters.

""DEBTS"": D-E-B-T-S? Then E is at position 2? And avoid position 5? Position 5 is S. And no C,A,R,N? D not used before, E we know, B not used, T not used, S common? Sounds good.

But ""DEBTS"" is a word? Yes, meaning debts as in money owed.

Another: ""DOZES"" — E at position 4? D-O-Z-E-S, so E at pos4, S at pos5. Z is not very common, but possible.

But we want common letters to get more hits.

Another idea: ""QUOTE"" — ends with E? Q-U-O-T-E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

""TIMEX"" — brand name? Not ideal.

""TEPID"": T-E-P-I-D? Positions: T=1, E=2, P=3, I=4, D=5. E is at pos2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes. Also, T and D are new.

Similarly, ""LEAPT"" — L-E-A-P-T? But A is out? We cannot use A? A is not in the word. So must avoid A.

""LEAPT"" has A? Yes, L,E,A,P,T? So contains A? Not allowed because A is not in word.

Therefore, must avoid A.

So ""TEPID"" is valid: T,E,P,I,D.

Check letters: T (new), E (in word, but we don't know position), P (new), I (new), D (new). Also, no C,R,A,N.

Another candidate: ""SPELT"" — S-P-E-L-T. E at pos3? Again, S,P,L,T new? But S,P,L,T are useful.

But wait, ""SPELT"" has L? Yes. We don't know about L.

We could include commonly used consonants: S,T,L etc.

Let's pick one that maximizes new information.

We know E is present, so by putting E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""TEPID"", E at pos2: 
- If we get ✓ for E, then it's correct position at pos2.
- If -, then E is in word and in wrong position (so either pos1,3,4? The word is 5 letters, but we don't have E at pos5? Wait, we know E is not at pos5 already? No, we only know E is somewhere else? We know E is in the word and not at pos5, but could be at pos1,2,3,4? After first guess, we know E exists but not at pos5. So in ""TEPID"", if E is at pos2, and if pos2 is correct, we get a ✓. Else, we might get a dash meaning it's in another position.

Similarly, we are testing T at the start? But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""TIMED"" — T-I-M-E-D? Position 4 E? Avoids C,A,R,N, and no E at end. But M and D?

Both are fine.

But ""TIMED"" might be better than ""TEPID"" because ""TIMED"" has M and D, while ""TEPID"" has P and D? Both good.

A common approach is to use a word with E and other vowels? But A is out already. We have I and O,U to consider? In ""TIMED"", there is I.

We also know that in Wordle, T, S, L, etc., are very common.

Another candidate: ""QUIET"" — but Q? Less common. Avoid.

""PIECE"" — P-I-E-C-E? But C is out? C not allowed. Also, ends with E? Avoid.

""SHIED"": S-H-I-E-D? E at position 4? S,H,I,E,D.

That could work: avoid C,R,A,N? Yes.

Also, S is very common.

Similarly, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D? Same concept.

But F might be less common? Not necessarily.

I think ""TIMED"" is good: T, I, M, E, D.

We don't know about any of these except E is in the word.

So, let's go with ""TIMED"".

Position by position:

If the feedback shows E is at position 4? Then we know it because ✓ or dash? Wait, but we have E at position 4? We don't know if position 4 is the right one? We will see.

Moreover, if E gets a dash, it means E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But we have T at1, I at2, M at3 — so if one of those is E? Then we get a dash for E? Let me think.

Actually, the feedback for each letter separately.

So, for ""TIMED"":

- T: if the first letter of secret word is T, ✓; else if T is in word at another position, -; else x.
- Similarly for I, M, E, D.

In the case of E at pos4: if E is not at pos4, then we get a dash meaning E exists (which we know) and at non-4 position? But we already know E exists. Actually, if E is at pos4 and we guess E at pos4, ✓. If E is at say pos2 and we guess E at pos4, we get - for E? And also if E is at pos2, then for I we might get something? But I at pos2: if I is not the letter? This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""TOOTH"" — but no E? No, we must include E? Actually not mandatory? Including E helps us narrow down its position? We don't have to. But since we know E is in the word, including E in the guess can give position information? But we are already limited to positions 1-4? No, we can guess words without E? But that would waste an opportunity to figure out where E is.

For example, if we don't include E and get no dash for E? That can't happen since E is in word? Actually, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, then at least one other letter would be E? But we would get an x for every letter? And we know E is present? So to find E and its position, we ought to include E in our guess? Yes.

Hence, include E but not at position 5.

Considering these, ""TIMED"" seems reasonable.

Another common approach: use a word that has E and many other common letters we haven't tried? We can think of letters: B,D,G,H,I,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z? Since C,A,R,N are out.

So, S,T,L,M,D,P etc.

Word: ""MEDIA"" — but A is out? Must avoid A.

""TOPED"" — not common? TOPED meaning? Might not be well-known. Avoid.

""STOLE"" — ends with E? Avoid.

How about ""STYLE"": S-T-Y-L-E? E at position 5? Avoid.

Do you see the problem? Many common words end with E.

Another idea: ""EXPEL"" — E at start? Position 1 is E? Then X is not common.

""EVITE"" — V is less common? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""BEIGE"" — ends with E? Not good.

""PETIT"" — P-E-T-I-T? But T repeated? Positions: P at1, E at2, T at3, I at4, T at5? Then E at2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes? But T? We have two T's? That might be useful? No, the word has T twice? We don't know about T yet.

But ""PETIT"" is a word? Yes.

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me choose ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D.

""TIMED"" is a valid English word.

So, I'll go with ""TIMED"".

Feedback: we'll see what happens.

Therefore, the guessed word is ""TIMED"".

But before that, let me think if there is a better choice.

Another candidate: ""COULD"" — but C is out? Cannot use C.

""DWELL"" — only four letters? Or ""DWELL"" is 5? D-W-E-L-L? E at position 3? And L's? Valid? Avoids C,A,R,N? Yes.

But we have double L? That might be inefficient? Not necessarily.

But ""TIMED"" seems more standard.

We can try ""SPEND"" — but S,P,E,N,D? N is out because we know N is not in the word? First guess feedback N was wrong? So we must avoid N? ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? So invalid because N is not in the secret word? Therefore, we cannot guess words with N? That's correct: since N is not in the word, if we guess a word with N, we'll get an x? So we avoid letters known to be absent? Yes? So no N in any guesses.

Similarly, no C, R, A, N.

Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid because it contains N.

Back to ""TIMED"": no C,R,A,N? T,I,M,E,D — all allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DIETS""? D-I-E-T-S? Ends with S? E at position 3? Better than ""TIMED""?

""DIETS"" has E at position 3? D=1, I=2, E=3, T=4, S=5? Then E at 3? And avoids C,A,R,N? Also common letters.

Yes, and S is at the end? We haven't tested position 5? Since E was not at 5, but position 5 could be S? So we are testing S at the end.

Similarly, ""TIMED"" tests D at the end.

But both are fine. I'll stick with ""TIMED"".

So guess: TIMED

But wait, ""TIMED"" has T at the beginning? And position 1 was previously C, which was not in the word? So T is new? So might reveal something? Yes.

Another word: ""LIVES"" — L,I,V,E,S? E at position 4? Not end? But V? Not common? And L? Fine.

I think ""TIMED"" is suitable.

So, final decision: guess ""TIMED"".

In the response format, we need to output <guess>timed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess:
- ""crane"" had feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- This means: 
  - C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess:

- Must avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (like T, I, M, D) to gather new information and narrow down E's position.

- A invalid letters (C, R, A, N not present).

The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:\nC: x (C is not in the word)\nR: x (R is not in the word)\nA: x (A is not in the word)\nN: x (N is not in the word)\nE: - (E is in the word but in the wrong position)\n\nSo, from guess 1, we know:\n- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was the 5th letter in ""crane"").\n- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N.\n\nFor the second guess, we should choose a word that:\n1. Contains the letter E (since we know it\'s in the word), but not in the 5th position.\n2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N since they are not in the word.\n3. Includes other common letters to get more information.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that has E, but not in the last position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\nPossible positions for E: it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me think of words with E that are not ending with E, and without the forbidden letters.\n\nCommon letters to try: we can use S, T, L, O, D, U, etc.\n\nA common word that comes to mind is ""SPITE"", but it ends with E — that\'s position 5, so we should avoid having E at the end. But we know E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, the feedback was for position 5: E was at the end and got a dash meaning E is in the word but not necessarily in the last position? Actually, the dash indicates that E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nSo, in our next guess, we can put E in any position except 5. But note, we don\'t know where E is, so we should put it in a different position to test.\n\nMoreover, we should try to eliminate other vowels? Since A is out, we have E already, but we can try other vowels: O, U, I?\n\nI recall that a good second guess might be ""HOUSE"", but that ends with E — again position 5. So not good.\n\nAnother idea: ""TIMES"" — but S is common and E is in position 4? Actually, ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? T=1, I=2, M=3, E=4, S=5. But E is not at position 5? Position 5 is S. Actually, position 5 is the last letter.\n\nIn ""crane"", E was at position 5. Now, we need to avoid putting E at position 5 in the next guess? But that\'s not necessary for testing; we can put E at a different position to learn more about its location.\n\nAlternatively, we can put E in a position we haven\'t tested. Since in ""crane"", E was at pos5 and we know it\'s not at pos5, we should avoid putting it at pos5 to avoid wasting the position.\n\nLet\'s list positions: \nPosition 1: no information (we had C, which is wrong)\nPosition 2: we had R, wrong\nPosition 3: we had A, wrong\nPosition 4: we had N, wrong\nPosition 5: we had E and it is in the word, but not here.\n\nSo, for E, we know it\'s in the word but not at position 5.\n\nPossible words: let me think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and avoid C,R,A,N.\n\nExamples:\n\n- E in position 1: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" but J might be rare. Or ""ETHOS""\n- E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"", ""BETEL"", ""SETUP""\n- E in position 3: e.g., ""TREAD"" — but R and A are invalid, so no. ""STEEP"" — S, T, E at 3? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, P at 5. But then we have double E? Not the best. ""STEEM""? Not a common word. Also, we need to avoid R and A and N? Wait, ""STEEP"" has no C,R,A,N? R is not allowed? We must avoid R? Yes, because R is out.\n\nConstraints: cannot have C,A,R,N.\n\nSo, what about ""BELIE"" — but that ends with E? Position 5 is E, so not good. ""BELIE"" spelling: B-E-L-I-E, so position 5 is E. We shouldn\'t put E at position 5.\n\nBetter: ""BILLE"" — that\'s not a word.\n\nLet me consider ""STELE"", but E at position 5? STELE: S-T-E-L-E? Standard spelling: STELE is S-T-E-L-E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E — that has two E\'s and ends with E? We know E is not at position 5, so having E at position 5 in a guess would be useless because we already know it\'s not there. So, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 in any guess to save positions for testing other letters.\n\nSo, next guess should have E in one of positions 1-4, and no letter in position 5 that we know is not E? Actually, we don\'t know about position 5; it could be any letter except E? Not necessarily: we just know E is not at pos5, but other letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid wasting the feedback, it\'s better to put E at one of positions 1-4 and put a new letter at position 5.\n\nSo, let\'s choose words without E at position 5.\n\nWord: ""STOLE"" — S-T-O-L-E? Position 5 is E. So that has E at the end. Avoid.\n\n""SPINE"": S-P-I-N-E? N is out because we know N is not in the word. Feedback for ""crane"": N was at position 4 and got an x, meaning N not in word. So we must not use N.\n\nSimilarly, avoid N.\n\nTherefore, no N.\n\nPossible word: ""SLICE"" — ends with E? Position 5 E. Avoid.\n\nI\'m stuck with E falling at the end. Consider words where E is earlier.\n\nHow about ""DEBT"" — too short? Must be 5 letters.\n\n""DEBTS"": D-E-B-T-S? Then E is at position 2? And avoid position 5? Position 5 is S. And no C,A,R,N? D not used before, E we know, B not used, T not used, S common? Sounds good.\n\nBut ""DEBTS"" is a word? Yes, meaning debts as in money owed.\n\nAnother: ""DOZES"" — E at position 4? D-O-Z-E-S, so E at pos4, S at pos5. Z is not very common, but possible.\n\nBut we want common letters to get more hits.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUOTE"" — ends with E? Q-U-O-T-E? Position 5 E. Avoid.\n\n""TIMEX"" — brand name? Not ideal.\n\n""TEPID"": T-E-P-I-D? Positions: T=1, E=2, P=3, I=4, D=5. E is at pos2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes. Also, T and D are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEAPT"" — L-E-A-P-T? But A is out? We cannot use A? A is not in the word. So must avoid A.\n\n""LEAPT"" has A? Yes, L,E,A,P,T? So contains A? Not allowed because A is not in word.\n\nTherefore, must avoid A.\n\nSo ""TEPID"" is valid: T,E,P,I,D.\n\nCheck letters: T (new), E (in word, but we don\'t know position), P (new), I (new), D (new). Also, no C,R,A,N.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPELT"" — S-P-E-L-T. E at pos3? Again, S,P,L,T new? But S,P,L,T are useful.\n\nBut wait, ""SPELT"" has L? Yes. We don\'t know about L.\n\nWe could include commonly used consonants: S,T,L etc.\n\nLet\'s pick one that maximizes new information.\n\nWe know E is present, so by putting E in different positions, we can get information about its location.\n\nIn ""TEPID"", E at pos2: \n- If we get ✓ for E, then it\'s correct position at pos2.\n- If -, then E is in word and in wrong position (so either pos1,3,4? The word is 5 letters, but we don\'t have E at pos5? Wait, we know E is not at pos5 already? No, we only know E is somewhere else? We know E is in the word and not at pos5, but could be at pos1,2,3,4? After first guess, we know E exists but not at pos5. So in ""TEPID"", if E is at pos2, and if pos2 is correct, we get a ✓. Else, we might get a dash meaning it\'s in another position.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T at the start? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""TIMED"" — T-I-M-E-D? Position 4 E? Avoids C,A,R,N, and no E at end. But M and D?\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nBut ""TIMED"" might be better than ""TEPID"" because ""TIMED"" has M and D, while ""TEPID"" has P and D? Both good.\n\nA common approach is to use a word with E and other vowels? But A is out already. We have I and O,U to consider? In ""TIMED"", there is I.\n\nWe also know that in Wordle, T, S, L, etc., are very common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""QUIET"" — but Q? Less common. Avoid.\n\n""PIECE"" — P-I-E-C-E? But C is out? C not allowed. Also, ends with E? Avoid.\n\n""SHIED"": S-H-I-E-D? E at position 4? S,H,I,E,D.\n\nThat could work: avoid C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\nAlso, S is very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D? Same concept.\n\nBut F might be less common? Not necessarily.\n\nI think ""TIMED"" is good: T, I, M, E, D.\n\nWe don\'t know about any of these except E is in the word.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""TIMED"".\n\nPosition by position:\n\nIf the feedback shows E is at position 4? Then we know it because ✓ or dash? Wait, but we have E at position 4? We don\'t know if position 4 is the right one? We will see.\n\nMoreover, if E gets a dash, it means E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But we have T at1, I at2, M at3 — so if one of those is E? Then we get a dash for E? Let me think.\n\nActually, the feedback for each letter separately.\n\nSo, for ""TIMED"":\n\n- T: if the first letter of secret word is T, ✓; else if T is in word at another position, -; else x.\n- Similarly for I, M, E, D.\n\nIn the case of E at pos4: if E is not at pos4, then we get a dash meaning E exists (which we know) and at non-4 position? But we already know E exists. Actually, if E is at pos4 and we guess E at pos4, ✓. If E is at say pos2 and we guess E at pos4, we get - for E? And also if E is at pos2, then for I we might get something? But I at pos2: if I is not the letter? This will give us good information.\n\nAlternatively, ""TOOTH"" — but no E? No, we must include E? Actually not mandatory? Including E helps us narrow down its position? We don\'t have to. But since we know E is in the word, including E in the guess can give position information? But we are already limited to positions 1-4? No, we can guess words without E? But that would waste an opportunity to figure out where E is.\n\nFor example, if we don\'t include E and get no dash for E? That can\'t happen since E is in word? Actually, we know E is in the word, so if we don\'t include E, then at least one other letter would be E? But we would get an x for every letter? And we know E is present? So to find E and its position, we ought to include E in our guess? Yes.\n\nHence, include E but not at position 5.\n\nConsidering these, ""TIMED"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother common approach: use a word that has E and many other common letters we haven\'t tried? We can think of letters: B,D,G,H,I,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z? Since C,A,R,N are out.\n\nSo, S,T,L,M,D,P etc.\n\nWord: ""MEDIA"" — but A is out? Must avoid A.\n\n""TOPED"" — not common? TOPED meaning? Might not be well-known. Avoid.\n\n""STOLE"" — ends with E? Avoid.\n\nHow about ""STYLE"": S-T-Y-L-E? E at position 5? Avoid.\n\nDo you see the problem? Many common words end with E.\n\nAnother idea: ""EXPEL"" — E at start? Position 1 is E? Then X is not common.\n\n""EVITE"" — V is less common? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps ""BEIGE"" — ends with E? Not good.\n\n""PETIT"" — P-E-T-I-T? But T repeated? Positions: P at1, E at2, T at3, I at4, T at5? Then E at2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes? But T? We have two T\'s? That might be useful? No, the word has T twice? We don\'t know about T yet.\n\nBut ""PETIT"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut I think I\'m overcomplicating.\n\nLet me choose ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D.\n\n""TIMED"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TIMED"".\n\nFeedback: we\'ll see what happens.\n\nTherefore, the guessed word is ""TIMED"".\n\nBut before that, let me think if there is a better choice.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COULD"" — but C is out? Cannot use C.\n\n""DWELL"" — only four letters? Or ""DWELL"" is 5? D-W-E-L-L? E at position 3? And L\'s? Valid? Avoids C,A,R,N? Yes.\n\nBut we have double L? That might be inefficient? Not necessarily.\n\nBut ""TIMED"" seems more standard.\n\nWe can try ""SPEND"" — but S,P,E,N,D? N is out because we know N is not in the word? First guess feedback N was wrong? So we must avoid N? ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? So invalid because N is not in the secret word? Therefore, we cannot guess words with N? That\'s correct: since N is not in the word, if we guess a word with N, we\'ll get an x? So we avoid letters known to be absent? Yes? So no N in any guesses.\n\nSimilarly, no C, R, A, N.\n\nTherefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid because it contains N.\n\nBack to ""TIMED"": no C,R,A,N? T,I,M,E,D — all allowed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIETS""? D-I-E-T-S? Ends with S? E at position 3? Better than ""TIMED""?\n\n""DIETS"" has E at position 3? D=1, I=2, E=3, T=4, S=5? Then E at 3? And avoids C,A,R,N? Also common letters.\n\nYes, and S is at the end? We haven\'t tested position 5? Since E was not at 5, but position 5 could be S? So we are testing S at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIMED"" tests D at the end.\n\nBut both are fine. I\'ll stick with ""TIMED"".\n\nSo guess: TIMED\n\nBut wait, ""TIMED"" has T at the beginning? And position 1 was previously C, which was not in the word? So T is new? So might reveal something? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""LIVES"" — L,I,V,E,S? E at position 4? Not end? But V? Not common? And L? Fine.\n\nI think ""TIMED"" is suitable.\n\nSo, final decision: guess ""TIMED"".\n\nIn the response format, we need to output <guess>timed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess:\n- ""crane"" had feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n- This means: \n  - C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n  \nFor the second guess:\n- Must include E (since it\'s in the word), but not in position 5.\n- Must avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (like T, I, M, D) to gather new information and narrow down E\'s position.\n\nSelecting ""timed"" as the guess:\n- Places E in position 4 (avoiding position 5).\n- Uses new letters: T, I, M, D.\n- A invalid letters (C, R, A, N not present).\n- Maximizes information potential by testing E\'s position and new letters at untested positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 were untouched for non-E letters).\n\n<guess>timed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: timed -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the third guess. The previous feedback is:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""timed"" -> T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- T, I, M, D are not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""timed"", E is the 4th letter).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word contains E and it is fixed at position 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, with E at position 4.

Now, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include E at position 4 (since it's correct and we can keep it there to reduce variables).
- Avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.
- Use new letters to test for the remaining positions (1,2,3,5).

The remaining positions to guess are 1,2,3, and 5.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- The other letters (positions 1,2,3,5) are from the unused letters and are common to maximize information.

What letters are left? The English alphabet minus the used and incorrect ones.

Used and incorrect: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.

So, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters for 5-letter words: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need a word of the form _ _ _ E _

With the first three and last letter from the available set, avoiding the forbidden letters.

Let's think of common words that fit.

Examples:
- ""SPOKE"": S-P-O-K-E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. In ""SPOKE"", E is at position 5, so not good.

We need E at position 4, so the word must end with something else, and E must be the fourth letter.

So, pattern: ? ? ? E ?

Possible words:
- ""HOPES"": H-O-P-E-S? Then E is at position 4? H=1, O=2, P=3, E=4, S=5. Yes. And letters: H, O, P, S are available? Check: H not used, O not used, P not used, S not used. And avoid C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D? Yes.

But ""HOPES"" has S at the end? That's fine.

Another: ""LOVES"": L-O-V-E-S? Similarly, L=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. L, O, V, S available? L not used, O not used, V not used, S not used.

But V is less common? Still possible.

""BOXES"": B-O-X-E-S? B=1, O=2, X=3, E=4, S=5. X is uncommon? Might not be ideal.

""JOKES"": J-O-K-E-S? J and K? J is less common.

""POKES"": P-O-K-E-S? P, O, K, E, S. K is available.

But we have multiple options.

We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another: ""GLOVE"": G-L-O-V-E? But E is at position 5? G-L-O-V-E: positions 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? But we need E at position 4, so this has E at 5? Not good.

We must have E at position 4.

So, words ending with E are not allowed? No, the word can end with any letter, but E must be at position 4, so the last letter is position 5, which is not E? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from first guess, E is not at position 5, so in the secret word, position 5 is not E. Therefore, in our guess, we can have any letter at position 5 except E? But we know it's not E, so we should not put E there? Correct.

In ""HOPES"", position 5 is S, not E, so that's fine.

Similarly, ""LOVES"" has S at 5.

But let's list more: ""WIPES""? W-I-P-E-S? But I is not allowed? I is in the forbidden list? From guess 2, I got x, so I is not in the word. So we cannot use I.

Similarly, T, M, D are out.

So, for ""WIPES"", it has I? Not allowed.

""COPES"": C is out? Not allowed.

""FUSES"": F-U-S-E-S? F=1, U=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? But S at position 3 and 5? That's possible? But we are testing S? Also, F and U are new.

But S repeated? Might be less efficient? Not necessarily.

""BUSES"": B-U-S-E-S? Similar.

But let's think of words without repeated letters to maximize information.

""HOPES"": H, O, P, E, S — all distinct and available.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S — distinct.

""POKES"": P, O, K, E, S — distinct.

""JOKES"": J, O, K, E, S — distinct, but J is infrequent.

""YOKES"": Y-O-K-E-S? Y is vowel-like? Available.

But we should prefer more common letters.

S, O, L, P, B, etc.

Another word: ""SHOES"": S-H-O-E-S? But E is at position 4? S=1, H=2, O=3, E=4, S=5? Then E at 4? But S repeated? Not ideal.

""GLUES"": G-L-U-E-S? G=1, L=2, U=3, E=4, S=5. Distinct letters: G, L, U, E, S. All available.

Similarly, ""FLUES"": F-L-U-E-S? Same.

But F and G are less common than S, O, etc.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E? But E is at position 5? H=1, O=2, U=3, S=4, E=5? But we need E at position 4? Not 5. So invalid for our pattern.

We need E at position 4.

So, ""HOUSE"" has E at 5? Not good.

""PHONE"": P-H-O-N-E? But N is out? N is not allowed. So invalid.

""PLANE"": P-L-A-N-E? A and N out? Not allowed.

So, back to ""HOPES"" or ""LOVES"".

Another common word: ""BOXED""? B-O-X-E-D? But D is out? From guess 2, D got x, so not allowed. So ""BOXED"" has D? Not good.

""JOKED"": J-O-K-E-D? D out.

""SOBER"": S-O-B-E-R? But R is out? R not allowed.

""COVER"": C and R out? Not good.

""LOVES"" seems good: L, O, V, E, S.

But V is not the most common. How about ""POSES""? P-O-S-E-S? S repeated? Not good.

""POSSE"": P-O-S-S-E? Double S and E at end? But E at position 5? Not 4.

We need E at 4.

""FOCUS"": No E? But we must have E at 4? We don't have to include E? But we know E is at position 4, so we can keep it fixed to reduce the search? Yes, it's efficient to keep known correct letters in place.

So, we should keep E at position 4.

Therefore, pattern: ? ? ? E ?

With positions 1,2,3,5 to be filled with available letters.

Now, to maximize information, we should choose common letters that we haven't tested.

Tested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,M,D.

So, untested common letters: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good word might be ""SLOPE"": S-L-O-P-E? But E is at position 5? S=1, L=2, O=3, P=4, E=5? Not E at 4.

""SLOPE"" has E at 5? Not good.

""SPOLE""? Not a word.

How about ""SOLVE"": S-O-L-V-E? E at 5? Not 4.

I think I need to think of words ending with a consonant after E? Like ""PAGES"": P-A-G-E-S? A is out? Not allowed.

""LOGES"": L-O-G-E-S? G and S? L=1, O=2, G=3, E=4, S=5. Yes! And letters: L, O, G, E, S. All available? L not used, O not used, G not used, S not used. And avoid forbidden? Yes.

""LOGES"" is a word? It might be less common; it means a lodge in French, but in English, it might be accepted? Wordle accepts various words.

""BOGUS"": B-O-G-U-S? No E? But we need E at position 4? Not included? We must have E at position 4? We can, but we are keeping E fixed? So ""BOGUS"" doesn't have E? So not good.

We need to include E at position 4.

So, ""LOGES"" has E at 4? L-O-G-E-S: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:G, 4:E, 5:S. Yes, E at 4.

Similarly, ""TOGES""? T is out? T not allowed.

""DOGES""? D is out.

""FOGES""? Not a word? F-O-G-E-S? Foges? Not standard.

""LOGES"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""HOSES"": H-O-S-E-S? S repeated? H=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S at 3 and 5? Not ideal.

""POSED"": P-O-S-E-D? But D is out? Not allowed.

""LOSES"": L-O-S-E-S? S repeated? L=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S twice.

""MOVES"": M is out? Not allowed.

""WOVES"": W-O-V-E-S? W=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. W, O, V, S available? W not used, O not used, V not used, S not used. And no forbidden letters? Yes.

""WOVES"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""LOVES"" is also common.

""LOVES"" and ""WOVES"" are both options.

But ""LOVES"" has L, which is common.

Another: ""HOPES"" as I thought earlier: H-O-P-E-S.

H, O, P, S are all common.

Similarly, ""HOPES"" might be better than ""WOVES"" because V is less common.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Available common letters: S, O, L, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

In ""HOPES"": H, O, P, S — that's four new letters, all common.

In ""LOVES"": L, O, V, S — V is less common.

In ""WOVES"": W, O, V, S — W and V less common.

So ""HOPES"" seems better: H, O, P, S.

Also, ""HOPES"" is a very common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""HOPES"".

So, the guess is ""HOPES"".

Feedback will tell us about H at pos1, O at pos2, P at pos3, and S at pos5.

Since E is fixed at pos4 and correct, we don't need feedback for it? But we'll get it anyway.

In the response, we output the guess.

So, <guess>hopes</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, and N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (""timed""): T, I, M, and D are not in the word. E is confirmed in position 4 (correct position).

Key insights:
- The secret word has E fixed at position 4.
- Invalid letters (must avoid): C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Available letters to use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (prioritizing common letters like S, O, L, P, H).

For the third guess:
- Must keep E in position 4.
- Choose a word with E at position 4, using new, common letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 to maximize information.
- ""HOPES"" fits well: 
  - H (position 1), O (position 2), P (position 3), E (position 4, fixed), S (position 5).
  - All letters are untested and common (H, O, P, S).
  - Avoids all invalid letters.

This guess tests four new letters and may reveal their positions or exclusions.

<guess>hopes</guess>",hopes,"We are on the third guess. The previous feedback is:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""timed"" -> T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- T, I, M, D are not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""timed"", E is the 4th letter).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word contains E and it is fixed at position 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, with E at position 4.

Now, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include E at position 4 (since it's correct and we can keep it there to reduce variables).
- Avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.
- Use new letters to test for the remaining positions (1,2,3,5).

The remaining positions to guess are 1,2,3, and 5.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- The other letters (positions 1,2,3,5) are from the unused letters and are common to maximize information.

What letters are left? The English alphabet minus the used and incorrect ones.

Used and incorrect: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.

So, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters for 5-letter words: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need a word of the form _ _ _ E _

With the first three and last letter from the available set, avoiding the forbidden letters.

Let's think of common words that fit.

Examples:
- ""SPOKE"": S-P-O-K-E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. In ""SPOKE"", E is at position 5, so not good.

We need E at position 4, so the word must end with something else, and E must be the fourth letter.

So, pattern: ? ? ? E ?

Possible words:
- ""HOPES"": H-O-P-E-S? Then E is at position 4? H=1, O=2, P=3, E=4, S=5. Yes. And letters: H, O, P, S are available? Check: H not used, O not used, P not used, S not used. And avoid C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D? Yes.

But ""HOPES"" has S at the end? That's fine.

Another: ""LOVES"": L-O-V-E-S? Similarly, L=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. L, O, V, S available? L not used, O not used, V not used, S not used.

But V is less common? Still possible.

""BOXES"": B-O-X-E-S? B=1, O=2, X=3, E=4, S=5. X is uncommon? Might not be ideal.

""JOKES"": J-O-K-E-S? J and K? J is less common.

""POKES"": P-O-K-E-S? P, O, K, E, S. K is available.

But we have multiple options.

We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another: ""GLOVE"": G-L-O-V-E? But E is at position 5? G-L-O-V-E: positions 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? But we need E at position 4, so this has E at 5? Not good.

We must have E at position 4.

So, words ending with E are not allowed? No, the word can end with any letter, but E must be at position 4, so the last letter is position 5, which is not E? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from first guess, E is not at position 5, so in the secret word, position 5 is not E. Therefore, in our guess, we can have any letter at position 5 except E? But we know it's not E, so we should not put E there? Correct.

In ""HOPES"", position 5 is S, not E, so that's fine.

Similarly, ""LOVES"" has S at 5.

But let's list more: ""WIPES""? W-I-P-E-S? But I is not allowed? I is in the forbidden list? From guess 2, I got x, so I is not in the word. So we cannot use I.

Similarly, T, M, D are out.

So, for ""WIPES"", it has I? Not allowed.

""COPES"": C is out? Not allowed.

""FUSES"": F-U-S-E-S? F=1, U=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? But S at position 3 and 5? That's possible? But we are testing S? Also, F and U are new.

But S repeated? Might be less efficient? Not necessarily.

""BUSES"": B-U-S-E-S? Similar.

But let's think of words without repeated letters to maximize information.

""HOPES"": H, O, P, E, S — all distinct and available.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S — distinct.

""POKES"": P, O, K, E, S — distinct.

""JOKES"": J, O, K, E, S — distinct, but J is infrequent.

""YOKES"": Y-O-K-E-S? Y is vowel-like? Available.

But we should prefer more common letters.

S, O, L, P, B, etc.

Another word: ""SHOES"": S-H-O-E-S? But E is at position 4? S=1, H=2, O=3, E=4, S=5? Then E at 4? But S repeated? Not ideal.

""GLUES"": G-L-U-E-S? G=1, L=2, U=3, E=4, S=5. Distinct letters: G, L, U, E, S. All available.

Similarly, ""FLUES"": F-L-U-E-S? Same.

But F and G are less common than S, O, etc.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E? But E is at position 5? H=1, O=2, U=3, S=4, E=5? But we need E at position 4? Not 5. So invalid for our pattern.

We need E at position 4.

So, ""HOUSE"" has E at 5? Not good.

""PHONE"": P-H-O-N-E? But N is out? N is not allowed. So invalid.

""PLANE"": P-L-A-N-E? A and N out? Not allowed.

So, back to ""HOPES"" or ""LOVES"".

Another common word: ""BOXED""? B-O-X-E-D? But D is out? From guess 2, D got x, so not allowed. So ""BOXED"" has D? Not good.

""JOKED"": J-O-K-E-D? D out.

""SOBER"": S-O-B-E-R? But R is out? R not allowed.

""COVER"": C and R out? Not good.

""LOVES"" seems good: L, O, V, E, S.

But V is not the most common. How about ""POSES""? P-O-S-E-S? S repeated? Not good.

""POSSE"": P-O-S-S-E? Double S and E at end? But E at position 5? Not 4.

We need E at 4.

""FOCUS"": No E? But we must have E at 4? We don't have to include E? But we know E is at position 4, so we can keep it fixed to reduce the search? Yes, it's efficient to keep known correct letters in place.

So, we should keep E at position 4.

Therefore, pattern: ? ? ? E ?

With positions 1,2,3,5 to be filled with available letters.

Now, to maximize information, we should choose common letters that we haven't tested.

Tested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,M,D.

So, untested common letters: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good word might be ""SLOPE"": S-L-O-P-E? But E is at position 5? S=1, L=2, O=3, P=4, E=5? Not E at 4.

""SLOPE"" has E at 5? Not good.

""SPOLE""? Not a word.

How about ""SOLVE"": S-O-L-V-E? E at 5? Not 4.

I think I need to think of words ending with a consonant after E? Like ""PAGES"": P-A-G-E-S? A is out? Not allowed.

""LOGES"": L-O-G-E-S? G and S? L=1, O=2, G=3, E=4, S=5. Yes! And letters: L, O, G, E, S. All available? L not used, O not used, G not used, S not used. And avoid forbidden? Yes.

""LOGES"" is a word? It might be less common; it means a lodge in French, but in English, it might be accepted? Wordle accepts various words.

""BOGUS"": B-O-G-U-S? No E? But we need E at position 4? Not included? We must have E at position 4? We can, but we are keeping E fixed? So ""BOGUS"" doesn't have E? So not good.

We need to include E at position 4.

So, ""LOGES"" has E at 4? L-O-G-E-S: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:G, 4:E, 5:S. Yes, E at 4.

Similarly, ""TOGES""? T is out? T not allowed.

""DOGES""? D is out.

""FOGES""? Not a word? F-O-G-E-S? Foges? Not standard.

""LOGES"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""HOSES"": H-O-S-E-S? S repeated? H=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S at 3 and 5? Not ideal.

""POSED"": P-O-S-E-D? But D is out? Not allowed.

""LOSES"": L-O-S-E-S? S repeated? L=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S twice.

""MOVES"": M is out? Not allowed.

""WOVES"": W-O-V-E-S? W=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. W, O, V, S available? W not used, O not used, V not used, S not used. And no forbidden letters? Yes.

""WOVES"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""LOVES"" is also common.

""LOVES"" and ""WOVES"" are both options.

But ""LOVES"" has L, which is common.

Another: ""HOPES"" as I thought earlier: H-O-P-E-S.

H, O, P, S are all common.

Similarly, ""HOPES"" might be better than ""WOVES"" because V is less common.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Available common letters: S, O, L, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

In ""HOPES"": H, O, P, S — that's four new letters, all common.

In ""LOVES"": L, O, V, S — V is less common.

In ""WOVES"": W, O, V, S — W and V less common.

So ""HOPES"" seems better: H, O, P, S.

Also, ""HOPES"" is a very common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""HOPES"".

So, the guess is ""HOPES"".

Feedback will tell us about H at pos1, O at pos2, P at pos3, and S at pos5.

Since E is fixed at pos4 and correct, we don't need feedback for it? But we'll get it anyway.

In the response, we output the guess.

So, <guess>hopes</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, and N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (""timed""): T, I, M, and D are not in the word. E is confirmed in position 4 (correct position).

Key insights:
- The secret word has E fixed at position 4.
- Invalid letters (must avoid): C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Available letters to use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (prioritizing common letters like S, O, L, P, H).

For the third guess:
- Must keep E in position 4.
- Choose a word with E at position 4, using new, common letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 to maximize information.
- ""HOPES"" fits well: 
  - H (position 1), O (position 2), P (position 3), E (position 4, fixed), S (position 5).
  - All letters are untested and common (H, O, P, S).
  - Avoids all invalid letters.

This guess tests four new letters and may reveal their positions or exclusions.",Guess 3: hopes -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,HOVEL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:
C: x (C is not in the word)
R: x (R is not in the word)
A: x (A is not in the word)
N: x (N is not in the word)
E: - (E is in the word but in the wrong position)

So, from guess 1, we know:
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was the 5th letter in ""crane"").
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N.

For the second guess, we should choose a word that:
1. Contains the letter E (since we know it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N since they are not in the word.
3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

We need a 5-letter word that has E, but not in the last position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, N.

Possible positions for E: it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E that are not ending with E, and without the forbidden letters.

Common letters to try: we can use S, T, L, O, D, U, etc.

A common word that comes to mind is ""SPITE"", but it ends with E — that's position 5, so we should avoid having E at the end. But we know E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, the feedback was for position 5: E was at the end and got a dash meaning E is in the word but not necessarily in the last position? Actually, the dash indicates that E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So, in our next guess, we can put E in any position except 5. But note, we don't know where E is, so we should put it in a different position to test.

Moreover, we should try to eliminate other vowels? Since A is out, we have E already, but we can try other vowels: O, U, I?

I recall that a good second guess might be ""HOUSE"", but that ends with E — again position 5. So not good.

Another idea: ""TIMES"" — but S is common and E is in position 4? Actually, ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? T=1, I=2, M=3, E=4, S=5. But E is not at position 5? Position 5 is S. Actually, position 5 is the last letter.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5. Now, we need to avoid putting E at position 5 in the next guess? But that's not necessary for testing; we can put E at a different position to learn more about its location.

Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tested. Since in ""crane"", E was at pos5 and we know it's not at pos5, we should avoid putting it at pos5 to avoid wasting the position.

Let's list positions: 
Position 1: no information (we had C, which is wrong)
Position 2: we had R, wrong
Position 3: we had A, wrong
Position 4: we had N, wrong
Position 5: we had E and it is in the word, but not here.

So, for E, we know it's in the word but not at position 5.

Possible words: let me think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and avoid C,R,A,N.

Examples:

- E in position 1: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" but J might be rare. Or ""ETHOS""
- E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"", ""BETEL"", ""SETUP""
- E in position 3: e.g., ""TREAD"" — but R and A are invalid, so no. ""STEEP"" — S, T, E at 3? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, P at 5. But then we have double E? Not the best. ""STEEM""? Not a common word. Also, we need to avoid R and A and N? Wait, ""STEEP"" has no C,R,A,N? R is not allowed? We must avoid R? Yes, because R is out.

Constraints: cannot have C,A,R,N.

So, what about ""BELIE"" — but that ends with E? Position 5 is E, so not good. ""BELIE"" spelling: B-E-L-I-E, so position 5 is E. We shouldn't put E at position 5.

Better: ""BILLE"" — that's not a word.

Let me consider ""STELE"", but E at position 5? STELE: S-T-E-L-E? Standard spelling: STELE is S-T-E-L-E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E — that has two E's and ends with E? We know E is not at position 5, so having E at position 5 in a guess would be useless because we already know it's not there. So, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in any guess to save positions for testing other letters.

So, next guess should have E in one of positions 1-4, and no letter in position 5 that we know is not E? Actually, we don't know about position 5; it could be any letter except E? Not necessarily: we just know E is not at pos5, but other letters? We don't know.

But to avoid wasting the feedback, it's better to put E at one of positions 1-4 and put a new letter at position 5.

So, let's choose words without E at position 5.

Word: ""STOLE"" — S-T-O-L-E? Position 5 is E. So that has E at the end. Avoid.

""SPINE"": S-P-I-N-E? N is out because we know N is not in the word. Feedback for ""crane"": N was at position 4 and got an x, meaning N not in word. So we must not use N.

Similarly, avoid N.

Therefore, no N.

Possible word: ""SLICE"" — ends with E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

I'm stuck with E falling at the end. Consider words where E is earlier.

How about ""DEBT"" — too short? Must be 5 letters.

""DEBTS"": D-E-B-T-S? Then E is at position 2? And avoid position 5? Position 5 is S. And no C,A,R,N? D not used before, E we know, B not used, T not used, S common? Sounds good.

But ""DEBTS"" is a word? Yes, meaning debts as in money owed.

Another: ""DOZES"" — E at position 4? D-O-Z-E-S, so E at pos4, S at pos5. Z is not very common, but possible.

But we want common letters to get more hits.

Another idea: ""QUOTE"" — ends with E? Q-U-O-T-E? Position 5 E. Avoid.

""TIMEX"" — brand name? Not ideal.

""TEPID"": T-E-P-I-D? Positions: T=1, E=2, P=3, I=4, D=5. E is at pos2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes. Also, T and D are new.

Similarly, ""LEAPT"" — L-E-A-P-T? But A is out? We cannot use A? A is not in the word. So must avoid A.

""LEAPT"" has A? Yes, L,E,A,P,T? So contains A? Not allowed because A is not in word.

Therefore, must avoid A.

So ""TEPID"" is valid: T,E,P,I,D.

Check letters: T (new), E (in word, but we don't know position), P (new), I (new), D (new). Also, no C,R,A,N.

Another candidate: ""SPELT"" — S-P-E-L-T. E at pos3? Again, S,P,L,T new? But S,P,L,T are useful.

But wait, ""SPELT"" has L? Yes. We don't know about L.

We could include commonly used consonants: S,T,L etc.

Let's pick one that maximizes new information.

We know E is present, so by putting E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""TEPID"", E at pos2: 
- If we get ✓ for E, then it's correct position at pos2.
- If -, then E is in word and in wrong position (so either pos1,3,4? The word is 5 letters, but we don't have E at pos5? Wait, we know E is not at pos5 already? No, we only know E is somewhere else? We know E is in the word and not at pos5, but could be at pos1,2,3,4? After first guess, we know E exists but not at pos5. So in ""TEPID"", if E is at pos2, and if pos2 is correct, we get a ✓. Else, we might get a dash meaning it's in another position.

Similarly, we are testing T at the start? But we don't know.

Alternatively, ""TIMED"" — T-I-M-E-D? Position 4 E? Avoids C,A,R,N, and no E at end. But M and D?

Both are fine.

But ""TIMED"" might be better than ""TEPID"" because ""TIMED"" has M and D, while ""TEPID"" has P and D? Both good.

A common approach is to use a word with E and other vowels? But A is out already. We have I and O,U to consider? In ""TIMED"", there is I.

We also know that in Wordle, T, S, L, etc., are very common.

Another candidate: ""QUIET"" — but Q? Less common. Avoid.

""PIECE"" — P-I-E-C-E? But C is out? C not allowed. Also, ends with E? Avoid.

""SHIED"": S-H-I-E-D? E at position 4? S,H,I,E,D.

That could work: avoid C,R,A,N? Yes.

Also, S is very common.

Similarly, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D? Same concept.

But F might be less common? Not necessarily.

I think ""TIMED"" is good: T, I, M, E, D.

We don't know about any of these except E is in the word.

So, let's go with ""TIMED"".

Position by position:

If the feedback shows E is at position 4? Then we know it because ✓ or dash? Wait, but we have E at position 4? We don't know if position 4 is the right one? We will see.

Moreover, if E gets a dash, it means E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But we have T at1, I at2, M at3 — so if one of those is E? Then we get a dash for E? Let me think.

Actually, the feedback for each letter separately.

So, for ""TIMED"":

- T: if the first letter of secret word is T, ✓; else if T is in word at another position, -; else x.
- Similarly for I, M, E, D.

In the case of E at pos4: if E is not at pos4, then we get a dash meaning E exists (which we know) and at non-4 position? But we already know E exists. Actually, if E is at pos4 and we guess E at pos4, ✓. If E is at say pos2 and we guess E at pos4, we get - for E? And also if E is at pos2, then for I we might get something? But I at pos2: if I is not the letter? This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""TOOTH"" — but no E? No, we must include E? Actually not mandatory? Including E helps us narrow down its position? We don't have to. But since we know E is in the word, including E in the guess can give position information? But we are already limited to positions 1-4? No, we can guess words without E? But that would waste an opportunity to figure out where E is.

For example, if we don't include E and get no dash for E? That can't happen since E is in word? Actually, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, then at least one other letter would be E? But we would get an x for every letter? And we know E is present? So to find E and its position, we ought to include E in our guess? Yes.

Hence, include E but not at position 5.

Considering these, ""TIMED"" seems reasonable.

Another common approach: use a word that has E and many other common letters we haven't tried? We can think of letters: B,D,G,H,I,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z? Since C,A,R,N are out.

So, S,T,L,M,D,P etc.

Word: ""MEDIA"" — but A is out? Must avoid A.

""TOPED"" — not common? TOPED meaning? Might not be well-known. Avoid.

""STOLE"" — ends with E? Avoid.

How about ""STYLE"": S-T-Y-L-E? E at position 5? Avoid.

Do you see the problem? Many common words end with E.

Another idea: ""EXPEL"" — E at start? Position 1 is E? Then X is not common.

""EVITE"" — V is less common? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""BEIGE"" — ends with E? Not good.

""PETIT"" — P-E-T-I-T? But T repeated? Positions: P at1, E at2, T at3, I at4, T at5? Then E at2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes? But T? We have two T's? That might be useful? No, the word has T twice? We don't know about T yet.

But ""PETIT"" is a word? Yes.

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me choose ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D.

""TIMED"" is a valid English word.

So, I'll go with ""TIMED"".

Feedback: we'll see what happens.

Therefore, the guessed word is ""TIMED"".

But before that, let me think if there is a better choice.

Another candidate: ""COULD"" — but C is out? Cannot use C.

""DWELL"" — only four letters? Or ""DWELL"" is 5? D-W-E-L-L? E at position 3? And L's? Valid? Avoids C,A,R,N? Yes.

But we have double L? That might be inefficient? Not necessarily.

But ""TIMED"" seems more standard.

We can try ""SPEND"" — but S,P,E,N,D? N is out because we know N is not in the word? First guess feedback N was wrong? So we must avoid N? ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? So invalid because N is not in the secret word? Therefore, we cannot guess words with N? That's correct: since N is not in the word, if we guess a word with N, we'll get an x? So we avoid letters known to be absent? Yes? So no N in any guesses.

Similarly, no C, R, A, N.

Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid because it contains N.

Back to ""TIMED"": no C,R,A,N? T,I,M,E,D — all allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DIETS""? D-I-E-T-S? Ends with S? E at position 3? Better than ""TIMED""?

""DIETS"" has E at position 3? D=1, I=2, E=3, T=4, S=5? Then E at 3? And avoids C,A,R,N? Also common letters.

Yes, and S is at the end? We haven't tested position 5? Since E was not at 5, but position 5 could be S? So we are testing S at the end.

Similarly, ""TIMED"" tests D at the end.

But both are fine. I'll stick with ""TIMED"".

So guess: TIMED

But wait, ""TIMED"" has T at the beginning? And position 1 was previously C, which was not in the word? So T is new? So might reveal something? Yes.

Another word: ""LIVES"" — L,I,V,E,S? E at position 4? Not end? But V? Not common? And L? Fine.

I think ""TIMED"" is suitable.

So, final decision: guess ""TIMED"".

In the response format, we need to output <guess>timed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess:
- ""crane"" had feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- This means: 
  - C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess:
- Must include E (since it's in the word), but not in position 5.
- Must avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (like T, I, M, D) to gather new information and narrow down E's position.

Selecting ""timed"" as the guess:
- Places E in position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: T, I, M, D.
- A invalid letters (C, R, A, N not present).
- Maximizes information potential by testing E's position and new letters at untested positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 were untouched for non-E letters).

<guess>timed</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: timed -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. The previous feedback is:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""timed"" -> T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- T, I, M, D are not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""timed"", E is the 4th letter).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word contains E and it is fixed at position 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, with E at position 4.

Now, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include E at position 4 (since it's correct and we can keep it there to reduce variables).
- Avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.
- Use new letters to test for the remaining positions (1,2,3,5).

The remaining positions to guess are 1,2,3, and 5.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- The other letters (positions 1,2,3,5) are from the unused letters and are common to maximize information.

What letters are left? The English alphabet minus the used and incorrect ones.

Used and incorrect: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.

So, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters for 5-letter words: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need a word of the form _ _ _ E _

With the first three and last letter from the available set, avoiding the forbidden letters.

Let's think of common words that fit.

Examples:
- ""SPOKE"": S-P-O-K-E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. In ""SPOKE"", E is at position 5, so not good.

We need E at position 4, so the word must end with something else, and E must be the fourth letter.

So, pattern: ? ? ? E ?

Possible words:
- ""HOPES"": H-O-P-E-S? Then E is at position 4? H=1, O=2, P=3, E=4, S=5. Yes. And letters: H, O, P, S are available? Check: H not used, O not used, P not used, S not used. And avoid C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D? Yes.

But ""HOPES"" has S at the end? That's fine.

Another: ""LOVES"": L-O-V-E-S? Similarly, L=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. L, O, V, S available? L not used, O not used, V not used, S not used.

But V is less common? Still possible.

""BOXES"": B-O-X-E-S? B=1, O=2, X=3, E=4, S=5. X is uncommon? Might not be ideal.

""JOKES"": J-O-K-E-S? J and K? J is less common.

""POKES"": P-O-K-E-S? P, O, K, E, S. K is available.

But we have multiple options.

We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another: ""GLOVE"": G-L-O-V-E? But E is at position 5? G-L-O-V-E: positions 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? But we need E at position 4, so this has E at 5? Not good.

We must have E at position 4.

So, words ending with E are not allowed? No, the word can end with any letter, but E must be at position 4, so the last letter is position 5, which is not E? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from first guess, E is not at position 5, so in the secret word, position 5 is not E. Therefore, in our guess, we can have any letter at position 5 except E? But we know it's not E, so we should not put E there? Correct.

In ""HOPES"", position 5 is S, not E, so that's fine.

Similarly, ""LOVES"" has S at 5.

But let's list more: ""WIPES""? W-I-P-E-S? But I is not allowed? I is in the forbidden list? From guess 2, I got x, so I is not in the word. So we cannot use I.

Similarly, T, M, D are out.

So, for ""WIPES"", it has I? Not allowed.

""COPES"": C is out? Not allowed.

""FUSES"": F-U-S-E-S? F=1, U=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? But S at position 3 and 5? That's possible? But we are testing S? Also, F and U are new.

But S repeated? Might be less efficient? Not necessarily.

""BUSES"": B-U-S-E-S? Similar.

But let's think of words without repeated letters to maximize information.

""HOPES"": H, O, P, E, S — all distinct and available.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S — distinct.

""POKES"": P, O, K, E, S — distinct.

""JOKES"": J, O, K, E, S — distinct, but J is infrequent.

""YOKES"": Y-O-K-E-S? Y is vowel-like? Available.

But we should prefer more common letters.

S, O, L, P, B, etc.

Another word: ""SHOES"": S-H-O-E-S? But E is at position 4? S=1, H=2, O=3, E=4, S=5? Then E at 4? But S repeated? Not ideal.

""GLUES"": G-L-U-E-S? G=1, L=2, U=3, E=4, S=5. Distinct letters: G, L, U, E, S. All available.

Similarly, ""FLUES"": F-L-U-E-S? Same.

But F and G are less common than S, O, etc.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E? But E is at position 5? H=1, O=2, U=3, S=4, E=5? But we need E at position 4? Not 5. So invalid for our pattern.

We need E at position 4.

So, ""HOUSE"" has E at 5? Not good.

""PHONE"": P-H-O-N-E? But N is out? N is not allowed. So invalid.

""PLANE"": P-L-A-N-E? A and N out? Not allowed.

So, back to ""HOPES"" or ""LOVES"".

Another common word: ""BOXED""? B-O-X-E-D? But D is out? From guess 2, D got x, so not allowed. So ""BOXED"" has D? Not good.

""JOKED"": J-O-K-E-D? D out.

""SOBER"": S-O-B-E-R? But R is out? R not allowed.

""COVER"": C and R out? Not good.

""LOVES"" seems good: L, O, V, E, S.

But V is not the most common. How about ""POSES""? P-O-S-E-S? S repeated? Not good.

""POSSE"": P-O-S-S-E? Double S and E at end? But E at position 5? Not 4.

We need E at 4.

""FOCUS"": No E? But we must have E at 4? We don't have to include E? But we know E is at position 4, so we can keep it fixed to reduce the search? Yes, it's efficient to keep known correct letters in place.

So, we should keep E at position 4.

Therefore, pattern: ? ? ? E ?

With positions 1,2,3,5 to be filled with available letters.

Now, to maximize information, we should choose common letters that we haven't tested.

Tested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,M,D.

So, untested common letters: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good word might be ""SLOPE"": S-L-O-P-E? But E is at position 5? S=1, L=2, O=3, P=4, E=5? Not E at 4.

""SLOPE"" has E at 5? Not good.

""SPOLE""? Not a word.

How about ""SOLVE"": S-O-L-V-E? E at 5? Not 4.

I think I need to think of words ending with a consonant after E? Like ""PAGES"": P-A-G-E-S? A is out? Not allowed.

""LOGES"": L-O-G-E-S? G and S? L=1, O=2, G=3, E=4, S=5. Yes! And letters: L, O, G, E, S. All available? L not used, O not used, G not used, S not used. And avoid forbidden? Yes.

""LOGES"" is a word? It might be less common; it means a lodge in French, but in English, it might be accepted? Wordle accepts various words.

""BOGUS"": B-O-G-U-S? No E? But we need E at position 4? Not included? We must have E at position 4? We can, but we are keeping E fixed? So ""BOGUS"" doesn't have E? So not good.

We need to include E at position 4.

So, ""LOGES"" has E at 4? L-O-G-E-S: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:G, 4:E, 5:S. Yes, E at 4.

Similarly, ""TOGES""? T is out? T not allowed.

""DOGES""? D is out.

""FOGES""? Not a word? F-O-G-E-S? Foges? Not standard.

""LOGES"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""HOSES"": H-O-S-E-S? S repeated? H=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S at 3 and 5? Not ideal.

""POSED"": P-O-S-E-D? But D is out? Not allowed.

""LOSES"": L-O-S-E-S? S repeated? L=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S twice.

""MOVES"": M is out? Not allowed.

""WOVES"": W-O-V-E-S? W=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. W, O, V, S available? W not used, O not used, V not used, S not used. And no forbidden letters? Yes.

""WOVES"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""LOVES"" is also common.

""LOVES"" and ""WOVES"" are both options.

But ""LOVES"" has L, which is common.

Another: ""HOPES"" as I thought earlier: H-O-P-E-S.

H, O, P, S are all common.

Similarly, ""HOPES"" might be better than ""WOVES"" because V is less common.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Available common letters: S, O, L, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

In ""HOPES"": H, O, P, S — that's four new letters, all common.

In ""LOVES"": L, O, V, S — V is less common.

In ""WOVES"": W, O, V, S — W and V less common.

So ""HOPES"" seems better: H, O, P, S.

Also, ""HOPES"" is a very common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""HOPES"".

So, the guess is ""HOPES"".

Feedback will tell us about H at pos1, O at pos2, P at pos3, and S at pos5.

Since E is fixed at pos4 and correct, we don't need feedback for it? But we'll get it anyway.

In the response, we output the guess.

So, <guess>hopes</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, and N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (""timed""): T, I, M, and D are not in the word. E is confirmed in position 4 (correct position).

Key insights:
- The secret word has E fixed at position 4.
- Invalid letters (must avoid): C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Available letters to use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (prioritizing common letters like S, O, L, P, H).

For the third guess:
- Must keep E in position 4.
- Choose a word with E at position 4, using new, common letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 to maximize information.
- ""HOPES"" fits well: 
  - H (position 1), O (position 2), P (position 3), E (position 4, fixed), S (position 5).
  - All letters are untested and common (H, O, P, S).
  - Avoids all invalid letters.

This guess tests four new letters and may reveal their positions or exclusions.

But we know E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, the feedback was for position 5: E was at the end and got a dash meaning E is in the word but not necessarily in the last position? Actually, the dash indicates that E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nSo, in our next guess, we can put E in any position except 5. But note, we don\'t know where E is, so we should put it in a different position to test.\n\nMoreover, we should try to eliminate other vowels? Since A is out, we have E already, but we can try other vowels: O, U, I?\n\nI recall that a good second guess might be ""HOUSE"", but that ends with E — again position 5. So not good.\n\nAnother idea: ""TIMES"" — but S is common and E is in position 4? Actually, ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? T=1, I=2, M=3, E=4, S=5. But E is not at position 5? Position 5 is S. Actually, position 5 is the last letter.\n\nIn ""crane"", E was at position 5. Now, we need to avoid putting E at position 5 in the next guess? But that\'s not necessary for testing; we can put E at a different position to learn more about its location.\n\nAlternatively, we can put E in a position we haven\'t tested. Since in ""crane"", E was at pos5 and we know it\'s not at pos5, we should avoid putting it at pos5 to avoid wasting the position.\n\nLet\'s list positions: \nPosition 1: no information (we had C, which is wrong)\nPosition 2: we had R, wrong\nPosition 3: we had A, wrong\nPosition 4: we had N, wrong\nPosition 5: we had E and it is in the word, but not here.\n\nSo, for E, we know it\'s in the word but not at position 5.\n\nPossible words: let me think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and avoid C,R,A,N.\n\nExamples:\n\n- E in position 1: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" but J might be rare. Or ""ETHOS""\n- E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"", ""BETEL"", ""SETUP""\n- E in position 3: e.g., ""TREAD"" — but R and A are invalid, so no. ""STEEP"" — S, T, E at 3? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, P at 5. But then we have double E? Not the best. ""STEEM""? Not a common word. Also, we need to avoid R and A and N? Wait, ""STEEP"" has no C,R,A,N? R is not allowed? We must avoid R? Yes, because R is out.\n\nConstraints: cannot have C,A,R,N.\n\nSo, what about ""BELIE"" — but that ends with E? Position 5 is E, so not good. ""BELIE"" spelling: B-E-L-I-E, so position 5 is E. We shouldn\'t put E at position 5.\n\nBetter: ""BILLE"" — that\'s not a word.\n\nLet me consider ""STELE"", but E at position 5? STELE: S-T-E-L-E? Standard spelling: STELE is S-T-E-L-E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E — that has two E\'s and ends with E? We know E is not at position 5, so having E at position 5 in a guess would be useless because we already know it\'s not there. So, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 in any guess to save positions for testing other letters.\n\nSo, next guess should have E in one of positions 1-4, and no letter in position 5 that we know is not E? Actually, we don\'t know about position 5; it could be any letter except E? Not necessarily: we just know E is not at pos5, but other letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid wasting the feedback, it\'s better to put E at one of positions 1-4 and put a new letter at position 5.\n\nSo, let\'s choose words without E at position 5.\n\nWord: ""STOLE"" — S-T-O-L-E? Position 5 is E. So that has E at the end. Avoid.\n\n""SPINE"": S-P-I-N-E? N is out because we know N is not in the word. Feedback for ""crane"": N was at position 4 and got an x, meaning N not in word. So we must not use N.\n\nSimilarly, avoid N.\n\nTherefore, no N.\n\nPossible word: ""SLICE"" — ends with E? Position 5 E. Avoid.\n\nI\'m stuck with E falling at the end. Consider words where E is earlier.\n\nHow about ""DEBT"" — too short? Must be 5 letters.\n\n""DEBTS"": D-E-B-T-S? Then E is at position 2? And avoid position 5? Position 5 is S. And no C,A,R,N? D not used before, E we know, B not used, T not used, S common? Sounds good.\n\nBut ""DEBTS"" is a word? Yes, meaning debts as in money owed.\n\nAnother: ""DOZES"" — E at position 4? D-O-Z-E-S, so E at pos4, S at pos5. Z is not very common, but possible.\n\nBut we want common letters to get more hits.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUOTE"" — ends with E? Q-U-O-T-E? Position 5 E. Avoid.\n\n""TIMEX"" — brand name? Not ideal.\n\n""TEPID"": T-E-P-I-D? Positions: T=1, E=2, P=3, I=4, D=5. E is at pos2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes. Also, T and D are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEAPT"" — L-E-A-P-T? But A is out? We cannot use A? A is not in the word. So must avoid A.\n\n""LEAPT"" has A? Yes, L,E,A,P,T? So contains A? Not allowed because A is not in word.\n\nTherefore, must avoid A.\n\nSo ""TEPID"" is valid: T,E,P,I,D.\n\nCheck letters: T (new), E (in word, but we don\'t know position), P (new), I (new), D (new). Also, no C,R,A,N.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPELT"" — S-P-E-L-T. E at pos3? Again, S,P,L,T new? But S,P,L,T are useful.\n\nBut wait, ""SPELT"" has L? Yes. We don\'t know about L.\n\nWe could include commonly used consonants: S,T,L etc.\n\nLet\'s pick one that maximizes new information.\n\nWe know E is present, so by putting E in different positions, we can get information about its location.\n\nIn ""TEPID"", E at pos2: \n- If we get ✓ for E, then it\'s correct position at pos2.\n- If -, then E is in word and in wrong position (so either pos1,3,4? The word is 5 letters, but we don\'t have E at pos5? Wait, we know E is not at pos5 already? No, we only know E is somewhere else? We know E is in the word and not at pos5, but could be at pos1,2,3,4? After first guess, we know E exists but not at pos5. So in ""TEPID"", if E is at pos2, and if pos2 is correct, we get a ✓. Else, we might get a dash meaning it\'s in another position.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T at the start? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""TIMED"" — T-I-M-E-D? Position 4 E? Avoids C,A,R,N, and no E at end. But M and D?\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nBut ""TIMED"" might be better than ""TEPID"" because ""TIMED"" has M and D, while ""TEPID"" has P and D? Both good.\n\nA common approach is to use a word with E and other vowels? But A is out already. We have I and O,U to consider? In ""TIMED"", there is I.\n\nWe also know that in Wordle, T, S, L, etc., are very common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""QUIET"" — but Q? Less common. Avoid.\n\n""PIECE"" — P-I-E-C-E? But C is out? C not allowed. Also, ends with E? Avoid.\n\n""SHIED"": S-H-I-E-D? E at position 4? S,H,I,E,D.\n\nThat could work: avoid C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\nAlso, S is very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D? Same concept.\n\nBut F might be less common? Not necessarily.\n\nI think ""TIMED"" is good: T, I, M, E, D.\n\nWe don\'t know about any of these except E is in the word.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""TIMED"".\n\nPosition by position:\n\nIf the feedback shows E is at position 4? Then we know it because ✓ or dash? Wait, but we have E at position 4? We don\'t know if position 4 is the right one? We will see.\n\nMoreover, if E gets a dash, it means E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But we have T at1, I at2, M at3 — so if one of those is E? Then we get a dash for E? Let me think.\n\nActually, the feedback for each letter separately.\n\nSo, for ""TIMED"":\n\n- T: if the first letter of secret word is T, ✓; else if T is in word at another position, -; else x.\n- Similarly for I, M, E, D.\n\nIn the case of E at pos4: if E is not at pos4, then we get a dash meaning E exists (which we know) and at non-4 position? But we already know E exists. Actually, if E is at pos4 and we guess E at pos4, ✓. If E is at say pos2 and we guess E at pos4, we get - for E? And also if E is at pos2, then for I we might get something? But I at pos2: if I is not the letter? This will give us good information.\n\nAlternatively, ""TOOTH"" — but no E? No, we must include E? Actually not mandatory? Including E helps us narrow down its position? We don\'t have to. But since we know E is in the word, including E in the guess can give position information? But we are already limited to positions 1-4? No, we can guess words without E? But that would waste an opportunity to figure out where E is.\n\nFor example, if we don\'t include E and get no dash for E? That can\'t happen since E is in word? Actually, we know E is in the word, so if we don\'t include E, then at least one other letter would be E? But we would get an x for every letter? And we know E is present? So to find E and its position, we ought to include E in our guess? Yes.\n\nHence, include E but not at position 5.\n\nConsidering these, ""TIMED"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother common approach: use a word that has E and many other common letters we haven\'t tried? We can think of letters: B,D,G,H,I,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z? Since C,A,R,N are out.\n\nSo, S,T,L,M,D,P etc.\n\nWord: ""MEDIA"" — but A is out? Must avoid A.\n\n""TOPED"" — not common? TOPED meaning? Might not be well-known. Avoid.\n\n""STOLE"" — ends with E? Avoid.\n\nHow about ""STYLE"": S-T-Y-L-E? E at position 5? Avoid.\n\nDo you see the problem? Many common words end with E.\n\nAnother idea: ""EXPEL"" — E at start? Position 1 is E? Then X is not common.\n\n""EVITE"" — V is less common? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps ""BEIGE"" — ends with E? Not good.\n\n""PETIT"" — P-E-T-I-T? But T repeated? Positions: P at1, E at2, T at3, I at4, T at5? Then E at2? And avoids C,A,R,N? Yes? But T? We have two T\'s? That might be useful? No, the word has T twice? We don\'t know about T yet.\n\nBut ""PETIT"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut I think I\'m overcomplicating.\n\nLet me choose ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D.\n\n""TIMED"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TIMED"".\n\nFeedback: we\'ll see what happens.\n\nTherefore, the guessed word is ""TIMED"".\n\nBut before that, let me think if there is a better choice.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COULD"" — but C is out? Cannot use C.\n\n""DWELL"" — only four letters? Or ""DWELL"" is 5? D-W-E-L-L? E at position 3? And L\'s? Valid? Avoids C,A,R,N? Yes.\n\nBut we have double L? That might be inefficient? Not necessarily.\n\nBut ""TIMED"" seems more standard.\n\nWe can try ""SPEND"" — but S,P,E,N,D? N is out because we know N is not in the word? First guess feedback N was wrong? So we must avoid N? ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? So invalid because N is not in the secret word? Therefore, we cannot guess words with N? That\'s correct: since N is not in the word, if we guess a word with N, we\'ll get an x? So we avoid letters known to be absent? Yes? So no N in any guesses.\n\nSimilarly, no C, R, A, N.\n\nTherefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid because it contains N.\n\nBack to ""TIMED"": no C,R,A,N? T,I,M,E,D — all allowed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIETS""? D-I-E-T-S? Ends with S? E at position 3? Better than ""TIMED""?\n\n""DIETS"" has E at position 3? D=1, I=2, E=3, T=4, S=5? Then E at 3? And avoids C,A,R,N? Also common letters.\n\nYes, and S is at the end? We haven\'t tested position 5? Since E was not at 5, but position 5 could be S? So we are testing S at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIMED"" tests D at the end.\n\nBut both are fine. I\'ll stick with ""TIMED"".\n\nSo guess: TIMED\n\nBut wait, ""TIMED"" has T at the beginning? And position 1 was previously C, which was not in the word? So T is new? So might reveal something? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""LIVES"" — L,I,V,E,S? E at position 4? Not end? But V? Not common? And L? Fine.\n\nI think ""TIMED"" is suitable.\n\nSo, final decision: guess ""TIMED"".\n\nIn the response format, we need to output <guess>timed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess:\n- ""crane"" had feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n- This means: \n  - C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n  \nFor the second guess:\n- Must include E (since it\'s in the word), but not in position 5.\n- Must avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (like T, I, M, D) to gather new information and narrow down E\'s position.\n\nSelecting ""timed"" as the guess:\n- Places E in position 4 (avoiding position 5).\n- Uses new letters: T, I, M, D.\n- A invalid letters (C, R, A, N not present).\n- Maximizes information potential by testing E\'s position and new letters at untested positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 were untouched for non-E letters).\n\n<guess>timed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: timed -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the third guess. The previous feedback is:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""timed"" -> T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- T, I, M, D are not in the word.\n- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""timed"", E is the 4th letter).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word contains E and it is fixed at position 4.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.\n\nWe also know that the word has 5 letters, with E at position 4.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we need to:\n- Include E at position 4 (since it\'s correct and we can keep it there to reduce variables).\n- Avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.\n- Use new letters to test for the remaining positions (1,2,3,5).\n\nThe remaining positions to guess are 1,2,3, and 5.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Has E at position 4.\n- The other letters (positions 1,2,3,5) are from the unused letters and are common to maximize information.\n\nWhat letters are left? The English alphabet minus the used and incorrect ones.\n\nUsed and incorrect: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.\n\nSo, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters for 5-letter words: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.\n\nWe need a word of the form _ _ _ E _\n\nWith the first three and last letter from the available set, avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit.\n\nExamples:\n- ""SPOKE"": S-P-O-K-E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. In ""SPOKE"", E is at position 5, so not good.\n\nWe need E at position 4, so the word must end with something else, and E must be the fourth letter.\n\nSo, pattern: ? ? ? E ?\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HOPES"": H-O-P-E-S? Then E is at position 4? H=1, O=2, P=3, E=4, S=5. Yes. And letters: H, O, P, S are available? Check: H not used, O not used, P not used, S not used. And avoid C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D? Yes.\n\nBut ""HOPES"" has S at the end? That\'s fine.\n\nAnother: ""LOVES"": L-O-V-E-S? Similarly, L=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. L, O, V, S available? L not used, O not used, V not used, S not used.\n\nBut V is less common? Still possible.\n\n""BOXES"": B-O-X-E-S? B=1, O=2, X=3, E=4, S=5. X is uncommon? Might not be ideal.\n\n""JOKES"": J-O-K-E-S? J and K? J is less common.\n\n""POKES"": P-O-K-E-S? P, O, K, E, S. K is available.\n\nBut we have multiple options.\n\nWe also want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nAnother: ""GLOVE"": G-L-O-V-E? But E is at position 5? G-L-O-V-E: positions 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? But we need E at position 4, so this has E at 5? Not good.\n\nWe must have E at position 4.\n\nSo, words ending with E are not allowed? No, the word can end with any letter, but E must be at position 4, so the last letter is position 5, which is not E? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from first guess, E is not at position 5, so in the secret word, position 5 is not E. Therefore, in our guess, we can have any letter at position 5 except E? But we know it\'s not E, so we should not put E there? Correct.\n\nIn ""HOPES"", position 5 is S, not E, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""LOVES"" has S at 5.\n\nBut let\'s list more: ""WIPES""? W-I-P-E-S? But I is not allowed? I is in the forbidden list? From guess 2, I got x, so I is not in the word. So we cannot use I.\n\nSimilarly, T, M, D are out.\n\nSo, for ""WIPES"", it has I? Not allowed.\n\n""COPES"": C is out? Not allowed.\n\n""FUSES"": F-U-S-E-S? F=1, U=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? But S at position 3 and 5? That\'s possible? But we are testing S? Also, F and U are new.\n\nBut S repeated? Might be less efficient? Not necessarily.\n\n""BUSES"": B-U-S-E-S? Similar.\n\nBut let\'s think of words without repeated letters to maximize information.\n\n""HOPES"": H, O, P, E, S — all distinct and available.\n\n""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S — distinct.\n\n""POKES"": P, O, K, E, S — distinct.\n\n""JOKES"": J, O, K, E, S — distinct, but J is infrequent.\n\n""YOKES"": Y-O-K-E-S? Y is vowel-like? Available.\n\nBut we should prefer more common letters.\n\nS, O, L, P, B, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOES"": S-H-O-E-S? But E is at position 4? S=1, H=2, O=3, E=4, S=5? Then E at 4? But S repeated? Not ideal.\n\n""GLUES"": G-L-U-E-S? G=1, L=2, U=3, E=4, S=5. Distinct letters: G, L, U, E, S. All available.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLUES"": F-L-U-E-S? Same.\n\nBut F and G are less common than S, O, etc.\n\n""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E? But E is at position 5? H=1, O=2, U=3, S=4, E=5? But we need E at position 4? Not 5. So invalid for our pattern.\n\nWe need E at position 4.\n\nSo, ""HOUSE"" has E at 5? Not good.\n\n""PHONE"": P-H-O-N-E? But N is out? N is not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""PLANE"": P-L-A-N-E? A and N out? Not allowed.\n\nSo, back to ""HOPES"" or ""LOVES"".\n\nAnother common word: ""BOXED""? B-O-X-E-D? But D is out? From guess 2, D got x, so not allowed. So ""BOXED"" has D? Not good.\n\n""JOKED"": J-O-K-E-D? D out.\n\n""SOBER"": S-O-B-E-R? But R is out? R not allowed.\n\n""COVER"": C and R out? Not good.\n\n""LOVES"" seems good: L, O, V, E, S.\n\nBut V is not the most common. How about ""POSES""? P-O-S-E-S? S repeated? Not good.\n\n""POSSE"": P-O-S-S-E? Double S and E at end? But E at position 5? Not 4.\n\nWe need E at 4.\n\n""FOCUS"": No E? But we must have E at 4? We don\'t have to include E? But we know E is at position 4, so we can keep it fixed to reduce the search? Yes, it\'s efficient to keep known correct letters in place.\n\nSo, we should keep E at position 4.\n\nTherefore, pattern: ? ? ? E ?\n\nWith positions 1,2,3,5 to be filled with available letters.\n\nNow, to maximize information, we should choose common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nTested letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,M,D.\n\nSo, untested common letters: S, L, O, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.\n\nA good word might be ""SLOPE"": S-L-O-P-E? But E is at position 5? S=1, L=2, O=3, P=4, E=5? Not E at 4.\n\n""SLOPE"" has E at 5? Not good.\n\n""SPOLE""? Not a word.\n\nHow about ""SOLVE"": S-O-L-V-E? E at 5? Not 4.\n\nI think I need to think of words ending with a consonant after E? Like ""PAGES"": P-A-G-E-S? A is out? Not allowed.\n\n""LOGES"": L-O-G-E-S? G and S? L=1, O=2, G=3, E=4, S=5. Yes! And letters: L, O, G, E, S. All available? L not used, O not used, G not used, S not used. And avoid forbidden? Yes.\n\n""LOGES"" is a word? It might be less common; it means a lodge in French, but in English, it might be accepted? Wordle accepts various words.\n\n""BOGUS"": B-O-G-U-S? No E? But we need E at position 4? Not included? We must have E at position 4? We can, but we are keeping E fixed? So ""BOGUS"" doesn\'t have E? So not good.\n\nWe need to include E at position 4.\n\nSo, ""LOGES"" has E at 4? L-O-G-E-S: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:G, 4:E, 5:S. Yes, E at 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOGES""? T is out? T not allowed.\n\n""DOGES""? D is out.\n\n""FOGES""? Not a word? F-O-G-E-S? Foges? Not standard.\n\n""LOGES"" might be acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""HOSES"": H-O-S-E-S? S repeated? H=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S at 3 and 5? Not ideal.\n\n""POSED"": P-O-S-E-D? But D is out? Not allowed.\n\n""LOSES"": L-O-S-E-S? S repeated? L=1, O=2, S=3, E=4, S=5? S twice.\n\n""MOVES"": M is out? Not allowed.\n\n""WOVES"": W-O-V-E-S? W=1, O=2, V=3, E=4, S=5. W, O, V, S available? W not used, O not used, V not used, S not used. And no forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n""WOVES"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""LOVES"" is also common.\n\n""LOVES"" and ""WOVES"" are both options.\n\nBut ""LOVES"" has L, which is common.\n\nAnother: ""HOPES"" as I thought earlier: H-O-P-E-S.\n\nH, O, P, S are all common.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOPES"" might be better than ""WOVES"" because V is less common.\n\nBut we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAvailable common letters: S, O, L, P, U, B, G, H, K, etc.\n\nIn ""HOPES"": H, O, P, S — that\'s four new letters, all common.\n\nIn ""LOVES"": L, O, V, S — V is less common.\n\nIn ""WOVES"": W, O, V, S — W and V less common.\n\nSo ""HOPES"" seems better: H, O, P, S.\n\nAlso, ""HOPES"" is a very common word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""HOPES"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""HOPES"".\n\nFeedback will tell us about H at pos1, O at pos2, P at pos3, and S at pos5.\n\nSince E is fixed at pos4 and correct, we don\'t need feedback for it? But we\'ll get it anyway.\n\nIn the response, we output the guess.\n\nSo, <guess>hopes</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, and N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- From Guess 2 (""timed""): T, I, M, and D are not in the word. E is confirmed in position 4 (correct position).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has E fixed at position 4.\n- Invalid letters (must avoid): C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D.\n- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n- Available letters to use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (prioritizing common letters like S, O, L, P, H).\n\nFor the third guess:\n- Must keep E in position 4.\n- Choose a word with E at position 4, using new, common letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 to maximize information.\n- ""HOPES"" fits well: \n  - H (position 1), O (position 2), P (position 3), E (position 4, fixed), S (position 5).\n  - All letters are untested and common (H, O, P, S).\n  - Avoids all invalid letters.\n\nThis guess tests four new letters and may reveal their positions or exclusions.\n\n<guess>hopes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: timed -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: hopes -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""timed"" -> T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
- Meaning: T, I, M, D are absent; E is correct at position 4.

Guess 3: ""hopes"" -> H(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(x)
- Meaning: H is correct at position 1? H was at position 1 in ""hopes"", so if ✓, then H is in word and at correct position: H at 1?
- O is correct at position 2? O was at position 2, so if ✓, then O is at position 2? And E is at position 4? Still ✓?
- P is absent (x) at position 3? P was at position 3? So P not in word?
- S is absent (x) at position 5? S was at position 5? So S not in word?

Let's clarify the feedback: H(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(x)
For ""hopes"": positions
1: H -> ✓ meaning correct letter and position? So secret word has H at position 1.
2: O -> ✓ meaning correct letter and position? So secret word has O at position 2.
3: P -> x meaning P not in the word at all.
4: E -> ✓ meaning correct, we already knew E at position 4.
5: S -> x meaning S not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- Secret word: position 1: H, position 2: O, position 4: E.
- So the word is H O _ E _
- Also, P and S are not in the word? Based on feedback: P(x) and S(x), meaning P and S are absent? So not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S? Plus, we know E, H, O are present? With fixed positions.

So current knowledge:
- Fixed positions: 
  - Pos 1: H
  - Pos 2: O
  - Pos 4: E
- Remaining positions: Pos 3 and Pos 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S? And also from guess 3, S is out? Yes.

We need to find a word of the form H O _ E _ 
With the third and fifth letters to be guessed.

Pos 3 and Pos 5: could be any letters except the absent ones.

Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S.

Also, we know E is at 4, so E cannot be at other positions? But already used and fixed.

We need to choose a word that fits H O _ E _.

Possible letters for position 3 and 5: the English alphabet minus absent and used? But H and O are used? But they can be repeated? No, in Wordle, if a letter is used in one position, it might be repeated unless we have information? But here, H and O are at fixed positions, so they are used? But they can be repeated only if the word has multiple, but with feedback? We don't have information on repetition? So we assume no repetition? But not necessarily.

In this case, since H, O, E are all in the word at specific positions, but for positions 3 and 5, they could be H, O, or other letters? But generally, to save guesses, we assume no repetition unless needed? But let's see based on feedback.

For example, if the word were ""HOTEL"", then O is at position 2? But if we don't restrict? We are to guess positions 3 and 5.

First, list possible missing letters? Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Etc.

Now, we need a word: H O ? E ? 

Common possibilities:
- Ending with L? Like ""HOTEL""? But T is out? Not available? T is absent per guess 2? T(x), so T not in word? So ""HOTEL"" not possible because T? But also P,S etc? Not.

T is out? Yes.

Similarly, common words: ""HOMER""? But M is out? M absent? From guess 2? M(x), and also R absent? ""HOMER"" has R? R absent? Yes.

""HOUSE""? But S absent? And U? But ""HOUSE"" has S? S is out? Not.

What about ""HORSE""? But R and S absent? Not.

""HOLE?"" only four letters? Five? ""HOLED""? H-O-L-E-D? But D absent? D not in word? From guess 2? D(x)? So not.

Possible words:
- ""HOLDER""? Only six letters? Short.
"" H O L E _ "" five letters? Position 3 and 5?

""HOLE"" is four? So five: ""HOLES""? But S absent? S not allowed.

Another: ""HOTLY""? But T and L? T out? Not.

With available letters? Let's list possible English words fitting H O ? E ? 

For position 3: a letter not in absent list? And position 5: similarly.

Available: B, F, G, K, L, U, V, W, Y? For example.

Words:
- ""HOKEY"": H-O-K-E-Y? Is that a word? Meaning: overly sentimental? Yes, but Y at position 5? Letters: K and Y? Both available? No absent? Also, check absent: C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D,P,S — K not there? Y not there? So possible.

""HOKEY"" is H=1, O=2, K=3, E=4, Y=5.

Similarly, ""HOWE"": too short? Four? ""HOWEL""? Not common? ""HOW"" something? ""HOWBE""? Not.

""HOUSE"" not with S out.

""HOOVE"": H-O-O-V-E? But O repeated? Positions: H1, O2, O3? But we have O at position 2? If O at position 3, we don't know? But let's see.

But ""HOOVE"" is not a common word; it might mean part of an animal? Hoof? But usually ""hoof"" is different.

Another: ""HONEY"": H-O-N-E-Y? But N is absent? N out? Not allowed? Yes, N in absent list.

""HOLEY"": H-O-L-E-Y? Positions: H1, O2, L3, E4, Y5? And ""HOLEY"" means full of holes? Valid word? And letters: L and Y, both available? Absent list: C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D,P,S? L not there? Y not there? So yes.

Similarly, ""HOKEY"" as above.

""HOIZE""? Not a word.

""JOKE"" short? ""JOKED"" but D out.

How about ""MOVED"" but M and D out? Not.

So, possible words: ""HOLEY"" or ""HOKEY""? Or others?

Also, ""HOVER"": H-O-V-E-R? But R out? Not allowed? R absent? Yes.

""BOXED"" not with D out? And B? Position.

B is available: ""HOBES""? Not a word? H-O-B-E-S? But S out? Not.

""LOVES"" not with S out? And L? But position 3? For ""H O _ E _"" with L? ""HOLES"" not S out? Not.

Another word: ""HOWBE"" not standard? ""HOGBE"" not? 

Perhaps ""HOLE"" related? ""HOLED"" past tense? H-O-L-E-D? But D absent? Not.

Valid: 
- ""HOLEY"": H, O, L, E, Y — with L at 3 and Y at 5? Acceptable? Yes.
- ""HOKEY"": H, O, K, E, Y — K at 3, Y at 5.

Also, ""HOMED""? But M out? Not.

""FOLEY""? But F? Position, ""FOLEY"" F1,O2,L3,E4,Y5? But we have fixed H at position 1? So not matching? We must have H at position 1? So the word must start with H? Yes, because H is correct at pos1? So we cannot have ""FOLEY""? Correct.

So options are ""HOLEY"" and ""HOKEY""? Both ending with Y at position 5.

But are there others?

""HOXES""? H-O-X-E-S? S out? Not allowed? S absent? Yes.

""HOKED""? Past of ""hoke""? Not common? And D out? Not.

""VOLES""? But V? But ""VOLES"" doesn't start with H? And we have fixed H and O at beginning? So no.

Another: ""HOWES""? H-O-W-E-S? S out? Not allowed? S absent? Yes.

""GROUP"" no E? Not.

So, probably only common words are ""HOLEY"" and ""HOKEY""? Or ""HOWEE""? Not familiar.

Perhaps there are more: ""HOLLER"" too long? Or ""HOLLA""? Not?

Another: ""HOLLA"" is 5 letters? H-O-L-L-A? But A absent? A not allowed? And L repeated? Also position 4 is E? Not, would be A? No, we need E at 4.

So ""HOLEY"" or ""HOKEY"" seem the main choices.

We need to guess one.

Since we have two options, and we have tries left? Only one unknown? No, positions 3 and 5 are unknown? But we know the pattern H O ? E ?

For position 3? Can be different letters? And position 5 similarly? We don't know if Y is in the word? So far no information about Y? Or other letters.

In this guess, we can choose a word that uses common letters or narrow down.

But since we only have positions 3 and 5 unknown? And we know all other letters? So actually, the word must be H O X E Y for some X? And Y? But not necessarily? Position 5 could be different letter.

But in common English? ""HOLEY"" and ""HOKEY"" are candidates.

Also, ""HOSE"" with E? But not five? ""HOZED""? Not.

Perhaps ""HONG"" not? Etc.

Let me confirm absent letters: from previous:

Guess 1: C,R,A,N absent
Guess 2: T,I,M,D absent
Guess 3: P,S absent

And fixed: E,H,O.

So available: B,F,G,J,K,L,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

For word: H O ? E ?

With ? position: one letter for position 3 and one for position 5? From available.

Now, for ""HOLEY"": positions: H1,O2,L3,E4,Y5. L and Y available? Yes? L not absent? Y not absent.

Similarly ""HOKEY"": K and Y? K available? Yes.

Also, ""HOVEL"": H-O-V-E-L? Five? Positions: H1,O2,V3,E4,L5? Then V and L? Both available? And ""HOVEL"" is a word meaning a small cabin? Yes.

Oh! I missed that: ""HOVEL"": H-O-V-E-L? Yes, with V at position 3 and L at position 5.

Similarly, ""HOWEL"": H-O-W-E-L? Same? ""HOWEL"" might be variant? But not as common? But ""HOVEL"" is standard.

Also, ""HOWES"" not with S? Etc.

So now we have:
Candidates:
- ""HOLEY"" (L3, Y5)
- ""HOKEY"" (K3, Y5)
- ""HOVEL"" (V3, L5)

And others?

""FOYER""? But start with F? Not H? Must start with H? Yes.

""HOYED""? With D? D absent? Not.

""HOYLE""? H-O-Y-L-E? Position: H1,O2,Y3,L4,E5? But we need E at position 4? Here E is at position 5? Not fixed? So wrong pattern? Not.

Similarly, ""HOLEY"" is H-O-L-E-Y? Positions: L at 3, E at 4, Y at 5? Correct.

We must have E at position 4? In ""HOLEY"", E is at 4? Position 4 is E? Yes.

Similarly for ""HOKEY"": position 4 E? Position 5 Y? Yes.

And ""HOVEL"": position 4 E? Position 5 L? Yes.

But in ""HOVEL"", position 5 is L? And position 3 is V? So different characters? We haven't tested V or L? Yes.

Similarly, HOLEY and HOKEY share Y at 5? But not necessarily? Position 5 could be different.

Since we don't know, we need to guess one.

We are on guess 4? We have 6 tries? So we can guess and if wrong, we have more chances? But we want to make an informed choice.

All of ""HOLEY"", ""HOKEY"", ""HOVEL"" use untested letters? V, K, L, Y? Etc.

To maximize information or be efficient? Since we know three letters? Only two missing? We can choose a word that covers common possibilities? But any guess will reveal?

We can pick one that tests more frequent letters? But L and Y might be more common than K or V? For example.

In English 5-letter words? With H O _ E _ pattern? Some are possible? Like ""HOMES"" but M and S out? Not.

Another: ""HOGAN""? No E? Not.

""HOUSE"" not with S? Etc.

So ""HOLEY"" with L and Y? Both common suffixes?

""HOKEY"" may be less common? But acceptable.

""HOVEL"" might be a good guess? Because it uses V and L? Which are distinct.

But let's consider: if we guess ""HOVEL"", then if correct, we win? If not, the feedback will tell us about V at pos3 and L at pos5? Or position?

But since the pattern might be Y at pos5? Etc.

Similarly, no other constraints? So, perhaps just guess one.

Common word: ""HOLEY"" means full of holes? Less common than ""HOVEL""?

""HOVEL"" is common? Yes? Or ""HOLEY""? Might be equal.

To be safe, we can guess ""HOVEL""? Because L might be more common at the end? But anyway.

Notice that in the secret word, position 5 must not be E? But could be a vowel or consonant? And position 3 is unknown.

Perhaps there is a word with G? Like ""HOGEE""? Not common.

I think the main candidates are three: ""HOVEL"", ""HOLEY"", ""HOKEY"".

But ""HOKEY"" has K? Which is less frequent? So better to avoid? Guess the other two? We can't avoid? Need to guess one.

Since we are at guess 4 and have 6 tries, it's ok to guess one; if wrong, we can adjust.

But let's see if we can infer? For example, in position 5? No information? So we don't know.

Another word: ""CHOSE"" but C and S out? Not.

""SHOES"" not with S? Etc.

So, I'll go with ""HOVEL""? Because L at the end is common? Like ""LEVEL"" but different? Or ""NOVEL""? But not.

But ""HOVEL"" exists.

Perhaps ""HOWDY"" but D? And no E? Not.

So, guess ""HOVEL""?

But in ""HOVEL"", position 5 is L? But L? We don't know about L? So it could be.

But in the feedback for ""hopes"", we didn't test L? So yes.

Similarly, ""HOLEY"" also has L, but at position 3? And Y at 5? Different.

Perhaps we can include letters we haven't guessed? Yes.

I think ""HOVEL"" is a bit more common? Or ""HOLEY""?

To make a decision, let's choose ""HOVEL"".

So guess: ""HOVEL""
</think>
After reviewing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not at position 5.

- **Guess 2: ""timed""**  
  Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(✓), D(x)  
  Interpretation: T, I, M, D are absent; E is confirmed at position 4 (correct position).

- **Guess 3: ""hopes""**  
  Feedback: H(✓), O(✓), P(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  Interpretation: H is correct at position 1; O is correct at position 2; P and S are absent; E is confirmed at position 4.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed letters and positions:**
   - Position 1: H
   - Position 2: O
   - Position 4: E
   - The secret word pattern is: `H O ? E ?`

2. **Absent letters** (not in the word at all):  
   C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S

3. **Remaining positions**:  
   - Position 3: Unknown, must be a letter not in the absent list.
   - Position 5: Unknown, must be a letter not in the absent list.

4. **Available letters** (untested and not absent):  
   B, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

5. **Possible word candidates** fitting `H O ? E ?`:
   - ""HOVEL"" (H O V E L): Tests V at position 3 and L at position 5.
   - ""HOLEY"" (H O L E Y): Tests L at position 3 and Y at position 5.
   - ""HOKEY"" (H O K E Y): Tests K at position 3 and Y at position 5.
   - These are common English words matching the pattern.

### Thought Process:
- Only positions 3 and 5 need solving, making this guess efficient by focusing on fixed letters.
- Prioritize words with common, untested letters to maximize information if incorrect.
- ""HOVEL"" uses V and L (both plausible) and is a standard word.
- ""HOKEY"" uses K (less common) and Y; ""HOLEY"" is less frequent but valid.
- Choosing ""HOVEL"" as it tests two new letters (V and L) in distinct positions and maintains exploration efficiency.
- If ""HOVEL"" is correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on positions 3 and 5 will constrain the solution space significantly.

<guess>hovel</guess>",hovel,"We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""timed"" -> T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
- Meaning: T, I, M, D are absent; E is correct at position 4.

Guess 3: ""hopes"" -> H(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(x)
- Meaning: H is correct at position 1? H was at position 1 in ""hopes"", so if ✓, then H is in word and at correct position: H at 1?
- O is correct at position 2? O was at position 2, so if ✓, then O is at position 2? And E is at position 4? Still ✓?
- P is absent (x) at position 3? P was at position 3? So P not in word?
- S is absent (x) at position 5? S was at position 5? So S not in word?

Let's clarify the feedback: H(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(x)
For ""hopes"": positions
1: H -> ✓ meaning correct letter and position? So secret word has H at position 1.
2: O -> ✓ meaning correct letter and position? So secret word has O at position 2.
3: P -> x meaning P not in the word at all.
4: E -> ✓ meaning correct, we already knew E at position 4.
5: S -> x meaning S not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- Secret word: position 1: H, position 2: O, position 4: E.
- So the word is H O _ E _
- Also, P and S are not in the word? Based on feedback: P(x) and S(x), meaning P and S are absent? So not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S? Plus, we know E, H, O are present? With fixed positions.

So current knowledge:
- Fixed positions: 
  - Pos 1: H
  - Pos 2: O
  - Pos 4: E
- Remaining positions: Pos 3 and Pos 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S? And also from guess 3, S is out? Yes.

We need to find a word of the form H O _ E _ 
With the third and fifth letters to be guessed.

Pos 3 and Pos 5: could be any letters except the absent ones.

Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S.

Also, we know E is at 4, so E cannot be at other positions? But already used and fixed.

We need to choose a word that fits H O _ E _.

Possible letters for position 3 and 5: the English alphabet minus absent and used? But H and O are used? But they can be repeated? No, in Wordle, if a letter is used in one position, it might be repeated unless we have information? But here, H and O are at fixed positions, so they are used? But they can be repeated only if the word has multiple, but with feedback? We don't have information on repetition? So we assume no repetition? But not necessarily.

In this case, since H, O, E are all in the word at specific positions, but for positions 3 and 5, they could be H, O, or other letters? But generally, to save guesses, we assume no repetition unless needed? But let's see based on feedback.

For example, if the word were ""HOTEL"", then O is at position 2? But if we don't restrict? We are to guess positions 3 and 5.

First, list possible missing letters? Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Etc.

Now, we need a word: H O ? E ? 

Common possibilities:
- Ending with L? Like ""HOTEL""? But T is out? Not available? T is absent per guess 2? T(x), so T not in word? So ""HOTEL"" not possible because T? But also P,S etc? Not.

T is out? Yes.

Similarly, common words: ""HOMER""? But M is out? M absent? From guess 2? M(x), and also R absent? ""HOMER"" has R? R absent? Yes.

""HOUSE""? But S absent? And U? But ""HOUSE"" has S? S is out? Not.

What about ""HORSE""? But R and S absent? Not.

""HOLE?"" only four letters? Five? ""HOLED""? H-O-L-E-D? But D absent? D not in word? From guess 2? D(x)? So not.

Possible words:
- ""HOLDER""? Only six letters? Short.
"" H O L E _ "" five letters? Position 3 and 5?

""HOLE"" is four? So five: ""HOLES""? But S absent? S not allowed.

Another: ""HOTLY""? But T and L? T out? Not.

With available letters? Let's list possible English words fitting H O ? E ? 

For position 3: a letter not in absent list? And position 5: similarly.

Available: B, F, G, K, L, U, V, W, Y? For example.

Words:
- ""HOKEY"": H-O-K-E-Y? Is that a word? Meaning: overly sentimental? Yes, but Y at position 5? Letters: K and Y? Both available? No absent? Also, check absent: C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D,P,S — K not there? Y not there? So possible.

""HOKEY"" is H=1, O=2, K=3, E=4, Y=5.

Similarly, ""HOWE"": too short? Four? ""HOWEL""? Not common? ""HOW"" something? ""HOWBE""? Not.

""HOUSE"" not with S out.

""HOOVE"": H-O-O-V-E? But O repeated? Positions: H1, O2, O3? But we have O at position 2? If O at position 3, we don't know? But let's see.

But ""HOOVE"" is not a common word; it might mean part of an animal? Hoof? But usually ""hoof"" is different.

Another: ""HONEY"": H-O-N-E-Y? But N is absent? N out? Not allowed? Yes, N in absent list.

""HOLEY"": H-O-L-E-Y? Positions: H1, O2, L3, E4, Y5? And ""HOLEY"" means full of holes? Valid word? And letters: L and Y, both available? Absent list: C,R,A,N,T,I,M,D,P,S? L not there? Y not there? So yes.

Similarly, ""HOKEY"" as above.

""HOIZE""? Not a word.

""JOKE"" short? ""JOKED"" but D out.

How about ""MOVED"" but M and D out? Not.

So, possible words: ""HOLEY"" or ""HOKEY""? Or others?

Also, ""HOVER"": H-O-V-E-R? But R out? Not allowed? R absent? Yes.

""BOXED"" not with D out? And B? Position.

B is available: ""HOBES""? Not a word? H-O-B-E-S? But S out? Not.

""LOVES"" not with S out? And L? But position 3? For ""H O _ E _"" with L? ""HOLES"" not S out? Not.

Another word: ""HOWBE"" not standard? ""HOGBE"" not? 

Perhaps ""HOLE"" related? ""HOLED"" past tense? H-O-L-E-D? But D absent? Not.

Valid: 
- ""HOLEY"": H, O, L, E, Y — with L at 3 and Y at 5? Acceptable? Yes.
- ""HOKEY"": H, O, K, E, Y — K at 3, Y at 5.

Also, ""HOMED""? But M out? Not.

""FOLEY""? But F? Position, ""FOLEY"" F1,O2,L3,E4,Y5? But we have fixed H at position 1? So not matching? We must have H at position 1? So the word must start with H? Yes, because H is correct at pos1? So we cannot have ""FOLEY""? Correct.

So options are ""HOLEY"" and ""HOKEY""? Both ending with Y at position 5.

But are there others?

""HOXES""? H-O-X-E-S? S out? Not allowed? S absent? Yes.

""HOKED""? Past of ""hoke""? Not common? And D out? Not.

""VOLES""? But V? But ""VOLES"" doesn't start with H? And we have fixed H and O at beginning? So no.

Another: ""HOWES""? H-O-W-E-S? S out? Not allowed? S absent? Yes.

""GROUP"" no E? Not.

So, probably only common words are ""HOLEY"" and ""HOKEY""? Or ""HOWEE""? Not familiar.

Perhaps there are more: ""HOLLER"" too long? Or ""HOLLA""? Not?

Another: ""HOLLA"" is 5 letters? H-O-L-L-A? But A absent? A not allowed? And L repeated? Also position 4 is E? Not, would be A? No, we need E at 4.

So ""HOLEY"" or ""HOKEY"" seem the main choices.

We need to guess one.

Since we have two options, and we have tries left? Only one unknown? No, positions 3 and 5 are unknown? But we know the pattern H O ? E ?

For position 3? Can be different letters? And position 5 similarly? We don't know if Y is in the word? So far no information about Y? Or other letters.

In this guess, we can choose a word that uses common letters or narrow down.

But since we only have positions 3 and 5 unknown? And we know all other letters? So actually, the word must be H O X E Y for some X? And Y? But not necessarily? Position 5 could be different letter.

But in common English? ""HOLEY"" and ""HOKEY"" are candidates.

Also, ""HOSE"" with E? But not five? ""HOZED""? Not.

Perhaps ""HONG"" not? Etc.

Let me confirm absent letters: from previous:

Guess 1: C,R,A,N absent
Guess 2: T,I,M,D absent
Guess 3: P,S absent

And fixed: E,H,O.

So available: B,F,G,J,K,L,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

For word: H O ? E ?

With ? position: one letter for position 3 and one for position 5? From available.

Now, for ""HOLEY"": positions: H1,O2,L3,E4,Y5. L and Y available? Yes? L not absent? Y not absent.

Similarly ""HOKEY"": K and Y? K available? Yes.

Also, ""HOVEL"": H-O-V-E-L? Five? Positions: H1,O2,V3,E4,L5? Then V and L? Both available? And ""HOVEL"" is a word meaning a small cabin? Yes.

Oh! I missed that: ""HOVEL"": H-O-V-E-L? Yes, with V at position 3 and L at position 5.

Similarly, ""HOWEL"": H-O-W-E-L? Same? ""HOWEL"" might be variant? But not as common? But ""HOVEL"" is standard.

Also, ""HOWES"" not with S? Etc.

So now we have:
Candidates:
- ""HOLEY"" (L3, Y5)
- ""HOKEY"" (K3, Y5)
- ""HOVEL"" (V3, L5)

And others?

""FOYER""? But start with F? Not H? Must start with H? Yes.

""HOYED""? With D? D absent? Not.

""HOYLE""? H-O-Y-L-E? Position: H1,O2,Y3,L4,E5? But we need E at position 4? Here E is at position 5? Not fixed? So wrong pattern? Not.

Similarly, ""HOLEY"" is H-O-L-E-Y? Positions: L at 3, E at 4, Y at 5? Correct.

We must have E at position 4? In ""HOLEY"", E is at 4? Position 4 is E? Yes.

Similarly for ""HOKEY"": position 4 E? Position 5 Y? Yes.

And ""HOVEL"": position 4 E? Position 5 L? Yes.

But in ""HOVEL"", position 5 is L? And position 3 is V? So different characters? We haven't tested V or L? Yes.

Similarly, HOLEY and HOKEY share Y at 5? But not necessarily? Position 5 could be different.

Since we don't know, we need to guess one.

We are on guess 4? We have 6 tries? So we can guess and if wrong, we have more chances? But we want to make an informed choice.

All of ""HOLEY"", ""HOKEY"", ""HOVEL"" use untested letters? V, K, L, Y? Etc.

To maximize information or be efficient? Since we know three letters? Only two missing? We can choose a word that covers common possibilities? But any guess will reveal?

We can pick one that tests more frequent letters? But L and Y might be more common than K or V? For example.

In English 5-letter words? With H O _ E _ pattern? Some are possible? Like ""HOMES"" but M and S out? Not.

Another: ""HOGAN""? No E? Not.

""HOUSE"" not with S? Etc.

So ""HOLEY"" with L and Y? Both common suffixes?

""HOKEY"" may be less common? But acceptable.

""HOVEL"" might be a good guess? Because it uses V and L? Which are distinct.

But let's consider: if we guess ""HOVEL"", then if correct, we win? If not, the feedback will tell us about V at pos3 and L at pos5? Or position?

But since the pattern might be Y at pos5? Etc.

Similarly, no other constraints? So, perhaps just guess one.

Common word: ""HOLEY"" means full of holes? Less common than ""HOVEL""?

""HOVEL"" is common? Yes? Or ""HOLEY""? Might be equal.

To be safe, we can guess ""HOVEL""? Because L might be more common at the end? But anyway.

Notice that in the secret word, position 5 must not be E? But could be a vowel or consonant? And position 3 is unknown.

Perhaps there is a word with G? Like ""HOGEE""? Not common.

I think the main candidates are three: ""HOVEL"", ""HOLEY"", ""HOKEY"".

But ""HOKEY"" has K? Which is less frequent? So better to avoid? Guess the other two? We can't avoid? Need to guess one.

Since we are at guess 4 and have 6 tries, it's ok to guess one; if wrong, we can adjust.

But let's see if we can infer? For example, in position 5? No information? So we don't know.

Another word: ""CHOSE"" but C and S out? Not.

""SHOES"" not with S? Etc.

So, I'll go with ""HOVEL""? Because L at the end is common? Like ""LEVEL"" but different? Or ""NOVEL""? But not.

But ""HOVEL"" exists.

Perhaps ""HOWDY"" but D? And no E? Not.

So, guess ""HOVEL""?

But in ""HOVEL"", position 5 is L? But L? We don't know about L? So it could be.

But in the feedback for ""hopes"", we didn't test L? So yes.

Similarly, ""HOLEY"" also has L, but at position 3? And Y at 5? Different.

Perhaps we can include letters we haven't guessed? Yes.

I think ""HOVEL"" is a bit more common? Or ""HOLEY""?

To make a decision, let's choose ""HOVEL"".

So guess: ""HOVEL""After reviewing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not at position 5.

- **Guess 2: ""timed""**  
  Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(✓), D(x)  
  Interpretation: T, I, M, D are absent; E is confirmed at position 4 (correct position).

- **Guess 3: ""hopes""**  
  Feedback: H(✓), O(✓), P(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  Interpretation: H is correct at position 1; O is correct at position 2; P and S are absent; E is confirmed at position 4.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed letters and positions:**
   - Position 1: H
   - Position 2: O
   - Position 4: E
   - The secret word pattern is: `H O ? E ?`

2. **Absent letters** (not in the word at all):  
   C, R, A, N, T, I, M, D, P, S

3. **Remaining positions**:  
   - Position 3: Unknown, must be a letter not in the absent list.
   - Position 5: Unknown, must be a letter not in the absent list.

4. **Available letters** (untested and not absent):  
   B, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

5. **Possible word candidates** fitting `H O ? E ?`:
   - ""HOVEL"" (H O V E L): Tests V at position 3 and L at position 5.
   - ""HOLEY"" (H O L E Y): Tests L at position 3 and Y at position 5.
   - ""HOKEY"" (H O K E Y): Tests K at position 3 and Y at position 5.
   - These are common English words matching the pattern.

### Thought Process:
- Only positions 3 and 5 need solving, making this guess efficient by focusing on fixed letters.
- Prioritize words with common, untested letters to maximize information if incorrect.
- ""HOVEL"" uses V and L (both plausible) and is a standard word.
- ""HOKEY"" uses K (less common) and Y; ""HOLEY"" is less frequent but valid.
- Choosing ""HOVEL"" as it tests two new letters (V and L) in distinct positions and maintains exploration efficiency.
- If ""HOVEL"" is correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on positions 3 and 5 will constrain the solution space significantly.",Guess 4: hovel -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
