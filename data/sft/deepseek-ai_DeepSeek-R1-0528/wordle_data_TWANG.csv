We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 Ideally, we pick a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 Some popular starting words are: SALET, CRATE, SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers some vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and no repeating letters.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we can use any valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" is known to be a strong starting word. But let me stick to ""CRANE"".

 But wait, the problem says: ""a valid 5-letter English word"". So we must pick a word that exists.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"". It uses common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Let me consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words in English:

 According to various sources, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 The word ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: five of the top letters? Actually, R (3rd), A (2nd), I (4th), S (6th), E (1st) -> that's good.

 Another word: ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but may be obscure.

 Since we want a common word, let's choose ""SALET"" if we are going for best opening? Or ""SLATE"" is more common.

 Actually, after checking, ""SLATE"" is a very common starting word.

 Alternatively, I see ""CRATE"", ""SLANT"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 After some thought, I'll pick ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T), and all are common.

 But note that the example in the problem used ""STORM"" which has two of the same letters? Actually, no repeating letters. Wait, ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> all distinct.

 Since we are starting, let's go with ""CRANE"":

 C R A N E

 But note: A and E are vowels, and C, R, N are consonants. 

 However, let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has higher frequency? Actually, ""RAISE"" has:

 R - common
 A - common
 I - common
 S - common
 E - common

 So I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 But wait, I can also consider avoiding letters that might be in the same word? Actually, first guess no info.

 So, let me pick ""RAISE"".

 Valid guess? Yes. So I'll go with RAISE.

 Alternatively, the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so they are valid.

 Therefore, my first guess: RAISE.
</think>
<thinking>
As this is the first guess, I have zero prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with distinct common letters to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

I analyzed English letter frequency in 5-letter words:
- High-frequency consonants: R, S, T, L, N
- High-frequency vowels: A, E, I, O

The ideal word should:
- Contain 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities
- Include multiple vowels and common consonants
- Avoid obscure words to ensure validity

Considering these factors, **""RAISE""** is a strong choice because:
1. It uses five distinct, high-frequency letters: R, A, I, S, E
2. It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word (meaning ""to lift or set up"")

Alternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" also meet criteria, but ""RAISE"" slightly optimizes vowel coverage. The feedback from this guess will efficiently reveal positional and inclusion information, especially about vowels which are critical for word formation.

Thus, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.

We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": 
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word, but not in the second position.
 I(x) -> I is not in the secret word.
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So what do we know?
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was marked '-'). So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. In ""RAISE"", A was in position 2. So it's in the word and yellow, meaning it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we know that R, I, S, E are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word contains A, but not R, I, S, or E.

 We must make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word
 - Contains A (since we know it's present)
 - Does not contain R, I, S, E (since they are absent)
 - And we should try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is present and must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5, we should avoid putting A in position 2 again.

 Also, note that the word might have repeating letters? The rules didn't say it can't, but typically they don't. And in the feedback, if a letter repeats, it gets marked appropriately only if it appears multiple times. But we don't have any indication of repetition yet.

 Without knowing the positions, we can use A in a different position in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that fits:
 - Excluded letters: R, I, S, E
 - Included letters: A (must be in the word)

 We can use common English consonants and vowels that are not excluded: 
 Vowels: O, U and sometimes Y? But Y can be used as a vowel or consonant. The excluded vowels are I and E (we only have A as vowel so far). We have O and U.

 Consonants: We excluded R and S. So we have T, N, L, C, D, M, P, ... etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A and avoid R,I,S,E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Words starting with A: But we need a word without E,R,I,S.
 - Words ending with A: Similarly.

 Common letters we can use: T, L, N, O, U, etc.

 Example words: 
 ""ABOUT"" : contains A (in position ?) and avoids R,I,S,E? 
   Let's check: A, B, O, U, T -> excludes R,I,S,E? Yes. But note: the feedback for A in the previous word was '-', meaning it's present and should be in our word. However, in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1? That might be a possibility.

 But wait, we don't know the position yet. So we could try to have A in a new position.

 However, we must remember: we also want to test multiple new letters to gain more information.

 Another idea: The word could have A in position 3? Or 4? 

 Since we don't know, let's pick a word that places A in a different position than position 2.

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADOBE"" -> but E is excluded? E is excluded because in the previous feedback E(x). So we cannot use E.

 So ""ADOBE"" has E -> invalid.

 Example with A in position 1: A, then avoid E,R,I,S? 
 Words: ""ABOUT"" (A in position 1), ""ABOUT"" is valid: A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 But is ""ABOUT"" a 5-letter word? Yes: A-B-O-U-T.

 Alternatively, A in position 3: Possible words: ""TOTAL"" -> but T,A,L: but L is okay? Excluded? Only R,I,S,E are excluded. Total has T,O,T,A,L -> two T's? That's acceptable.

 ""TOTAL"": 
 - T: new letter, O: new, T: repeated? A: we know is present, L: new.

 However, we want to avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage? But it might be necessary.

 But note that we are also testing additional letters: T, O, L in ""TOTAL"". But ""TOTAL"" has two T's and two A's? Wait: T, O, T, A, L -> actually only one A? And two T's.

 We might get feedback that helps us understand if T appears once or twice.

 Similarly, we can consider ""POUCH""? No A.

 So we need words containing A.

 Let me list words without E,R,I,S and with A:

 Some candidates:
   ABOUT: positions 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T
   MANGO: M, A, N, G, O -> note G is also a common letter? But acceptable? Yes.
   BANAL: B, A, N, A, L -> two A's? That might complicate. Also note L is common.
   PANDA: P, A, N, D, A -> two A's? Not good for information.
   TANGO: T, A, N, G, O -> distinct letters? T, A, N, G, O.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test? Because we only have A so far.

 So ""ABOUT"" uses A, B, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T? Actually A,B,O,U,T are distinct? Yes.

 Similarly, ""MANGO"": M,A,N,G,O -> distinct? Yes.

 But note: we only know A is present. The others are unknown and might be present or absent.

 We can also consider: ""PLAUT"" ? but not a word. 

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I? Yes, feedback said I is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""OCTAD""? Not common, avoid.

 Among the two: 
 ABOUT: uses A (position 1), B, O, U, T -> and avoids E,R,I,S.
 MANGO: A in position 2 -> but wait, in our previous guess we had A in position 2 and it was yellow? Meaning that the letter A is not in position 2? Then if we put A again in position 2, we would get a '-', meaning wrong position? But actually, we want to test A in a new position? The secret word does not have A in position 2. So we should avoid putting A in position 2 because we know it's incorrect.

 In MANGO: 
 If we put MANGO: M(position1), A(position2), N(position3), G(position4), O(position5)

 But we know that A is not in position 2? Because the secret word's A is not there. So having A in position 2 again would waste our chance? Yet the feedback would show A as '-'. Since the secret word has A, but not in position 2, then if we put A in position 2, we would get a '-' again? But that wouldn't tell us anything new because we already know that. We want to try A in a different position.

 Therefore, avoid putting A in position 2.

 That rules out words that have A in the second position? 

 So words like MANGO (A in position 2) is bad.

 Then what about ABOUT? A is in position 1: that's a new position.

 Also, any word that has A in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Possible words:

 Position 1: ABOUT, ACTOR? Actor: A,C,T,O,R -> but R is excluded? R is in the exclusion list. So no R. Therefore ACTOR invalid.

 Position 3: 
   PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids E,R,I,S. And A is in position 3. This is good? 
   CHANT: C,H,A,N,T -> same pattern.

 Position 4:
   Could try a word with A in fourth? Example: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> E is excluded. Invalid.

 Position 5:
   ""TABLA"" -> but T,A,B,L,A? Two A's? and we don't know about B. Not common? and A in position 2 and 5? We want only one A? We know A is present at least once. It could be that the word has two A's? But we don't know.

   Also, try ""KOALA"" -> K,O,A,L,A? Two A's? Again.

   Or ""NANGA"" -> not common.

   Better: find words with A only once and in position 5.

   Example: ""CHAIR"" -> C,H,A,I,R -> has I and R? Excluded.

   ""ATOLL"" -> A in position 1? No: A,T,O,L,L? 

   We need a word ending with A: ""PIZZA"" -> P,I,Z,Z,A -> has I? Excluded.

   Not easy? So maybe position 3 is easier.

 Considering that, let's pick ""PLANT"". It has:
 P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)

 We avoid E,R,I,S and we avoid putting A in position 2. 

 Advantages: 
 - Tests new letters: P, L, N, T (and A in a new position).
 - All distinct letters? Yes: P,L,A,N,T.

 But is ""PLANT"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, we are missing testing of vowels: We know that O and U are still possibilities? We haven't tested them. But we can test them later.

 Alternatively, ABOUT: positions 1: A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> tests vowels O and U? Yes, O and U. And distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T.

 So ABOUT tests two vowels (O and U) and consonants B and T? While PLANT tests consonants only.

 Since vowels are important, and we have only tested A? We haven't tested O and U? So ABOUT may be better for testing the vowel space.

 Let's not forget: the word must have A. By putting A in position 1 in ABOUT, we will get feedback on whether A is in the first position? If we get green, then we know. If we get yellow, then we know it's in positions 3,4,5? Actually, we already know it's not in position 2? And if we get yellow for A in position 1? Then A is in the word but not in position 1? Which we already knew it could be? But wait: if we put A in position 1 and it is green, then we know position 1 is A. If we get yellow, then we know A is not in position 1? That would be new information because we only knew before that it wasn't in 2? And if we get gray? But we already know A is in the word? It cannot be gray? Wait: the feedback rules: '-' means it's in the word but wrong position? And 'x' means not in the word? But we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it is still a '-'? That would tell us: yes A is present? But it's not in position 1? Which is new? And if it's green? That tells us it is in position 1.

 Therefore, by putting A in position 1, we might end up with: 
   Green: then we know the first letter is A? And then we restrict possibilities? 
   Yellow: then we know A is not in position 1? Then it must be in 3,4 or 5? (since in RAISE we had it in 2 and now 1 is wrong) -> so positions 3,4,5 and we avoid position 1.

 If we put A in position 3 (like PLANT) and get green? Then we know A is fixed at position 3? 

 Either way, we get new positional information about A? 

 However, ABOUT has the advantage that it also tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (B and T). 

 In terms of information: ABOUT covers more vowel ground? 

 But note: in the secret word, we already know there's no E,I? So vowels available are A (which we know), O, U, and sometimes Y? 

 Testing O and U might be valuable? 

 Alternatively, PLANT doesn't test O and U? 

 Therefore, I prefer ABOUT? Because it can help eliminate or confirm two vowels? 

 But also consider the frequency: letters like T, O, U are common? So testing them is good.

 So let's go with ABOUT.

 We must be cautious: the word ABOUT might not be the secret word because it's a common word? But it's possible? But we are just trying for information.

 Therefore, the guess: ABOUT.

 But wait: in position 5? We have T. T is a common consonant? We can test.

 So let me choose ABOUT.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, S, E are **absent** (marked x)
- A is **present** but not in position 2 (marked -)

### Key Constraints:
1. The secret word **contains A** but **not R, I, S, E**.
2. A must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
3. The guess should prioritize:
   - Testing A in a new position (avoiding position 2)
   - Covering new high-frequency consonants/vowels
   - Avoiding excluded letters (R,I,S,E)

### Optimal Second Guess: **ABOUT**
- **Why this word?**
  - Places A in **position 1** (untested position) to check if A is correctly positioned there.
  - Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T** (all distinct).
  - Uses vowels **O** and **U** (high value after excluding E/I).
  - Contains no repeated letters or excluded letters (R,I,S,E).

### Expected Information Gain:
- If A is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter.
- If A is yellow (-), we know A must be in positions 3/4/5.
- Feedback on B/O/U/T will reveal new letters or eliminate possibilities.

<thinking>
Given the constraints and information gap, ABOUT optimally probes positional data for A while efficiently testing new high-value vowels/consonants.
</thinking>

<guess>ABOUT</guess>",ABOUT,"We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": 
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word, but not in the second position.
 I(x) -> I is not in the secret word.
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So what do we know?
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was marked '-'). So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. In ""RAISE"", A was in position 2. So it's in the word and yellow, meaning it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we know that R, I, S, E are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word contains A, but not R, I, S, or E.

 We must make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word
 - Contains A (since we know it's present)
 - Does not contain R, I, S, E (since they are absent)
 - And we should try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is present and must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5, we should avoid putting A in position 2 again.

 Also, note that the word might have repeating letters? The rules didn't say it can't, but typically they don't. And in the feedback, if a letter repeats, it gets marked appropriately only if it appears multiple times. But we don't have any indication of repetition yet.

 Without knowing the positions, we can use A in a different position in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that fits:
 - Excluded letters: R, I, S, E
 - Included letters: A (must be in the word)

 We can use common English consonants and vowels that are not excluded: 
 Vowels: O, U and sometimes Y? But Y can be used as a vowel or consonant. The excluded vowels are I and E (we only have A as vowel so far). We have O and U.

 Consonants: We excluded R and S. So we have T, N, L, C, D, M, P, ... etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A and avoid R,I,S,E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Words starting with A: But we need a word without E,R,I,S.
 - Words ending with A: Similarly.

 Common letters we can use: T, L, N, O, U, etc.

 Example words: 
 ""ABOUT"" : contains A (in position ?) and avoids R,I,S,E? 
   Let's check: A, B, O, U, T -> excludes R,I,S,E? Yes. But note: the feedback for A in the previous word was '-', meaning it's present and should be in our word. However, in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1? That might be a possibility.

 But wait, we don't know the position yet. So we could try to have A in a new position.

 However, we must remember: we also want to test multiple new letters to gain more information.

 Another idea: The word could have A in position 3? Or 4? 

 Since we don't know, let's pick a word that places A in a different position than position 2.

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADOBE"" -> but E is excluded? E is excluded because in the previous feedback E(x). So we cannot use E.

 So ""ADOBE"" has E -> invalid.

 Example with A in position 1: A, then avoid E,R,I,S? 
 Words: ""ABOUT"" (A in position 1), ""ABOUT"" is valid: A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 But is ""ABOUT"" a 5-letter word? Yes: A-B-O-U-T.

 Alternatively, A in position 3: Possible words: ""TOTAL"" -> but T,A,L: but L is okay? Excluded? Only R,I,S,E are excluded. Total has T,O,T,A,L -> two T's? That's acceptable.

 ""TOTAL"": 
 - T: new letter, O: new, T: repeated? A: we know is present, L: new.

 However, we want to avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage? But it might be necessary.

 But note that we are also testing additional letters: T, O, L in ""TOTAL"". But ""TOTAL"" has two T's and two A's? Wait: T, O, T, A, L -> actually only one A? And two T's.

 We might get feedback that helps us understand if T appears once or twice.

 Similarly, we can consider ""POUCH""? No A.

 So we need words containing A.

 Let me list words without E,R,I,S and with A:

 Some candidates:
   ABOUT: positions 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T
   MANGO: M, A, N, G, O -> note G is also a common letter? But acceptable? Yes.
   BANAL: B, A, N, A, L -> two A's? That might complicate. Also note L is common.
   PANDA: P, A, N, D, A -> two A's? Not good for information.
   TANGO: T, A, N, G, O -> distinct letters? T, A, N, G, O.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test? Because we only have A so far.

 So ""ABOUT"" uses A, B, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T? Actually A,B,O,U,T are distinct? Yes.

 Similarly, ""MANGO"": M,A,N,G,O -> distinct? Yes.

 But note: we only know A is present. The others are unknown and might be present or absent.

 We can also consider: ""PLAUT"" ? but not a word. 

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I? Yes, feedback said I is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""OCTAD""? Not common, avoid.

 Among the two: 
 ABOUT: uses A (position 1), B, O, U, T -> and avoids E,R,I,S.
 MANGO: A in position 2 -> but wait, in our previous guess we had A in position 2 and it was yellow? Meaning that the letter A is not in position 2? Then if we put A again in position 2, we would get a '-', meaning wrong position? But actually, we want to test A in a new position? The secret word does not have A in position 2. So we should avoid putting A in position 2 because we know it's incorrect.

 In MANGO: 
 If we put MANGO: M(position1), A(position2), N(position3), G(position4), O(position5)

 But we know that A is not in position 2? Because the secret word's A is not there. So having A in position 2 again would waste our chance? Yet the feedback would show A as '-'. Since the secret word has A, but not in position 2, then if we put A in position 2, we would get a '-' again? But that wouldn't tell us anything new because we already know that. We want to try A in a different position.

 Therefore, avoid putting A in position 2.

 That rules out words that have A in the second position? 

 So words like MANGO (A in position 2) is bad.

 Then what about ABOUT? A is in position 1: that's a new position.

 Also, any word that has A in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Possible words:

 Position 1: ABOUT, ACTOR? Actor: A,C,T,O,R -> but R is excluded? R is in the exclusion list. So no R. Therefore ACTOR invalid.

 Position 3: 
   PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids E,R,I,S. And A is in position 3. This is good? 
   CHANT: C,H,A,N,T -> same pattern.

 Position 4:
   Could try a word with A in fourth? Example: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> E is excluded. Invalid.

 Position 5:
   ""TABLA"" -> but T,A,B,L,A? Two A's? and we don't know about B. Not common? and A in position 2 and 5? We want only one A? We know A is present at least once. It could be that the word has two A's? But we don't know.

   Also, try ""KOALA"" -> K,O,A,L,A? Two A's? Again.

   Or ""NANGA"" -> not common.

   Better: find words with A only once and in position 5.

   Example: ""CHAIR"" -> C,H,A,I,R -> has I and R? Excluded.

   ""ATOLL"" -> A in position 1? No: A,T,O,L,L? 

   We need a word ending with A: ""PIZZA"" -> P,I,Z,Z,A -> has I? Excluded.

   Not easy? So maybe position 3 is easier.

 Considering that, let's pick ""PLANT"". It has:
 P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)

 We avoid E,R,I,S and we avoid putting A in position 2. 

 Advantages: 
 - Tests new letters: P, L, N, T (and A in a new position).
 - All distinct letters? Yes: P,L,A,N,T.

 But is ""PLANT"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, we are missing testing of vowels: We know that O and U are still possibilities? We haven't tested them. But we can test them later.

 Alternatively, ABOUT: positions 1: A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> tests vowels O and U? Yes, O and U. And distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T.

 So ABOUT tests two vowels (O and U) and consonants B and T? While PLANT tests consonants only.

 Since vowels are important, and we have only tested A? We haven't tested O and U? So ABOUT may be better for testing the vowel space.

 Let's not forget: the word must have A. By putting A in position 1 in ABOUT, we will get feedback on whether A is in the first position? If we get green, then we know. If we get yellow, then we know it's in positions 3,4,5? Actually, we already know it's not in position 2? And if we get yellow for A in position 1? Then A is in the word but not in position 1? Which we already knew it could be? But wait: if we put A in position 1 and it is green, then we know position 1 is A. If we get yellow, then we know A is not in position 1? That would be new information because we only knew before that it wasn't in 2? And if we get gray? But we already know A is in the word? It cannot be gray? Wait: the feedback rules: '-' means it's in the word but wrong position? And 'x' means not in the word? But we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it is still a '-'? That would tell us: yes A is present? But it's not in position 1? Which is new? And if it's green? That tells us it is in position 1.

 Therefore, by putting A in position 1, we might end up with: 
   Green: then we know the first letter is A? And then we restrict possibilities? 
   Yellow: then we know A is not in position 1? Then it must be in 3,4 or 5? (since in RAISE we had it in 2 and now 1 is wrong) -> so positions 3,4,5 and we avoid position 1.

 If we put A in position 3 (like PLANT) and get green? Then we know A is fixed at position 3? 

 Either way, we get new positional information about A? 

 However, ABOUT has the advantage that it also tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (B and T). 

 In terms of information: ABOUT covers more vowel ground? 

 But note: in the secret word, we already know there's no E,I? So vowels available are A (which we know), O, U, and sometimes Y? 

 Testing O and U might be valuable? 

 Alternatively, PLANT doesn't test O and U? 

 Therefore, I prefer ABOUT? Because it can help eliminate or confirm two vowels? 

 But also consider the frequency: letters like T, O, U are common? So testing them is good.

 So let's go with ABOUT.

 We must be cautious: the word ABOUT might not be the secret word because it's a common word? But it's possible? But we are just trying for information.

 Therefore, the guess: ABOUT.

 But wait: in position 5? We have T. T is a common consonant? We can test.

 So let me choose ABOUT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, S, E are **absent** (marked x)
- A is **present** but not in position 2 (marked -)

### Key Constraints:
1. The secret word **contains A** but **not R, I, S, E**.
2. A must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
3. The guess should prioritize:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 Ideally, we pick a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 Some popular starting words are: SALET, CRATE, SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers some vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and no repeating letters.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we can use any valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" is known to be a strong starting word. But let me stick to ""CRANE"".

 But wait, the problem says: ""a valid 5-letter English word"". So we must pick a word that exists.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"". It uses common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Let me consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words in English:

 According to various sources, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 The word ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: five of the top letters? Actually, R (3rd), A (2nd), I (4th), S (6th), E (1st) -> that's good.

 Another word: ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but may be obscure.

 Since we want a common word, let's choose ""SALET"" if we are going for best opening? Or ""SLATE"" is more common.

 Actually, after checking, ""SLATE"" is a very common starting word.

 Alternatively, I see ""CRATE"", ""SLANT"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 After some thought, I'll pick ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T), and all are common.

 But note that the example in the problem used ""STORM"" which has two of the same letters? Actually, no repeating letters. Wait, ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> all distinct.

 Since we are starting, let's go with ""CRANE"":

 C R A N E

 But note: A and E are vowels, and C, R, N are consonants. 

 However, let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has higher frequency? Actually, ""RAISE"" has:

 R - common
 A - common
 I - common
 S - common
 E - common

 So I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 But wait, I can also consider avoiding letters that might be in the same word? Actually, first guess no info.

 So, let me pick ""RAISE"".

 Valid guess? Yes. So I'll go with RAISE.

 Alternatively, the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so they are valid.

 Therefore, my first guess: RAISE.<thinking>
As this is the first guess, I have zero prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with distinct common letters to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

I analyzed English letter frequency in 5-letter words:
- High-frequency consonants: R, S, T, L, N
- High-frequency vowels: A, E, I, O

The ideal word should:
- Contain 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities
- Include multiple vowels and common consonants
- Avoid obscure words to ensure validity

Considering these factors, **""RAISE""** is a strong choice because:
1. It uses five distinct, high-frequency letters: R, A, I, S, E
2. It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word (meaning ""to lift or set up"")

Alternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" also meet criteria, but ""RAISE"" slightly optimizes vowel coverage. The feedback from this guess will efficiently reveal positional and inclusion information, especially about vowels which are critical for word formation.

Thus, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": 
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word, but not in the second position.
 I(x) -> I is not in the secret word.
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So what do we know?
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was marked '-'). So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. In ""RAISE"", A was in position 2. So it's in the word and yellow, meaning it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we know that R, I, S, E are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word contains A, but not R, I, S, or E.

 We must make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word
 - Contains A (since we know it's present)
 - Does not contain R, I, S, E (since they are absent)
 - And we should try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is present and must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5, we should avoid putting A in position 2 again.

 Also, note that the word might have repeating letters? The rules didn't say it can't, but typically they don't. And in the feedback, if a letter repeats, it gets marked appropriately only if it appears multiple times. But we don't have any indication of repetition yet.

 Without knowing the positions, we can use A in a different position in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that fits:
 - Excluded letters: R, I, S, E
 - Included letters: A (must be in the word)

 We can use common English consonants and vowels that are not excluded: 
 Vowels: O, U and sometimes Y? But Y can be used as a vowel or consonant. The excluded vowels are I and E (we only have A as vowel so far). We have O and U.

 Consonants: We excluded R and S. So we have T, N, L, C, D, M, P, ... etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A and avoid R,I,S,E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Words starting with A: But we need a word without E,R,I,S.
 - Words ending with A: Similarly.

 Common letters we can use: T, L, N, O, U, etc.

 Example words: 
 ""ABOUT"" : contains A (in position ?) and avoids R,I,S,E? 
   Let's check: A, B, O, U, T -> excludes R,I,S,E? Yes. But note: the feedback for A in the previous word was '-', meaning it's present and should be in our word. However, in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1? That might be a possibility.

 But wait, we don't know the position yet. So we could try to have A in a new position.

 However, we must remember: we also want to test multiple new letters to gain more information.

 Another idea: The word could have A in position 3? Or 4? 

 Since we don't know, let's pick a word that places A in a different position than position 2.

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADOBE"" -> but E is excluded? E is excluded because in the previous feedback E(x). So we cannot use E.

 So ""ADOBE"" has E -> invalid.

 Example with A in position 1: A, then avoid E,R,I,S? 
 Words: ""ABOUT"" (A in position 1), ""ABOUT"" is valid: A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 But is ""ABOUT"" a 5-letter word? Yes: A-B-O-U-T.

 Alternatively, A in position 3: Possible words: ""TOTAL"" -> but T,A,L: but L is okay? Excluded? Only R,I,S,E are excluded. Total has T,O,T,A,L -> two T's? That's acceptable.

 ""TOTAL"": 
 - T: new letter, O: new, T: repeated? A: we know is present, L: new.

 However, we want to avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage? But it might be necessary.

 But note that we are also testing additional letters: T, O, L in ""TOTAL"". But ""TOTAL"" has two T's and two A's? Wait: T, O, T, A, L -> actually only one A? And two T's.

 We might get feedback that helps us understand if T appears once or twice.

 Similarly, we can consider ""POUCH""? No A.

 So we need words containing A.

 Let me list words without E,R,I,S and with A:

 Some candidates:
   ABOUT: positions 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T
   MANGO: M, A, N, G, O -> note G is also a common letter? But acceptable? Yes.
   BANAL: B, A, N, A, L -> two A's? That might complicate. Also note L is common.
   PANDA: P, A, N, D, A -> two A's? Not good for information.
   TANGO: T, A, N, G, O -> distinct letters? T, A, N, G, O.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test? Because we only have A so far.

 So ""ABOUT"" uses A, B, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T? Actually A,B,O,U,T are distinct? Yes.

 Similarly, ""MANGO"": M,A,N,G,O -> distinct? Yes.

 But note: we only know A is present. The others are unknown and might be present or absent.

 We can also consider: ""PLAUT"" ? but not a word. 

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I? Yes, feedback said I is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""OCTAD""? Not common, avoid.

 Among the two: 
 ABOUT: uses A (position 1), B, O, U, T -> and avoids E,R,I,S.
 MANGO: A in position 2 -> but wait, in our previous guess we had A in position 2 and it was yellow? Meaning that the letter A is not in position 2? Then if we put A again in position 2, we would get a '-', meaning wrong position? But actually, we want to test A in a new position? The secret word does not have A in position 2. So we should avoid putting A in position 2 because we know it's incorrect.

 In MANGO: 
 If we put MANGO: M(position1), A(position2), N(position3), G(position4), O(position5)

 But we know that A is not in position 2? Because the secret word's A is not there. So having A in position 2 again would waste our chance? Yet the feedback would show A as '-'. Since the secret word has A, but not in position 2, then if we put A in position 2, we would get a '-' again? But that wouldn't tell us anything new because we already know that. We want to try A in a different position.

 Therefore, avoid putting A in position 2.

 That rules out words that have A in the second position? 

 So words like MANGO (A in position 2) is bad.

 Then what about ABOUT? A is in position 1: that's a new position.

 Also, any word that has A in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Possible words:

 Position 1: ABOUT, ACTOR? Actor: A,C,T,O,R -> but R is excluded? R is in the exclusion list. So no R. Therefore ACTOR invalid.

 Position 3: 
   PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids E,R,I,S. And A is in position 3. This is good? 
   CHANT: C,H,A,N,T -> same pattern.

 Position 4:
   Could try a word with A in fourth? Example: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> E is excluded. Invalid.

 Position 5:
   ""TABLA"" -> but T,A,B,L,A? Two A's? and we don't know about B. Not common? and A in position 2 and 5? We want only one A? We know A is present at least once. It could be that the word has two A's? But we don't know.

   Also, try ""KOALA"" -> K,O,A,L,A? Two A's? Again.

   Or ""NANGA"" -> not common.

   Better: find words with A only once and in position 5.

   Example: ""CHAIR"" -> C,H,A,I,R -> has I and R? Excluded.

   ""ATOLL"" -> A in position 1? No: A,T,O,L,L? 

   We need a word ending with A: ""PIZZA"" -> P,I,Z,Z,A -> has I? Excluded.

   Not easy? So maybe position 3 is easier.

 Considering that, let's pick ""PLANT"". It has:
 P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)

 We avoid E,R,I,S and we avoid putting A in position 2. 

 Advantages: 
 - Tests new letters: P, L, N, T (and A in a new position).
 - All distinct letters? Yes: P,L,A,N,T.

 But is ""PLANT"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, we are missing testing of vowels: We know that O and U are still possibilities? We haven't tested them. But we can test them later.

 Alternatively, ABOUT: positions 1: A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> tests vowels O and U? Yes, O and U. And distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T.

 So ABOUT tests two vowels (O and U) and consonants B and T? While PLANT tests consonants only.

 Since vowels are important, and we have only tested A? We haven't tested O and U? So ABOUT may be better for testing the vowel space.

 Let's not forget: the word must have A. By putting A in position 1 in ABOUT, we will get feedback on whether A is in the first position? If we get green, then we know. If we get yellow, then we know it's in positions 3,4,5? Actually, we already know it's not in position 2? And if we get yellow for A in position 1? Then A is in the word but not in position 1? Which we already knew it could be? But wait: if we put A in position 1 and it is green, then we know position 1 is A. If we get yellow, then we know A is not in position 1? That would be new information because we only knew before that it wasn't in 2? And if we get gray? But we already know A is in the word? It cannot be gray? Wait: the feedback rules: '-' means it's in the word but wrong position? And 'x' means not in the word? But we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it is still a '-'? That would tell us: yes A is present? But it's not in position 1? Which is new? And if it's green? That tells us it is in position 1.

 Therefore, by putting A in position 1, we might end up with: 
   Green: then we know the first letter is A? And then we restrict possibilities? 
   Yellow: then we know A is not in position 1? Then it must be in 3,4 or 5? (since in RAISE we had it in 2 and now 1 is wrong) -> so positions 3,4,5 and we avoid position 1.

 If we put A in position 3 (like PLANT) and get green? Then we know A is fixed at position 3? 

 Either way, we get new positional information about A? 

 However, ABOUT has the advantage that it also tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (B and T). 

 In terms of information: ABOUT covers more vowel ground? 

 But note: in the secret word, we already know there's no E,I? So vowels available are A (which we know), O, U, and sometimes Y? 

 Testing O and U might be valuable? 

 Alternatively, PLANT doesn't test O and U? 

 Therefore, I prefer ABOUT? Because it can help eliminate or confirm two vowels? 

 But also consider the frequency: letters like T, O, U are common? So testing them is good.

 So let's go with ABOUT.

 We must be cautious: the word ABOUT might not be the secret word because it's a common word? But it's possible? But we are just trying for information.

 Therefore, the guess: ABOUT.

 But wait: in position 5? We have T. T is a common consonant? We can test.

 So let me choose ABOUT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, S, E are **absent** (marked x)
- A is **present** but not in position 2 (marked -)

### Key Constraints:
1. The secret word **contains A** but **not R, I, S, E**.
2. A must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
3. The guess should prioritize:
   - Testing A in a new position (avoiding position 2)
   - Covering new high-frequency consonants/vowels
   - Avoiding excluded letters (R,I,S,E)

### Optimal Second Guess: **ABOUT**
- **Why this word?**
  - Places A in **position 1** (untested position) to check if A is correctly positioned there.
  - Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T** (all distinct).
  - Uses vowels **O** and **U** (high value after excluding E/I).
  - Contains no repeated letters or excluded letters (R,I,S,E).

### Expected Information Gain:
- If A is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter.
- If A is yellow (-), we know A must be in positions 3/4/5.
- Feedback on B/O/U/T will reveal new letters or eliminate possibilities.

<thinking>
Given the constraints and information gap, ABOUT optimally probes positional data for A while efficiently testing new high-value vowels/consonants.

We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.\n Since it\'s the first guess, we have no prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.\n Ideally, we pick a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many letters as possible.\n\n Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.\n Some popular starting words are: SALET, CRATE, SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers some vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and no repeating letters.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we can use any valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALET"" is known to be a strong starting word. But let me stick to ""CRANE"".\n\n But wait, the problem says: ""a valid 5-letter English word"". So we must pick a word that exists.\n\n Another popular word is ""SLATE"". It uses common letters: S, L, A, T, E.\n\n Let me consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words in English:\n\n According to various sources, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.\n\n The word ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: five of the top letters? Actually, R (3rd), A (2nd), I (4th), S (6th), E (1st) -> that\'s good.\n\n Another word: ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but may be obscure.\n\n Since we want a common word, let\'s choose ""SALET"" if we are going for best opening? Or ""SLATE"" is more common.\n\n Actually, after checking, ""SLATE"" is a very common starting word.\n\n Alternatively, I see ""CRATE"", ""SLANT"", ""TRACE"", etc.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll pick ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T), and all are common.\n\n But note that the example in the problem used ""STORM"" which has two of the same letters? Actually, no repeating letters. Wait, ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> all distinct.\n\n Since we are starting, let\'s go with ""CRANE"":\n\n C R A N E\n\n But note: A and E are vowels, and C, R, N are consonants. \n\n However, let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has higher frequency? Actually, ""RAISE"" has:\n\n R - common\n A - common\n I - common\n S - common\n E - common\n\n So I\'ll choose ""RAISE"".\n\n But wait, I can also consider avoiding letters that might be in the same word? Actually, first guess no info.\n\n So, let me pick ""RAISE"".\n\n Valid guess? Yes. So I\'ll go with RAISE.\n\n Alternatively, the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so they are valid.\n\n Therefore, my first guess: RAISE.<thinking>\nAs this is the first guess, I have zero prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with distinct common letters to cover a broad range of possibilities. \n\nI analyzed English letter frequency in 5-letter words:\n- High-frequency consonants: R, S, T, L, N\n- High-frequency vowels: A, E, I, O\n\nThe ideal word should:\n- Contain 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities\n- Include multiple vowels and common consonants\n- Avoid obscure words to ensure validity\n\nConsidering these factors, **""RAISE""** is a strong choice because:\n1. It uses five distinct, high-frequency letters: R, A, I, S, E\n2. It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)\n3. It\'s a valid English word (meaning ""to lift or set up"")\n\nAlternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" also meet criteria, but ""RAISE"" slightly optimizes vowel coverage. The feedback from this guess will efficiently reveal positional and inclusion information, especially about vowels which are critical for word formation.\n\nThus, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": \n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n A(-) -> A is in the word, but not in the second position.\n I(x) -> I is not in the secret word.\n S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n So what do we know?\n - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was marked \'-\'). So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. In ""RAISE"", A was in position 2. So it\'s in the word and yellow, meaning it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Additionally, we know that R, I, S, E are absent.\n\n Therefore, the secret word contains A, but not R, I, S, or E.\n\n We must make a second guess that:\n - Is a 5-letter English word\n - Contains A (since we know it\'s present)\n - Does not contain R, I, S, E (since they are absent)\n - And we should try to include other common letters to test.\n\n Since A is present and must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5, we should avoid putting A in position 2 again.\n\n Also, note that the word might have repeating letters?

But Y can be used as a vowel or consonant. The excluded vowels are I and E (we only have A as vowel so far). We have O and U.\n\n Consonants: We excluded R and S.

Yes. But note: the feedback for A in the previous word was \'-\', meaning it\'s present and should be in our word. However, in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1? That might be a possibility.\n\n But wait, we don\'t know the position yet.

E is excluded because in the previous feedback E(x).

Yes: A-B-O-U-T.\n\n Alternatively, A in position 3: Possible words: ""TOTAL"" -> but T,A,L: but L is okay? Excluded? Only R,I,S,E are excluded. Total has T,O,T,A,L -> two T\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n\n ""TOTAL"": \n - T: new letter, O: new, T: repeated? A: we know is present, L: new.\n\n However, we want to avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage?

No A.\n\n So we need words containing A.\n\n Let me list words without E,R,I,S and with A:\n\n Some candidates:\n   ABOUT: positions 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T\n   MANGO: M, A, N, G, O -> note G is also a common letter?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.
- The letters R, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ABOUT
- A: present, but not in position 1 (-)  [since we put it in position 1 and got '-']
- B: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- U: absent (x)
- T: present, but not in position 5 (-)

So now we know:
- A is present, but not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1 and guess2).
- T is present, but not in position 5.
- B, O, U are absent (so the word does not contain B, O, U).
- Additionally, we still know R, I, S, E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must contain A and T.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Wait, from guess1: A not in 2, from guess2: A not in 1. We don't know about 3,4,5? But in guess2, A was in position 1 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, in guess1, A was in position 2 and we got '-'. So A must be in position 3 or 4? (since there are only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5; and 1 and 2 are ruled out, and 5 is still possible? But wait, we haven't tested A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? Actually, we have not placed A in position 3,4, or 5 yet? So we don't know about those.

But note: in guess2, we placed A in position 1 and got a '-', which only tells us that A is not in position 1. It doesn't tell us about position 5? We haven't placed A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? 

Similarly, T is present but not in position 5? So T must be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But we don't know which.

Also, the absent letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E. So the word cannot have these.

Now, what letters are available? We have to use letters that are not excluded. The alphabet without B, O, U, R, I, S, E: 

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and T are already known to be in the word.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Contains A and T (since they are present, we should include them to get positional information)
- Avoids the excluded letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E.
- We should try to place A in a new position (we haven't tried 3,4,5) and T in a new position (we haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried T in position 5 and got '-', so we know T is not in 5? So we should try T in 1,2,3, or 4? But we haven't tried any of these? So we can try any? But we want to maximize information.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? We have 3 more letters to test? Since we know A and T are in, we can test three new letters? But we have to form a word.

We also know that A cannot be in position 1 or 2? So in our next guess, we should put A in either position 3,4, or 5? Similarly, T cannot be in position 5? So we can put T in 1,2,3,4? 

But note: we want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? For A, we know positions 1 and 2 are wrong? So we must put A in 3,4, or 5? Similarly, for T, we know position 5 is wrong? So we must put T in 1,2,3, or 4? 

But we can put both A and T in the same word? And we have to.

Now, we need to choose positions for A and T that are possible? And then fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4

But note: if we put A and T in the same position? That's not possible? We have to put them in different positions? Because they are distinct letters? Unless the word has two of the same? But we don't know? But so far, we have no indication of duplicates? But it's possible? However, we are going to assume distinct for now? But we don't know? So we have to consider? But to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates? 

But we know A and T are present? So if we put them in different positions? 

Let me try to form words that have A and T, and three other letters from the available set? And avoid the excluded letters.

We also want to test common letters? Like L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that have A and T? And 3 other letters? And avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3 and T in position 1: T _ A _ _ 
  What words? T? A? 
  Examples: ""TALKY"" -> but Y is allowed? But we have to check: T(1), A(2)? But wait, we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2? So we cannot put A in position 2? We must put A in 3,4, or 5? 

  So if T in 1 and A in 3: T _ A _ _
  Words: ""TALKY"" -> T(1), A(2) -> invalid because A in position 2? We cannot do that? We must avoid position 2 for A? 

  So we cannot have A in position 2? So in the pattern T _ A _ _, the A is in position 3? That's okay? Then what words? 
  ""TALKY"": T(1), A(2) -> no, that's position 2? 
  We need A in position 3: so T _ _ A _? Or T _ A _ _? Actually, if we have T in 1 and A in 3: then the pattern is T (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

  Example: ""TACIT"" -> but I is excluded? Invalid.

  ""TACKY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? Not allowed? We must avoid position 2 for A? 

  How about ""TANGO"": but O is excluded? 

  ""TANGY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? 

  It's hard to find a word with T in 1 and A in 3? 

  Let me try: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> this works? Because A is in position 3? And we avoid excluded letters? H, N, K are not excluded? 

  But note: we have to avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E? Yes, THANK has none of these? So THANK is a valid word? 

  But wait: we also have T? We know T is in the word? But we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? But that's okay? We are testing.

  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? 

  Let me try to list words with A in position 3,4, or 5 and T in 1,2,3,4? 

  Another idea: put A in position 5? and T in position 1? 
  Pattern: T _ _ _ A
  Words: ""TABLA"" -> but B is excluded? 
          ""TACHA"" -> not common? 
          ""TALMA"" -> not common? 
          ""TANGA"" -> but we have two A's? and G is okay? But TANGA is a word? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? 

  But we want to avoid duplicates? So let's try to find words with distinct letters? 

  How about A in position 4? 
  Pattern: T _ _ A _
  Example: ""TALKA"" -> again, two A's? 
           ""TAPPA"" -> two P's? 

  Alternatively, put T in position 2? But we haven't tested T in position 2? 

  Let me try a different approach: put A in position 3 and T in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ A T _
  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but we used PLANT in the previous step? But we didn't? We considered it? But now we have more constraints? 
  ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5? Because in ABOUT, T was in position 5 and we got '-', meaning T is present but not in 5? So we cannot put T in position 5? 

  Therefore, in PLANT, if we put T in position 5, we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? 

  We want to put T in a position we haven't tried? We have only tried position 5? So we should try 1,2,3,4? 

  So for the pattern _ _ A T _: 
  We can have: 
    Position 1: any letter (not excluded)
    Position 2: any letter (not excluded)
    Position 3: A
    Position 4: T
    Position 5: any letter (not excluded)

  Example: ""CHANT"": C(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? We cannot put T in 5? Because we know it's not there? 

  We need to put T in a position that is not 5? So in this pattern, we cannot put T in 4? Because the pattern has T in 4? And then position 5 is free? 

  But we are putting T in 4? That's allowed? Because we haven't tried T in 4? 

  However, the pattern _ _ A T _ has T in position 4? That's okay? 

  But then the word must end with a letter? So position 5 is the last? 

  But we are not putting T in 5? We are putting T in 4? So that's okay? 

  So ""CHANT"" has T in 4? And then position 5 is N? But wait: ""CHANT"" is C-H-A-N-T? So T is in position 5? Oh, I see: in ""CHANT"", the T is in position 5? 

  So we need a word that has T in position 4? 

  Example: ""CATTY"" -> C(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A is in position 2? We cannot put A in 2? And also two T's? 

  How about ""MATTE"": M(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), E(5) -> A in 2? and E? excluded? 

  We need a word with A in 3 and T in 4? 
  Pattern: ? ? A T ? 
  And the last letter is not T? 

  Example: ""FACTS"": F(1), A(2), C(3), T(4), S(5) -> but A in 2? and S is excluded? 

  ""PACTs"" -> same? 

  ""DATUM"": D(1), A(2), T(3), U(4), M(5) -> A in 2? and U excluded? 

  It's hard? 

  How about A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ A T -> but T in position 5? We know T is not in 5? So we cannot put T in 5? 

  So we must avoid T in 5? 

  Therefore, we cannot have T at the end? 

  So let's try A in position 3 and T in position 1? 
  Pattern: T _ A _ _ 
  We need a word: T, ?, A, ?, ? 
  With A in 3? and T in 1? 
  And the second letter cannot be A? because we know A is not in 2? 

  Example: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> as I thought earlier? 

  THANK: 
    T: we are testing in position 1? 
    H: new letter? 
    A: in position 3? 
    N: new letter? 
    K: new letter? 

  And it avoids excluded letters? Yes: B,O,U,R,I,S,E are excluded? H, N, K are not excluded? 

  So THANK is a valid word? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? It might be? Or it might be in 2,3,4? 

  Similarly, A in position 3? 

  This guess will tell us about T in position 1 and A in position 3? 

  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? 

  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And we have to include T? So T must be in one of the other positions? 

  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but T in 5? not allowed? 

  ""CLAMP"": C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5) -> but A in 3? and no T? We must include T? 

  We must include both A and T? 

  So for A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And T must be in 1,2,3, or 5? But 5 is not allowed for T? So T must be in 1,2, or 3? 

  Example: ""TAPAS"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""PATIO"" -> P(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""MANTY"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 

  How about T in position 1 and A in position 4? 
  Pattern: T _ _ A _ 
  Example: ""TALKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""TANKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? 
           ""TACHA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? 

  It seems difficult? 

  How about T in position 2 and A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ T _ A _ 
  Example: ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? 
           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? and T in 2? and then T in 3? and A in 4? -> but A in 1 and 4? and T in 2 and 3? 
           But we have to avoid A in 1? We know A is not in 1? So we cannot have A in 1? 

  So the first letter cannot be A? 

  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? 

  ""MUTHA"" -> U excluded? 

  ""KETCH"" -> no A? 

  It's challenging? 

  Therefore, the best option might be THANK? 

  But let me think of another word with A in position 5? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ _ A 
  And T must be in 1,2,3,4? 
  Example: ""MANGA"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""PANDA"" -> P(1), A(2) -> same? 
           ""VISTA"" -> S excluded? 
           ""JUMBA"" -> U excluded? 

  How about ""DATA"" -> but that's 4 letters? 

  ""YENTA"" -> Y(1), E(2) -> E excluded? 

  ""FATWA"" -> F(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 

  So it seems that having A in position 5 is hard? 

  Therefore, the most feasible is to put A in position 3? 

  So THANK is a candidate? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? But that's okay? 

  Another candidate: ""CHAMP"" -> but A in 3? and T not included? We must include T? 

  We must include T? 

  How about ""THYME""? -> T(1), H(2), Y(3), M(4), E(5) -> E excluded? 

  ""THUMB"" -> U excluded? 

  ""THANA"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> two A's? But we don't know? And A in 3 and 5? But we know A is present? It could be twice? But we want to avoid duplicates? 

  But THANA is a word? 

  However, we are testing A in position 3? And we have T in 1? 

  But THANA has two A's? So if the secret word has only one A, then we might get feedback that the second A is absent? But we know A is present? So the feedback for the first A (position 3) would be either green or yellow? And the second A (position 5) would be yellow if the word has two A's? Or if the word has only one A, then the second A would be gray? 

  But we don't know? So it might be confusing? 

  Therefore, to avoid confusion, we should try a word with distinct letters? 

  So THANK is better? 

  Another word: ""THALI"" -> but I excluded? 

  ""THECA"" -> T(1), H(2), E(3), C(4), A(5) -> E excluded? 

  ""THACK"" -> not common? 

  So THANK seems good? 

  But let me check: THANK: T, H, A, N, K -> all distinct? Yes? 

  And positions: 
    T in 1: we haven't tested T in 1? 
    H in 2: new? 
    A in 3: we haven't tested A in 3? 
    N in 4: new? 
    K in 5: new? 

  And we avoid excluded letters? Yes. 

  So I think THANK is a good guess? 

  But note: we are not testing T in a position that might be more likely? But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we could put T in position 2? 

  Pattern: _ T _ _ _ 
  And A in 3: _ T A _ _ 
  Example: ""STACK"" -> S excluded? 
           ""PTARM"" -> not common? 
           ""ATAPS"" -> A in 1? not allowed? 

  How about ""MTAOU"" -> not a word? 

  It's hard? 

  So I'll go with THANK? 

  But wait: what about putting A in position 4? 

  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And T in 2: _ T _ A _ 
  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? 
           ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? 
           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? not allowed? 

  How about ""LTAKM"" -> not a word? 

  So THANK seems the best? 

  Another idea: ""TANKA"" -> but A in 2? not allowed? 

  Therefore, I choose THANK.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence? So we go with distinct.

So guess: THANK.

But let me double-check the feedback we might get? 

If the secret word has A in position 3? Then we get A as green? 
If T is in position 1? Then T green? 
But we don't know? 

But we are trying to get information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 5? and T in position 1? 
But we couldn't find one? 

How about ""TAWAF"" -> not common? 

I think THANK is acceptable.

So I'll go with THANK.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Feedback Summary:
- **RAISE**: A is present (not in position 2); R, I, S, E absent.
- **ABOUT**: A is present (not in position 1); T is present (not in position 5); B, O, U absent.

### Key Constraints:
1. **A** must be in the word but **not in positions 1 or 2** (so positions 3, 4, or 5).
2. **T** must be in the word but **not in position 5** (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
3. **Excluded letters**: B, O, U, R, I, S, E (cannot appear).
4. Available letters: A, T, and others like C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test new positions for A and T**: Place A in position 3 (untested) and T in position 1 (untested) to maximize positional information.
- **Cover new high-frequency letters**: Include H, N, K (common consonants) to test their presence.
- **Avoid duplicates and excluded letters**: Ensure all letters are distinct and valid.

### Chosen Guess: **THANK**
- **T** in position 1: Tests if T is correctly placed at start.
- **H** in position 2: New consonant test.
- **A** in position 3: Tests if A is correctly placed here (since positions 1/2 are invalid).
- **N** in position 4: New consonant test.
- **K** in position 5: New consonant test.

This guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently probes for A/T placement while testing 3 new letters. If A is green (✓) in position 3, we lock its location. If T is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter. Feedback on H/N/K will further narrow possibilities.

<thinking>
THANK is optimal as it:
- Avoids all excluded letters (B,O,U,R,I,S,E)
- Tests A in a new valid position (3) and T in a new valid position (1)
- Uses high-frequency new letters (H, N, K)
- Maximizes information gain for the next move
</thinking>

<guess>THANK</guess>",THANK,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.
- The letters R, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ABOUT
- A: present, but not in position 1 (-)  [since we put it in position 1 and got '-']
- B: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- U: absent (x)
- T: present, but not in position 5 (-)

So now we know:
- A is present, but not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1 and guess2).
- T is present, but not in position 5.
- B, O, U are absent (so the word does not contain B, O, U).
- Additionally, we still know R, I, S, E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must contain A and T.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Wait, from guess1: A not in 2, from guess2: A not in 1. We don't know about 3,4,5? But in guess2, A was in position 1 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, in guess1, A was in position 2 and we got '-'. So A must be in position 3 or 4? (since there are only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5; and 1 and 2 are ruled out, and 5 is still possible? But wait, we haven't tested A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? Actually, we have not placed A in position 3,4, or 5 yet? So we don't know about those.

But note: in guess2, we placed A in position 1 and got a '-', which only tells us that A is not in position 1. It doesn't tell us about position 5? We haven't placed A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? 

Similarly, T is present but not in position 5? So T must be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But we don't know which.

Also, the absent letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E. So the word cannot have these.

Now, what letters are available? We have to use letters that are not excluded. The alphabet without B, O, U, R, I, S, E: 

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and T are already known to be in the word.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Contains A and T (since they are present, we should include them to get positional information)
- Avoids the excluded letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E.
- We should try to place A in a new position (we haven't tried 3,4,5) and T in a new position (we haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried T in position 5 and got '-', so we know T is not in 5? So we should try T in 1,2,3, or 4? But we haven't tried any of these? So we can try any? But we want to maximize information.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? We have 3 more letters to test? Since we know A and T are in, we can test three new letters? But we have to form a word.

We also know that A cannot be in position 1 or 2? So in our next guess, we should put A in either position 3,4, or 5? Similarly, T cannot be in position 5? So we can put T in 1,2,3,4? 

But note: we want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? For A, we know positions 1 and 2 are wrong? So we must put A in 3,4, or 5? Similarly, for T, we know position 5 is wrong? So we must put T in 1,2,3, or 4? 

But we can put both A and T in the same word? And we have to.

Now, we need to choose positions for A and T that are possible? And then fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4

But note: if we put A and T in the same position? That's not possible? We have to put them in different positions? Because they are distinct letters? Unless the word has two of the same? But we don't know? But so far, we have no indication of duplicates? But it's possible? However, we are going to assume distinct for now? But we don't know? So we have to consider? But to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates? 

But we know A and T are present? So if we put them in different positions? 

Let me try to form words that have A and T, and three other letters from the available set? And avoid the excluded letters.

We also want to test common letters? Like L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that have A and T? And 3 other letters? And avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3 and T in position 1: T _ A _ _ 
  What words? T? A? 
  Examples: ""TALKY"" -> but Y is allowed? But we have to check: T(1), A(2)? But wait, we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2? So we cannot put A in position 2? We must put A in 3,4, or 5? 

  So if T in 1 and A in 3: T _ A _ _
  Words: ""TALKY"" -> T(1), A(2) -> invalid because A in position 2? We cannot do that? We must avoid position 2 for A? 

  So we cannot have A in position 2? So in the pattern T _ A _ _, the A is in position 3? That's okay? Then what words? 
  ""TALKY"": T(1), A(2) -> no, that's position 2? 
  We need A in position 3: so T _ _ A _? Or T _ A _ _? Actually, if we have T in 1 and A in 3: then the pattern is T (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

  Example: ""TACIT"" -> but I is excluded? Invalid.

  ""TACKY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? Not allowed? We must avoid position 2 for A? 

  How about ""TANGO"": but O is excluded? 

  ""TANGY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? 

  It's hard to find a word with T in 1 and A in 3? 

  Let me try: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> this works? Because A is in position 3? And we avoid excluded letters? H, N, K are not excluded? 

  But note: we have to avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E? Yes, THANK has none of these? So THANK is a valid word? 

  But wait: we also have T? We know T is in the word? But we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? But that's okay? We are testing.

  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? 

  Let me try to list words with A in position 3,4, or 5 and T in 1,2,3,4? 

  Another idea: put A in position 5? and T in position 1? 
  Pattern: T _ _ _ A
  Words: ""TABLA"" -> but B is excluded? 
          ""TACHA"" -> not common? 
          ""TALMA"" -> not common? 
          ""TANGA"" -> but we have two A's? and G is okay? But TANGA is a word? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? 

  But we want to avoid duplicates? So let's try to find words with distinct letters? 

  How about A in position 4? 
  Pattern: T _ _ A _
  Example: ""TALKA"" -> again, two A's? 
           ""TAPPA"" -> two P's? 

  Alternatively, put T in position 2? But we haven't tested T in position 2? 

  Let me try a different approach: put A in position 3 and T in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ A T _
  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but we used PLANT in the previous step? But we didn't? We considered it? But now we have more constraints? 
  ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5? Because in ABOUT, T was in position 5 and we got '-', meaning T is present but not in 5? So we cannot put T in position 5? 

  Therefore, in PLANT, if we put T in position 5, we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? 

  We want to put T in a position we haven't tried? We have only tried position 5? So we should try 1,2,3,4? 

  So for the pattern _ _ A T _: 
  We can have: 
    Position 1: any letter (not excluded)
    Position 2: any letter (not excluded)
    Position 3: A
    Position 4: T
    Position 5: any letter (not excluded)

  Example: ""CHANT"": C(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? We cannot put T in 5? Because we know it's not there? 

  We need to put T in a position that is not 5? So in this pattern, we cannot put T in 4? Because the pattern has T in 4? And then position 5 is free? 

  But we are putting T in 4? That's allowed? Because we haven't tried T in 4? 

  However, the pattern _ _ A T _ has T in position 4? That's okay? 

  But then the word must end with a letter? So position 5 is the last? 

  But we are not putting T in 5? We are putting T in 4? So that's okay? 

  So ""CHANT"" has T in 4? And then position 5 is N? But wait: ""CHANT"" is C-H-A-N-T? So T is in position 5? Oh, I see: in ""CHANT"", the T is in position 5? 

  So we need a word that has T in position 4? 

  Example: ""CATTY"" -> C(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A is in position 2? We cannot put A in 2? And also two T's? 

  How about ""MATTE"": M(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), E(5) -> A in 2? and E? excluded? 

  We need a word with A in 3 and T in 4? 
  Pattern: ? ? A T ? 
  And the last letter is not T? 

  Example: ""FACTS"": F(1), A(2), C(3), T(4), S(5) -> but A in 2? and S is excluded? 

  ""PACTs"" -> same? 

  ""DATUM"": D(1), A(2), T(3), U(4), M(5) -> A in 2? and U excluded? 

  It's hard? 

  How about A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ A T -> but T in position 5? We know T is not in 5? So we cannot put T in 5? 

  So we must avoid T in 5? 

  Therefore, we cannot have T at the end? 

  So let's try A in position 3 and T in position 1? 
  Pattern: T _ A _ _ 
  We need a word: T, ?, A, ?, ? 
  With A in 3? and T in 1? 
  And the second letter cannot be A? because we know A is not in 2? 

  Example: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> as I thought earlier? 

  THANK: 
    T: we are testing in position 1? 
    H: new letter? 
    A: in position 3? 
    N: new letter? 
    K: new letter? 

  And it avoids excluded letters? Yes: B,O,U,R,I,S,E are excluded? H, N, K are not excluded? 

  So THANK is a valid word? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? It might be? Or it might be in 2,3,4? 

  Similarly, A in position 3? 

  This guess will tell us about T in position 1 and A in position 3? 

  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? 

  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And we have to include T? So T must be in one of the other positions? 

  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but T in 5? not allowed? 

  ""CLAMP"": C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5) -> but A in 3? and no T? We must include T? 

  We must include both A and T? 

  So for A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And T must be in 1,2,3, or 5? But 5 is not allowed for T? So T must be in 1,2, or 3? 

  Example: ""TAPAS"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""PATIO"" -> P(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""MANTY"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 

  How about T in position 1 and A in position 4? 
  Pattern: T _ _ A _ 
  Example: ""TALKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""TANKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? 
           ""TACHA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? 

  It seems difficult? 

  How about T in position 2 and A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ T _ A _ 
  Example: ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? 
           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? and T in 2? and then T in 3? and A in 4? -> but A in 1 and 4? and T in 2 and 3? 
           But we have to avoid A in 1? We know A is not in 1? So we cannot have A in 1? 

  So the first letter cannot be A? 

  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? 

  ""MUTHA"" -> U excluded? 

  ""KETCH"" -> no A? 

  It's challenging? 

  Therefore, the best option might be THANK? 

  But let me think of another word with A in position 5? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ _ A 
  And T must be in 1,2,3,4? 
  Example: ""MANGA"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""PANDA"" -> P(1), A(2) -> same? 
           ""VISTA"" -> S excluded? 
           ""JUMBA"" -> U excluded? 

  How about ""DATA"" -> but that's 4 letters? 

  ""YENTA"" -> Y(1), E(2) -> E excluded? 

  ""FATWA"" -> F(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 

  So it seems that having A in position 5 is hard? 

  Therefore, the most feasible is to put A in position 3? 

  So THANK is a candidate? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? But that's okay? 

  Another candidate: ""CHAMP"" -> but A in 3? and T not included? We must include T? 

  We must include T? 

  How about ""THYME""? -> T(1), H(2), Y(3), M(4), E(5) -> E excluded? 

  ""THUMB"" -> U excluded? 

  ""THANA"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> two A's? But we don't know? And A in 3 and 5? But we know A is present? It could be twice? But we want to avoid duplicates? 

  But THANA is a word? 

  However, we are testing A in position 3? And we have T in 1? 

  But THANA has two A's? So if the secret word has only one A, then we might get feedback that the second A is absent? But we know A is present? So the feedback for the first A (position 3) would be either green or yellow? And the second A (position 5) would be yellow if the word has two A's? Or if the word has only one A, then the second A would be gray? 

  But we don't know? So it might be confusing? 

  Therefore, to avoid confusion, we should try a word with distinct letters? 

  So THANK is better? 

  Another word: ""THALI"" -> but I excluded? 

  ""THECA"" -> T(1), H(2), E(3), C(4), A(5) -> E excluded? 

  ""THACK"" -> not common? 

  So THANK seems good? 

  But let me check: THANK: T, H, A, N, K -> all distinct? Yes? 

  And positions: 
    T in 1: we haven't tested T in 1? 
    H in 2: new? 
    A in 3: we haven't tested A in 3? 
    N in 4: new? 
    K in 5: new? 

  And we avoid excluded letters? Yes. 

  So I think THANK is a good guess? 

  But note: we are not testing T in a position that might be more likely? But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we could put T in position 2? 

  Pattern: _ T _ _ _ 
  And A in 3: _ T A _ _ 
  Example: ""STACK"" -> S excluded? 
           ""PTARM"" -> not common? 
           ""ATAPS"" -> A in 1? not allowed? 

  How about ""MTAOU"" -> not a word? 

  It's hard? 

  So I'll go with THANK? 

  But wait: what about putting A in position 4? 

  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And T in 2: _ T _ A _ 
  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? 
           ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? 
           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? not allowed? 

  How about ""LTAKM"" -> not a word? 

  So THANK seems the best? 

  Another idea: ""TANKA"" -> but A in 2? not allowed? 

  Therefore, I choose THANK.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence? So we go with distinct.

So guess: THANK.

But let me double-check the feedback we might get? 

If the secret word has A in position 3? Then we get A as green? 
If T is in position 1? Then T green? 
But we don't know? 

But we are trying to get information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 5? and T in position 1? 
But we couldn't find one? 

How about ""TAWAF"" -> not common? 

I think THANK is acceptable.

So I'll go with THANK.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Feedback Summary:
- **RAISE**: A is present (not in position 2); R, I, S, E absent.
- **ABOUT**: A is present (not in position 1); T is present (not in position 5); B, O, U absent.

### Key Constraints:
1. **A** must be in the word but **not in positions 1 or 2** (so positions 3, 4, or 5).
2. **T** must be in the word but **not in position 5** (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
3. **Excluded letters**: B, O, U, R, I, S, E (cannot appear).
4. Available letters: A, T, and others like C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test new positions for A and T**: Place A in position 3 (untested) and T in position 1 (untested) to maximize positional information.
- **Cover new high-frequency letters**: Include H, N, K (common consonants) to test their presence.
- **Avoid duplicates and excluded letters**: Ensure all letters are distinct and valid.

### Chosen Guess: **THANK**
- **T** in position 1: Tests if T is correctly placed at start.
- **H** in position 2: New consonant test.
- **A** in position 3: Tests if A is correctly placed here (since positions 1/2 are invalid).
- **N** in position 4: New consonant test.
- **K** in position 5: New consonant test.

This guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently probes for A/T placement while testing 3 new letters. If A is green (✓) in position 3, we lock its location. If T is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter. Feedback on H/N/K will further narrow possibilities.

<thinking>
THANK is optimal as it:
- Avoids all excluded letters (B,O,U,R,I,S,E)
- Tests A in a new valid position (3) and T in a new valid position (1)
- Uses high-frequency new letters (H, N, K)
- Maximizes information gain for the next move

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 Ideally, we pick a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 Some popular starting words are: SALET, CRATE, SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers some vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and no repeating letters.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we can use any valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" is known to be a strong starting word. But let me stick to ""CRANE"".

 But wait, the problem says: ""a valid 5-letter English word"". So we must pick a word that exists.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"". It uses common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Let me consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words in English:

 According to various sources, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 The word ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: five of the top letters? Actually, R (3rd), A (2nd), I (4th), S (6th), E (1st) -> that's good.

 Another word: ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but may be obscure.

 Since we want a common word, let's choose ""SALET"" if we are going for best opening? Or ""SLATE"" is more common.

 Actually, after checking, ""SLATE"" is a very common starting word.

 Alternatively, I see ""CRATE"", ""SLANT"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 After some thought, I'll pick ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T), and all are common.

 But note that the example in the problem used ""STORM"" which has two of the same letters? Actually, no repeating letters. Wait, ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> all distinct.

 Since we are starting, let's go with ""CRANE"":

 C R A N E

 But note: A and E are vowels, and C, R, N are consonants. 

 However, let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has higher frequency? Actually, ""RAISE"" has:

 R - common
 A - common
 I - common
 S - common
 E - common

 So I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 But wait, I can also consider avoiding letters that might be in the same word? Actually, first guess no info.

 So, let me pick ""RAISE"".

 Valid guess? Yes. So I'll go with RAISE.

 Alternatively, the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so they are valid.

 Therefore, my first guess: RAISE.<thinking>
As this is the first guess, I have zero prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with distinct common letters to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

I analyzed English letter frequency in 5-letter words:
- High-frequency consonants: R, S, T, L, N
- High-frequency vowels: A, E, I, O

The ideal word should:
- Contain 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities
- Include multiple vowels and common consonants
- Avoid obscure words to ensure validity

Considering these factors, **""RAISE""** is a strong choice because:
1. It uses five distinct, high-frequency letters: R, A, I, S, E
2. It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word (meaning ""to lift or set up"")

Alternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" also meet criteria, but ""RAISE"" slightly optimizes vowel coverage. The feedback from this guess will efficiently reveal positional and inclusion information, especially about vowels which are critical for word formation.

Thus, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": 
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word, but not in the second position.
 I(x) -> I is not in the secret word.
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So what do we know?
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was marked '-'). So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. In ""RAISE"", A was in position 2. So it's in the word and yellow, meaning it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we know that R, I, S, E are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word contains A, but not R, I, S, or E.

 We must make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word
 - Contains A (since we know it's present)
 - Does not contain R, I, S, E (since they are absent)
 - And we should try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is present and must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5, we should avoid putting A in position 2 again.

 Also, note that the word might have repeating letters? The rules didn't say it can't, but typically they don't. And in the feedback, if a letter repeats, it gets marked appropriately only if it appears multiple times. But we don't have any indication of repetition yet.

 Without knowing the positions, we can use A in a different position in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that fits:
 - Excluded letters: R, I, S, E
 - Included letters: A (must be in the word)

 We can use common English consonants and vowels that are not excluded: 
 Vowels: O, U and sometimes Y? But Y can be used as a vowel or consonant. The excluded vowels are I and E (we only have A as vowel so far). We have O and U.

 Consonants: We excluded R and S. So we have T, N, L, C, D, M, P, ... etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A and avoid R,I,S,E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Words starting with A: But we need a word without E,R,I,S.
 - Words ending with A: Similarly.

 Common letters we can use: T, L, N, O, U, etc.

 Example words: 
 ""ABOUT"" : contains A (in position ?) and avoids R,I,S,E? 
   Let's check: A, B, O, U, T -> excludes R,I,S,E? Yes. But note: the feedback for A in the previous word was '-', meaning it's present and should be in our word. However, in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1? That might be a possibility.

 But wait, we don't know the position yet. So we could try to have A in a new position.

 However, we must remember: we also want to test multiple new letters to gain more information.

 Another idea: The word could have A in position 3? Or 4? 

 Since we don't know, let's pick a word that places A in a different position than position 2.

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADOBE"" -> but E is excluded? E is excluded because in the previous feedback E(x). So we cannot use E.

 So ""ADOBE"" has E -> invalid.

 Example with A in position 1: A, then avoid E,R,I,S? 
 Words: ""ABOUT"" (A in position 1), ""ABOUT"" is valid: A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 But is ""ABOUT"" a 5-letter word? Yes: A-B-O-U-T.

 Alternatively, A in position 3: Possible words: ""TOTAL"" -> but T,A,L: but L is okay? Excluded? Only R,I,S,E are excluded. Total has T,O,T,A,L -> two T's? That's acceptable.

 ""TOTAL"": 
 - T: new letter, O: new, T: repeated? A: we know is present, L: new.

 However, we want to avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage? But it might be necessary.

 But note that we are also testing additional letters: T, O, L in ""TOTAL"". But ""TOTAL"" has two T's and two A's? Wait: T, O, T, A, L -> actually only one A? And two T's.

 We might get feedback that helps us understand if T appears once or twice.

 Similarly, we can consider ""POUCH""? No A.

 So we need words containing A.

 Let me list words without E,R,I,S and with A:

 Some candidates:
   ABOUT: positions 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T
   MANGO: M, A, N, G, O -> note G is also a common letter? But acceptable? Yes.
   BANAL: B, A, N, A, L -> two A's? That might complicate. Also note L is common.
   PANDA: P, A, N, D, A -> two A's? Not good for information.
   TANGO: T, A, N, G, O -> distinct letters? T, A, N, G, O.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test? Because we only have A so far.

 So ""ABOUT"" uses A, B, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T? Actually A,B,O,U,T are distinct? Yes.

 Similarly, ""MANGO"": M,A,N,G,O -> distinct? Yes.

 But note: we only know A is present. The others are unknown and might be present or absent.

 We can also consider: ""PLAUT"" ? but not a word. 

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I? Yes, feedback said I is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""OCTAD""? Not common, avoid.

 Among the two: 
 ABOUT: uses A (position 1), B, O, U, T -> and avoids E,R,I,S.
 MANGO: A in position 2 -> but wait, in our previous guess we had A in position 2 and it was yellow? Meaning that the letter A is not in position 2? Then if we put A again in position 2, we would get a '-', meaning wrong position? But actually, we want to test A in a new position? The secret word does not have A in position 2. So we should avoid putting A in position 2 because we know it's incorrect.

 In MANGO: 
 If we put MANGO: M(position1), A(position2), N(position3), G(position4), O(position5)

 But we know that A is not in position 2? Because the secret word's A is not there. So having A in position 2 again would waste our chance? Yet the feedback would show A as '-'. Since the secret word has A, but not in position 2, then if we put A in position 2, we would get a '-' again? But that wouldn't tell us anything new because we already know that. We want to try A in a different position.

 Therefore, avoid putting A in position 2.

 That rules out words that have A in the second position? 

 So words like MANGO (A in position 2) is bad.

 Then what about ABOUT? A is in position 1: that's a new position.

 Also, any word that has A in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Possible words:

 Position 1: ABOUT, ACTOR? Actor: A,C,T,O,R -> but R is excluded? R is in the exclusion list. So no R. Therefore ACTOR invalid.

 Position 3: 
   PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids E,R,I,S. And A is in position 3. This is good? 
   CHANT: C,H,A,N,T -> same pattern.

 Position 4:
   Could try a word with A in fourth? Example: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> E is excluded. Invalid.

 Position 5:
   ""TABLA"" -> but T,A,B,L,A? Two A's? and we don't know about B. Not common? and A in position 2 and 5? We want only one A? We know A is present at least once. It could be that the word has two A's? But we don't know.

   Also, try ""KOALA"" -> K,O,A,L,A? Two A's? Again.

   Or ""NANGA"" -> not common.

   Better: find words with A only once and in position 5.

   Example: ""CHAIR"" -> C,H,A,I,R -> has I and R? Excluded.

   ""ATOLL"" -> A in position 1? No: A,T,O,L,L? 

   We need a word ending with A: ""PIZZA"" -> P,I,Z,Z,A -> has I? Excluded.

   Not easy? So maybe position 3 is easier.

 Considering that, let's pick ""PLANT"". It has:
 P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)

 We avoid E,R,I,S and we avoid putting A in position 2. 

 Advantages: 
 - Tests new letters: P, L, N, T (and A in a new position).
 - All distinct letters? Yes: P,L,A,N,T.

 But is ""PLANT"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, we are missing testing of vowels: We know that O and U are still possibilities? We haven't tested them. But we can test them later.

 Alternatively, ABOUT: positions 1: A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> tests vowels O and U? Yes, O and U. And distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T.

 So ABOUT tests two vowels (O and U) and consonants B and T? While PLANT tests consonants only.

 Since vowels are important, and we have only tested A? We haven't tested O and U? So ABOUT may be better for testing the vowel space.

 Let's not forget: the word must have A. By putting A in position 1 in ABOUT, we will get feedback on whether A is in the first position? If we get green, then we know. If we get yellow, then we know it's in positions 3,4,5? Actually, we already know it's not in position 2? And if we get yellow for A in position 1? Then A is in the word but not in position 1? Which we already knew it could be? But wait: if we put A in position 1 and it is green, then we know position 1 is A. If we get yellow, then we know A is not in position 1? That would be new information because we only knew before that it wasn't in 2? And if we get gray? But we already know A is in the word? It cannot be gray? Wait: the feedback rules: '-' means it's in the word but wrong position? And 'x' means not in the word? But we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it is still a '-'? That would tell us: yes A is present? But it's not in position 1? Which is new? And if it's green? That tells us it is in position 1.

 Therefore, by putting A in position 1, we might end up with: 
   Green: then we know the first letter is A? And then we restrict possibilities? 
   Yellow: then we know A is not in position 1? Then it must be in 3,4 or 5? (since in RAISE we had it in 2 and now 1 is wrong) -> so positions 3,4,5 and we avoid position 1.

 If we put A in position 3 (like PLANT) and get green? Then we know A is fixed at position 3? 

 Either way, we get new positional information about A? 

 However, ABOUT has the advantage that it also tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (B and T). 

 In terms of information: ABOUT covers more vowel ground? 

 But note: in the secret word, we already know there's no E,I? So vowels available are A (which we know), O, U, and sometimes Y? 

 Testing O and U might be valuable? 

 Alternatively, PLANT doesn't test O and U? 

 Therefore, I prefer ABOUT? Because it can help eliminate or confirm two vowels? 

 But also consider the frequency: letters like T, O, U are common? So testing them is good.

 So let's go with ABOUT.

 We must be cautious: the word ABOUT might not be the secret word because it's a common word? But it's possible? But we are just trying for information.

 Therefore, the guess: ABOUT.

 But wait: in position 5? We have T. T is a common consonant? We can test.

 So let me choose ABOUT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, S, E are **absent** (marked x)
- A is **present** but not in position 2 (marked -)

### Key Constraints:
1. The secret word **contains A** but **not R, I, S, E**.
2. A must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
3. The guess should prioritize:
   - Testing A in a new position (avoiding position 2)
   - Covering new high-frequency consonants/vowels
   - Avoiding excluded letters (R,I,S,E)

### Optimal Second Guess: **ABOUT**
- **Why this word?**
  - Places A in **position 1** (untested position) to check if A is correctly positioned there.
  - Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T** (all distinct).
  - Uses vowels **O** and **U** (high value after excluding E/I).
  - Contains no repeated letters or excluded letters (R,I,S,E).

### Expected Information Gain:
- If A is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter.
- If A is yellow (-), we know A must be in positions 3/4/5.
- Feedback on B/O/U/T will reveal new letters or eliminate possibilities.

<thinking>
Given the constraints and information gap, ABOUT optimally probes positional data for A while efficiently testing new high-value vowels/consonants.

<guess>ABOUT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.
- The letters R, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ABOUT
- A: present, but not in position 1 (-)  [since we put it in position 1 and got '-']
- B: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- U: absent (x)
- T: present, but not in position 5 (-)

So now we know:
- A is present, but not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1 and guess2).
- T is present, but not in position 5.
- B, O, U are absent (so the word does not contain B, O, U).
- Additionally, we still know R, I, S, E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must contain A and T.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Wait, from guess1: A not in 2, from guess2: A not in 1. We don't know about 3,4,5? But in guess2, A was in position 1 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, in guess1, A was in position 2 and we got '-'. So A must be in position 3 or 4? (since there are only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5; and 1 and 2 are ruled out, and 5 is still possible? But wait, we haven't tested A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? Actually, we have not placed A in position 3,4, or 5 yet? So we don't know about those.

But note: in guess2, we placed A in position 1 and got a '-', which only tells us that A is not in position 1. It doesn't tell us about position 5? We haven't placed A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? 

Similarly, T is present but not in position 5? So T must be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But we don't know which.

Also, the absent letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E. So the word cannot have these.

Now, what letters are available? We have to use letters that are not excluded. The alphabet without B, O, U, R, I, S, E: 

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and T are already known to be in the word.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Contains A and T (since they are present, we should include them to get positional information)
- Avoids the excluded letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E.
- We should try to place A in a new position (we haven't tried 3,4,5) and T in a new position (we haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried T in position 5 and got '-', so we know T is not in 5? So we should try T in 1,2,3, or 4? But we haven't tried any of these? So we can try any? But we want to maximize information.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? We have 3 more letters to test? Since we know A and T are in, we can test three new letters? But we have to form a word.

We also know that A cannot be in position 1 or 2? So in our next guess, we should put A in either position 3,4, or 5? Similarly, T cannot be in position 5? So we can put T in 1,2,3,4? 

But note: we want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? For A, we know positions 1 and 2 are wrong? So we must put A in 3,4, or 5? Similarly, for T, we know position 5 is wrong? So we must put T in 1,2,3, or 4? 

But we can put both A and T in the same word? And we have to.

Now, we need to choose positions for A and T that are possible? And then fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4

But note: if we put A and T in the same position? That's not possible? We have to put them in different positions? Because they are distinct letters? Unless the word has two of the same? But we don't know? But so far, we have no indication of duplicates? But it's possible? However, we are going to assume distinct for now? But we don't know? So we have to consider? But to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates? 

But we know A and T are present? So if we put them in different positions? 

Let me try to form words that have A and T, and three other letters from the available set? And avoid the excluded letters.

We also want to test common letters? Like L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that have A and T? And 3 other letters? And avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3 and T in position 1: T _ A _ _ 
  What words? T? A? 
  Examples: ""TALKY"" -> but Y is allowed? But we have to check: T(1), A(2)? But wait, we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2? So we cannot put A in position 2? We must put A in 3,4, or 5? 

  So if T in 1 and A in 3: T _ A _ _
  Words: ""TALKY"" -> T(1), A(2) -> invalid because A in position 2? We cannot do that? We must avoid position 2 for A? 

  So we cannot have A in position 2? So in the pattern T _ A _ _, the A is in position 3? That's okay? Then what words? 
  ""TALKY"": T(1), A(2) -> no, that's position 2? 
  We need A in position 3: so T _ _ A _? Or T _ A _ _? Actually, if we have T in 1 and A in 3: then the pattern is T (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

  Example: ""TACIT"" -> but I is excluded? Invalid.

  ""TACKY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? Not allowed? We must avoid position 2 for A? 

  How about ""TANGO"": but O is excluded? 

  ""TANGY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? 

  It's hard to find a word with T in 1 and A in 3? 

  Let me try: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> this works? Because A is in position 3? And we avoid excluded letters? H, N, K are not excluded? 

  But note: we have to avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E? Yes, THANK has none of these? So THANK is a valid word? 

  But wait: we also have T? We know T is in the word? But we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? But that's okay? We are testing.

  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? 

  Let me try to list words with A in position 3,4, or 5 and T in 1,2,3,4? 

  Another idea: put A in position 5? and T in position 1? 
  Pattern: T _ _ _ A
  Words: ""TABLA"" -> but B is excluded? 
          ""TACHA"" -> not common? 
          ""TALMA"" -> not common? 
          ""TANGA"" -> but we have two A's? and G is okay? But TANGA is a word? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? 

  But we want to avoid duplicates? So let's try to find words with distinct letters? 

  How about A in position 4? 
  Pattern: T _ _ A _
  Example: ""TALKA"" -> again, two A's? 
           ""TAPPA"" -> two P's? 

  Alternatively, put T in position 2? But we haven't tested T in position 2? 

  Let me try a different approach: put A in position 3 and T in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ A T _
  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but we used PLANT in the previous step? But we didn't? We considered it? But now we have more constraints? 
  ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5? Because in ABOUT, T was in position 5 and we got '-', meaning T is present but not in 5? So we cannot put T in position 5? 

  Therefore, in PLANT, if we put T in position 5, we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? 

  We want to put T in a position we haven't tried? We have only tried position 5? So we should try 1,2,3,4? 

  So for the pattern _ _ A T _: 
  We can have: 
    Position 1: any letter (not excluded)
    Position 2: any letter (not excluded)
    Position 3: A
    Position 4: T
    Position 5: any letter (not excluded)

  Example: ""CHANT"": C(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? We cannot put T in 5? Because we know it's not there? 

  We need to put T in a position that is not 5? So in this pattern, we cannot put T in 4? Because the pattern has T in 4? And then position 5 is free? 

  But we are putting T in 4? That's allowed? Because we haven't tried T in 4? 

  However, the pattern _ _ A T _ has T in position 4? That's okay? 

  But then the word must end with a letter? So position 5 is the last? 

  But we are not putting T in 5? We are putting T in 4? So that's okay? 

  So ""CHANT"" has T in 4? And then position 5 is N? But wait: ""CHANT"" is C-H-A-N-T? So T is in position 5? Oh, I see: in ""CHANT"", the T is in position 5? 

  So we need a word that has T in position 4? 

  Example: ""CATTY"" -> C(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A is in position 2? We cannot put A in 2? And also two T's? 

  How about ""MATTE"": M(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), E(5) -> A in 2? and E? excluded? 

  We need a word with A in 3 and T in 4? 
  Pattern: ? ? A T ? 
  And the last letter is not T? 

  Example: ""FACTS"": F(1), A(2), C(3), T(4), S(5) -> but A in 2? and S is excluded? 

  ""PACTs"" -> same? 

  ""DATUM"": D(1), A(2), T(3), U(4), M(5) -> A in 2? and U excluded? 

  It's hard? 

  How about A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ A T -> but T in position 5? We know T is not in 5? So we cannot put T in 5? 

  So we must avoid T in 5? 

  Therefore, we cannot have T at the end? 

  So let's try A in position 3 and T in position 1? 
  Pattern: T _ A _ _ 
  We need a word: T, ?, A, ?, ? 
  With A in 3? and T in 1? 
  And the second letter cannot be A? because we know A is not in 2? 

  Example: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> as I thought earlier? 

  THANK: 
    T: we are testing in position 1? 
    H: new letter? 
    A: in position 3? 
    N: new letter? 
    K: new letter? 

  And it avoids excluded letters? Yes: B,O,U,R,I,S,E are excluded? H, N, K are not excluded? 

  So THANK is a valid word? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? It might be? Or it might be in 2,3,4? 

  Similarly, A in position 3? 

  This guess will tell us about T in position 1 and A in position 3? 

  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? 

  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And we have to include T? So T must be in one of the other positions? 

  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but T in 5? not allowed? 

  ""CLAMP"": C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5) -> but A in 3? and no T? We must include T? 

  We must include both A and T? 

  So for A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And T must be in 1,2,3, or 5? But 5 is not allowed for T? So T must be in 1,2, or 3? 

  Example: ""TAPAS"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""PATIO"" -> P(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""MANTY"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 

  How about T in position 1 and A in position 4? 
  Pattern: T _ _ A _ 
  Example: ""TALKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""TANKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? 
           ""TACHA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? 

  It seems difficult? 

  How about T in position 2 and A in position 4? 
  Pattern: _ T _ A _ 
  Example: ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? 
           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? and T in 2? and then T in 3? and A in 4? -> but A in 1 and 4? and T in 2 and 3? 
           But we have to avoid A in 1? We know A is not in 1? So we cannot have A in 1? 

  So the first letter cannot be A? 

  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? 

  ""MUTHA"" -> U excluded? 

  ""KETCH"" -> no A? 

  It's challenging? 

  Therefore, the best option might be THANK? 

  But let me think of another word with A in position 5? 
  Pattern: _ _ _ _ A 
  And T must be in 1,2,3,4? 
  Example: ""MANGA"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 
           ""PANDA"" -> P(1), A(2) -> same? 
           ""VISTA"" -> S excluded? 
           ""JUMBA"" -> U excluded? 

  How about ""DATA"" -> but that's 4 letters? 

  ""YENTA"" -> Y(1), E(2) -> E excluded? 

  ""FATWA"" -> F(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? 

  So it seems that having A in position 5 is hard? 

  Therefore, the most feasible is to put A in position 3? 

  So THANK is a candidate? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don't know if T is in position 1? But that's okay? 

  Another candidate: ""CHAMP"" -> but A in 3? and T not included? We must include T? 

  We must include T? 

  How about ""THYME""? -> T(1), H(2), Y(3), M(4), E(5) -> E excluded? 

  ""THUMB"" -> U excluded? 

  ""THANA"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> two A's? But we don't know? And A in 3 and 5? But we know A is present? It could be twice? But we want to avoid duplicates? 

  But THANA is a word? 

  However, we are testing A in position 3? And we have T in 1? 

  But THANA has two A's? So if the secret word has only one A, then we might get feedback that the second A is absent? But we know A is present? So the feedback for the first A (position 3) would be either green or yellow? And the second A (position 5) would be yellow if the word has two A's? Or if the word has only one A, then the second A would be gray? 

  But we don't know? So it might be confusing? 

  Therefore, to avoid confusion, we should try a word with distinct letters? 

  So THANK is better? 

  Another word: ""THALI"" -> but I excluded? 

  ""THECA"" -> T(1), H(2), E(3), C(4), A(5) -> E excluded? 

  ""THACK"" -> not common? 

  So THANK seems good? 

  But let me check: THANK: T, H, A, N, K -> all distinct? Yes? 

  And positions: 
    T in 1: we haven't tested T in 1? 
    H in 2: new? 
    A in 3: we haven't tested A in 3? 
    N in 4: new? 
    K in 5: new? 

  And we avoid excluded letters? Yes. 

  So I think THANK is a good guess? 

  But note: we are not testing T in a position that might be more likely? But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we could put T in position 2? 

  Pattern: _ T _ _ _ 
  And A in 3: _ T A _ _ 
  Example: ""STACK"" -> S excluded? 
           ""PTARM"" -> not common? 
           ""ATAPS"" -> A in 1? not allowed? 

  How about ""MTAOU"" -> not a word? 

  It's hard? 

  So I'll go with THANK? 

  But wait: what about putting A in position 4? 

  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ 
  And T in 2: _ T _ A _ 
  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? 
           ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? 
           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? not allowed? 

  How about ""LTAKM"" -> not a word? 

  So THANK seems the best? 

  Another idea: ""TANKA"" -> but A in 2? not allowed? 

  Therefore, I choose THANK.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence? So we go with distinct.

So guess: THANK.

But let me double-check the feedback we might get? 

If the secret word has A in position 3? Then we get A as green? 
If T is in position 1? Then T green? 
But we don't know? 

But we are trying to get information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 5? and T in position 1? 
But we couldn't find one? 

How about ""TAWAF"" -> not common? 

I think THANK is acceptable.

So I'll go with THANK.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Feedback Summary:
- **RAISE**: A is present (not in position 2); R, I, S, E absent.
- **ABOUT**: A is present (not in position 1); T is present (not in position 5); B, O, U absent.

### Key Constraints:
1. **A** must be in the word but **not in positions 1 or 2** (so positions 3, 4, or 5).
2. **T** must be in the word but **not in position 5** (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
3. **Excluded letters**: B, O, U, R, I, S, E (cannot appear).
4. Available letters: A, T, and others like C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test new positions for A and T**: Place A in position 3 (untested) and T in position 1 (untested) to maximize positional information.
- **Cover new high-frequency letters**: Include H, N, K (common consonants) to test their presence.
- **Avoid duplicates and excluded letters**: Ensure all letters are distinct and valid.

### Chosen Guess: **THANK**
- **T** in position 1: Tests if T is correctly placed at start.
- **H** in position 2: New consonant test.
- **A** in position 3: Tests if A is correctly placed here (since positions 1/2 are invalid).
- **N** in position 4: New consonant test.
- **K** in position 5: New consonant test.

This guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently probes for A/T placement while testing 3 new letters. If A is green (✓) in position 3, we lock its location. If T is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter. Feedback on H/N/K will further narrow possibilities.

<thinking>
THANK is optimal as it:
- Avoids all excluded letters (B,O,U,R,I,S,E)
- Tests A in a new valid position (3) and T in a new valid position (1)
- Uses high-frequency new letters (H, N, K)
- Maximizes information gain for the next move

We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.\n Since it\'s the first guess, we have no prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.\n Ideally, we pick a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many letters as possible.\n\n Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.\n Some popular starting words are: SALET, CRATE, SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and covers some vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and no repeating letters.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we can use any valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALET"" is known to be a strong starting word.

So I\'ll go with RAISE.\n\n Alternatively, the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so they are valid.\n\n Therefore, my first guess: RAISE.<thinking>\nAs this is the first guess, I have zero prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with distinct common letters to cover a broad range of possibilities. \n\nI analyzed English letter frequency in 5-letter words:\n- High-frequency consonants: R, S, T, L, N\n- High-frequency vowels: A, E, I, O\n\nThe ideal word should:\n- Contain 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities\n- Include multiple vowels and common consonants\n- Avoid obscure words to ensure validity\n\nConsidering these factors, **""RAISE""** is a strong choice because:\n1. It uses five distinct, high-frequency letters: R, A, I, S, E\n2. It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)\n3. It\'s a valid English word (meaning ""to lift or set up"")\n\nAlternative words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" also meet criteria, but ""RAISE"" slightly optimizes vowel coverage. The feedback from this guess will efficiently reveal positional and inclusion information, especially about vowels which are critical for word formation.\n\nThus, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"": \n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n A(-) -> A is in the word, but not in the second position.\n I(x) -> I is not in the secret word.\n S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n So what do we know?\n - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was marked \'-\'). So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. In ""RAISE"", A was in position 2. So it\'s in the word and yellow, meaning it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Additionally, we know that R, I, S, E are absent.\n\n Therefore, the secret word contains A, but not R, I, S, or E.\n\n We must make a second guess that:\n - Is a 5-letter English word\n - Contains A (since we know it\'s present)\n - Does not contain R, I, S, E (since they are absent)\n - And we should try to include other common letters to test.\n\n Since A is present and must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5, we should avoid putting A in position 2 again.\n\n Also, note that the word might have repeating letters? The rules didn\'t say it can\'t, but typically they don\'t. And in the feedback, if a letter repeats, it gets marked appropriately only if it appears multiple times. But we don\'t have any indication of repetition yet.\n\n Without knowing the positions, we can use A in a different position in our next guess.\n\n We need to choose a word that fits:\n - Excluded letters: R, I, S, E\n - Included letters: A (must be in the word)\n\n We can use common English consonants and vowels that are not excluded: \n Vowels: O, U and sometimes Y? But Y can be used as a vowel or consonant. The excluded vowels are I and E (we only have A as vowel so far). We have O and U.\n\n Consonants: We excluded R and S. So we have T, N, L, C, D, M, P, ... etc.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain A and avoid R,I,S,E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - Words starting with A: But we need a word without E,R,I,S.\n - Words ending with A: Similarly.\n\n Common letters we can use: T, L, N, O, U, etc.\n\n Example words: \n ""ABOUT"" : contains A (in position ?) and avoids R,I,S,E? \n   Let\'s check: A, B, O, U, T -> excludes R,I,S,E? Yes. But note: the feedback for A in the previous word was \'-\', meaning it\'s present and should be in our word. However, in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1? That might be a possibility.\n\n But wait, we don\'t know the position yet. So we could try to have A in a new position.\n\n However, we must remember: we also want to test multiple new letters to gain more information.\n\n Another idea: The word could have A in position 3? Or 4? \n\n Since we don\'t know, let\'s pick a word that places A in a different position than position 2.\n\n Let\'s try to put A in position 1: \n Example: ""ADOBE"" -> but E is excluded? E is excluded because in the previous feedback E(x). So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""ADOBE"" has E -> invalid.\n\n Example with A in position 1: A, then avoid E,R,I,S? \n Words: ""ABOUT"" (A in position 1), ""ABOUT"" is valid: A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.\n\n But is ""ABOUT"" a 5-letter word? Yes: A-B-O-U-T.\n\n Alternatively, A in position 3: Possible words: ""TOTAL"" -> but T,A,L: but L is okay? Excluded? Only R,I,S,E are excluded. Total has T,O,T,A,L -> two T\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n\n ""TOTAL"": \n - T: new letter, O: new, T: repeated? A: we know is present, L: new.\n\n However, we want to avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage? But it might be necessary.\n\n But note that we are also testing additional letters: T, O, L in ""TOTAL"". But ""TOTAL"" has two T\'s and two A\'s? Wait: T, O, T, A, L -> actually only one A? And two T\'s.\n\n We might get feedback that helps us understand if T appears once or twice.\n\n Similarly, we can consider ""POUCH""? No A.\n\n So we need words containing A.\n\n Let me list words without E,R,I,S and with A:\n\n Some candidates:\n   ABOUT: positions 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T\n   MANGO: M, A, N, G, O -> note G is also a common letter? But acceptable? Yes.\n   BANAL: B, A, N, A, L -> two A\'s? That might complicate. Also note L is common.\n   PANDA: P, A, N, D, A -> two A\'s? Not good for information.\n   TANGO: T, A, N, G, O -> distinct letters? T, A, N, G, O.\n\n We want to maximize the number of new letters we test? Because we only have A so far.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" uses A, B, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T? Actually A,B,O,U,T are distinct? Yes.\n\n Similarly, ""MANGO"": M,A,N,G,O -> distinct? Yes.\n\n But note: we only know A is present. The others are unknown and might be present or absent.\n\n We can also consider: ""PLAUT"" ? but not a word. \n\n Another: ""AUDIO"" -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I? Yes, feedback said I is absent. So invalid.\n\n How about ""OCTAD""? Not common, avoid.\n\n Among the two: \n ABOUT: uses A (position 1), B, O, U, T -> and avoids E,R,I,S.\n MANGO: A in position 2 -> but wait, in our previous guess we had A in position 2 and it was yellow? Meaning that the letter A is not in position 2? Then if we put A again in position 2, we would get a \'-\', meaning wrong position? But actually, we want to test A in a new position? The secret word does not have A in position 2. So we should avoid putting A in position 2 because we know it\'s incorrect.\n\n In MANGO: \n If we put MANGO: M(position1), A(position2), N(position3), G(position4), O(position5)\n\n But we know that A is not in position 2? Because the secret word\'s A is not there. So having A in position 2 again would waste our chance? Yet the feedback would show A as \'-\'. Since the secret word has A, but not in position 2, then if we put A in position 2, we would get a \'-\' again? But that wouldn\'t tell us anything new because we already know that. We want to try A in a different position.\n\n Therefore, avoid putting A in position 2.\n\n That rules out words that have A in the second position? \n\n So words like MANGO (A in position 2) is bad.\n\n Then what about ABOUT? A is in position 1: that\'s a new position.\n\n Also, any word that has A in positions 3,4, or 5.\n\n Possible words:\n\n Position 1: ABOUT, ACTOR? Actor: A,C,T,O,R -> but R is excluded? R is in the exclusion list. So no R. Therefore ACTOR invalid.\n\n Position 3: \n   PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids E,R,I,S. And A is in position 3. This is good? \n   CHANT: C,H,A,N,T -> same pattern.\n\n Position 4:\n   Could try a word with A in fourth? Example: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> E is excluded. Invalid.\n\n Position 5:\n   ""TABLA"" -> but T,A,B,L,A? Two A\'s? and we don\'t know about B. Not common? and A in position 2 and 5? We want only one A? We know A is present at least once. It could be that the word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Also, try ""KOALA"" -> K,O,A,L,A? Two A\'s? Again.\n\n   Or ""NANGA"" -> not common.\n\n   Better: find words with A only once and in position 5.\n\n   Example: ""CHAIR"" -> C,H,A,I,R -> has I and R? Excluded.\n\n   ""ATOLL"" -> A in position 1? No: A,T,O,L,L? \n\n   We need a word ending with A: ""PIZZA"" -> P,I,Z,Z,A -> has I? Excluded.\n\n   Not easy? So maybe position 3 is easier.\n\n Considering that, let\'s pick ""PLANT"". It has:\n P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)\n\n We avoid E,R,I,S and we avoid putting A in position 2. \n\n Advantages: \n - Tests new letters: P, L, N, T (and A in a new position).\n - All distinct letters? Yes: P,L,A,N,T.\n\n But is ""PLANT"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n However, we are missing testing of vowels: We know that O and U are still possibilities? We haven\'t tested them. But we can test them later.\n\n Alternatively, ABOUT: positions 1: A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> tests vowels O and U? Yes, O and U. And distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T.\n\n So ABOUT tests two vowels (O and U) and consonants B and T? While PLANT tests consonants only.\n\n Since vowels are important, and we have only tested A? We haven\'t tested O and U? So ABOUT may be better for testing the vowel space.\n\n Let\'s not forget: the word must have A. By putting A in position 1 in ABOUT, we will get feedback on whether A is in the first position? If we get green, then we know. If we get yellow, then we know it\'s in positions 3,4,5? Actually, we already know it\'s not in position 2? And if we get yellow for A in position 1? Then A is in the word but not in position 1? Which we already knew it could be? But wait: if we put A in position 1 and it is green, then we know position 1 is A. If we get yellow, then we know A is not in position 1? That would be new information because we only knew before that it wasn\'t in 2? And if we get gray? But we already know A is in the word? It cannot be gray? Wait: the feedback rules: \'-\' means it\'s in the word but wrong position? And \'x\' means not in the word? But we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it is still a \'-\'? That would tell us: yes A is present? But it\'s not in position 1? Which is new? And if it\'s green? That tells us it is in position 1.\n\n Therefore, by putting A in position 1, we might end up with: \n   Green: then we know the first letter is A? And then we restrict possibilities? \n   Yellow: then we know A is not in position 1? Then it must be in 3,4 or 5? (since in RAISE we had it in 2 and now 1 is wrong) -> so positions 3,4,5 and we avoid position 1.\n\n If we put A in position 3 (like PLANT) and get green? Then we know A is fixed at position 3? \n\n Either way, we get new positional information about A? \n\n However, ABOUT has the advantage that it also tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (B and T). \n\n In terms of information: ABOUT covers more vowel ground? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we already know there\'s no E,I? So vowels available are A (which we know), O, U, and sometimes Y? \n\n Testing O and U might be valuable? \n\n Alternatively, PLANT doesn\'t test O and U? \n\n Therefore, I prefer ABOUT? Because it can help eliminate or confirm two vowels? \n\n But also consider the frequency: letters like T, O, U are common? So testing them is good.\n\n So let\'s go with ABOUT.\n\n We must be cautious: the word ABOUT might not be the secret word because it\'s a common word? But it\'s possible? But we are just trying for information.\n\n Therefore, the guess: ABOUT.\n\n But wait: in position 5? We have T. T is a common consonant? We can test.\n\n So let me choose ABOUT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, S, E are **absent** (marked x)\n- A is **present** but not in position 2 (marked -)\n\n### Key Constraints:\n1. The secret word **contains A** but **not R, I, S, E**.\n2. A must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).\n3. The guess should prioritize:\n   - Testing A in a new position (avoiding position 2)\n   - Covering new high-frequency consonants/vowels\n   - Avoiding excluded letters (R,I,S,E)\n\n### Optimal Second Guess: **ABOUT**\n- **Why this word?**\n  - Places A in **position 1** (untested position) to check if A is correctly positioned there.\n  - Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T** (all distinct).\n  - Uses vowels **O** and **U** (high value after excluding E/I).\n  - Contains no repeated letters or excluded letters (R,I,S,E).\n\n### Expected Information Gain:\n- If A is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter.\n- If A is yellow (-), we know A must be in positions 3/4/5.\n- Feedback on B/O/U/T will reveal new letters or eliminate possibilities.\n\n<thinking>\nGiven the constraints and information gap, ABOUT optimally probes positional data for A while efficiently testing new high-value vowels/consonants.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>ABOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: present, but not in position 2 (-)\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n- E: absent (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.\n- The letters R, I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ABOUT\n- A: present, but not in position 1 (-)  [since we put it in position 1 and got \'-\']\n- B: absent (x)\n- O: absent (x)\n- U: absent (x)\n- T: present, but not in position 5 (-)\n\nSo now we know:\n- A is present, but not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1 and guess2).\n- T is present, but not in position 5.\n- B, O, U are absent (so the word does not contain B, O, U).\n- Additionally, we still know R, I, S, E are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must contain A and T.\n- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Wait, from guess1: A not in 2, from guess2: A not in 1. We don\'t know about 3,4,5? But in guess2, A was in position 1 and we got \'-\', meaning A is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, in guess1, A was in position 2 and we got \'-\'. So A must be in position 3 or 4? (since there are only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5; and 1 and 2 are ruled out, and 5 is still possible? But wait, we haven\'t tested A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? Actually, we have not placed A in position 3,4, or 5 yet? So we don\'t know about those.\n\nBut note: in guess2, we placed A in position 1 and got a \'-\', which only tells us that A is not in position 1. It doesn\'t tell us about position 5? We haven\'t placed A in position 5? So A could be in 3,4, or 5? \n\nSimilarly, T is present but not in position 5? So T must be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But we don\'t know which.\n\nAlso, the absent letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E. So the word cannot have these.\n\nNow, what letters are available? We have to use letters that are not excluded. The alphabet without B, O, U, R, I, S, E: \n\nAvailable: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: A and T are already known to be in the word.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Contains A and T (since they are present, we should include them to get positional information)\n- Avoids the excluded letters: B, O, U, R, I, S, E.\n- We should try to place A in a new position (we haven\'t tried 3,4,5) and T in a new position (we haven\'t tried 1,2,3,4? We tried T in position 5 and got \'-\', so we know T is not in 5? So we should try T in 1,2,3, or 4? But we haven\'t tried any of these? So we can try any? But we want to maximize information.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible? We have 3 more letters to test? Since we know A and T are in, we can test three new letters? But we have to form a word.\n\nWe also know that A cannot be in position 1 or 2? So in our next guess, we should put A in either position 3,4, or 5? Similarly, T cannot be in position 5? So we can put T in 1,2,3,4? \n\nBut note: we want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? For A, we know positions 1 and 2 are wrong? So we must put A in 3,4, or 5? Similarly, for T, we know position 5 is wrong? So we must put T in 1,2,3, or 4? \n\nBut we can put both A and T in the same word? And we have to.\n\nNow, we need to choose positions for A and T that are possible? And then fill the rest with new letters.\n\nPossible positions for A: 3,4,5\nPossible positions for T: 1,2,3,4\n\nBut note: if we put A and T in the same position? That\'s not possible? We have to put them in different positions? Because they are distinct letters? Unless the word has two of the same? But we don\'t know? But so far, we have no indication of duplicates? But it\'s possible? However, we are going to assume distinct for now? But we don\'t know? So we have to consider? But to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates? \n\nBut we know A and T are present? So if we put them in different positions? \n\nLet me try to form words that have A and T, and three other letters from the available set? And avoid the excluded letters.\n\nWe also want to test common letters? Like L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and T? And 3 other letters? And avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put A in position 3 and T in position 1: T _ A _ _ \n  What words? T? A? \n  Examples: ""TALKY"" -> but Y is allowed? But we have to check: T(1), A(2)? But wait, we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2? So we cannot put A in position 2? We must put A in 3,4, or 5? \n\n  So if T in 1 and A in 3: T _ A _ _\n  Words: ""TALKY"" -> T(1), A(2) -> invalid because A in position 2? We cannot do that? We must avoid position 2 for A? \n\n  So we cannot have A in position 2? So in the pattern T _ A _ _, the A is in position 3? That\'s okay? Then what words? \n  ""TALKY"": T(1), A(2) -> no, that\'s position 2? \n  We need A in position 3: so T _ _ A _? Or T _ A _ _? Actually, if we have T in 1 and A in 3: then the pattern is T (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)\n\n  Example: ""TACIT"" -> but I is excluded? Invalid.\n\n  ""TACKY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? Not allowed? We must avoid position 2 for A? \n\n  How about ""TANGO"": but O is excluded? \n\n  ""TANGY"": T(1), A(2) -> again, A in 2? \n\n  It\'s hard to find a word with T in 1 and A in 3? \n\n  Let me try: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> this works? Because A is in position 3? And we avoid excluded letters? H, N, K are not excluded? \n\n  But note: we have to avoid B,O,U,R,I,S,E? Yes, THANK has none of these? So THANK is a valid word? \n\n  But wait: we also have T? We know T is in the word? But we are putting T in position 1? We don\'t know if T is in position 1? But that\'s okay? We are testing.\n\n  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? \n\n  Let me try to list words with A in position 3,4, or 5 and T in 1,2,3,4? \n\n  Another idea: put A in position 5? and T in position 1? \n  Pattern: T _ _ _ A\n  Words: ""TABLA"" -> but B is excluded? \n          ""TACHA"" -> not common? \n          ""TALMA"" -> not common? \n          ""TANGA"" -> but we have two A\'s? and G is okay? But TANGA is a word? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? \n\n  But we want to avoid duplicates? So let\'s try to find words with distinct letters? \n\n  How about A in position 4? \n  Pattern: T _ _ A _\n  Example: ""TALKA"" -> again, two A\'s? \n           ""TAPPA"" -> two P\'s? \n\n  Alternatively, put T in position 2? But we haven\'t tested T in position 2? \n\n  Let me try a different approach: put A in position 3 and T in position 4? \n  Pattern: _ _ A T _\n  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but we used PLANT in the previous step? But we didn\'t? We considered it? But now we have more constraints? \n  ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5? Because in ABOUT, T was in position 5 and we got \'-\', meaning T is present but not in 5? So we cannot put T in position 5? \n\n  Therefore, in PLANT, if we put T in position 5, we would get a \'-\' again? But we already know that? So it\'s a waste? \n\n  We want to put T in a position we haven\'t tried? We have only tried position 5? So we should try 1,2,3,4? \n\n  So for the pattern _ _ A T _: \n  We can have: \n    Position 1: any letter (not excluded)\n    Position 2: any letter (not excluded)\n    Position 3: A\n    Position 4: T\n    Position 5: any letter (not excluded)\n\n  Example: ""CHANT"": C(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is in position 5? We cannot put T in 5? Because we know it\'s not there? \n\n  We need to put T in a position that is not 5? So in this pattern, we cannot put T in 4? Because the pattern has T in 4? And then position 5 is free? \n\n  But we are putting T in 4? That\'s allowed? Because we haven\'t tried T in 4? \n\n  However, the pattern _ _ A T _ has T in position 4? That\'s okay? \n\n  But then the word must end with a letter? So position 5 is the last? \n\n  But we are not putting T in 5? We are putting T in 4? So that\'s okay? \n\n  So ""CHANT"" has T in 4? And then position 5 is N? But wait: ""CHANT"" is C-H-A-N-T? So T is in position 5? Oh, I see: in ""CHANT"", the T is in position 5? \n\n  So we need a word that has T in position 4? \n\n  Example: ""CATTY"" -> C(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A is in position 2? We cannot put A in 2? And also two T\'s? \n\n  How about ""MATTE"": M(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), E(5) -> A in 2? and E? excluded? \n\n  We need a word with A in 3 and T in 4? \n  Pattern: ? ? A T ? \n  And the last letter is not T? \n\n  Example: ""FACTS"": F(1), A(2), C(3), T(4), S(5) -> but A in 2? and S is excluded? \n\n  ""PACTs"" -> same? \n\n  ""DATUM"": D(1), A(2), T(3), U(4), M(5) -> A in 2? and U excluded? \n\n  It\'s hard? \n\n  How about A in position 4? \n  Pattern: _ _ _ A T -> but T in position 5? We know T is not in 5? So we cannot put T in 5? \n\n  So we must avoid T in 5? \n\n  Therefore, we cannot have T at the end? \n\n  So let\'s try A in position 3 and T in position 1? \n  Pattern: T _ A _ _ \n  We need a word: T, ?, A, ?, ? \n  With A in 3? and T in 1? \n  And the second letter cannot be A? because we know A is not in 2? \n\n  Example: ""THANK"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> as I thought earlier? \n\n  THANK: \n    T: we are testing in position 1? \n    H: new letter? \n    A: in position 3? \n    N: new letter? \n    K: new letter? \n\n  And it avoids excluded letters? Yes: B,O,U,R,I,S,E are excluded? H, N, K are not excluded? \n\n  So THANK is a valid word? \n\n  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don\'t know if T is in position 1? It might be? Or it might be in 2,3,4? \n\n  Similarly, A in position 3? \n\n  This guess will tell us about T in position 1 and A in position 3? \n\n  Alternatively, we could put A in position 4? \n\n  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ \n  And we have to include T? So T must be in one of the other positions? \n\n  Example: ""PLANT"" -> but T in 5? not allowed? \n\n  ""CLAMP"": C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5) -> but A in 3? and no T? We must include T? \n\n  We must include both A and T? \n\n  So for A in position 4? \n  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ \n  And T must be in 1,2,3, or 5? But 5 is not allowed for T? So T must be in 1,2, or 3? \n\n  Example: ""TAPAS"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? \n           ""PATIO"" -> P(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? \n           ""MANTY"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? \n\n  How about T in position 1 and A in position 4? \n  Pattern: T _ _ A _ \n  Example: ""TALKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? \n           ""TANKA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? \n           ""TACHA"" -> T(1), A(2) -> same? \n\n  It seems difficult? \n\n  How about T in position 2 and A in position 4? \n  Pattern: _ T _ A _ \n  Example: ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? \n           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? and T in 2? and then T in 3? and A in 4? -> but A in 1 and 4? and T in 2 and 3? \n           But we have to avoid A in 1? We know A is not in 1? So we cannot have A in 1? \n\n  So the first letter cannot be A? \n\n  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? \n\n  ""MUTHA"" -> U excluded? \n\n  ""KETCH"" -> no A? \n\n  It\'s challenging? \n\n  Therefore, the best option might be THANK? \n\n  But let me think of another word with A in position 5? \n  Pattern: _ _ _ _ A \n  And T must be in 1,2,3,4? \n  Example: ""MANGA"" -> M(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? \n           ""PANDA"" -> P(1), A(2) -> same? \n           ""VISTA"" -> S excluded? \n           ""JUMBA"" -> U excluded? \n\n  How about ""DATA"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? \n\n  ""YENTA"" -> Y(1), E(2) -> E excluded? \n\n  ""FATWA"" -> F(1), A(2) -> A in 2? not allowed? \n\n  So it seems that having A in position 5 is hard? \n\n  Therefore, the most feasible is to put A in position 3? \n\n  So THANK is a candidate? \n\n  But note: we are putting T in position 1? We don\'t know if T is in position 1? But that\'s okay? \n\n  Another candidate: ""CHAMP"" -> but A in 3? and T not included? We must include T? \n\n  We must include T? \n\n  How about ""THYME""? -> T(1), H(2), Y(3), M(4), E(5) -> E excluded? \n\n  ""THUMB"" -> U excluded? \n\n  ""THANA"": T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> two A\'s? But we don\'t know? And A in 3 and 5? But we know A is present? It could be twice? But we want to avoid duplicates? \n\n  But THANA is a word? \n\n  However, we are testing A in position 3? And we have T in 1? \n\n  But THANA has two A\'s? So if the secret word has only one A, then we might get feedback that the second A is absent? But we know A is present? So the feedback for the first A (position 3) would be either green or yellow? And the second A (position 5) would be yellow if the word has two A\'s? Or if the word has only one A, then the second A would be gray? \n\n  But we don\'t know? So it might be confusing? \n\n  Therefore, to avoid confusion, we should try a word with distinct letters? \n\n  So THANK is better? \n\n  Another word: ""THALI"" -> but I excluded? \n\n  ""THECA"" -> T(1), H(2), E(3), C(4), A(5) -> E excluded? \n\n  ""THACK"" -> not common? \n\n  So THANK seems good? \n\n  But let me check: THANK: T, H, A, N, K -> all distinct? Yes? \n\n  And positions: \n    T in 1: we haven\'t tested T in 1? \n    H in 2: new? \n    A in 3: we haven\'t tested A in 3? \n    N in 4: new? \n    K in 5: new? \n\n  And we avoid excluded letters? Yes. \n\n  So I think THANK is a good guess? \n\n  But note: we are not testing T in a position that might be more likely? But we don\'t know? \n\n  Alternatively, we could put T in position 2? \n\n  Pattern: _ T _ _ _ \n  And A in 3: _ T A _ _ \n  Example: ""STACK"" -> S excluded? \n           ""PTARM"" -> not common? \n           ""ATAPS"" -> A in 1? not allowed? \n\n  How about ""MTAOU"" -> not a word? \n\n  It\'s hard? \n\n  So I\'ll go with THANK? \n\n  But wait: what about putting A in position 4? \n\n  Pattern: _ _ _ A _ \n  And T in 2: _ T _ A _ \n  Example: ""UTTAP"" -> U excluded? \n           ""STAMP"" -> S excluded? \n           ""ATTAR"" -> A in 1? not allowed? \n\n  How about ""LTAKM"" -> not a word? \n\n  So THANK seems the best? \n\n  Another idea: ""TANKA"" -> but A in 2? not allowed? \n\n  Therefore, I choose THANK.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence? So we go with distinct.\n\nSo guess: THANK.\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we might get? \n\nIf the secret word has A in position 3? Then we get A as green? \nIf T is in position 1? Then T green? \nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBut we are trying to get information? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 5? and T in position 1? \nBut we couldn\'t find one? \n\nHow about ""TAWAF"" -> not common? \n\nI think THANK is acceptable.\n\nSo I\'ll go with THANK.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n### Feedback Summary:\n- **RAISE**: A is present (not in position 2); R, I, S, E absent.\n- **ABOUT**: A is present (not in position 1); T is present (not in position 5); B, O, U absent.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n1. **A** must be in the word but **not in positions 1 or 2** (so positions 3, 4, or 5).\n2. **T** must be in the word but **not in position 5** (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n3. **Excluded letters**: B, O, U, R, I, S, E (cannot appear).\n4. Available letters: A, T, and others like C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- **Test new positions for A and T**: Place A in position 3 (untested) and T in position 1 (untested) to maximize positional information.\n- **Cover new high-frequency letters**: Include H, N, K (common consonants) to test their presence.\n- **Avoid duplicates and excluded letters**: Ensure all letters are distinct and valid.\n\n### Chosen Guess: **THANK**\n- **T** in position 1: Tests if T is correctly placed at start.\n- **H** in position 2: New consonant test.\n- **A** in position 3: Tests if A is correctly placed here (since positions 1/2 are invalid).\n- **N** in position 4: New consonant test.\n- **K** in position 5: New consonant test.\n\nThis guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently probes for A/T placement while testing 3 new letters. If A is green (✓) in position 3, we lock its location. If T is green (✓) in position 1, we lock the first letter. Feedback on H/N/K will further narrow possibilities.\n\n<thinking>\nTHANK is optimal as it:\n- Avoids all excluded letters (B,O,U,R,I,S,E)\n- Tests A in a new valid position (3) and T in a new valid position (1)\n- Uses high-frequency new letters (H, N, K)\n- Maximizes information gain for the next move\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>THANK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: THANK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(x) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but not in position 2 (yellow -)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ABOUT
- A: present but not in position 1 (yellow -)
- B: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- U: absent (x)
- T: present but not in position 5 (yellow -)

Guess 3: THANK
- T: correct in position 1 (green ✓)
- H: absent (x)
- A: correct in position 3 (green ✓)
- N: correct in position 4 (green ✓)
- K: absent (x)

From Guess 3, we know:
- The first letter is T (green)
- The third letter is A (green)
- The fourth letter is N (green)
- H is absent (so H not in the secret word)
- K is absent (so K not in the secret word)

Also, from previous guesses:
- The secret word has A, and we know it's not in position 1 or 2 (from previous feedback). Now we know it is in position 3 (green).
- The secret word has T, and we know it's not in position 5 (from ABOUT). Now we know it's in position 1 (green).
- We confirmed that N is in position 4 (green).

The known positions:
Position 1: T
Position 3: A
Position 4: N

We don't know position 2 and position 5.

We also have more absent letters: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K.

Additionally, from Guess 3, N is in the word and we have it in position 4, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere? However, in THANK, we only used one N and it was in position 4. But the secret word might have another N? We don't know. But we don't have any feedback suggesting it.

Summary of constraints:

- Known placements: 
  - Position 1: T
  - Position 3: A
  - Position 4: N

- Absent letters: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K

- Available letters: All letters except the excluded ones. Common ones: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

- The word must be 5 letters: T _ A N _ 

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with T
- Third letter A
- Fourth letter N
- First blank (position 2) can be any letter except the absent ones
- Last blank (position 5) can be any letter except the absent ones
- And the word must be valid.

Also, note: the letter in position 2 and position 5 must be among the available letters?

Possible words:

We need to fill positions 2 and 5. Since we know T, A, N are fixed, we just need two letters.

Possible letter combinations:

Position 2: could be? Common letters: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Position 5: similarly.

We should avoid the absent letters.

So let's think of English words: T?AN?

Examples:
- ""TWANG"": But W and G? But check: T, W, A, N, G -> absent letters? W: not absent? G: not absent? But wait: look at excluded: R,I,S,E,B,O,U,H,K are absent. So W and G are allowed? Yes.

  But in ""TWANG"": 
    Position 1: T (correct)
    Position 2: W (new)
    Position 3: A (correct)
    Position 4: N (correct)
    Position 5: G (new)

  And it avoids the excluded letters? Yes.

- ""TYRAN"" -> but Y and R? R is absent? So invalid? Because R is excluded.

- ""TRAIN"" -> T, R, A, I, N -> but R and I absent? Invalid.

- ""PLAIN"" -> but doesn't start with T.

Focus on T?AN?:

Other possibilities:
- ""THANE""? -> but H: we know H is absent? And we have THANK feedback: H was absent? So ""THANE"" uses H -> invalid? Because H is excluded.

- ""TRANS"" -> R and S excluded? Invalid.

- ""DEAN"" -> not starting with T.

- ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y? -> wait, in TANGY: position 1: T, position 2: A? But we know A is in position 3? And we cannot have A in position 2? Wait, but in the word ""TANGY"", A is in position 2? That would be invalid? Because we know A is not in position 2? Actually, in the secret word, we know A is in position 3? So even if we tried, it would be wrong.

But we are forming a word? We have the structure T _ A N _?

So position 2: first blank? position 5: second blank.

So ""TANGY"" doesn't fit: T A N G Y -> position 3 is N? Not A? The pattern requires position 3 to be A? So:

Position 1: T
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: ?

So ""T A N G Y"" would be T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> but that's not T?AN? because position 3 is N? Not A? So we need position 3 to be A and position 4 to be N? So the word pattern must be T ? A N ?

So:

Possible words:
- TWANG: T, W, A, N, G -> ? But position 5 is G? So the word ends with G? So ""TWANG"" is T, W, A, N, G -> yes.

- ""TWANK"": is that a word? Not really? Twank might be slang? But not standard? Avoid.

- ""CLANG"" -> doesn't start with T.

- ""FLANG"" -> not a word.

- ""TWARN"" -> not a word.

- ""TWAN"": too short.

Other words: 
- ""TRANT"" -> but R absent? And T repeated? But we don't know? But R excluded? So invalid.

- ""TYANS"" -> not a word? And S excluded.

- ""DWAIN"" -> D? But D is available? But not starting with T? 

What about ""DWINE"" -> not.

Back to TWANG? Is ""twang"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a sharp vibrating sound.

Alternatively: ""SWANG"" -> but S excluded? Cannot use S.

""PLANG"" -> not a word? 

""BLANG"" -> not? 

""GLAND"" -> G,L,A,N,D -> but G,L,A,N,D: but starts with G? Not T? 

Perhaps: 
  ""TYNDE"" -> not common? 

  ""TALON"" -> T,A,L,O,N -> but O excluded? And A is in position 2? We cannot have A in position 2? And also, position 3 must be A? In TALON: position 3 is L? So doesn't have A in position 3? 

Try words that match T?A N?:

Examples:
- TWANG (as above)
- OR ""TAMAN"" -> T,A,M,A,N -> but A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is only in position 3? And also, it has two A's? But we don't know? But if we put A in position 2, it would be incorrect? And we would get a yellow or gray? But we are just guessing? We don't want to.

But the pattern allows it? But we are constrained by the known A position? We know A is in position 3? So we cannot put A in position 2? So the letter in position 2 cannot be A? 

Similarly, position 5: can be A? It could be? But we have no indication? 

In TWANG, there is no extra A? 

Another word: ""TPANG"" -> not a word? 

""DWANG"" -> not common? 

""DYANG"" -> no? 

Perhaps: ""CRANE"" but doesn't start with T? 

Another common word: ""TARAN"" -> T,A,R,A,N -> R excluded?
  T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? and R excluded? invalid.

What about ""TAWNY""? -> T, A, W, N, Y -> position 2: A? We cannot put A in position 2? And also, position 3: W? Not A? 

We need position 3 to be A? 

So let me search for T?AN? words:

- TWANG: as we have.
- BRAND: but not? Starts with B? B excluded? 

Perhaps: ""TFANG"" -> not a word.

Less common: ""TEGAN"" -> T, E, G, A, N -> E excluded? 

""TOMAN"" -> O excluded? 

""TUMAN"" -> U excluded? 

""TYFAN"" -> not a word? 

G: ""TIGAN"" -> I excluded? 

D: ""TELAN"" -> E excluded? 

But TWANG seems the most common? 

Y: ""TYNAN""? Is that a name? Not typically? 

P: ""TAPAN"" -> T,A,P,A,N -> A in position 2? Not allowed? And P? But A in 2? 

C: ""TACAN"" -> T, A, C, A, N -> again A in 2? 

M: ""TAMAN"" -> A in 2? 

But we cannot use A in position 2? So position 2 must not be A? 

Therefore, we have TWANG: T, W, A, N, G -> avoids A in position 2? Position 2 is W? 

Yes.

Are there others? 

""TWYND"" -> not a word? 

So TWANG is good? 

But note: we haven't tested W and G? But that's fine? 

Also, we can think: maybe ""CLAMP"" but doesn't fit.

What about ""DWANG""? Meaning a timber strut? But it's a word? 

""DWANG"": D, W, A, N, G -> but doesn't start with T? 

We need T.

Therefore, I think TWANG is a good guess? 

But we can also consider the frequency? But since we have three correct letters, we want to solve quickly? 

But we have to guess a word? 

But note: in TWANG, the positions are:
1: T (green) -> correct?
2: W (new) -> might be correct or not?
3: A (green) -> correct?
4: N (green) -> correct?
5: G (new) -> might be correct or not?

But we know T, A, N are fixed? So we only need position 2 and 5?

Therefore, if TWANG is the secret word? It fits.

But are there other possibilities? 

For example, maybe T R A N D? But R excluded? 

T F A N D? Not a word? 

T G A N G? But G repeated? 

But we don't know? 

The word might be TWANG? 

But we have no reason to believe that? 

We can make a guess that tests common letters for positions 2 and 5? 

But since we have only one word that satisfies? 

Maybe ""TWANK"" is not valid? 

Another word: ""TRANT"" -> R excluded? 

""TWIN"" -> too short? 

So I think TWANG is acceptable? 

But wait: what about ""DWARF"" -> no? 

""WANG"" -> not starting with T? 

So let me confirm: the secret word must be T?AN? 

And we have TWANG? 

And it has W and G? Both new? And not excluded? 

So we can guess TWANG.

But if the secret word is ""TWANG"", we win? 

But what if it's not? 

We have not ruled out other words? 

For example: ""TYZAN"" -> not? 

""TZARINA"" -> too long? 

So I think TWANG is the most common? 

Another word: ""SWANP"" -> S excluded? 

Therefore, we'll guess TWANG.

### Feedback Interpretation:
From previous guesses:
- **RAISE**: A present (wrong position in slot 2); R, I, S, E absent.
- **ABOUT**: A present (wrong position in slot 1); T present (wrong position in slot 5); B, O, U absent.
- **THANK**: 
  - T correct (✓) in position 1.
  - H absent (x).
  - A correct (✓) in position 3.
  - N correct (✓) in position 4.
  - K absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed Letters**:
   - Position 1: **T** (must be T).
   - Position 3: **A** (must be A).
   - Position 4: **N** (must be N).
2. **Absent Letters**: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K (excluded from word).
3. **Unknown Positions**:
   - Position 2: Unknown letter (not R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K).
   - Position 5: Unknown letter (not R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K).
4. **Word Structure**: `T _ A N _`, where:
   - First blank (position 2) must be a letter not in the excluded list (e.g., C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y).
   - Second blank (position 5) must also be a letter not excluded.

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- **Goal**: Find a valid word matching `T _ A N _` that adheres to constraints.
- **Priority**: Test high-frequency letters for positions 2 and 5 (e.g., L, D, M, P, G, Y).
- **Optimal Guess**: **TWANG**
  - Fits structure: **T** (pos1), **W** (pos2), **A** (pos3), **N** (pos4), **G** (pos5).
  - Uses **W** and **G** (common letters not tested/excluded).
  - Valid English word (meaning: a sharp vibrating sound).
  - Tests key positions efficiently—if correct, solves the puzzle; if only partial, feedback reveals letter presence/position.

### Expected Outcomes:
- If **W** is correct in position 2, it will be green (✓); otherwise, feedback reveals if **W** is present (yellow -) or absent (x).
- If **G** is correct in position 5, it will be green (✓); otherwise, feedback reveals if **G** is present (yellow -) or absent (x).

<thinking>
TWANG is a strong guess as it adheres to all known constraints, tests plausible letters (W/G) for unsolved positions, and could solve the puzzle outright in this turn.
</thinking>

<guess>TWANG</guess>",TWANG,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but not in position 2 (yellow -)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ABOUT
- A: present but not in position 1 (yellow -)
- B: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- U: absent (x)
- T: present but not in position 5 (yellow -)

Guess 3: THANK
- T: correct in position 1 (green ✓)
- H: absent (x)
- A: correct in position 3 (green ✓)
- N: correct in position 4 (green ✓)
- K: absent (x)

From Guess 3, we know:
- The first letter is T (green)
- The third letter is A (green)
- The fourth letter is N (green)
- H is absent (so H not in the secret word)
- K is absent (so K not in the secret word)

Also, from previous guesses:
- The secret word has A, and we know it's not in position 1 or 2 (from previous feedback). Now we know it is in position 3 (green).
- The secret word has T, and we know it's not in position 5 (from ABOUT). Now we know it's in position 1 (green).
- We confirmed that N is in position 4 (green).

The known positions:
Position 1: T
Position 3: A
Position 4: N

We don't know position 2 and position 5.

We also have more absent letters: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K.

Additionally, from Guess 3, N is in the word and we have it in position 4, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere? However, in THANK, we only used one N and it was in position 4. But the secret word might have another N? We don't know. But we don't have any feedback suggesting it.

Summary of constraints:

- Known placements: 
  - Position 1: T
  - Position 3: A
  - Position 4: N

- Absent letters: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K

- Available letters: All letters except the excluded ones. Common ones: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

- The word must be 5 letters: T _ A N _ 

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with T
- Third letter A
- Fourth letter N
- First blank (position 2) can be any letter except the absent ones
- Last blank (position 5) can be any letter except the absent ones
- And the word must be valid.

Also, note: the letter in position 2 and position 5 must be among the available letters?

Possible words:

We need to fill positions 2 and 5. Since we know T, A, N are fixed, we just need two letters.

Possible letter combinations:

Position 2: could be? Common letters: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Position 5: similarly.

We should avoid the absent letters.

So let's think of English words: T?AN?

Examples:
- ""TWANG"": But W and G? But check: T, W, A, N, G -> absent letters? W: not absent? G: not absent? But wait: look at excluded: R,I,S,E,B,O,U,H,K are absent. So W and G are allowed? Yes.

  But in ""TWANG"": 
    Position 1: T (correct)
    Position 2: W (new)
    Position 3: A (correct)
    Position 4: N (correct)
    Position 5: G (new)

  And it avoids the excluded letters? Yes.

- ""TYRAN"" -> but Y and R? R is absent? So invalid? Because R is excluded.

- ""TRAIN"" -> T, R, A, I, N -> but R and I absent? Invalid.

- ""PLAIN"" -> but doesn't start with T.

Focus on T?AN?:

Other possibilities:
- ""THANE""? -> but H: we know H is absent? And we have THANK feedback: H was absent? So ""THANE"" uses H -> invalid? Because H is excluded.

- ""TRANS"" -> R and S excluded? Invalid.

- ""DEAN"" -> not starting with T.

- ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y? -> wait, in TANGY: position 1: T, position 2: A? But we know A is in position 3? And we cannot have A in position 2? Wait, but in the word ""TANGY"", A is in position 2? That would be invalid? Because we know A is not in position 2? Actually, in the secret word, we know A is in position 3? So even if we tried, it would be wrong.

But we are forming a word? We have the structure T _ A N _?

So position 2: first blank? position 5: second blank.

So ""TANGY"" doesn't fit: T A N G Y -> position 3 is N? Not A? The pattern requires position 3 to be A? So:

Position 1: T
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: ?

So ""T A N G Y"" would be T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> but that's not T?AN? because position 3 is N? Not A? So we need position 3 to be A and position 4 to be N? So the word pattern must be T ? A N ?

So:

Possible words:
- TWANG: T, W, A, N, G -> ? But position 5 is G? So the word ends with G? So ""TWANG"" is T, W, A, N, G -> yes.

- ""TWANK"": is that a word? Not really? Twank might be slang? But not standard? Avoid.

- ""CLANG"" -> doesn't start with T.

- ""FLANG"" -> not a word.

- ""TWARN"" -> not a word.

- ""TWAN"": too short.

Other words: 
- ""TRANT"" -> but R absent? And T repeated? But we don't know? But R excluded? So invalid.

- ""TYANS"" -> not a word? And S excluded.

- ""DWAIN"" -> D? But D is available? But not starting with T? 

What about ""DWINE"" -> not.

Back to TWANG? Is ""twang"" a valid English word? Yes, meaning a sharp vibrating sound.

Alternatively: ""SWANG"" -> but S excluded? Cannot use S.

""PLANG"" -> not a word? 

""BLANG"" -> not? 

""GLAND"" -> G,L,A,N,D -> but G,L,A,N,D: but starts with G? Not T? 

Perhaps: 
  ""TYNDE"" -> not common? 

  ""TALON"" -> T,A,L,O,N -> but O excluded? And A is in position 2? We cannot have A in position 2? And also, position 3 must be A? In TALON: position 3 is L? So doesn't have A in position 3? 

Try words that match T?A N?:

Examples:
- TWANG (as above)
- OR ""TAMAN"" -> T,A,M,A,N -> but A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is only in position 3? And also, it has two A's? But we don't know? But if we put A in position 2, it would be incorrect? And we would get a yellow or gray? But we are just guessing? We don't want to.

But the pattern allows it? But we are constrained by the known A position? We know A is in position 3? So we cannot put A in position 2? So the letter in position 2 cannot be A? 

Similarly, position 5: can be A? It could be? But we have no indication? 

In TWANG, there is no extra A? 

Another word: ""TPANG"" -> not a word? 

""DWANG"" -> not common? 

""DYANG"" -> no? 

Perhaps: ""CRANE"" but doesn't start with T? 

Another common word: ""TARAN"" -> T,A,R,A,N -> R excluded?
  T(1), A(2) -> A in 2? and R excluded? invalid.

What about ""TAWNY""? -> T, A, W, N, Y -> position 2: A? We cannot put A in position 2? And also, position 3: W? Not A? 

We need position 3 to be A? 

So let me search for T?AN? words:

- TWANG: as we have.
- BRAND: but not? Starts with B? B excluded? 

Perhaps: ""TFANG"" -> not a word.

Less common: ""TEGAN"" -> T, E, G, A, N -> E excluded? 

""TOMAN"" -> O excluded? 

""TUMAN"" -> U excluded? 

""TYFAN"" -> not a word? 

G: ""TIGAN"" -> I excluded? 

D: ""TELAN"" -> E excluded? 

But TWANG seems the most common? 

Y: ""TYNAN""? Is that a name? Not typically? 

P: ""TAPAN"" -> T,A,P,A,N -> A in position 2? Not allowed? And P? But A in 2? 

C: ""TACAN"" -> T, A, C, A, N -> again A in 2? 

M: ""TAMAN"" -> A in 2? 

But we cannot use A in position 2? So position 2 must not be A? 

Therefore, we have TWANG: T, W, A, N, G -> avoids A in position 2? Position 2 is W? 

Yes.

Are there others? 

""TWYND"" -> not a word? 

So TWANG is good? 

But note: we haven't tested W and G? But that's fine? 

Also, we can think: maybe ""CLAMP"" but doesn't fit.

What about ""DWANG""? Meaning a timber strut? But it's a word? 

""DWANG"": D, W, A, N, G -> but doesn't start with T? 

We need T.

Therefore, I think TWANG is a good guess? 

But we can also consider the frequency? But since we have three correct letters, we want to solve quickly? 

But we have to guess a word? 

But note: in TWANG, the positions are:
1: T (green) -> correct?
2: W (new) -> might be correct or not?
3: A (green) -> correct?
4: N (green) -> correct?
5: G (new) -> might be correct or not?

But we know T, A, N are fixed? So we only need position 2 and 5?

Therefore, if TWANG is the secret word? It fits.

But are there other possibilities? 

For example, maybe T R A N D? But R excluded? 

T F A N D? Not a word? 

T G A N G? But G repeated? 

But we don't know? 

The word might be TWANG? 

But we have no reason to believe that? 

We can make a guess that tests common letters for positions 2 and 5? 

But since we have only one word that satisfies? 

Maybe ""TWANK"" is not valid? 

Another word: ""TRANT"" -> R excluded? 

""TWIN"" -> too short? 

So I think TWANG is acceptable? 

But wait: what about ""DWARF"" -> no? 

""WANG"" -> not starting with T? 

So let me confirm: the secret word must be T?AN? 

And we have TWANG? 

And it has W and G? Both new? And not excluded? 

So we can guess TWANG.

But if the secret word is ""TWANG"", we win? 

But what if it's not? 

We have not ruled out other words? 

For example: ""TYZAN"" -> not? 

""TZARINA"" -> too long? 

So I think TWANG is the most common? 

Another word: ""SWANP"" -> S excluded? 

Therefore, we'll guess TWANG.### Feedback Interpretation:
From previous guesses:
- **RAISE**: A present (wrong position in slot 2); R, I, S, E absent.
- **ABOUT**: A present (wrong position in slot 1); T present (wrong position in slot 5); B, O, U absent.
- **THANK**: 
  - T correct (✓) in position 1.
  - H absent (x).
  - A correct (✓) in position 3.
  - N correct (✓) in position 4.
  - K absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed Letters**:
   - Position 1: **T** (must be T).
   - Position 3: **A** (must be A).
   - Position 4: **N** (must be N).
2. **Absent Letters**: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K (excluded from word).
3. **Unknown Positions**:
   - Position 2: Unknown letter (not R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K).
   - Position 5: Unknown letter (not R, I, S, E, B, O, U, H, K).
4. **Word Structure**: `T _ A N _`, where:
   - First blank (position 2) must be a letter not in the excluded list (e.g., C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y).
   - Second blank (position 5) must also be a letter not excluded.

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- **Goal**: Find a valid word matching `T _ A N _` that adheres to constraints.
- **Priority**: Test high-frequency letters for positions 2 and 5 (e.g., L, D, M, P, G, Y).
- **Optimal Guess**: **TWANG**
  - Fits structure: **T** (pos1), **W** (pos2), **A** (pos3), **N** (pos4), **G** (pos5).
  - Uses **W** and **G** (common letters not tested/excluded).
  - Valid English word (meaning: a sharp vibrating sound).
  - Tests key positions efficiently—if correct, solves the puzzle; if only partial, feedback reveals letter presence/position.

### Expected Outcomes:
- If **W** is correct in position 2, it will be green (✓); otherwise, feedback reveals if **W** is present (yellow -) or absent (x).
- If **G** is correct in position 5, it will be green (✓); otherwise, feedback reveals if **G** is present (yellow -) or absent (x).

<thinking>
TWANG is a strong guess as it adheres to all known constraints, tests plausible letters (W/G) for unsolved positions, and could solve the puzzle outright in this turn.
