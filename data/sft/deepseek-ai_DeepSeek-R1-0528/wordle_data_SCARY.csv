We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (✓) meaning A is correct and in the right position (so the third letter is A).
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The secret word also contains C and R, but not in the first or second positions respectively (since C was in position 1 and R in position 2 of ""crane"", but they were marked as wrong position). This means C cannot be in the first position and R cannot be in the second position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that C is in the word but not in position 1, and R is in the word but not in position 2. Since A is fixed at position 3, that leaves positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Actually, the positions that are wrong could be elsewhere. Specifically:
- C is in the word, but not at position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"" meaning wrong position). So C must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5? But wait, position 2 was R and position 3 is A, so C could be in position 2, 4, or 5? However, we must be cautious because the word has 5 letters.

Also note that the secret word does not contain N or E.

So the secret word pattern so far:
Position 1: unknown, but not C? Actually, it could be C? No, because if position 1 were C, then we would have gotten a ✓ for C. We got (-) which means C is present but position 1 is incorrect for it. Since C is in the word, but not at position 1.

Similarly, R is in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, A is fixed at position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3: A
- The word contains C and R, but not N, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess that includes C and R (since they are in the word) and excludes N and E. It must also place A in the third position.

We want to try to find positions for C and R, and also discover other letters.

Let me consider possible placements for C and R:
- Since position 1 cannot be C (from feedback), and position 3 is A, so C can be only in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, R was guessed at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning R is not at position 2. So R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait: positions: 1, 4, 5? Actually, position 3 is taken by A.

The positions available are:
1: open, but we know R can be here? And C cannot be here? Let's recap:

- Position 1: must not have C (because if it did, we would have gotten ✓ for C? Actually no, because we got (-) for C meaning it's present but not here. So position 1 can have R? Or any letter except C? Actually, no, position 1 can be any letter except C? Actually, no! Position 1 could be another letter. We don't know what letter is allowed at position 1, only that it isn't C (but C is in the word elsewhere).

Similarly, for position 2: it must not have R (since R was at position 2 and got ""-""), but R is in the word. So position 2 can be any letter except R? Actually, no: any letter can be at position 2, just that R is not there.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us what letters are at other positions. We only know that R is in the word but not at position 2.

Therefore, the possibilities for C: positions 2, 4, 5? Position 2: yes, position 4, position 5. But note that position 3 is A, so that's fixed.

Similarly for R: positions 1, 4, 5? Because position 2 is out (already marked) and position 3 is A.

So R can be at 1, 4, or 5.

Now, when we make the second guess:
- It must be a 5-letter word with A in the third position.
- It must include C and R (because we know they are in the word).
- It must not include N or E (because they are not in the word).

Also, we want to test possible positions for C and R.

Let me think of words with A in the third position, and containing C and R.

But note: we have constraints on where C and R cannot be.

Our goal is to deduce the positions.

Possible words? Let me list a few:

- We know position 3: A. So pattern: _ _ A _ _

We need to include C and R.

We should avoid N and E.

Let me think: starting with R? Because R can be at position 1? Or C can be at position 2?

But note: C cannot be at position 1? Correct? Because it was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is not at position 1. So position 1 must be a letter different from C? And C must be in the word elsewhere. Similarly for R not at position 2.

So, one idea: try R at position 1? Then C elsewhere? Or C at position 4, etc.

Let me try to find words that match the pattern:

For example: 
- TRACE? But we already guessed CRANE, so we cannot repeat? Actually, we can guess any word, but TRACE includes T, R, A, C, E. But E is not in the word? From feedback, E is absent. So TRACE has E? Yes, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot have words with N or E.

Another example: CARDS? But that has D, S? And R? Pattern: C A R ... wait, but we need A at position 3? CARDS has A at position 2? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

Words with ??A??.

And contain C and R, and no E or N.

Possible words:
- Let's consider words ending in C? Or containing C.
- For example: BROAD? Pattern: B R O A D -> letters: B,R,O,A,D. Third letter is O, not A? No.
  Position: 1:B, 2:R, 3:O, 4:A, 5:D? Not matching.

We need third position exactly A.

How about ""CRAWL""? 
- C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, W at 4, L at 5.
  But we have constraints:
  - C was at position 1 in ""crane"" and got (-) meaning two things: (1) C is in the word, but (2) position 1 is incorrect for C? So if we put C at position 1 again, we expect feedback for it? Actually, we are allowed to put C at position 1? But we already know position 1 is not C? So we shouldn't put C at position 1? Because it must be wrong? Yes.

Similarly, in ""CRAWL"", we have R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Because from feedback when R was at position 2 in ""crane"" it was shown as ""-"", meaning present but not at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be a mistake? We expect it to be wrong.

Therefore, if we guess ""CRAWL"", we put C at position 1 (which we know is wrong) and R at position 2 (which we know is wrong). So that's inefficient because we know that those positions for C and R are invalid.

Therefore, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.

So, acceptable positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5.
Acceptable positions for R: positions 1, 4, or 5.

Therefore, we can consider:
- Having R at position 1? Then C at position 4? Or C at position 2? But if we put C at position 2, is that allowed? Yes, because we have no feedback about position 2? Actually, no: position 2 in ""crane"" was R, but now we are considering putting C at position 2? That's fine because we don't have any feedback about position 2 having/not having C? Only that we know R is not at position 2.

Similarly, we can put R at position 4 or 5.

So, let me think of words with pattern ? ? A ? ? and including C and R:

Option 1: Place R at position 1? Then R _ A _ _ 
Words: e.g., ROAST? But that has O, S, T? And we need to include C? But ROAST doesn't have C? No.

We need C too.

Option 2: Place C at position 2? Like ? C A ? ? and must have R. And no N, E.

Words: SCARB? Not a word. 
Perhaps ""SCARE""? But S C A R E -> has E which is not allowed? And also E is not in the word, wait no: E is excluded? So words with E are bad? We must avoid letters N and E? No, don't know about others? But E is confirmed absent? So words with E are not valid? Actually, we can have words that contain any letters? But if we guess a word with E, we'll get x for E? But we already know E is absent? So it's wasteful? So it's better to choose words without E and without N? Yes, to maximize information? Because if we include new letters that might be present.

Actually, avoiding E and N is good because we know they are absent? So we can use other letters.

Back to placing R at position 1 and C at position, say, 5? Or 4.

Word: R _ A _ C? Example: ""REACT"" -> R E A C T? Has E? Not allowed? And E is absent.

""TRACT"" -> T R A C T? But R is at position 2? And we cannot have R at position 2? Wait: in TRACT, positions: T1, R2, A3, C4, T5? But position 2: R? That's the same position as in crane? But we know R is not at position 2? So if we guess R at position 2 again, we expect it to be wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Same with C at position 1? We avoid.

But TRACT has R at position 2? Which is a position we know is wrong for R? So if we guess TRACT, then:
Position 1: T, new letter? Could be anything? Position 2: R? We know it's wrong for R? And we get feedback? But we already know that R isn't at position 2? So we don't gain more? But we are forced to include R? So it's okay? It might show R as ""-"" again? That confirms it's still not at position 2? Alternatively, we might try to place R in a position we haven't tested? So that if we get a ✓ we know? 

So to maximize information, we should try R in a position we haven't tried yet? That is position 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, C should be in position 2, 4, or 5? Not position 1? Because we tried position 1? So avoid C at 1.

Therefore, let me list words that:
- Have A at position 3.
- Include R and C.
- Avoid E and N.
- Place R in one of {1,4,5}? And C in one of {2,4,5} (can be same position? But no duplicate letters? We don't know yet? Wait, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily? So we have to consider?
But in ""crane"" it had no duplicates? And the feedback didn't show any duplicates? So we don't know? 

Assuming for now, we avoid words with duplicate letters? But it's not required? To be safe.

But we can choose a word that uses new letters? Because we also want to test more letters.

So, perhaps: Place R at position 1? And C at position 4?

Word pattern: R _ A C _? And last letter? Not E, not N.

Possible words: ""TRACK"" -> T? But we have no T? Position: R at 1? But wait: pattern R? 1: R, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: C? 5: ? 
But ""TRACK"" has T at position 1? That's not R? No? ""TRACK"" is T,R,A,C,K -> positions T1,R2,A3,C4,K5? That doesn't fit? Because R is at 2? We want R at position 1? So ""R _ A C _""? Words: for example, ""REACH"" -> but E? Has E? ""R A C H E""? No? 

""RATCH"" -> not really common? Not English? 

What about ""GRACE"" -> but E? Has E?

""CRAMP"" -> C at 1? Which we want to avoid? Because position 1 is C? And we already tested position 1 for C? And it was wrong? So we don't want that? ""CRAMP"": C1,R2,A3,M4,P5? That has R at position 2? Which we don't want? 

We need a word that has R at position 1? And C? Then? ""RACED"" -> but E and N? No? But it has E? 

""RACER"" -> repeated R? and E? 

Perhaps ""CARAT"" -> C at position 1? Not allowed? And it has A at position 3? Pattern: C1, A2, R3? No: CARAT: C1, A2, R3? But position 3 is not A? We need position 3 to be A? In CARAT, position 3 is R? So third letter must be A? 

Another idea: Place R at position 4? And C at position 2? So pattern: ? C A R ? 

Words: SCARF? S C A R F? That has S and F? No E or N? It uses S and F? Which are new.

SCARF: positions: S1, C2, A3, R4, F5.

Now, let's see:
- C is at position 2? We haven't tested C at position 2? And R is at position 4? Not at position 2 which is bad? So that seems okay? 

Also, A at position 3? Correct? And no E or N? Good? 

But we must check: does the word SCARF exist? Yes? So it seems a valid guess.

With SCARF, we can test:
- S: new letter? We'll see if present?
- C: at position 2? Previously in crane, C was at position 1? So if now if C is at position 2? How will feedback work? Depending on where C actually is? 
- R: at position 4? Previously at position 2? Now position 4? 

If C is indeed at position 2? Then we get ✓? If C is elsewhere? Then we get ""-"" meaning R? So it can help narrow down.

Similarly, R: if it is at position 4? We get ✓? Else? 

But note: we also want to cover positions 1 and 5? We have S at position 1? F at position 5? They are unknown? So we test those too? 

Therefore, ""SCARF"" seems a reasonable guess.

Alternatively? ""CRWTH""? Not English? Difficult letters? 

Or ""TRACT""? But has R at position 2? Which we know is wrong? 

So I think SCARF is a good choice.

But note: the secret word has C in it? But not at position 1? And we are putting it at position 2? Well, maybe? 

So I'll go with ""SCARF"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as `-`).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as `-`).
- A is in the correct position (position 3, marked as `✓`).
- N and E are not in the word (marked as `x`).

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure A remains in position 3 (since it's fixed).
2. Include C and R (as they are in the word).
3. Avoid N and E (as they are absent).
4. Test C and R in positions we haven't ruled out:
   - C cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so I'll try it in position 2.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so I'll try it in position 4.
5. Introduce new letters to maximize information, avoiding repeating positions that were already incorrect.

A word that fits this is **""scarf""**:
- Positions: S (1), C (2), A (3), R (4), F (5).
- This tests:
  - S at position 1 (new letter).
  - C at position 2 (to see if correct or if C is elsewhere).
  - A at position 3 (confirmed).
  - R at position 4 (to see if correct or if R is elsewhere).
  - F at position 5 (new letter).

This guess efficiently uses the feedback and explores potential placements for C and R while introducing S and F as new letters.

<guess>scarf</guess>",scarf,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (✓) meaning A is correct and in the right position (so the third letter is A).
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The secret word also contains C and R, but not in the first or second positions respectively (since C was in position 1 and R in position 2 of ""crane"", but they were marked as wrong position). This means C cannot be in the first position and R cannot be in the second position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that C is in the word but not in position 1, and R is in the word but not in position 2. Since A is fixed at position 3, that leaves positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Similarly, R is in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, A is fixed at position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3: A
- The word contains C and R, but not N, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess that includes C and R (since they are in the word) and excludes N and E. It must also place A in the third position.

We want to try to find positions for C and R, and also discover other letters.

Let me consider possible placements for C and R:
- Since position 1 cannot be C (from feedback), and position 3 is A, so C can be only in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, R was guessed at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning R is not at position 2. So R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait: positions: 1, 4, 5? Actually, position 3 is taken by A.

The positions available are:
1: open, but we know R can be here? And C cannot be here? Let's recap:

- Position 1: must not have C (because if it did, we would have gotten ✓ for C? Actually no, because we got (-) for C meaning it's present but not here. So position 1 can have R? Or any letter except C? Actually, no, position 1 can be any letter except C? Actually, no! Position 1 could be another letter. We don't know what letter is allowed at position 1, only that it isn't C (but C is in the word elsewhere).

Similarly, for position 2: it must not have R (since R was at position 2 and got ""-""), but R is in the word. So position 2 can be any letter except R? Actually, no: any letter can be at position 2, just that R is not there.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us what letters are at other positions. We only know that R is in the word but not at position 2.

Therefore, the possibilities for C: positions 2, 4, 5? Position 2: yes, position 4, position 5. But note that position 3 is A, so that's fixed.

Similarly for R: positions 1, 4, 5? Because position 2 is out (already marked) and position 3 is A.

So R can be at 1, 4, or 5.

Now, when we make the second guess:
- It must be a 5-letter word with A in the third position.
- It must include C and R (because we know they are in the word).
- It must not include N or E (because they are not in the word).

Also, we want to test possible positions for C and R.

- TRACE? But we already guessed CRANE, so we cannot repeat? Actually, we can guess any word, but TRACE includes T, R, A, C, E. But E is not in the word? From feedback, E is absent. So TRACE has E? Yes, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot have words with N or E.

Another example: CARDS? But that has D, S? And R? Pattern: C A R ... wait, but we need A at position 3? CARDS has A at position 2? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

Words with ??A??.

And contain C and R, and no E or N.

Possible words:
- Let's consider words ending in C? Or containing C.
- For example: BROAD? Pattern: B R O A D -> letters: B,R,O,A,D. Third letter is O, not A? No.
  Position: 1:B, 2:R, 3:O, 4:A, 5:D? Not matching.

We need third position exactly A.

How about ""CRAWL""? 
- C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, W at 4, L at 5.
  But we have constraints:
  - C was at position 1 in ""crane"" and got (-) meaning two things: (1) C is in the word, but (2) position 1 is incorrect for C? So if we put C at position 1 again, we expect feedback for it? Actually, we are allowed to put C at position 1? But we already know position 1 is not C? So we shouldn't put C at position 1? Because it must be wrong? Yes.

Similarly, in ""CRAWL"", we have R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Because from feedback when R was at position 2 in ""crane"" it was shown as ""-"", meaning present but not at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be a mistake? We expect it to be wrong.

Therefore, if we guess ""CRAWL"", we put C at position 1 (which we know is wrong) and R at position 2 (which we know is wrong). So that's inefficient because we know that those positions for C and R are invalid.

Therefore, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.

So, acceptable positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5.
Acceptable positions for R: positions 1, 4, or 5.

Therefore, we can consider:
- Having R at position 1? Then C at position 4? Or C at position 2? But if we put C at position 2, is that allowed? Yes, because we have no feedback about position 2? Actually, no: position 2 in ""crane"" was R, but now we are considering putting C at position 2? That's fine because we don't have any feedback about position 2 having/not having C? Only that we know R is not at position 2.

Similarly, we can put R at position 4 or 5.

So, let me think of words with pattern ? ? A ? ? and including C and R:

Option 1: Place R at position 1? Then R _ A _ _ 
Words: e.g., ROAST? But that has O, S, T? And we need to include C? But ROAST doesn't have C? No.

We need C too.

Option 2: Place C at position 2? Like ? C A ? ? and must have R. And no N, E.

Words: SCARB? Not a word. 
Perhaps ""SCARE""? But S C A R E -> has E which is not allowed? And also E is not in the word, wait no: E is excluded? So words with E are bad? We must avoid letters N and E? No, don't know about others? But E is confirmed absent? So words with E are not valid? Actually, we can have words that contain any letters? But if we guess a word with E, we'll get x for E? But we already know E is absent? So it's wasteful? So it's better to choose words without E and without N? Yes, to maximize information? Because if we include new letters that might be present.

Actually, avoiding E and N is good because we know they are absent? So we can use other letters.

Back to placing R at position 1 and C at position, say, 5? Or 4.

Word: R _ A _ C? Example: ""REACT"" -> R E A C T? Has E? Not allowed? And E is absent.

""TRACT"" -> T R A C T? But R is at position 2? And we cannot have R at position 2? Wait: in TRACT, positions: T1, R2, A3, C4, T5? But position 2: R? That's the same position as in crane? But we know R is not at position 2? So if we guess R at position 2 again, we expect it to be wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Same with C at position 1? We avoid.

But TRACT has R at position 2? Which is a position we know is wrong for R? So if we guess TRACT, then:
Position 1: T, new letter? Could be anything? Position 2: R? We know it's wrong for R? And we get feedback? But we already know that R isn't at position 2? So we don't gain more? But we are forced to include R? So it's okay? It might show R as ""-"" again? That confirms it's still not at position 2? Alternatively, we might try to place R in a position we haven't tested? So that if we get a ✓ we know? 

So to maximize information, we should try R in a position we haven't tried yet? That is position 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, C should be in position 2, 4, or 5? Not position 1? Because we tried position 1? So avoid C at 1.

Therefore, let me list words that:
- Have A at position 3.
- Include R and C.
- Avoid E and N.
- Place R in one of {1,4,5}? And C in one of {2,4,5} (can be same position? But no duplicate letters? We don't know yet? Wait, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily? So we have to consider?
But in ""crane"" it had no duplicates? And the feedback didn't show any duplicates? So we don't know? 

Assuming for now, we avoid words with duplicate letters? But it's not required? To be safe.

But we can choose a word that uses new letters? Because we also want to test more letters.

So, perhaps: Place R at position 1? And C at position 4?

Word pattern: R _ A C _? And last letter? Not E, not N.

Possible words: ""TRACK"" -> T? But we have no T? Position: R at 1? But wait: pattern R? 1: R, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: C? 5: ? 
But ""TRACK"" has T at position 1? That's not R? No? ""TRACK"" is T,R,A,C,K -> positions T1,R2,A3,C4,K5? That doesn't fit? Because R is at 2? We want R at position 1? So ""R _ A C _""? Words: for example, ""REACH"" -> but E? Has E? ""R A C H E""? No? 

""RATCH"" -> not really common? Not English? 

What about ""GRACE"" -> but E? Has E?

""CRAMP"" -> C at 1? Which we want to avoid? Because position 1 is C? And we already tested position 1 for C? And it was wrong? So we don't want that? ""CRAMP"": C1,R2,A3,M4,P5? That has R at position 2? Which we don't want? 

We need a word that has R at position 1? And C? Then? ""RACED"" -> but E and N? No? But it has E? 

""RACER"" -> repeated R? and E? 

Perhaps ""CARAT"" -> C at position 1? Not allowed? And it has A at position 3? Pattern: C1, A2, R3? No: CARAT: C1, A2, R3? But position 3 is not A? We need position 3 to be A? In CARAT, position 3 is R? So third letter must be A? 

Another idea: Place R at position 4? And C at position 2? So pattern: ? C A R ? 

Words: SCARF? S C A R F? That has S and F? No E or N? It uses S and F? Which are new.

SCARF: positions: S1, C2, A3, R4, F5.

Now, let's see:
- C is at position 2? We haven't tested C at position 2? And R is at position 4? Not at position 2 which is bad? So that seems okay? 

Also, A at position 3? Correct? And no E or N? Good? 

But we must check: does the word SCARF exist? Yes? So it seems a valid guess.

With SCARF, we can test:
- S: new letter? We'll see if present?
- C: at position 2? Previously in crane, C was at position 1? So if now if C is at position 2? How will feedback work? Depending on where C actually is? 
- R: at position 4? Previously at position 2? Now position 4? 

If C is indeed at position 2? Then we get ✓? If C is elsewhere? Then we get ""-"" meaning R? So it can help narrow down.

Similarly, R: if it is at position 4? We get ✓? Else? 

But note: we also want to cover positions 1 and 5? We have S at position 1? F at position 5? They are unknown? So we test those too? 

Therefore, ""SCARF"" seems a reasonable guess.

Alternatively? ""CRWTH""? Not English? Difficult letters? 

Or ""TRACT""? But has R at position 2? Which we know is wrong? 

So I think SCARF is a good choice.

But note: the secret word has C in it? But not at position 1? And we are putting it at position 2? Well, maybe? 

So I'll go with ""SCARF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as `-`).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as `-`).
- A is in the correct position (position 3, marked as `✓`).
- N and E are not in the word (marked as `x`).

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure A remains in position 3 (since it's fixed).
2. Include C and R (as they are in the word).
3. Avoid N and E (as they are absent).
4. Test C and R in positions we haven't ruled out:
   - C cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so I'll try it in position 2.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so I'll try it in position 4.
5. Introduce new letters to maximize information, avoiding repeating positions that were already incorrect.

A word that fits this is **""scarf""**:
- Positions: S (1), C (2), A (3), R (4), F (5).
- This tests:
  - S at position 1 (new letter).
  - C at position 2 (to see if correct or if C is elsewhere).
  - A at position 3 (confirmed).
  - R at position 4 (to see if correct or if R is elsewhere).
  - F at position 5 (new letter).

This guess efficiently uses the feedback and explores potential placements for C and R while introducing S and F as new letters.",Guess 2: scarf -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) F(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SCARY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (✓) meaning A is correct and in the right position (so the third letter is A).
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The secret word also contains C and R, but not in the first or second positions respectively (since C was in position 1 and R in position 2 of ""crane"", but they were marked as wrong position). This means C cannot be in the first position and R cannot be in the second position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that C is in the word but not in position 1, and R is in the word but not in position 2. Since A is fixed at position 3, that leaves positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Actually, the positions that are wrong could be elsewhere. Specifically:
- C is in the word, but not at position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"" meaning wrong position). So C must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5? But wait, position 2 was R and position 3 is A, so C could be in position 2, 4, or 5? However, we must be cautious because the word has 5 letters.

Also note that the secret word does not contain N or E.

So the secret word pattern so far:
Position 1: unknown, but not C? Actually, it could be C? No, because if position 1 were C, then we would have gotten a ✓ for C. We got (-) which means C is present but position 1 is incorrect for it. Since C is in the word, but not at position 1.

Similarly, R is in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, A is fixed at position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3: A
- The word contains C and R, but not N, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess that includes C and R (since they are in the word) and excludes N and E. It must also place A in the third position.

We want to try to find positions for C and R, and also discover other letters.

Let me consider possible placements for C and R:
- Since position 1 cannot be C (from feedback), and position 3 is A, so C can be only in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, R was guessed at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning R is not at position 2. So R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait: positions: 1, 4, 5? Actually, position 3 is taken by A.

The positions available are:
1: open, but we know R can be here? And C cannot be here? Let's recap:

- Position 1: must not have C (because if it did, we would have gotten ✓ for C? Actually no, because we got (-) for C meaning it's present but not here. So position 1 can have R? Or any letter except C? Actually, no, position 1 can be any letter except C? Actually, no! Position 1 could be another letter. We don't know what letter is allowed at position 1, only that it isn't C (but C is in the word elsewhere).

Similarly, for position 2: it must not have R (since R was at position 2 and got ""-""), but R is in the word. So position 2 can be any letter except R? Actually, no: any letter can be at position 2, just that R is not there.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us what letters are at other positions. We only know that R is in the word but not at position 2.

Therefore, the possibilities for C: positions 2, 4, 5? Position 2: yes, position 4, position 5. But note that position 3 is A, so that's fixed.

Similarly for R: positions 1, 4, 5? Because position 2 is out (already marked) and position 3 is A.

So R can be at 1, 4, or 5.

Now, when we make the second guess:
- It must be a 5-letter word with A in the third position.
- It must include C and R (because we know they are in the word).
- It must not include N or E (because they are not in the word).

Also, we want to test possible positions for C and R.

Let me think of words with A in the third position, and containing C and R.

But note: we have constraints on where C and R cannot be.

Our goal is to deduce the positions.

Possible words? Let me list a few:

- We know position 3: A. So pattern: _ _ A _ _

We need to include C and R.

We should avoid N and E.

Let me think: starting with R? Because R can be at position 1? Or C can be at position 2?

But note: C cannot be at position 1? Correct? Because it was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is not at position 1. So position 1 must be a letter different from C? And C must be in the word elsewhere. Similarly for R not at position 2.

So, one idea: try R at position 1? Then C elsewhere? Or C at position 4, etc.

Let me try to find words that match the pattern:

For example: 
- TRACE? But we already guessed CRANE, so we cannot repeat? Actually, we can guess any word, but TRACE includes T, R, A, C, E. But E is not in the word? From feedback, E is absent. So TRACE has E? Yes, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot have words with N or E.

Another example: CARDS? But that has D, S? And R? Pattern: C A R ... wait, but we need A at position 3? CARDS has A at position 2? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

Words with ??A??.

And contain C and R, and no E or N.

Possible words:
- Let's consider words ending in C? Or containing C.
- For example: BROAD? Pattern: B R O A D -> letters: B,R,O,A,D. Third letter is O, not A? No.
  Position: 1:B, 2:R, 3:O, 4:A, 5:D? Not matching.

We need third position exactly A.

How about ""CRAWL""? 
- C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, W at 4, L at 5.
  But we have constraints:
  - C was at position 1 in ""crane"" and got (-) meaning two things: (1) C is in the word, but (2) position 1 is incorrect for C? So if we put C at position 1 again, we expect feedback for it? Actually, we are allowed to put C at position 1? But we already know position 1 is not C? So we shouldn't put C at position 1? Because it must be wrong? Yes.

Similarly, in ""CRAWL"", we have R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Because from feedback when R was at position 2 in ""crane"" it was shown as ""-"", meaning present but not at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be a mistake? We expect it to be wrong.

Therefore, if we guess ""CRAWL"", we put C at position 1 (which we know is wrong) and R at position 2 (which we know is wrong). So that's inefficient because we know that those positions for C and R are invalid.

Therefore, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.

So, acceptable positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5.
Acceptable positions for R: positions 1, 4, or 5.

Therefore, we can consider:
- Having R at position 1? Then C at position 4? Or C at position 2? But if we put C at position 2, is that allowed? Yes, because we have no feedback about position 2? Actually, no: position 2 in ""crane"" was R, but now we are considering putting C at position 2? That's fine because we don't have any feedback about position 2 having/not having C? Only that we know R is not at position 2.

Similarly, we can put R at position 4 or 5.

So, let me think of words with pattern ? ? A ? ? and including C and R:

Option 1: Place R at position 1? Then R _ A _ _ 
Words: e.g., ROAST? But that has O, S, T? And we need to include C? But ROAST doesn't have C? No.

We need C too.

Option 2: Place C at position 2? Like ? C A ? ? and must have R. And no N, E.

Words: SCARB? Not a word. 
Perhaps ""SCARE""? But S C A R E -> has E which is not allowed? And also E is not in the word, wait no: E is excluded? So words with E are bad? We must avoid letters N and E? No, don't know about others? But E is confirmed absent? So words with E are not valid? Actually, we can have words that contain any letters? But if we guess a word with E, we'll get x for E? But we already know E is absent? So it's wasteful? So it's better to choose words without E and without N? Yes, to maximize information? Because if we include new letters that might be present.

Actually, avoiding E and N is good because we know they are absent? So we can use other letters.

Back to placing R at position 1 and C at position, say, 5? Or 4.

Word: R _ A _ C? Example: ""REACT"" -> R E A C T? Has E? Not allowed? And E is absent.

""TRACT"" -> T R A C T? But R is at position 2? And we cannot have R at position 2? Wait: in TRACT, positions: T1, R2, A3, C4, T5? But position 2: R? That's the same position as in crane? But we know R is not at position 2? So if we guess R at position 2 again, we expect it to be wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Same with C at position 1? We avoid.

But TRACT has R at position 2? Which is a position we know is wrong for R? So if we guess TRACT, then:
Position 1: T, new letter? Could be anything? Position 2: R? We know it's wrong for R? And we get feedback? But we already know that R isn't at position 2? So we don't gain more? But we are forced to include R? So it's okay? It might show R as ""-"" again? That confirms it's still not at position 2? Alternatively, we might try to place R in a position we haven't tested? So that if we get a ✓ we know? 

So to maximize information, we should try R in a position we haven't tried yet? That is position 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, C should be in position 2, 4, or 5? Not position 1? Because we tried position 1? So avoid C at 1.

Therefore, let me list words that:
- Have A at position 3.
- Include R and C.
- Avoid E and N.
- Place R in one of {1,4,5}? And C in one of {2,4,5} (can be same position? But no duplicate letters? We don't know yet? Wait, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily? So we have to consider?
But in ""crane"" it had no duplicates? And the feedback didn't show any duplicates? So we don't know? 

Assuming for now, we avoid words with duplicate letters? But it's not required? To be safe.

But we can choose a word that uses new letters? Because we also want to test more letters.

So, perhaps: Place R at position 1? And C at position 4?

Word pattern: R _ A C _? And last letter? Not E, not N.

Possible words: ""TRACK"" -> T? But we have no T? Position: R at 1? But wait: pattern R? 1: R, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: C? 5: ? 
But ""TRACK"" has T at position 1? That's not R? No? ""TRACK"" is T,R,A,C,K -> positions T1,R2,A3,C4,K5? That doesn't fit? Because R is at 2? We want R at position 1? So ""R _ A C _""? Words: for example, ""REACH"" -> but E? Has E? ""R A C H E""? No? 

""RATCH"" -> not really common? Not English? 

What about ""GRACE"" -> but E? Has E?

""CRAMP"" -> C at 1? Which we want to avoid? Because position 1 is C? And we already tested position 1 for C? And it was wrong? So we don't want that? ""CRAMP"": C1,R2,A3,M4,P5? That has R at position 2? Which we don't want? 

We need a word that has R at position 1? And C? Then? ""RACED"" -> but E and N? No? But it has E? 

""RACER"" -> repeated R? and E? 

Perhaps ""CARAT"" -> C at position 1? Not allowed? And it has A at position 3? Pattern: C1, A2, R3? No: CARAT: C1, A2, R3? But position 3 is not A? We need position 3 to be A? In CARAT, position 3 is R? So third letter must be A? 

Another idea: Place R at position 4? And C at position 2? So pattern: ? C A R ? 

Words: SCARF? S C A R F? That has S and F? No E or N? It uses S and F? Which are new.

SCARF: positions: S1, C2, A3, R4, F5.

Now, let's see:
- C is at position 2? We haven't tested C at position 2? And R is at position 4? Not at position 2 which is bad? So that seems okay? 

Also, A at position 3? Correct? And no E or N? Good? 

But we must check: does the word SCARF exist? Yes? So it seems a valid guess.

With SCARF, we can test:
- S: new letter? We'll see if present?
- C: at position 2? Previously in crane, C was at position 1? So if now if C is at position 2? How will feedback work? Depending on where C actually is? 
- R: at position 4? Previously at position 2? Now position 4? 

If C is indeed at position 2? Then we get ✓? If C is elsewhere? Then we get ""-"" meaning R? So it can help narrow down.

Similarly, R: if it is at position 4? We get ✓? Else? 

But note: we also want to cover positions 1 and 5? We have S at position 1? F at position 5? They are unknown? So we test those too? 

Therefore, ""SCARF"" seems a reasonable guess.

Alternatively? ""CRWTH""? Not English? Difficult letters? 

Or ""TRACT""? But has R at position 2? Which we know is wrong? 

So I think SCARF is a good choice.

But note: the secret word has C in it? But not at position 1? And we are putting it at position 2? Well, maybe? 

So I'll go with ""SCARF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as `-`).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as `-`).
- A is in the correct position (position 3, marked as `✓`).
- N and E are not in the word (marked as `x`).

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure A remains in position 3 (since it's fixed).
2. Include C and R (as they are in the word).
3. Avoid N and E (as they are absent).
4. Test C and R in positions we haven't ruled out:
   - C cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so I'll try it in position 2.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so I'll try it in position 4.
5. Introduce new letters to maximize information, avoiding repeating positions that were already incorrect.

A word that fits this is **""scarf""**:
- Positions: S (1), C (2), A (3), R (4), F (5).
- This tests:
  - S at position 1 (new letter).
  - C at position 2 (to see if correct or if C is elsewhere).
  - A at position 3 (confirmed).
  - R at position 4 (to see if correct or if R is elsewhere).
  - F at position 5 (new letter).

This guess efficiently uses the feedback and explores potential placements for C and R while introducing S and F as new letters.

It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- A: (✓) meaning A is correct and in the right position (so the third letter is A).\n- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.\n- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter A in the third position: _ _ A _ _\n- The secret word also contains C and R, but not in the first or second positions respectively (since C was in position 1 and R in position 2 of ""crane"", but they were marked as wrong position). This means C cannot be in the first position and R cannot be in the second position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that C is in the word but not in position 1, and R is in the word but not in position 2. Since A is fixed at position 3, that leaves positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nActually, the positions that are wrong could be elsewhere. Specifically:\n- C is in the word, but not at position 1 (since it was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"" meaning wrong position). So C must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5? But wait, position 2 was R and position 3 is A, so C could be in position 2, 4, or 5? However, we must be cautious because the word has 5 letters.\n\nAlso note that the secret word does not contain N or E.\n\nSo the secret word pattern so far:\nPosition 1: unknown, but not C? Actually, it could be C? No, because if position 1 were C, then we would have gotten a ✓ for C. We got (-) which means C is present but position 1 is incorrect for it. Since C is in the word, but not at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, R is in the word, but not at position 2.\n\nAlso, A is fixed at position 3.\n\nTherefore:\n- Position 3: A\n- The word contains C and R, but not N, E.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess that includes C and R (since they are in the word) and excludes N and E. It must also place A in the third position.\n\nWe want to try to find positions for C and R, and also discover other letters.\n\nLet me consider possible placements for C and R:\n- Since position 1 cannot be C (from feedback), and position 3 is A, so C can be only in positions 2, 4, or 5.\n- Similarly, R was guessed at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning R is not at position 2. So R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait: positions: 1, 4, 5? Actually, position 3 is taken by A.\n\nThe positions available are:\n1: open, but we know R can be here? And C cannot be here? Let\'s recap:\n\n- Position 1: must not have C (because if it did, we would have gotten ✓ for C? Actually no, because we got (-) for C meaning it\'s present but not here. So position 1 can have R? Or any letter except C? Actually, no, position 1 can be any letter except C? Actually, no! Position 1 could be another letter. We don\'t know what letter is allowed at position 1, only that it isn\'t C (but C is in the word elsewhere).\n\nSimilarly, for position 2: it must not have R (since R was at position 2 and got ""-""), but R is in the word. So position 2 can be any letter except R? Actually, no: any letter can be at position 2, just that R is not there.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us what letters are at other positions. We only know that R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\nTherefore, the possibilities for C: positions 2, 4, 5? Position 2: yes, position 4, position 5. But note that position 3 is A, so that\'s fixed.\n\nSimilarly for R: positions 1, 4, 5? Because position 2 is out (already marked) and position 3 is A.\n\nSo R can be at 1, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, when we make the second guess:\n- It must be a 5-letter word with A in the third position.\n- It must include C and R (because we know they are in the word).\n- It must not include N or E (because they are not in the word).\n\nAlso, we want to test possible positions for C and R.\n\nLet me think of words with A in the third position, and containing C and R.\n\nBut note: we have constraints on where C and R cannot be.\n\nOur goal is to deduce the positions.\n\nPossible words? Let me list a few:\n\n- We know position 3: A. So pattern: _ _ A _ _\n\nWe need to include C and R.\n\nWe should avoid N and E.\n\nLet me think: starting with R? Because R can be at position 1? Or C can be at position 2?\n\nBut note: C cannot be at position 1? Correct? Because it was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is not at position 1. So position 1 must be a letter different from C? And C must be in the word elsewhere. Similarly for R not at position 2.\n\nSo, one idea: try R at position 1? Then C elsewhere? Or C at position 4, etc.\n\nLet me try to find words that match the pattern:\n\nFor example: \n- TRACE? But we already guessed CRANE, so we cannot repeat? Actually, we can guess any word, but TRACE includes T, R, A, C, E. But E is not in the word? From feedback, E is absent. So TRACE has E? Yes, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have words with N or E.\n\nAnother example: CARDS? But that has D, S? And R? Pattern: C A R ... wait, but we need A at position 3? CARDS has A at position 2? So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nWords with ??A??.\n\nAnd contain C and R, and no E or N.\n\nPossible words:\n- Let\'s consider words ending in C? Or containing C.\n- For example: BROAD? Pattern: B R O A D -> letters: B,R,O,A,D. Third letter is O, not A? No.\n  Position: 1:B, 2:R, 3:O, 4:A, 5:D? Not matching.\n\nWe need third position exactly A.\n\nHow about ""CRAWL""? \n- C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, W at 4, L at 5.\n  But we have constraints:\n  - C was at position 1 in ""crane"" and got (-) meaning two things: (1) C is in the word, but (2) position 1 is incorrect for C? So if we put C at position 1 again, we expect feedback for it? Actually, we are allowed to put C at position 1? But we already know position 1 is not C? So we shouldn\'t put C at position 1? Because it must be wrong? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, in ""CRAWL"", we have R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Because from feedback when R was at position 2 in ""crane"" it was shown as ""-"", meaning present but not at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be a mistake? We expect it to be wrong.\n\nTherefore, if we guess ""CRAWL"", we put C at position 1 (which we know is wrong) and R at position 2 (which we know is wrong). So that\'s inefficient because we know that those positions for C and R are invalid.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.\n\nSo, acceptable positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5.\nAcceptable positions for R: positions 1, 4, or 5.\n\nTherefore, we can consider:\n- Having R at position 1? Then C at position 4? Or C at position 2? But if we put C at position 2, is that allowed? Yes, because we have no feedback about position 2? Actually, no: position 2 in ""crane"" was R, but now we are considering putting C at position 2? That\'s fine because we don\'t have any feedback about position 2 having/not having C? Only that we know R is not at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we can put R at position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let me think of words with pattern ? ? A ? ? and including C and R:\n\nOption 1: Place R at position 1? Then R _ A _ _ \nWords: e.g., ROAST? But that has O, S, T? And we need to include C? But ROAST doesn\'t have C? No.\n\nWe need C too.\n\nOption 2: Place C at position 2? Like ? C A ? ? and must have R. And no N, E.\n\nWords: SCARB? Not a word. \nPerhaps ""SCARE""? But S C A R E -> has E which is not allowed? And also E is not in the word, wait no: E is excluded? So words with E are bad? We must avoid letters N and E? No, don\'t know about others? But E is confirmed absent? So words with E are not valid? Actually, we can have words that contain any letters? But if we guess a word with E, we\'ll get x for E? But we already know E is absent? So it\'s wasteful? So it\'s better to choose words without E and without N? Yes, to maximize information? Because if we include new letters that might be present.\n\nActually, avoiding E and N is good because we know they are absent? So we can use other letters.\n\nBack to placing R at position 1 and C at position, say, 5? Or 4.\n\nWord: R _ A _ C? Example: ""REACT"" -> R E A C T? Has E? Not allowed? And E is absent.\n\n""TRACT"" -> T R A C T? But R is at position 2? And we cannot have R at position 2? Wait: in TRACT, positions: T1, R2, A3, C4, T5? But position 2: R? That\'s the same position as in crane? But we know R is not at position 2? So if we guess R at position 2 again, we expect it to be wrong? So we shouldn\'t do that? Same with C at position 1? We avoid.\n\nBut TRACT has R at position 2? Which is a position we know is wrong for R? So if we guess TRACT, then:\nPosition 1: T, new letter? Could be anything? Position 2: R? We know it\'s wrong for R? And we get feedback? But we already know that R isn\'t at position 2? So we don\'t gain more? But we are forced to include R? So it\'s okay? It might show R as ""-"" again? That confirms it\'s still not at position 2? Alternatively, we might try to place R in a position we haven\'t tested? So that if we get a ✓ we know? \n\nSo to maximize information, we should try R in a position we haven\'t tried yet? That is position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, C should be in position 2, 4, or 5? Not position 1? Because we tried position 1? So avoid C at 1.\n\nTherefore, let me list words that:\n- Have A at position 3.\n- Include R and C.\n- Avoid E and N.\n- Place R in one of {1,4,5}? And C in one of {2,4,5} (can be same position? But no duplicate letters? We don\'t know yet? Wait, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily? So we have to consider?\nBut in ""crane"" it had no duplicates? And the feedback didn\'t show any duplicates? So we don\'t know? \n\nAssuming for now, we avoid words with duplicate letters? But it\'s not required? To be safe.\n\nBut we can choose a word that uses new letters? Because we also want to test more letters.\n\nSo, perhaps: Place R at position 1? And C at position 4?\n\nWord pattern: R _ A C _? And last letter? Not E, not N.\n\nPossible words: ""TRACK"" -> T? But we have no T? Position: R at 1? But wait: pattern R? 1: R, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: C? 5: ? \nBut ""TRACK"" has T at position 1? That\'s not R? No? ""TRACK"" is T,R,A,C,K -> positions T1,R2,A3,C4,K5? That doesn\'t fit? Because R is at 2? We want R at position 1? So ""R _ A C _""? Words: for example, ""REACH"" -> but E? Has E? ""R A C H E""? No? \n\n""RATCH"" -> not really common? Not English? \n\nWhat about ""GRACE"" -> but E? Has E?\n\n""CRAMP"" -> C at 1? Which we want to avoid? Because position 1 is C? And we already tested position 1 for C? And it was wrong? So we don\'t want that? ""CRAMP"": C1,R2,A3,M4,P5? That has R at position 2? Which we don\'t want? \n\nWe need a word that has R at position 1? And C? Then? ""RACED"" -> but E and N? No? But it has E? \n\n""RACER"" -> repeated R? and E? \n\nPerhaps ""CARAT"" -> C at position 1? Not allowed? And it has A at position 3? Pattern: C1, A2, R3? No: CARAT: C1, A2, R3? But position 3 is not A? We need position 3 to be A? In CARAT, position 3 is R? So third letter must be A? \n\nAnother idea: Place R at position 4? And C at position 2? So pattern: ? C A R ? \n\nWords: SCARF? S C A R F? That has S and F? No E or N? It uses S and F? Which are new.\n\nSCARF: positions: S1, C2, A3, R4, F5.\n\nNow, let\'s see:\n- C is at position 2? We haven\'t tested C at position 2? And R is at position 4? Not at position 2 which is bad? So that seems okay? \n\nAlso, A at position 3? Correct? And no E or N? Good? \n\nBut we must check: does the word SCARF exist? Yes? So it seems a valid guess.\n\nWith SCARF, we can test:\n- S: new letter? We\'ll see if present?\n- C: at position 2? Previously in crane, C was at position 1? So if now if C is at position 2? How will feedback work? Depending on where C actually is? \n- R: at position 4? Previously at position 2? Now position 4? \n\nIf C is indeed at position 2? Then we get ✓? If C is elsewhere? Then we get ""-"" meaning R? So it can help narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, R: if it is at position 4? We get ✓? Else? \n\nBut note: we also want to cover positions 1 and 5? We have S at position 1? F at position 5? They are unknown? So we test those too? \n\nTherefore, ""SCARF"" seems a reasonable guess.\n\nAlternatively? ""CRWTH""? Not English? Difficult letters? \n\nOr ""TRACT""? But has R at position 2? Which we know is wrong? \n\nSo I think SCARF is a good choice.\n\nBut note: the secret word has C in it? But not at position 1? And we are putting it at position 2? Well, maybe? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SCARF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as `-`).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as `-`).\n- A is in the correct position (position 3, marked as `✓`).\n- N and E are not in the word (marked as `x`).\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Ensure A remains in position 3 (since it\'s fixed).\n2. Include C and R (as they are in the word).\n3. Avoid N and E (as they are absent).\n4. Test C and R in positions we haven\'t ruled out:\n   - C cannot be in position 1 (from feedback), so I\'ll try it in position 2.\n   - R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so I\'ll try it in position 4.\n5. Introduce new letters to maximize information, avoiding repeating positions that were already incorrect.\n\nA word that fits this is **""scarf""**:\n- Positions: S (1), C (2), A (3), R (4), F (5).\n- This tests:\n  - S at position 1 (new letter).\n  - C at position 2 (to see if correct or if C is elsewhere).\n  - A at position 3 (confirmed).\n  - R at position 4 (to see if correct or if R is elsewhere).\n  - F at position 5 (new letter).\n\nThis guess efficiently uses the feedback and explores potential placements for C and R while introducing S and F as new letters.\n\n<guess>scarf</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scarf -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) F(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: (-) -> in word, wrong position (so not position 1)
- R: (-) -> in word, wrong position (so not position 2)
- A: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 3 is A)
- N: (x) -> not in word
- E: (x) -> not in word

Guess 2: ""scarf""
- S: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 1 is S)
- C: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 2 is C)
- A: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 3 is A, which we already knew)
- R: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 4 is R)
- F: (x) -> not in word

Now, putting it all together:

From ""scarf"" feedback:
- Position 1: S (correct) -> so the word starts with S.
- Position 2: C (correct) -> so the second letter is C.
- Position 3: A (correct) -> third letter is A.
- Position 4: R (correct) -> fourth letter is R.
- Position 5: F is not in the word, so the fifth letter is not F.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N and E are not in the word.

So the word so far is: S C A R ?

We are missing the fifth letter. We know it's not F, not N, not E.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SCAR"" and the last letter is not F, E, or N.

What are the possibilities? Common words:

- SCARE? But E is not in the word (from first guess), so cannot be SCARE.
- SCARF? We just guessed it, and F is not in the word? Actually, we guessed SCARF and F was marked as (x), meaning F is not in the word. So SCARF is not the word.
- SCARB? Not a word.
- SCARD? Not a word.
- SCARV? Not a word.
- SCARY? Y is a possibility? SCARY: S,C,A,R,Y.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? We haven't tested Y.

Other possibilities: SCARP? (as in a fish or architecture) but not common? Or SCARS? That would be plural.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the word has S? Actually, we didn't know S until now? But now we know S is at position 1.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words ending with SCAR?:

- SCARB: not a word.
- SCARD: not a word.
- SCARE: has E, which is absent -> invalid.
- SCARF: we guessed and F is absent -> invalid.
- SCARH: not a word.
- SCARK: not a word.
- SCARM: not a word.
- SCARN: has N, which is absent -> invalid.
- SCARP: a word? Yes, meaning a steep cliff or a type of fish. But let's see: S,C,A,R,P. P is a new letter? We haven't tested P.
- SCARS: plural of scar. S,C,A,R,S. But that would have two S's? Position 1 is S, and position 5 is S? That's possible? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The feedback didn't show any duplicate issues? So it could be.

But in ""scarf"", we have S at position 1 and no other S? So if the word is ""scars"", then when we guessed ""scarf"", the S at position 1 was correct, but there is another S at the end? But we didn't have an S at the end? So the feedback for ""scarf"" would have shown the S at position 1 as correct, but the word ""scars"" has an S at the end? So when we guessed ""scarf"", we had F at the end? But F is not in the word? So for ""scars"", the S at the end would not be revealed by ""scarf"" because we didn't guess it? So it's possible.

But we need to consider: the feedback for ""scarf"" only told us about the letters we guessed? So if the word is ""scars"", then:

- Position 1: S (guessed S, correct) -> ✓
- Position 2: C (guessed C, correct) -> ✓
- Position 3: A (guessed A, correct) -> ✓
- Position 4: R (guessed R, correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: F (guessed F, but the word has S) -> F is not in the word? Actually, the word has S at position 5? But we guessed F? So F is not present? So it would be (x) for F? Which matches.

But the word ""scars"" has two S's? But in ""scarf"", we only have one S? So the feedback doesn't tell us about the second S? Because we didn't guess it? So it's possible? Yes.

Similarly, ""scarp"" is a word? And it has P? We don't know about P.

Other words: ""scary"" with Y? Or ""scart"" (to scratch or a type of fish)? Not common? Or ""scarn"" has N? Invalid.

Common words: ""scare"" (invalid), ""scarf"" (invalid), ""scars"", ""scary"", ""scarp"".

But we need to make a guess? We have only one letter missing? So we can try to guess the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries? We are on guess 3? So we can try to guess the word if we think we know it? Or we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But since we have 4 letters fixed, we can try one of the possibilities.

But let's list the possibilities:

- SCARS: S at the end? But we have S at position 1? So if we guess SCARS, then we have S at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if that's allowed? But it could be.

- SCARY: Y at the end.

- SCARP: P at the end.

- SCARB: not a word.

- SCARD: not a word.

- SCARL: not a word.

- SCARV: not a word.

- SCART: not common? But it is a word? Meaning to scratch or a type of fish? Or in some dialects? But let's consider valid Wordle words? Usually common words.

- SCARF: already guessed and F is absent.

- SCARE: E absent.

So the most common words are SCARS, SCARY, and SCARP.

We can try one of them? But we have to be careful? Because if we guess wrong, we lose a turn? But we have 4 letters fixed? So we can try.

But note: we have feedback that F is absent? So SCARF is out? And E and N are absent? So SCARE and SCARN are out.

So between SCARS, SCARY, SCARP? Which one to choose?

We can also consider if there are other words? Like ""scath""? But that has H? And it's not common? Or ""scald""? But that has L and D? And position 3 is A? But ""scald"" is S,C,A,L,D? So position 4 is L? But we have R at position 4? From feedback? In ""scarf"", R at position 4 was correct? So position 4 must be R? So we cannot have L at position 4? So ""scald"" would not have R? But we know R is in the word? And at position 4? So the word must have R at position 4? So the word must be SCAR?.

Therefore, the word must start with SCAR and then one more letter? So only the fifth letter is unknown? And it must be a letter that forms a valid English word? And not F, not E, not N.

So the possibilities are:

- SCARS: valid, meaning marks on skin or plural of scar.
- SCARY: valid, meaning frightening.
- SCARP: valid, a geological term? Or a verb? But less common? But Wordle might accept it? 
- SCART: not common? But it is a word? Meaning to scratch? Or a connector? But let's see frequency.

In Wordle, common words are preferred? So SCARY and SCARS are more common? 

But we have to choose one? We can try SCARY? Or SCARS? 

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we got that C and R were present but in wrong positions? Now we have them in correct positions? So that's consistent.

Also, we need to consider if the word has duplicate letters? For SCARS, it has two S's? But we don't know? We haven't tested? But in ""scarf"", we only had one S? So if the word is SCARS, then the S at position 1 was correct? But the S at position 5 was not guessed? So it's possible? 

But we can get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter? But we only have one letter to guess? So it's better to guess one of the possibilities? 

But we have 4 tries left? So we can try SCARY? 

But let me think: is there a way to test multiple? Not really? Because we have to have SCAR at the beginning? 

So I think we should guess SCARY? Or SCARS? 

But to be safe? We can look for a word that has the same pattern? But we don't have many options? 

Another idea: we know the word is SCAR? and the last letter? So we can try SCARY? 

But let's see the feedback: if we guess SCARY? 

If the word is SCARY, then we get all correct? 

If the word is SCARS, then we get S at position 1,2,3,4 correct? But position 5: we guessed Y? But the word has S? So Y would be (x) if not in word? Or if the word is SCARS, then Y is not present? So we get (x) for Y? 

Similarly, if we guess SCARS? Then if the word is SCARS, all correct? If the word is SCARY, then position 5: S? But the word has Y? So S at position 5 would be (x) if S is not in the word? But wait, the word has S at position 1? So if we guess SCARS? Then:

- Position 1: S (correct) -> ✓
- Position 2: C (correct) -> ✓
- Position 3: A (correct) -> ✓
- Position 4: R (correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: S? But the word is SCARY? So the fifth letter is Y? So we guessed S? But S is in the word at position 1? So the feedback for position 5: S? Since S is in the word but not at position 5? So it would be (-) for S? Because S is present elsewhere? 

But we already have S at position 1? So if we guess S at position 5? And the word has only one S? Then it would be (x) for S? Because we already have one S? But if the word has two S's? Then it could be (-) or ✓? 

This is confusing? 

To avoid confusion, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? Like SCARY? 

SCARY has S,C,A,R,Y? All distinct? 

Similarly, SCARP has S,C,A,R,P? All distinct? 

SCARS has two S's? 

So perhaps try SCARY? 

But we don't know? 

Since we have multiple possibilities? We can try a word that tests the fifth letter? But we have to have SCAR fixed? So we cannot change? 

Another idea: we can try a word that is not SCAR? but has the same pattern? But we know positions 1-4 are fixed? So we must guess SCAR? and then the fifth letter? 

So we have to choose one? 

Given that, I think SCARY is a common word? So I'll guess that? 

But let's see: we have feedback that F is absent? So F is not the fifth letter? 

Also, from first guess, E and N absent? 

So possible letters for fifth position: any letter except F, E, N? And must form a word? 

Common ones: Y, P, T? But SCART? Not common? 

SCARH? Not a word? 

SCARW? Not? 

So SCARY, SCARS, SCARP? 

SCART is also a word? But less common? 

SCARAB? But that would be 6 letters? No? SCARAB is 6? S-C-A-R-A-B? 6 letters? No, 6? Wait, 5: S-C-A-R-B? But that's not SCARAB? SCARAB is 6? 

So 5-letter: SCARB not word? 

So I think the main ones are SCARY, SCARS, SCARP? 

Now, to decide? We can try SCARY? Because it's very common? 

But we have to be careful? 

Another thought: in the first guess, ""crane"", we had C and R in the word? But now we have them at positions 2 and 4? Which were not the positions in crane? But that's fine? 

Also, we have S at position 1? Which is new? 

So I think SCARY is a good guess? 

But let's see if there is a word that can help us distinguish? 

For example, if we guess a word that has Y, P, and other letters? But we cannot? Because positions 1-4 are fixed? 

So we have to guess one? 

I think we should guess SCARY? 

If it's not, we get feedback? 

But we have tries left? 

So I'll go with SCARY? 

But let's confirm the feedback we have: 

The word is S C A R ? 

We know it's not F, not E, not N? 

So guess: ""scary"" 

<guess>scary</guess> 

But if it's wrong, we can try SCARS next? 

But let's hope it's SCARY? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? Like ""scath""? But not common? 

Or ""scald""? But that would have L at position 4? But we have R at position 4? So impossible? 

So only the fifth letter varies? 

I think SCARY is a good guess? 

So I'll go with that.

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(-), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A is correct and in position 3.  
  - N and E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ""scarf""**  
  Feedback: S(✓), C(✓), A(✓), R(✓), F(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S is correct and in position 1.  
  - C is correct and in position 2.  
  - A is correct and in position 3 (already known).  
  - R is correct and in position 4.  
  - F is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with ""SCAR"" (positions 1–4 confirmed: S, C, A, R).
- The fifth letter is missing and must be a valid English letter that forms a 5-letter word.
- F, E, and N are confirmed absent (from feedback), so the fifth letter cannot be F, E, or N.
- Common English words fitting ""SCAR_"" include:
  - **SCARY** (meaning frightening)
  - **SCARS** (plural of scar)
  - **SCARP** (a geological term or steep slope)
- ""SCARY"" is chosen as the next guess because:
  - It uses distinct letters (no duplicates), which avoids potential confusion from feedback (e.g., ""SCARS"" has a repeated ""S"" that wasn't tested in previous guesses).
  - It is a high-frequency word and a common Wordle solution.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will directly reveal the fifth letter (e.g., if ""SCARY"" is wrong, the feedback for ""Y"" will indicate if it is present or absent, narrowing down to ""SCARS"" or ""SCARP"").

<guess>scary</guess>",scary,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: (-) -> in word, wrong position (so not position 1)
- R: (-) -> in word, wrong position (so not position 2)
- A: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 3 is A)
- N: (x) -> not in word
- E: (x) -> not in word

Guess 2: ""scarf""
- S: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 1 is S)
- C: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 2 is C)
- A: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 3 is A, which we already knew)
- R: (✓) -> correct and in position (so position 4 is R)
- F: (x) -> not in word

Now, putting it all together:

From ""scarf"" feedback:
- Position 1: S (correct) -> so the word starts with S.
- Position 2: C (correct) -> so the second letter is C.
- Position 3: A (correct) -> third letter is A.
- Position 4: R (correct) -> fourth letter is R.
- Position 5: F is not in the word, so the fifth letter is not F.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N and E are not in the word.

So the word so far is: S C A R ?

We are missing the fifth letter. We know it's not F, not N, not E.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SCAR"" and the last letter is not F, E, or N.

What are the possibilities? Common words:

- SCARE? But E is not in the word (from first guess), so cannot be SCARE.
- SCARF? We just guessed it, and F is not in the word? Actually, we guessed SCARF and F was marked as (x), meaning F is not in the word. So SCARF is not the word.
- SCARB? Not a word.
- SCARD? Not a word.
- SCARV? Not a word.
- SCARY? Y is a possibility? SCARY: S,C,A,R,Y.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? We haven't tested Y.

Other possibilities: SCARP? (as in a fish or architecture) but not common? Or SCARS? That would be plural.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the word has S? Actually, we didn't know S until now? But now we know S is at position 1.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words ending with SCAR?:

- SCARB: not a word.
- SCARD: not a word.
- SCARE: has E, which is absent -> invalid.
- SCARF: we guessed and F is absent -> invalid.
- SCARH: not a word.
- SCARK: not a word.
- SCARM: not a word.
- SCARN: has N, which is absent -> invalid.
- SCARP: a word? Yes, meaning a steep cliff or a type of fish. But let's see: S,C,A,R,P. P is a new letter? We haven't tested P.
- SCARS: plural of scar. S,C,A,R,S. But that would have two S's? Position 1 is S, and position 5 is S? That's possible? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The feedback didn't show any duplicate issues? So it could be.

But in ""scarf"", we have S at position 1 and no other S? So if the word is ""scars"", then when we guessed ""scarf"", the S at position 1 was correct, but there is another S at the end? But we didn't have an S at the end? So the feedback for ""scarf"" would have shown the S at position 1 as correct, but the word ""scars"" has an S at the end? So when we guessed ""scarf"", we had F at the end? But F is not in the word? So for ""scars"", the S at the end would not be revealed by ""scarf"" because we didn't guess it? So it's possible.

But we need to consider: the feedback for ""scarf"" only told us about the letters we guessed? So if the word is ""scars"", then:

- Position 1: S (guessed S, correct) -> ✓
- Position 2: C (guessed C, correct) -> ✓
- Position 3: A (guessed A, correct) -> ✓
- Position 4: R (guessed R, correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: F (guessed F, but the word has S) -> F is not in the word? Actually, the word has S at position 5? But we guessed F? So F is not present? So it would be (x) for F? Which matches.

But the word ""scars"" has two S's? But in ""scarf"", we only have one S? So the feedback doesn't tell us about the second S? Because we didn't guess it? So it's possible? Yes.

Similarly, ""scarp"" is a word? And it has P? We don't know about P.

Other words: ""scary"" with Y? Or ""scart"" (to scratch or a type of fish)? Not common? Or ""scarn"" has N? Invalid.

Common words: ""scare"" (invalid), ""scarf"" (invalid), ""scars"", ""scary"", ""scarp"".

But we need to make a guess? We have only one letter missing? So we can try to guess the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries? We are on guess 3? So we can try to guess the word if we think we know it? Or we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But since we have 4 letters fixed, we can try one of the possibilities.

But let's list the possibilities:

- SCARS: S at the end? But we have S at position 1? So if we guess SCARS, then we have S at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if that's allowed? But it could be.

- SCARY: Y at the end.

- SCARP: P at the end.

- SCARB: not a word.

- SCARD: not a word.

- SCARL: not a word.

- SCARV: not a word.

- SCART: not common? But it is a word? Meaning to scratch or a type of fish? Or in some dialects? But let's consider valid Wordle words? Usually common words.

- SCARF: already guessed and F is absent.

- SCARE: E absent.

So the most common words are SCARS, SCARY, and SCARP.

We can try one of them? But we have to be careful? Because if we guess wrong, we lose a turn? But we have 4 letters fixed? So we can try.

But note: we have feedback that F is absent? So SCARF is out? And E and N are absent? So SCARE and SCARN are out.

So between SCARS, SCARY, SCARP? Which one to choose?

We can also consider if there are other words? Like ""scath""? But that has H? And it's not common? Or ""scald""? But that has L and D? And position 3 is A? But ""scald"" is S,C,A,L,D? So position 4 is L? But we have R at position 4? From feedback? In ""scarf"", R at position 4 was correct? So position 4 must be R? So we cannot have L at position 4? So ""scald"" would not have R? But we know R is in the word? And at position 4? So the word must have R at position 4? So the word must be SCAR?.

Therefore, the word must start with SCAR and then one more letter? So only the fifth letter is unknown? And it must be a letter that forms a valid English word? And not F, not E, not N.

So the possibilities are:

- SCARS: valid, meaning marks on skin or plural of scar.
- SCARY: valid, meaning frightening.
- SCARP: valid, a geological term? Or a verb? But less common? But Wordle might accept it? 
- SCART: not common? But it is a word? Meaning to scratch? Or a connector? But let's see frequency.

In Wordle, common words are preferred? So SCARY and SCARS are more common? 

But we have to choose one? We can try SCARY? Or SCARS? 

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we got that C and R were present but in wrong positions? Now we have them in correct positions? So that's consistent.

Also, we need to consider if the word has duplicate letters? For SCARS, it has two S's? But we don't know? We haven't tested? But in ""scarf"", we only had one S? So if the word is SCARS, then the S at position 1 was correct? But the S at position 5 was not guessed? So it's possible? 

But we can get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter? But we only have one letter to guess? So it's better to guess one of the possibilities? 

But we have 4 tries left? So we can try SCARY? 

But let me think: is there a way to test multiple? Not really? Because we have to have SCAR at the beginning? 

So I think we should guess SCARY? Or SCARS? 

But to be safe? We can look for a word that has the same pattern? But we don't have many options? 

Another idea: we know the word is SCAR? and the last letter? So we can try SCARY? 

But let's see the feedback: if we guess SCARY? 

If the word is SCARY, then we get all correct? 

If the word is SCARS, then we get S at position 1,2,3,4 correct? But position 5: we guessed Y? But the word has S? So Y would be (x) if not in word? Or if the word is SCARS, then Y is not present? So we get (x) for Y? 

Similarly, if we guess SCARS? Then if the word is SCARS, all correct? If the word is SCARY, then position 5: S? But the word has Y? So S at position 5 would be (x) if S is not in the word? But wait, the word has S at position 1? So if we guess SCARS? Then:

- Position 1: S (correct) -> ✓
- Position 2: C (correct) -> ✓
- Position 3: A (correct) -> ✓
- Position 4: R (correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: S? But the word is SCARY? So the fifth letter is Y? So we guessed S? But S is in the word at position 1? So the feedback for position 5: S? Since S is in the word but not at position 5? So it would be (-) for S? Because S is present elsewhere? 

But we already have S at position 1? So if we guess S at position 5? And the word has only one S? Then it would be (x) for S? Because we already have one S? But if the word has two S's? Then it could be (-) or ✓? 

This is confusing? 

To avoid confusion, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? Like SCARY? 

SCARY has S,C,A,R,Y? All distinct? 

Similarly, SCARP has S,C,A,R,P? All distinct? 

SCARS has two S's? 

So perhaps try SCARY? 

But we don't know? 

Since we have multiple possibilities? We can try a word that tests the fifth letter? But we have to have SCAR fixed? So we cannot change? 

Another idea: we can try a word that is not SCAR? but has the same pattern? But we know positions 1-4 are fixed? So we must guess SCAR? and then the fifth letter? 

So we have to choose one? 

Given that, I think SCARY is a common word? So I'll guess that? 

But let's see: we have feedback that F is absent? So F is not the fifth letter? 

Also, from first guess, E and N absent? 

So possible letters for fifth position: any letter except F, E, N? And must form a word? 

Common ones: Y, P, T? But SCART? Not common? 

SCARH? Not a word? 

SCARW? Not? 

So SCARY, SCARS, SCARP? 

SCART is also a word? But less common? 

SCARAB? But that would be 6 letters? No? SCARAB is 6? S-C-A-R-A-B? 6 letters? No, 6? Wait, 5: S-C-A-R-B? But that's not SCARAB? SCARAB is 6? 

So 5-letter: SCARB not word? 

So I think the main ones are SCARY, SCARS, SCARP? 

Now, to decide? We can try SCARY? Because it's very common? 

But we have to be careful? 

Another thought: in the first guess, ""crane"", we had C and R in the word? But now we have them at positions 2 and 4? Which were not the positions in crane? But that's fine? 

Also, we have S at position 1? Which is new? 

So I think SCARY is a good guess? 

But let's see if there is a word that can help us distinguish? 

For example, if we guess a word that has Y, P, and other letters? But we cannot? Because positions 1-4 are fixed? 

So we have to guess one? 

I think we should guess SCARY? 

If it's not, we get feedback? 

But we have tries left? 

So I'll go with SCARY? 

But let's confirm the feedback we have: 

The word is S C A R ? 

We know it's not F, not E, not N? 

So guess: ""scary"" 

<guess>scary</guess> 

But if it's wrong, we can try SCARS next? 

But let's hope it's SCARY? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? Like ""scath""? But not common? 

Or ""scald""? But that would have L at position 4? But we have R at position 4? So impossible? 

So only the fifth letter varies? 

I think SCARY is a good guess? 

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
