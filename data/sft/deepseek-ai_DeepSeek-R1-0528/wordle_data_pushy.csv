We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x': C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). 
This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

We need to think of a word that uses other common letters. Common vowels left: I, O, U (but U is less common). Consonants: we have many, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.

A good strategy is to use another set of common letters to cover more ground. For example, ""TULIP"" or ""MOIST"" or ""PULLY"", but let's ensure we avoid the forbidden letters.

Avoiding C, R, A, N, E.

We can try the word ""MOIST"" because:
- M, O, I, S, T are common letters and none of them are in the excluded set.

Alternatively, ""SOLID"" or ""POUND"" but we have more common letters.

Let me list some words that avoid C, R, A, N, E:
Possible words: 
- TIMES (but E is excluded) -> invalid
- PILOT (contains O, I, L, P, T) -> but we don't know if these are excluded? We only know C,R,A,N,E are bad.
PILOT: P, I, L, O, T. None of these are in the forbidden set? 
But wait, we have to use only letters that haven't been tried? Not necessarily, but we know the forbidden ones are absent.

But we don't know about P, I, L, O, T. They are not excluded yet so they might be in the word.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"", ""LIGHT"", ""MOUTH"", etc.

But let's pick a word that has a good mix. ""MOIST"" is a common next guess in such situations.

MOIST: M, O, I, S, T. All these letters are not in the forbidden set (C,R,A,N,E).

Based on the previous feedback, the letters C, R, A, N, and E are **not present** in the secret word at all. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

- It uses common letters not yet tested: M, O, I, S, T.
- It contains a balanced mix of vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T).

We are on the third guess. Let's analyze the feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters are incorrect. So, C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.

From Guess 2 (""moist""): 
- M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x)

This means:
- M is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T is not in the word.

So, overall, we know the secret word contains the letter S, but not in the second position (since it was marked as wrong position in the fourth position of ""moist"").

Now, letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

And S is confirmed to be in the word.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word), but not in the fourth position (because in ""moist"" it was at the fourth position and was marked as wrong position). However, it could be in another position.

But note: the feedback for S was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not in that position. We don't know which position it belongs to.

Now, what letters are left? We have to find words using the remaining letters. The English alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, T

Remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we must include S.

Also, the word is 5 letters.

Moreover, in our new word, S should be placed in a position that is not the fourth (position 4) because in ""moist"" it was at position 4 and was wrong. But note: position numbering: moist is M(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). So S in position 4 is wrong.

Now, common letters to try: We can try to include other common consonants like L, P, G, D, or vowels we haven't tried: we have U left (since A, E, I, O are excluded). Also, we have Y which can sometimes act as a vowel.

So, we need a word that includes S and four other letters from the remaining set.

Possible words: 
- ""SULPH"" is not a word.
- ""PLUSH"" would be good but contains U and S. Let's see: P, L, U, S, H. Check if any letter excluded: P is not excluded (excluded were C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T), so P is okay. L is okay. U is okay. S is required. H is okay. But ""PLUSH"" has S in the fourth position? P(1), L(2), U(3), S(4), H(5). But wait, we should avoid putting S in position 4 because the feedback said S is in the word but not in position 4. So we shouldn't put S in position 4 again? Actually, we can put S anywhere, but we know position 4 is incorrect, so we can try S in other positions.

Alternatively, words that put S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Another word: ""SHULY"" not a word. 

""LUSHY"" is not standard. Let's find valid words.

Common words: 
- ""PULPS"" - P, U, L, P, S -> has duplicate P? And S at the end? But P is allowed? Excluded letters: we have to avoid the ones above. P is allowed. But let's check if it's valid: ""pulps"" is a word (plural of pulp). But S is at position 5.

Alternatively, ""GULPS"" - G, U, L, P, S -> G is allowed? Yes. Letters: G,U,L,P,S are all from the allowed set. And S is at the end (position 5). This could work.

But maybe it's better to use words with more common letters? Also, we have H, which is common.

Another word: ""SHILY"" - not a common word. ""SHYLY"" is valid: S, H, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And S is at position 1. Letters: S, H, Y, L, Y? That's five letters? ""SHYLY"" is S-H-Y-L-Y, but that has two Y's? Actually, it is a valid word. But we have Y twice? We could avoid using repeated letters to maximize information.

But actually, in Wordle-style, repeated letters might be allowed and could be useful, but since we don't know if there are repeats in the secret, we might prefer distinct letters.

If we use ""SHYLY"", the word has two Y's. The secret might also have repeated letters, but we don't know. So perhaps avoid that for now.

Another idea: ""SLUMS"" - has S at position 1 and 5? Also contains M and S? Wait, M is excluded! From guess2, M is marked as ""x"", so M is not in the word. So we cannot use M.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T. So M is out.

Similarly, T is out.

So we cannot use M.

Therefore, ""GULPS"": G, U, L, P, S -> all allowed.

""PULPS"": P, U, L, P, S -> P repeated? But it's allowed. S at end.

But let's think of words that have S not in position 4.

Position options: 1,2,3,5.

Possible words: 
- S at start: ""SKULK"", ""SQUIB"", ""SPLIT"" but SPLIT has I and T which are excluded? T is excluded? From guess2, T is marked ""x"", so T is not in the word. And I is also marked ""x"", so I is out.

We must avoid I and T.

So: ""SQUIB"" -> S, Q, U, I, B -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I. Excluded.

Therefore, ""SQUIB"" has I, so no.

""SQUAB"" -> S, Q, U, A, B -> but A is excluded? From guess1, A is marked ""x"", so A is excluded. So cannot use A.

Therefore, avoid S words that have letters we know are excluded.

Perhaps: ""SHOWY"" - S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded? From guess2, O is ""x"", so excluded.

So we need words only from allowed letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And must include S.

Let me try: ""SWILL"" - S, W, I, L, L -> but I is excluded? And L repeated? We avoid I.

""SKULK"" - S, K, U, L, K -> K repeated? But K is allowed, and U, L.

""SKULK"" is a word. But S at position 1, then K,U,L,K.

But ""DUMPS"" - D, U, M, P, S -> M is excluded? We cannot use M.

We must not use M.

Another word: ""GULPS"" seems okay: G, U, L, P, S -> positions: G1, U2, L3, P4, S5. So S is at position 5, which is fine since we know position 4 (from moist) was wrong, but position 5 might be correct? We don't know.

Moreover, we haven't tested G, U, L, P, so these are new.

Similarly, we can try ""BUGLE"" but E is excluded? Yes, E is out.

""LUNGS"" - L, U, N, G, S -> N is excluded? From guess1, N is ""x"", so out.

Therefore, ""GULPS"" or ""PULPS"" could be options.

To avoid duplication: ""GULFS"" - G, U, L, F, S -> this works? ""GULF"" is a word, adding S? Actually, ""GULFS"" is a valid word (pl of gulf).

Similarly, ""GULPS"" is gulps.

Another word: ""DUVET"" but E and T are excluded? E and T both excluded.

Perhaps ""BULKS"" - B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed.

""PUMPS"" contains M? P,U,M,P,S -> M is excluded. Cannot.

So, let me list some words:
- BULKS: B, U, L, K, S -> S at the end (pos5)
- FUSSY: F, U, S, S, Y -> S twice? And Y. But two S's: acceptable? But we don't know if the word has two S's? It might. But we might prefer distinct letters to test more.
- BUSKY: archaic.

Common words: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> P1,L2,U3,S4,H5. But S is at position 4? We know from feedback that S is not in position 4 (because in moist at pos4 it was wrong). Therefore, we should avoid putting S in position 4 again? No, we can put it elsewhere.

In ""PLUSH"", if I put S at position 4, and if the secret has S at a different position, it would show as wrong position again? But we already know position 4 is wrong? Actually, we know for sure that position 4 is not correct for S, so it would be redundant to put S in position 4 again. So to save a guess, we should put S in a new position.

Therefore, we should choose a word where S is not in position 4, so position 1,2,3, or 5.

In ""PLUSH"", if we can rearrange? But we cannot rearrange. The word must be valid.

Therefore, ""PLUSH"" has S in position 4? Let's see: if we write PLUSH as P-L-U-S-H, then S is in position 4. But we know position 4 is wrong. So if we guess ""PLUSH"" and put S in position 4, we will get - or x? But we know S is in the word, and position 4 is wrong? So it would show minus again? But that doesn't give new information about the position. So we should avoid wasting a guess by putting S in an already known wrong position.

Therefore, when guessing, we should put S in a position we haven't tried, i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 5? We tried S in position 4 only so far? So we can try position 1,2,3,5.

We haven't tried S in position 1,2,3,5.

So guess a word that has S in one of these positions.

For example, S in position 1: words like ""SKULK"", ""SQUIB"" but SQUIB has I (excluded), so invalid.

""SWILL"" invalid because of I.

""SHALL"" invalid because of A.

""SPILL"" invalid because of I and L repeated? But S,P,I,L,L -> I excluded.

None starting with S seem doable without using excluded letters? 

S with B: ""SBORR"" not word.

S with D: ""SDROP"" invalid.

We might need to consider S not at start.

Put S at position 3, for instance.

Word: ? ? S ? ?

With allowed letters.

For example, ""BUSKY"" not common, but ""BUSKS"" is a word? B,U,S,K,S -> S at position 3 and 5? And B and U are allowed? Yes. K also.

""BUSKS"": B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). So S is at position 3 and 5.

This tests two positions for S? But it has repeated S.

Similarly, ""FUSSY"" F,U,S,S,Y -> S at 3 and 4? Position 4 we know is wrong? So if we put S at 4, it would be wrong? But since we know S is not fixed yet, putting S at a wrong position again might not be efficient? However, if we put S at 3 and 5, that could test both.

But let's try for distinct letters.

Word with S at position 2: for example, ""PSYCH"" not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not valid? ""PSYCH"" is root, but words: ""PSYCH"" alone is not a word. ""PATIO"" has A and T? Excluded.

Hard to find words with S in position 2 without using excluded letters.

Position 5: many words end with S, like ""GUIDS"" not word? ""GUIDs"" not standard. ""GLUTS"" has T? Excluded.

""SPOTS"" has O and T? Excluded.

Perhaps we go with S at position 5: ""UGLIS"" not a word.

Common words ending with S: ""FOCUS"" has O? Excluded. ""CIVIL"" has I and C? Excluded.

Another idea: ""NYMPH"" but has N? Excluded and no S.

So perhaps we use ""GULPS"", which has S at position 5 and avoids position 4.

Similarly, ""LUMPS"" has U,M,P,S -> M? Excluded.

""BUMPS"" same.

How about ""DOWNS"" but O and other letters.

We might have to settle for ""GULPS"" or ""BULKS"".

Let me check ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> S at position 5, and letters are all allowed. And the word is real.

Similarly, ""SULKS"": S at position 1 -> S,U,L,K,S? Not distinct. ""SULKS"" is S,U,L,K,S -> S at 1 and 5? That could work: S(1), U(2), L(3), K(4), S(5). So S is at 1 and 5.

But we haven't tested position 1 and 4? We tested position 4? Not position 1.

In ""SULKS"", S is at positions 1 and 5? And we avoid excluded letters? U and L are allowed? Yes.

Is ""SULKS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to be sullen.

But note: we haven't tested position 1, so putting S at 1 could be correct? And also at 5? It could be.

But let's consider efficiency: we know S is in the word once? But we don't know if there are repeated letters. So guessing ""SULKS"" might be good because it tests both position 1 and 5 for S.

If S is in the word twice? Possible, but less common. But Wordle can have repeated letters.

But since we are limited by letters to choose from, let's choose a word.

To test more new positions: ""SULKS"" tests S at position 1 and 5? Also U, L, and K.

For position 3 we haven't tested S? We tried position 4 only.

So we can try S at position 3.

Word with S at position 3: ? ? S ? ?

With allowed letters: e.g., ""BASTS"" not distinct? ""BLAST"" has A? Excluded.

""DUSTS"" D,U,S,T,S -> T excluded? Cannot.

""GUESS"" has E? Excluded.

""JUSHY"" not word.

""PUSHY"" P,U,S,H,Y -> all allowed? P1,U2,S3,H4,Y5. So S at position 3. This seems good.

Is ""PUSHY"" a word? Yes, as in aggressive.

And it avoids all excluded letters: P,U,S,H,Y are all from allowed set (not in C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T).

So ""PUSHY"" has:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: Y

This way, S is tested at position 3, which is new. We also test P, U, H, and Y.

Compared to ""SULKS"" which tests S at 1 and 5, and L and K.

But ""PUSHY"" tests more new letters: P,U,H,Y.

Also, S at position 3.

We hope this will be informative.

Therefore, I choose ""PUSHY"".

<guess>pushy</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters incorrect, confirming that C, R, A, N, and E are **absent** from the secret word.
- Guess 2 (""moist"") showed:
  - M, O, I, T are **absent**.
  - S is **present** but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 4).

This means:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (not in the word).
- **Required letter**: S must be included, but not in position 4 (since this was its position in ""moist"").
- **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for the next guess:
1. **Must include S**: Since S is confirmed to be in the word, but its position is unknown.
2. **Avoid position 4 for S**: To avoid redundancy and maximize new information, S should be placed in a position not yet tested (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. **Use new high-frequency letters**: Prioritize untested common consonants like P, L, H, K, and the vowel U to cover more possibilities.
4. **Avoid excluded letters**: The guess cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, or T.

A suitable word is ""PUSHY"":
- Includes S at position 3 (testing a new position).
- Contains other untested letters: P, U, H, Y.
- Uses no excluded letters.
- ""PUSHY"" is a valid English word (meaning assertive or aggressive).

This guess efficiently tests S in a new location while exploring new letters.

<guess>pushy</guess>",pushy,"We are on the third guess. Let's analyze the feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters are incorrect. So, C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.

From Guess 2 (""moist""): 
- M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x)

This means:
- M is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T is not in the word.

So, overall, we know the secret word contains the letter S, but not in the second position (since it was marked as wrong position in the fourth position of ""moist"").

Now, letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

And S is confirmed to be in the word.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word), but not in the fourth position (because in ""moist"" it was at the fourth position and was marked as wrong position). However, it could be in another position.

But note: the feedback for S was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not in that position. We don't know which position it belongs to.

Now, what letters are left? We have to find words using the remaining letters. The English alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, T

Remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we must include S.

Also, the word is 5 letters.

Moreover, in our new word, S should be placed in a position that is not the fourth (position 4) because in ""moist"" it was at position 4 and was wrong. But note: position numbering: moist is M(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). So S in position 4 is wrong.

Now, common letters to try: We can try to include other common consonants like L, P, G, D, or vowels we haven't tried: we have U left (since A, E, I, O are excluded). Also, we have Y which can sometimes act as a vowel.

So, we need a word that includes S and four other letters from the remaining set.

Possible words: 
- ""SULPH"" is not a word.
- ""PLUSH"" would be good but contains U and S. Let's see: P, L, U, S, H. Check if any letter excluded: P is not excluded (excluded were C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T), so P is okay. L is okay. U is okay. S is required. H is okay. But ""PLUSH"" has S in the fourth position? P(1), L(2), U(3), S(4), H(5). But wait, we should avoid putting S in position 4 because the feedback said S is in the word but not in position 4. So we shouldn't put S in position 4 again? Actually, we can put S anywhere, but we know position 4 is incorrect, so we can try S in other positions.

Alternatively, words that put S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Another word: ""SHULY"" not a word. 

""LUSHY"" is not standard. Let's find valid words.

Common words: 
- ""PULPS"" - P, U, L, P, S -> has duplicate P? And S at the end? But P is allowed? Excluded letters: we have to avoid the ones above. P is allowed. But let's check if it's valid: ""pulps"" is a word (plural of pulp). But S is at position 5.

Alternatively, ""GULPS"" - G, U, L, P, S -> G is allowed? Yes. Letters: G,U,L,P,S are all from the allowed set. And S is at the end (position 5). This could work.

But maybe it's better to use words with more common letters? Also, we have H, which is common.

Another word: ""SHILY"" - not a common word. ""SHYLY"" is valid: S, H, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And S is at position 1. Letters: S, H, Y, L, Y? That's five letters? ""SHYLY"" is S-H-Y-L-Y, but that has two Y's? Actually, it is a valid word. But we have Y twice? We could avoid using repeated letters to maximize information.

But actually, in Wordle-style, repeated letters might be allowed and could be useful, but since we don't know if there are repeats in the secret, we might prefer distinct letters.

If we use ""SHYLY"", the word has two Y's. The secret might also have repeated letters, but we don't know. So perhaps avoid that for now.

Another idea: ""SLUMS"" - has S at position 1 and 5? Also contains M and S? Wait, M is excluded! From guess2, M is marked as ""x"", so M is not in the word. So we cannot use M.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T. So M is out.

Similarly, T is out.

So we cannot use M.

Therefore, ""GULPS"": G, U, L, P, S -> all allowed.

""PULPS"": P, U, L, P, S -> P repeated? But it's allowed. S at end.

But let's think of words that have S not in position 4.

Position options: 1,2,3,5.

Possible words: 
- S at start: ""SKULK"", ""SQUIB"", ""SPLIT"" but SPLIT has I and T which are excluded? T is excluded? From guess2, T is marked ""x"", so T is not in the word. And I is also marked ""x"", so I is out.

We must avoid I and T.

So: ""SQUIB"" -> S, Q, U, I, B -> but I is excluded? We cannot use I. Excluded.

Therefore, ""SQUIB"" has I, so no.

""SQUAB"" -> S, Q, U, A, B -> but A is excluded? From guess1, A is marked ""x"", so A is excluded. So cannot use A.

Therefore, avoid S words that have letters we know are excluded.

Perhaps: ""SHOWY"" - S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded? From guess2, O is ""x"", so excluded.

So we need words only from allowed letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And must include S.

Let me try: ""SWILL"" - S, W, I, L, L -> but I is excluded? And L repeated? We avoid I.

""SKULK"" - S, K, U, L, K -> K repeated? But K is allowed, and U, L.

""SKULK"" is a word. But S at position 1, then K,U,L,K.

But ""DUMPS"" - D, U, M, P, S -> M is excluded? We cannot use M.

We must not use M.

Another word: ""GULPS"" seems okay: G, U, L, P, S -> positions: G1, U2, L3, P4, S5. So S is at position 5, which is fine since we know position 4 (from moist) was wrong, but position 5 might be correct? We don't know.

Moreover, we haven't tested G, U, L, P, so these are new.

Similarly, we can try ""BUGLE"" but E is excluded? Yes, E is out.

""LUNGS"" - L, U, N, G, S -> N is excluded? From guess1, N is ""x"", so out.

Therefore, ""GULPS"" or ""PULPS"" could be options.

To avoid duplication: ""GULFS"" - G, U, L, F, S -> this works? ""GULF"" is a word, adding S? Actually, ""GULFS"" is a valid word (pl of gulf).

Similarly, ""GULPS"" is gulps.

Another word: ""DUVET"" but E and T are excluded? E and T both excluded.

Perhaps ""BULKS"" - B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed.

""PUMPS"" contains M? P,U,M,P,S -> M is excluded. Cannot.

So, let me list some words:
- BULKS: B, U, L, K, S -> S at the end (pos5)
- FUSSY: F, U, S, S, Y -> S twice? And Y. But two S's: acceptable? But we don't know if the word has two S's? It might. But we might prefer distinct letters to test more.
- BUSKY: archaic.

Common words: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> P1,L2,U3,S4,H5. But S is at position 4? We know from feedback that S is not in position 4 (because in moist at pos4 it was wrong). Therefore, we should avoid putting S in position 4 again? No, we can put it elsewhere.

In ""PLUSH"", if I put S at position 4, and if the secret has S at a different position, it would show as wrong position again? But we already know position 4 is wrong? Actually, we know for sure that position 4 is not correct for S, so it would be redundant to put S in position 4 again. So to save a guess, we should put S in a new position.

Therefore, we should choose a word where S is not in position 4, so position 1,2,3, or 5.

In ""PLUSH"", if we can rearrange? But we cannot rearrange. The word must be valid.

Therefore, ""PLUSH"" has S in position 4? Let's see: if we write PLUSH as P-L-U-S-H, then S is in position 4. But we know position 4 is wrong. So if we guess ""PLUSH"" and put S in position 4, we will get - or x? But we know S is in the word, and position 4 is wrong? So it would show minus again? But that doesn't give new information about the position. So we should avoid wasting a guess by putting S in an already known wrong position.

Therefore, when guessing, we should put S in a position we haven't tried, i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 5? We tried S in position 4 only so far? So we can try position 1,2,3,5.

We haven't tried S in position 1,2,3,5.

So guess a word that has S in one of these positions.

For example, S in position 1: words like ""SKULK"", ""SQUIB"" but SQUIB has I (excluded), so invalid.

""SWILL"" invalid because of I.

""SHALL"" invalid because of A.

""SPILL"" invalid because of I and L repeated? But S,P,I,L,L -> I excluded.

None starting with S seem doable without using excluded letters? 

S with B: ""SBORR"" not word.

S with D: ""SDROP"" invalid.

We might need to consider S not at start.

Put S at position 3, for instance.

Word: ? ? S ? ?

With allowed letters.

For example, ""BUSKY"" not common, but ""BUSKS"" is a word? B,U,S,K,S -> S at position 3 and 5? And B and U are allowed? Yes. K also.

""BUSKS"": B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). So S is at position 3 and 5.

This tests two positions for S? But it has repeated S.

Similarly, ""FUSSY"" F,U,S,S,Y -> S at 3 and 4? Position 4 we know is wrong? So if we put S at 4, it would be wrong? But since we know S is not fixed yet, putting S at a wrong position again might not be efficient? However, if we put S at 3 and 5, that could test both.

But let's try for distinct letters.

Word with S at position 2: for example, ""PSYCH"" not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not valid? ""PSYCH"" is root, but words: ""PSYCH"" alone is not a word. ""PATIO"" has A and T? Excluded.

Hard to find words with S in position 2 without using excluded letters.

Position 5: many words end with S, like ""GUIDS"" not word? ""GUIDs"" not standard. ""GLUTS"" has T? Excluded.

""SPOTS"" has O and T? Excluded.

Perhaps we go with S at position 5: ""UGLIS"" not a word.

Common words ending with S: ""FOCUS"" has O? Excluded. ""CIVIL"" has I and C? Excluded.

Another idea: ""NYMPH"" but has N? Excluded and no S.

So perhaps we use ""GULPS"", which has S at position 5 and avoids position 4.

Similarly, ""LUMPS"" has U,M,P,S -> M? Excluded.

""BUMPS"" same.

How about ""DOWNS"" but O and other letters.

We might have to settle for ""GULPS"" or ""BULKS"".

Let me check ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> S at position 5, and letters are all allowed. And the word is real.

Similarly, ""SULKS"": S at position 1 -> S,U,L,K,S? Not distinct. ""SULKS"" is S,U,L,K,S -> S at 1 and 5? That could work: S(1), U(2), L(3), K(4), S(5). So S is at 1 and 5.

But we haven't tested position 1 and 4? We tested position 4? Not position 1.

In ""SULKS"", S is at positions 1 and 5? And we avoid excluded letters? U and L are allowed? Yes.

Is ""SULKS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to be sullen.

But note: we haven't tested position 1, so putting S at 1 could be correct? And also at 5? It could be.

But let's consider efficiency: we know S is in the word once? But we don't know if there are repeated letters. So guessing ""SULKS"" might be good because it tests both position 1 and 5 for S.

If S is in the word twice? Possible, but less common. But Wordle can have repeated letters.

But since we are limited by letters to choose from, let's choose a word.

To test more new positions: ""SULKS"" tests S at position 1 and 5? Also U, L, and K.

For position 3 we haven't tested S? We tried position 4 only.

So we can try S at position 3.

Word with S at position 3: ? ? S ? ?

With allowed letters: e.g., ""BASTS"" not distinct? ""BLAST"" has A? Excluded.

""DUSTS"" D,U,S,T,S -> T excluded? Cannot.

""GUESS"" has E? Excluded.

""JUSHY"" not word.

""PUSHY"" P,U,S,H,Y -> all allowed? P1,U2,S3,H4,Y5. So S at position 3. This seems good.

Is ""PUSHY"" a word? Yes, as in aggressive.

And it avoids all excluded letters: P,U,S,H,Y are all from allowed set (not in C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T).

So ""PUSHY"" has:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: Y

This way, S is tested at position 3, which is new. We also test P, U, H, and Y.

Compared to ""SULKS"" which tests S at 1 and 5, and L and K.

But ""PUSHY"" tests more new letters: P,U,H,Y.

Also, S at position 3.

We hope this will be informative.

Therefore, I choose ""PUSHY"".
