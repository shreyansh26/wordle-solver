We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. 
 This word has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), which are common.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".
</think>
I'm starting with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it contains common letters: two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This combination helps test frequent letters in the alphabet, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback about which letters are present and their positions. Since we have no prior clues, this balanced approach maximizes information gain.

We are given feedback for the first guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Since all these letters are absent, we must avoid using them in the next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

Also, we should pick a word with letters that are common in English 5-letter words to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Some common letters that are not C, R, A, N, E: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

I think a good second guess might be ""SPLIT"" or ""BUILD"". Let me think of words without C,R,A,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T
- ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H
- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D

We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we should try to test new common letters.

Let's consider the frequencies of letters in English words.

According to English letter frequency, after vowels (we've tested A and E, which are absent), common consonants are S, T, L, D, etc.

But we cannot use E or A, so let's try for S, T, L, I, O.

I think ""SPLIT"" is a good option: S, P, L, I, T.

Another option could be ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.

But ""SPLIT"" has distinct letters and covers S, P, L, I, T.

We could also consider ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T. But that uses U and O, which might not be as common, but still reasonable.

Since we have no information yet, ""SPLIT"" seems solid.

Let me confirm: S, P, L, I, T are all not in the previous excluded list (C,R,A,N,E).

So I'll go with ""SPLIT"".
</think>
Based on the previous guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked absent (✕), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, for the next guess, I must avoid using C, R, A, N, or E and choose a word with entirely new letters to gain maximum information.

I need a word with common English letters not yet tested. After excluding C, R, A, N, E, high-frequency consonants and vowels include S, T, O, L, I, B, D, M, P, U, and H. A strong second guess should:
- Prioritize distinct high-frequency letters to test more possibilities.
- Avoid overusing less common letters.

A suitable word is ""split"". It uses S, P, L, I, T—all common letters and none repeated. This combination covers:
- Two high-frequency consonants (S and T)
- One vowel (I)
- Three additional common consonants (P, L)

Alternatives like ""built"" or ""fluid"" were considered, but ""split"" offers better coverage of common letters while avoiding redundancies.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in word)
2. ""split"": Feedback is S(✓) P(✓) L(-) I(✓) T(x)

Interpretation for guess 2 ""split"":
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T is not in the word.

Since S, P, and I are correct in positions 1, 2, and 4, the secret word has the form: S P _ I _
Also, L is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 5 (since position 4 is I and correct). So the word could be S P _ I L.

But we know T is absent, and from guess 1, C,R,A,N,E are absent, so the word does not contain these.

Now, the missing letter is at position 3. We need to find a letter that fits in position 3 such that the entire word is valid.

Constraints:
- Position 3: Cannot be L (because L is misplaced from position 3 and we now think it's at position 5), cannot be S,P,I (already placed), cannot be T (absent), and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess).
- Remaining letters: We need a letter not in the excluded list: C,R,A,N,E,T are excluded. Also, we have used S,P,L,I in positions 1,2,4, but L is not fixed yet. The word must contain L (since it's present) and we think it's at position 5.

So the word should be: S P ? I L, where ? is a letter not excluded and the word must be valid.

What letters are possible for position 3?
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T (and also any others we haven't encountered but must avoid).

We don't know what other letters are absent, so we need to pick a word that fits the pattern.

Since L is marked as wrong position in ""split"", and if the word is S P ? I L, then indeed L should be at position 5, not 3.

Now, what letters can go in position 3? It must be a letter that hasn't been tried yet? Not necessarily, because we haven't tested all letters.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form SP?IL.

Let me think of words that match SP_IL.

Common words:
- SPOIL: O is not excluded? We haven't tried O. But in ""crane"" we had no O, so O might be possible.
- SPAIL: But A is excluded, so no.
- SPFILL: not 5 letters.
- SPIEL: but E is excluded (from first guess), so E cannot be used.
- SPELL: E and L? E excluded, and we have two L's? But pattern has only one L so far? Also E is excluded.

SPIEL has E, which is excluded. So not that.

What about SPOIL? O is available and not excluded yet.

Also, could we have other words? SPHIL? Not a word.

SPRIL? but R is excluded.

So SPOIL seems a candidate.

But let's check the feedback: In guess 2, T was absent, but O has not been tested.

In ""split"", T was absent, so no T in the word. But in SPOIL, there is no T, so that's fine.

Also, in SPOIL, the positions:
- S at 1: correct
- P at 2: correct
- O at 3: new
- I at 4: correct
- L at 5: correct

In our previous guess ""split"", we had L at position 3, but now it would be at 5. The feedback said L is present but wrong position, which matches because in ""split"" L was at 3, but in SPOIL L is at 5, so it should be correct.

But in SPOIL, we have O which hasn't been tested yet.

Could there be another word? For example, SPBIL? Not a word.

SPGIL? Not a word.

SPUIL? Not a word.

SPMIL? Not a word.

So SPOIL seems to be a common word that fits.

But is O possible? Yes, since we haven't guessed O before.

Alternatively, maybe there is a word where the third letter is different, but SP?IL words are rare. SPOIL is a standard word.

Therefore, we can guess SPOIL.

But let's double-check: we know the word does not contain C,R,A,N,E,T. SPOIL has S, P, O, I, L — O is new and not excluded.

Also, it matches the pattern: positions 1,2,4 are fixed with S,P,I, and L is at 5 which was improperly placed at 3 in guess 2.

In SPOIL, the letter L is at 5, so if the secret word is SPOIL, then in ""split"" we had L at 3, which is wrong, so - is appropriate.

Therefore, I think SPOIL is a good guess.

But just to be thorough, are there other possibilities? What if the secret word is not SP?IL? Could L be in position 3? No, because the feedback said L was misplaced, so it cannot be at position 3. Because we tried it at 3 and got ""-"", meaning it is present but not at 3. Therefore it must be at 4 or 5.

Position 4 is I and correct, so L cannot be at 4. So L must be at position 5.

Hence the only possibility is SP?IL.

Therefore, we guess SPOIL.

But we need to make sure that SPOIL is valid and hasn't had any excluded letters.

Yes.

So the guess should be ""spoil"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent ✗, so these are excluded from the word.
- **Guess 2 (split)**: 
  - S✓ (position 1 correct).
  - P✓ (position 2 correct).
  - L- (present but wrong position; since positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed and position 3 is incorrect, L must be in position 5).
  - I✓ (position 4 correct).
  - T✗ (absent, so T is excluded).

The secret word must have the exact pattern: _S in position 1, P in position 2, I in position 4, and L in position 5 (due to the L feedback). The only unknown is position 3. Thus, the word structure is SP_IL.

Constraints:
- Position 3 cannot be C, R, A, N, E, T (excluded letters).
- Position 3 cannot be S, P, I, or L (already placed).
- The letter must form a valid English word.

After evaluating possible letters for position 3 (considering English words), ""O"" fits perfectly with ""SPOIL"" — a valid 5-letter word that meets all feedback criteria:
- S, P, I, L are correctly placed.
- O is a new, untested letter not in the excluded set.

Other combinations like SP?IL are rare, and SPOIL is the most common word matching the pattern. Given the constraints, SPOIL is a strong candidate for the secret word.

<guess>spoil</guess>",spoil,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in word)
2. ""split"": Feedback is S(✓) P(✓) L(-) I(✓) T(x)

Interpretation for guess 2 ""split"":
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T is not in the word.

Since S, P, and I are correct in positions 1, 2, and 4, the secret word has the form: S P _ I _
Also, L is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 5 (since position 4 is I and correct). So the word could be S P _ I L.

But we know T is absent, and from guess 1, C,R,A,N,E are absent, so the word does not contain these.

Now, the missing letter is at position 3. We need to find a letter that fits in position 3 such that the entire word is valid.

Constraints:
- Position 3: Cannot be L (because L is misplaced from position 3 and we now think it's at position 5), cannot be S,P,I (already placed), cannot be T (absent), and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess).
- Remaining letters: We need a letter not in the excluded list: C,R,A,N,E,T are excluded. Also, we have used S,P,L,I in positions 1,2,4, but L is not fixed yet. The word must contain L (since it's present) and we think it's at position 5.

So the word should be: S P ? I L, where ? is a letter not excluded and the word must be valid.

What letters are possible for position 3?
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T (and also any others we haven't encountered but must avoid).

We don't know what other letters are absent, so we need to pick a word that fits the pattern.

Since L is marked as wrong position in ""split"", and if the word is S P ? I L, then indeed L should be at position 5, not 3.

Now, what letters can go in position 3? It must be a letter that hasn't been tried yet? Not necessarily, because we haven't tested all letters.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form SP?IL.

Let me think of words that match SP_IL.

Common words:
- SPOIL: O is not excluded? We haven't tried O. But in ""crane"" we had no O, so O might be possible.
- SPAIL: But A is excluded, so no.
- SPFILL: not 5 letters.
- SPIEL: but E is excluded (from first guess), so E cannot be used.
- SPELL: E and L? E excluded, and we have two L's? But pattern has only one L so far? Also E is excluded.

SPIEL has E, which is excluded. So not that.

What about SPOIL? O is available and not excluded yet.

Also, could we have other words? SPHIL? Not a word.

SPRIL? but R is excluded.

So SPOIL seems a candidate.

But let's check the feedback: In guess 2, T was absent, but O has not been tested.

In ""split"", T was absent, so no T in the word. But in SPOIL, there is no T, so that's fine.

Also, in SPOIL, the positions:
- S at 1: correct
- P at 2: correct
- O at 3: new
- I at 4: correct
- L at 5: correct

In our previous guess ""split"", we had L at position 3, but now it would be at 5. The feedback said L is present but wrong position, which matches because in ""split"" L was at 3, but in SPOIL L is at 5, so it should be correct.

But in SPOIL, we have O which hasn't been tested yet.

Could there be another word? For example, SPBIL? Not a word.

SPGIL? Not a word.

SPUIL? Not a word.

SPMIL? Not a word.

So SPOIL seems to be a common word that fits.

But is O possible? Yes, since we haven't guessed O before.

Alternatively, maybe there is a word where the third letter is different, but SP?IL words are rare. SPOIL is a standard word.

Therefore, we can guess SPOIL.

But let's double-check: we know the word does not contain C,R,A,N,E,T. SPOIL has S, P, O, I, L — O is new and not excluded.

Also, it matches the pattern: positions 1,2,4 are fixed with S,P,I, and L is at 5 which was improperly placed at 3 in guess 2.

In SPOIL, the letter L is at 5, so if the secret word is SPOIL, then in ""split"" we had L at 3, which is wrong, so - is appropriate.

Therefore, I think SPOIL is a good guess.

But just to be thorough, are there other possibilities? What if the secret word is not SP?IL? Could L be in position 3? No, because the feedback said L was misplaced, so it cannot be at position 3. Because we tried it at 3 and got ""-"", meaning it is present but not at 3. Therefore it must be at 4 or 5.

Position 4 is I and correct, so L cannot be at 4. So L must be at position 5.

Hence the only possibility is SP?IL.

Therefore, we guess SPOIL.

But we need to make sure that SPOIL is valid and hasn't had any excluded letters.

Yes.

So the guess should be ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
