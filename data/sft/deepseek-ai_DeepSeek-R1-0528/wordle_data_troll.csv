We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we can try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- TRYST (but has T at the end and we don't know about T)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (has G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (has B, R, O, I, L)

But note: we don't know if O, U, I, etc. are in the word. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the second position and include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding A, E, and the other excluded letters).

We also know that the word does not have A or E, so it might have other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Let me think of some words:
- PRISM (P, R, I, S, M) -> but we don't know about P, I, S, M.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> similar.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, and also C, N from the first guess.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate because it uses P, I, S, M which are common and we haven't tested them.

Alternatively, ""TRYST"" uses T, R, Y, S, T (but T is repeated, which might not be ideal for getting more information).

Another option: ""SHIRT"" (S, H, I, R, T) but R is in the third position? We need R in the second position.

We must have R as the second letter.

So, let's list words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

Some options:
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> no excluded letters: B, R, I, S, K. R is in position 2. This is valid.
- PRICK (P, R, I, C, K) -> has C, excluded.
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) -> has N, excluded.
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) -> no excluded letters.

So, both ""BRISK"" and ""FRISK"" are good.

But we also have ""GRIMY"" (G, R, I, M, Y) -> no excluded letters.

However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's choose a word that has letters we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C, A, N, E).

I think ""BRISK"" is a solid choice because it uses B, I, S, K which are common.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) is also good and uses P, M.

But note: in ""PRISM"", R is the second letter? 
P-R-I-S-M: positions: 1-P, 2-R, 3-I, 4-S, 5-M -> yes.

So, both are valid.

I could also consider ""TRIPS"" (T, R, I, P, S) -> but that has R in the second position? T-R-I-P-S: yes.

But let me compare:

- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S

We want to maximize the number of new letters. Since we have no information about the other positions, any of these are fine.

I'll go with ""BRISK"" because it's a common word and covers B, I, S, K.

So, my second guess is ""BRISK"".

But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. I believe ""brisk"" is valid.

Therefore, the next guess: BRISK.

In the response format, we just need to output the word in the tags.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (all marked ""x"").
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- I chose ""brisk"" because it:
  - Fits the required pattern (_ R _ _ _).
  - Uses common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been tested yet.
  - Tests multiple new positions, helping to narrow down possibilities.

We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: ""crane""
   - C(x) -> not in word
   - R(✓) -> in word and correct position (so second letter is R)
   - A(x) -> not in word
   - N(x) -> not in word
   - E(x) -> not in word

2. Guess 2: ""brisk""
   - B(x) -> not in word
   - R(✓) -> in word and correct position (second letter R, which we already knew)
   - I(x) -> not in word
   - S(x) -> not in word
   - K(x) -> not in word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _ 
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K. (because they are marked as not in the word)

We now must avoid using any of these letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K.

So, allowed letters are the rest of the alphabet: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Q and Z are less common)

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and second letter is R.

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5], where letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are from the allowed letters set.

Moreover, since we have excluded 8 letters, we have plenty left.

We should consider common vowels and consonants. The vowels left are O, U (and sometimes Y). But note, we don't have A, E, I excluded.

Common consonants left: D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.

We can try to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Some words that fit the pattern and use only allowed letters:

Possible words:

- GROUT: G R O U T -> allowed letters? G: yes, O: yes, U: yes, T: yes. But note: we haven't tested G, O, U, T.
- GROUP: G R O U P -> P is allowed.
- TROMP: T R O M P -> allowed? T, O, M, P are all allowed.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> allowed? P, O, U, D are allowed.
- DROUG: not a word.
- FROTH: F R O T H -> F, O, T, H allowed.
- WRONG: W R O N G -> but N is excluded! Not allowed.
- GROWL: G R O W L -> W and L allowed? Yes, but note: W and L are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word exists.

Another idea: since we have limited vowels, we might use O or U.

Let me list more words:

- TROUP: T R O U P -> troup is a word? Troup might be less common, but ""troupe"" is a 6-letter word. So, not.

Perhaps: ""PROWL"" - P R O W L -> allowed? P, O, W, L: all allowed.

But note: we have not excluded L, W, P, O, etc.

Also ""GROWL"" - G R O W L -> same.

But let me check a word list mentally.

Another common word: ""THROW"" - T H R O W -> but wait, R is second, so this would be T H R O W -> positions: 1:T, 2:H? No, we need second letter to be R. So ""THROW"" has R as third letter? T-H-R-O-W: position 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> so doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: [anything] R [anything] [anything] [anything] with the first anything at position1, then R at position2, etc.

So:

- CROWD: C is excluded -> invalid.
- FROWN: F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.
- DROWN: D R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.
- PROOF: P R O O F -> allowed? P, O, F: yes. But note: there is a double O? The word could be ""proof"", and it's 5 letters? P-R-O-O-F -> yes, 5 letters.

Similarly, ""PROWL"": P R O W L -> allowed.

""GROVE"": G R O V E -> E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded (from ""crane"") -> so invalid.

""TROVE"": T R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""DROVE"": D R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""GROPE"": G R O P E -> E excluded -> invalid.

So without E, we have:

- PROWL (P, R, O, W, L)
- GROWL (G, R, O, W, L) -> but G and L are new.
- TROMP (if that's a word) - not common.
- FROTH (F, R, O, T, H)

Also, ""DRUGS"": D R U G S -> S excluded -> invalid.

""TRUMP"": T R U M P -> U and M allowed? Yes.

""GRUMP"": G R U M P -> same.

Another one: ""PROUD"": P R O U D -> allowed? P, O, U, D: all allowed.

So, let me choose ""PROUD"" because it has common letters and tests P, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests P, O, W, L.

But W is less common? Maybe not.

I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice because it includes U which is a vowel we haven't tested.

So, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But let me confirm: ""PROUD"" - P R O U D -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, D are not excluded. Yes.

Therefore, we guess ""PROUD"".

So, the next guess word: PROUD.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has 'R' as the second letter (confirmed by both guesses).
- Excluded letters (marked 'x'): C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K. These do not appear in the secret word.
- The possible letters are now limited to D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K are excluded).

For the next guess:
- The word must have 'R' in the second position and avoid all excluded letters.
- I chose ""PROUD"" because it:
  - Fits the pattern: P (new letter) / R (fixed) / O (new vowel) / U (new vowel) / D (new consonant).
  - Tests high-frequency letters like O, U, and D.
  - Maximizes information gain by covering multiple untested letters.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we can try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- TRYST (but has T at the end and we don't know about T)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (has G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (has B, R, O, I, L)

But note: we don't know if O, U, I, etc. are in the word. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the second position and include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding A, E, and the other excluded letters).

We also know that the word does not have A or E, so it might have other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Let me think of some words:
- PRISM (P, R, I, S, M) -> but we don't know about P, I, S, M.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> similar.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, and also C, N from the first guess.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate because it uses P, I, S, M which are common and we haven't tested them.

Alternatively, ""TRYST"" uses T, R, Y, S, T (but T is repeated, which might not be ideal for getting more information).

Another option: ""SHIRT"" (S, H, I, R, T) but R is in the third position? We need R in the second position.

We must have R as the second letter.

So, let's list words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

Some options:
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> no excluded letters: B, R, I, S, K. R is in position 2. This is valid.
- PRICK (P, R, I, C, K) -> has C, excluded.
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) -> has N, excluded.
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) -> no excluded letters.

So, both ""BRISK"" and ""FRISK"" are good.

But we also have ""GRIMY"" (G, R, I, M, Y) -> no excluded letters.

However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's choose a word that has letters we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C, A, N, E).

I think ""BRISK"" is a solid choice because it uses B, I, S, K which are common.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) is also good and uses P, M.

But note: in ""PRISM"", R is the second letter? 
P-R-I-S-M: positions: 1-P, 2-R, 3-I, 4-S, 5-M -> yes.

So, both are valid.

I could also consider ""TRIPS"" (T, R, I, P, S) -> but that has R in the second position? T-R-I-P-S: yes.

But let me compare:

- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S

We want to maximize the number of new letters. Since we have no information about the other positions, any of these are fine.

I'll go with ""BRISK"" because it's a common word and covers B, I, S, K.

So, my second guess is ""BRISK"".

But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. I believe ""brisk"" is valid.

Therefore, the next guess: BRISK.

In the response format, we just need to output the word in the tags.

<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (all marked ""x"").
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- I chose ""brisk"" because it:
  - Fits the required pattern (_ R _ _ _).
  - Uses common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been tested yet.
  - Tests multiple new positions, helping to narrow down possibilities.

Perhaps: ""PROWL"" - P R O W L -> allowed? P, O, W, L: all allowed.

But note: we have not excluded L, W, P, O, etc.

Also ""GROWL"" - G R O W L -> same.

But let me check a word list mentally.

Another common word: ""THROW"" - T H R O W -> but wait, R is second, so this would be T H R O W -> positions: 1:T, 2:H? No, we need second letter to be R. So ""THROW"" has R as third letter? T-H-R-O-W: position 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> so doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: [anything] R [anything] [anything] [anything] with the first anything at position1, then R at position2, etc.

So:

- CROWD: C is excluded -> invalid.
- FROWN: F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.
- DROWN: D R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.
- PROOF: P R O O F -> allowed? P, O, F: yes. But note: there is a double O? The word could be ""proof"", and it's 5 letters? P-R-O-O-F -> yes, 5 letters.

Similarly, ""PROWL"": P R O W L -> allowed.

""GROVE"": G R O V E -> E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded (from ""crane"") -> so invalid.

""TROVE"": T R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""DROVE"": D R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""GROPE"": G R O P E -> E excluded -> invalid.

So without E, we have:

- PROWL (P, R, O, W, L)
- GROWL (G, R, O, W, L) -> but G and L are new.
- TROMP (if that's a word) - not common.
- FROTH (F, R, O, T, H)

Also, ""DRUGS"": D R U G S -> S excluded -> invalid.

""TRUMP"": T R U M P -> U and M allowed? Yes.

""GRUMP"": G R U M P -> same.

Another one: ""PROUD"": P R O U D -> allowed? P, O, U, D: all allowed.

So, let me choose ""PROUD"" because it has common letters and tests P, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests P, O, W, L.

But W is less common? Maybe not.

I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice because it includes U which is a vowel we haven't tested.

So, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But let me confirm: ""PROUD"" - P R O U D -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, D are not excluded. Yes.

Therefore, we guess ""PROUD"".

So, the next guess word: PROUD.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has 'R' as the second letter (confirmed by both guesses).
- Excluded letters (marked 'x'): C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K. These do not appear in the secret word.
- The possible letters are now limited to D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K are excluded).

For the next guess:
- The word must have 'R' in the second position and avoid all excluded letters.
- I chose ""PROUD"" because it:
  - Fits the pattern: P (new letter) / R (fixed) / O (new vowel) / U (new vowel) / D (new consonant).
  - Tests high-frequency letters like O, U, and D.
  - Maximizes information gain by covering multiple untested letters.

Now, guessing: ""PROUD""

We are given feedback from Guess 3: ""proud"" -> P(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), D(x)

Combining with previous feedback:
- From Guess 1: R is in the correct position (second letter), and C,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From Guess 2: B,I,S,K are not in the word.
- From Guess 3: 
  - P is not in the word.
  - R is confirmed again (second letter).
  - O is in the word and in the correct position. Since O is the third letter in ""proud"", and it's marked ✓, that means the third letter of the secret word is O.
  - U is not in the word.
  - D is not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R O _ _
- Excluded letters (definitely not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D

We have fixed: second letter R, third letter O.

So the word is: [letter1] R O [letter4] [letter5]

We need to choose letter1, letter4, and letter5 from the remaining alphabet excluding the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D

Remaining letters: F, G, H, L, M, O*, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Note: O is already used in position 3, but it could potentially be used again? However, the feedback from ""proud"" had O marked as correct position only once, but we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since in ""proud"" there was only one O, and it was marked correct, the secret word might have only one O or more. We must consider the possibility of duplicate letters. However, since we haven't seen multiple O's yet, we'll proceed cautiously.

But note: the excluded letters are only letters that are completely absent, so O is present at least in position 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O in position 3
- Does not use any excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D
- And we want to test new letters for positions 1,4,5.

So the pattern: ? R O ? ?

We have to pick letters from F,G,H,L,M,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z and possibly O again? But O in position 3 is already fixed, so in positions 1,4,5, the letters could be any from the remaining set including F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc. But note, Q is uncommon.

Common letters left: F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,Y,Z (since X is uncommon).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern ? R O ? ? and use only allowed letters:

Examples:
- TROTH: T R O T H -> T is allowed, H is allowed. But note: T is in position1 and position4? We don't know about duplicates.
- GROWL: G R O W L -> G and L allowed? Yes, but note: W and L are allowed.
- FROTH: F R O T H -> F allowed? Yes.
- THROW: But position: T H R O W -> R is not in second? Position: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> doesn't match (we need second letter R). So ""THROW"", ""GROWL"", etc. must have R exactly at position 2.
- WRONG: W R O N G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.
- PROWL: P is excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""TROLL"" - T R O L L -> L allowed? Yes. But letters: T, L.
- ""TROMB"": not a word?
- ""GROUP"": G R O U P -> U excluded -> invalid.

With U excluded, words with U are out.

Another possibility: ""TROOP"" - T R O O P -> P excluded -> invalid.

""GROVE"": G R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""FROZE"" - F R O Z E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""WROTE"": W R O T E -> E excluded -> invalid.

So we cannot use E.

Perhaps ""GROWL"" is good: G R O W L

But note, we have the pattern: ? R O ? ? so position4 and5: in ""GROWL"" it's W and L.

Similarly, ""TROTH"": T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T? Duplicate T? Okay, but it's a valid word? Troth (meaning faith, or vow).

Also possible: ""FROWN"" - F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.

""CROWD"": C excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""TROVE"": T R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""GROSS"": G R O S S -> S excluded -> invalid.

""PROXY"": P excluded -> invalid.

So without E, U, P, etc., the options are limited.

Possibly: ""GROWL"", ""TROLL"", ""TROTH"", ""TROYS"" (if that's a word? Troy, but Troy is 4 letters? Troys might not be common).

Another: ""FROSH"" - F R O S H -> S excluded -> invalid.

""VROOM"": V is allowed? V R O O M -> note: O is duplicated? Vrooom is not a standard five-letter word? ""Vroom"" might be 5: V-R-O-O-M? But then it has two O's? Let me check: V R O O M -> positions: 1:V, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:M. But the third letter is fixed as O, and the fourth is also O? That is possible because O could be duplicated.

But we don't know if O appears multiple times. The feedback so far only showed O in position 3, not necessarily duplicated.

Word ""vroom"" is accepted? We'll assume standard words. But let's avoid ambiguity.

Perhaps ""GROMY"" is not valid.

Better option: ""TROMP"" (as previously?) but might not be common.

Perhaps ""THROB"": T H R O B -> but position: T(1), H(2)? H is at position 2, when we need R at position 2 -> invalid.

We must have R at position 2 and O at position 3.

So back to:

- Groan: G R O A N -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
- Drool: D R O O L -> D excluded -> invalid.

Another idea: WROTH - W R O T H -> W and T allowed? Yes.

Also, ""FROWL"" not a word.

I think ""GROWL"" is acceptable.

Similarly, ""TROLL"" is a word.

Also, ""TROPHY"" is 6 letters.

""TROUT"": T R O U T -> U excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose ""TROLL"" because it uses T, L which are common.

But wait, position1:T, position4:L, position5:L? ""TROLL"" is T-R-O-L-L -> so last letter L? Actually, T R O L L: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:L, 5:L -> so letter4 and letter5 are both L? Duplicates.

Similarly, ""TROTH"" has duplicate T: T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T.

Both are possible.

We could also consider ""VROOM"": V R O O M, which has two O's: position3 O and position4 O.

But again, O is already known at position3, and we are testing for duplicates.

But we don't have any information on duplicates yet.

Another word: ""WRACK"" -> K excluded -> invalid.

Perhaps ""GRAMY"" not a word.

Let me think of common words:

""FROST"": F R O S T -> S excluded -> invalid.

""TRIPY"" not a word.

Alternative: ""WRYLY"" - W R Y L Y -> but does not have O in third position -> invalid.

We need O exactly at third.

Perhaps ""ARROW"" is A excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""TROOP"" -> O at third? T-R-O-O-P: but O at third and fourth, but P excluded -> invalid.

""GORGE"": position: G(1), O(2)? But we need R at second -> invalid.

Focus on words with pattern [F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,Y,Z]R O [same set] [same set]

For example:
- From L: ""TROLL"" (TRO?L but with double L)
- From G: ""GROWL"" (GROWL)
- From F: ""FROTH"" - F R O T H -> T and H allowed? Yes.

""FROTH"" uses F, T, H.

Also, ""THROW"" is not pattern.

Another: ""WROTE"" -> E excluded.

But ""WROOT"": not a word.

""TROYS"" - if plural of troy, but not typical.

I think ""GROWL"" is safer.

But note: in ""GROWL"", we use G, W, L. And O is duplicated? No, only one O at position 3.

Similarly, ""TROLL"": uses T, L, L.

We have to choose one that maximizes new letters.

Since we have more possibilities, I'll go with ""GROWL"" because it tests G and W and L.

But L appears only once? GROWL: G-R-O-W-L -> letters: G,W,L. No duplicates.

Similarly, ""FROTH"" is F-R-O-T-H -> F,T,H.

Either is good.

Let me choose ""GROWL"" to test G.

So, guess is ""GROWL"".

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess).

Therefore, we make the guess: GROWL.

But let me confirm: GROWL is a valid word? Yes.

Now, output the guess.

<guess>growl</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

- **Secret word pattern**: The second letter is confirmed as 'R' (from both Guess 1 and 2), and the third letter is confirmed as 'O' (from Guess 3). The secret word has the pattern: `_ R O _ _`.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), B, I, S, K (from Guess 2), P, U, D (from Guess 3). These letters do not appear anywhere in the secret word.
- **Available letters**: The remaining letters are F, G, H, L, M, T, V, W, Y, Z (and Q/X are rare but possible). We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with new letters to maximize information gain.
- **Goal**: Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R O _ _`, avoids excluded letters, and tests common unused letters (e.g., G, W, L, F) to narrow down possibilities.
- **Possible words considered**:
  - Words like `TROLL` (T, L) or `FROTH` (F, T, H) were evaluated but have duplicates or test fewer letters.
  - `GROWL` fits perfectly: it starts with G, ends with W and L, all new high-frequency letters. This tests G in position 1, W in position 4, and L in position 5, providing broad coverage.
- **Why this guess?**: `GROWL` efficiently probes for presence/absence of three key unused letters (G, W, L) while maintaining the known `R O` in positions 2-3. Even if incorrect, the feedback will significantly reduce the solution space.

<guess>growl</guess>",growl,"We are given feedback from Guess 3: ""proud"" -> P(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), D(x)

Combining with previous feedback:
- From Guess 1: R is in the correct position (second letter), and C,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From Guess 2: B,I,S,K are not in the word.
- From Guess 3: 
  - P is not in the word.
  - R is confirmed again (second letter).
  - O is in the word and in the correct position. Since O is the third letter in ""proud"", and it's marked ✓, that means the third letter of the secret word is O.
  - U is not in the word.
  - D is not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R O _ _
- Excluded letters (definitely not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D

We have fixed: second letter R, third letter O.

So the word is: [letter1] R O [letter4] [letter5]

We need to choose letter1, letter4, and letter5 from the remaining alphabet excluding the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D

Remaining letters: F, G, H, L, M, O*, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Note: O is already used in position 3, but it could potentially be used again? However, the feedback from ""proud"" had O marked as correct position only once, but we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since in ""proud"" there was only one O, and it was marked correct, the secret word might have only one O or more. We must consider the possibility of duplicate letters. However, since we haven't seen multiple O's yet, we'll proceed cautiously.

But note: the excluded letters are only letters that are completely absent, so O is present at least in position 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O in position 3
- Does not use any excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D
- And we want to test new letters for positions 1,4,5.

So the pattern: ? R O ? ?

We have to pick letters from F,G,H,L,M,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z and possibly O again? But O in position 3 is already fixed, so in positions 1,4,5, the letters could be any from the remaining set including F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc. But note, Q is uncommon.

Common letters left: F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,Y,Z (since X is uncommon).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern ? R O ? ? and use only allowed letters:

Examples:
- TROTH: T R O T H -> T is allowed, H is allowed. But note: T is in position1 and position4? We don't know about duplicates.
- GROWL: G R O W L -> G and L allowed? Yes, but note: W and L are allowed.
- FROTH: F R O T H -> F allowed? Yes.
- THROW: But position: T H R O W -> R is not in second? Position: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> doesn't match (we need second letter R). So ""THROW"", ""GROWL"", etc. must have R exactly at position 2.
- WRONG: W R O N G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.
- PROWL: P is excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""TROLL"" - T R O L L -> L allowed? Yes. But letters: T, L.
- ""TROMB"": not a word?
- ""GROUP"": G R O U P -> U excluded -> invalid.

With U excluded, words with U are out.

Another possibility: ""TROOP"" - T R O O P -> P excluded -> invalid.

""GROVE"": G R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""FROZE"" - F R O Z E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""WROTE"": W R O T E -> E excluded -> invalid.

So we cannot use E.

Perhaps ""GROWL"" is good: G R O W L

But note, we have the pattern: ? R O ? ? so position4 and5: in ""GROWL"" it's W and L.

Similarly, ""TROTH"": T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T? Duplicate T? Okay, but it's a valid word? Troth (meaning faith, or vow).

Also possible: ""FROWN"" - F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.

""CROWD"": C excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""TROVE"": T R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""GROSS"": G R O S S -> S excluded -> invalid.

""PROXY"": P excluded -> invalid.

So without E, U, P, etc., the options are limited.

Possibly: ""GROWL"", ""TROLL"", ""TROTH"", ""TROYS"" (if that's a word? Troy, but Troy is 4 letters? Troys might not be common).

Another: ""FROSH"" - F R O S H -> S excluded -> invalid.

""VROOM"": V is allowed? V R O O M -> note: O is duplicated? Vrooom is not a standard five-letter word? ""Vroom"" might be 5: V-R-O-O-M? But then it has two O's? Let me check: V R O O M -> positions: 1:V, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:M. But the third letter is fixed as O, and the fourth is also O? That is possible because O could be duplicated.

But we don't know if O appears multiple times. The feedback so far only showed O in position 3, not necessarily duplicated.

Word ""vroom"" is accepted? We'll assume standard words. But let's avoid ambiguity.

Perhaps ""GROMY"" is not valid.

Better option: ""TROMP"" (as previously?) but might not be common.

Perhaps ""THROB"": T H R O B -> but position: T(1), H(2)? H is at position 2, when we need R at position 2 -> invalid.

We must have R at position 2 and O at position 3.

So back to:

- Groan: G R O A N -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
- Drool: D R O O L -> D excluded -> invalid.

Another idea: WROTH - W R O T H -> W and T allowed? Yes.

Also, ""FROWL"" not a word.

I think ""GROWL"" is acceptable.

Similarly, ""TROLL"" is a word.

Also, ""TROPHY"" is 6 letters.

""TROUT"": T R O U T -> U excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose ""TROLL"" because it uses T, L which are common.

But wait, position1:T, position4:L, position5:L? ""TROLL"" is T-R-O-L-L -> so last letter L? Actually, T R O L L: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:L, 5:L -> so letter4 and letter5 are both L? Duplicates.

Similarly, ""TROTH"" has duplicate T: T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T.

Both are possible.

We could also consider ""VROOM"": V R O O M, which has two O's: position3 O and position4 O.

But again, O is already known at position3, and we are testing for duplicates.

But we don't have any information on duplicates yet.

Another word: ""WRACK"" -> K excluded -> invalid.

Perhaps ""GRAMY"" not a word.

Let me think of common words:

""FROST"": F R O S T -> S excluded -> invalid.

""TRIPY"" not a word.

Alternative: ""WRYLY"" - W R Y L Y -> but does not have O in third position -> invalid.

We need O exactly at third.

Perhaps ""ARROW"" is A excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""TROOP"" -> O at third? T-R-O-O-P: but O at third and fourth, but P excluded -> invalid.

""GORGE"": position: G(1), O(2)? But we need R at second -> invalid.

Focus on words with pattern [F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,Y,Z]R O [same set] [same set]

For example:
- From L: ""TROLL"" (TRO?L but with double L)
- From G: ""GROWL"" (GROWL)
- From F: ""FROTH"" - F R O T H -> T and H allowed? Yes.

""FROTH"" uses F, T, H.

Also, ""THROW"" is not pattern.

Another: ""WROTE"" -> E excluded.

But ""WROOT"": not a word.

""TROYS"" - if plural of troy, but not typical.

I think ""GROWL"" is safer.

But note: in ""GROWL"", we use G, W, L. And O is duplicated? No, only one O at position 3.

Similarly, ""TROLL"": uses T, L, L.

We have to choose one that maximizes new letters.

Since we have more possibilities, I'll go with ""GROWL"" because it tests G and W and L.

But L appears only once? GROWL: G-R-O-W-L -> letters: G,W,L. No duplicates.

Similarly, ""FROTH"" is F-R-O-T-H -> F,T,H.

Either is good.

Let me choose ""GROWL"" to test G.

So, guess is ""GROWL"".

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess).

Therefore, we make the guess: GROWL.

But let me confirm: GROWL is a valid word? Yes.

Now, output the guess.

<guess>growl</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

- **Secret word pattern**: The second letter is confirmed as 'R' (from both Guess 1 and 2), and the third letter is confirmed as 'O' (from Guess 3). The secret word has the pattern: `_ R O _ _`.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), B, I, S, K (from Guess 2), P, U, D (from Guess 3). These letters do not appear anywhere in the secret word.
- **Available letters**: The remaining letters are F, G, H, L, M, T, V, W, Y, Z (and Q/X are rare but possible). We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with new letters to maximize information gain.
- **Goal**: Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R O _ _`, avoids excluded letters, and tests common unused letters (e.g., G, W, L, F) to narrow down possibilities.
- **Possible words considered**:
  - Words like `TROLL` (T, L) or `FROTH` (F, T, H) were evaluated but have duplicates or test fewer letters.
  - `GROWL` fits perfectly: it starts with G, ends with W and L, all new high-frequency letters. This tests G in position 1, W in position 4, and L in position 5, providing broad coverage.
- **Why this guess?**: `GROWL` efficiently probes for presence/absence of three key unused letters (G, W, L) while maintaining the known `R O` in positions 2-3. Even if incorrect, the feedback will significantly reduce the solution space.",Guess 4: growl -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we can try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- TRYST (but has T at the end and we don't know about T)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (has G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (has B, R, O, I, L)

But note: we don't know if O, U, I, etc. are in the word. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the second position and include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding A, E, and the other excluded letters).

We also know that the word does not have A or E, so it might have other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Let me think of some words:
- PRISM (P, R, I, S, M) -> but we don't know about P, I, S, M.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> similar.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, and also C, N from the first guess.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate because it uses P, I, S, M which are common and we haven't tested them.

Alternatively, ""TRYST"" uses T, R, Y, S, T (but T is repeated, which might not be ideal for getting more information).

Another option: ""SHIRT"" (S, H, I, R, T) but R is in the third position? We need R in the second position.

We must have R as the second letter.

So, let's list words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

Some options:
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> no excluded letters: B, R, I, S, K. R is in position 2. This is valid.
- PRICK (P, R, I, C, K) -> has C, excluded.
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) -> has N, excluded.
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) -> no excluded letters.

So, both ""BRISK"" and ""FRISK"" are good.

But we also have ""GRIMY"" (G, R, I, M, Y) -> no excluded letters.

However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's choose a word that has letters we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C, A, N, E).

I think ""BRISK"" is a solid choice because it uses B, I, S, K which are common.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) is also good and uses P, M.

But note: in ""PRISM"", R is the second letter? 
P-R-I-S-M: positions: 1-P, 2-R, 3-I, 4-S, 5-M -> yes.

So, both are valid.

I could also consider ""TRIPS"" (T, R, I, P, S) -> but that has R in the second position? T-R-I-P-S: yes.

But let me compare:

- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S

We want to maximize the number of new letters. Since we have no information about the other positions, any of these are fine.

I'll go with ""BRISK"" because it's a common word and covers B, I, S, K.

So, my second guess is ""BRISK"".

But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. I believe ""brisk"" is valid.

Therefore, the next guess: BRISK.

In the response format, we just need to output the word in the tags.

<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (all marked ""x"").
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- I chose ""brisk"" because it:
  - Fits the required pattern (_ R _ _ _).
  - Uses common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been tested yet.
  - Tests multiple new positions, helping to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: ""crane""
   - C(x) -> not in word
   - R(✓) -> in word and correct position (so second letter is R)
   - A(x) -> not in word
   - N(x) -> not in word
   - E(x) -> not in word

2. Guess 2: ""brisk""
   - B(x) -> not in word
   - R(✓) -> in word and correct position (second letter R, which we already knew)
   - I(x) -> not in word
   - S(x) -> not in word
   - K(x) -> not in word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _ 
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K. (because they are marked as not in the word)

We now must avoid using any of these letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K.

So, allowed letters are the rest of the alphabet: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Q and Z are less common)

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and second letter is R.

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5], where letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are from the allowed letters set.

Moreover, since we have excluded 8 letters, we have plenty left.

We should consider common vowels and consonants. The vowels left are O, U (and sometimes Y). But note, we don't have A, E, I excluded.

Common consonants left: D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.

We can try to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Some words that fit the pattern and use only allowed letters:

Possible words:

- GROUT: G R O U T -> allowed letters? G: yes, O: yes, U: yes, T: yes. But note: we haven't tested G, O, U, T.
- GROUP: G R O U P -> P is allowed.
- TROMP: T R O M P -> allowed? T, O, M, P are all allowed.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> allowed? P, O, U, D are allowed.
- DROUG: not a word.
- FROTH: F R O T H -> F, O, T, H allowed.
- WRONG: W R O N G -> but N is excluded! Not allowed.
- GROWL: G R O W L -> W and L allowed? Yes, but note: W and L are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word exists.

Another idea: since we have limited vowels, we might use O or U.

Let me list more words:

- TROUP: T R O U P -> troup is a word? Troup might be less common, but ""troupe"" is a 6-letter word. So, not.

Perhaps: ""PROWL"" - P R O W L -> allowed? P, O, W, L: all allowed.

But note: we have not excluded L, W, P, O, etc.

Also ""GROWL"" - G R O W L -> same.

But let me check a word list mentally.

Another common word: ""THROW"" - T H R O W -> but wait, R is second, so this would be T H R O W -> positions: 1:T, 2:H? No, we need second letter to be R. So ""THROW"" has R as third letter? T-H-R-O-W: position 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> so doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: [anything] R [anything] [anything] [anything] with the first anything at position1, then R at position2, etc.

So:

- CROWD: C is excluded -> invalid.
- FROWN: F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.
- DROWN: D R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.
- PROOF: P R O O F -> allowed? P, O, F: yes. But note: there is a double O? The word could be ""proof"", and it's 5 letters? P-R-O-O-F -> yes, 5 letters.

Similarly, ""PROWL"": P R O W L -> allowed.

""GROVE"": G R O V E -> E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded (from ""crane"") -> so invalid.

""TROVE"": T R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""DROVE"": D R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""GROPE"": G R O P E -> E excluded -> invalid.

So without E, we have:

- PROWL (P, R, O, W, L)
- GROWL (G, R, O, W, L) -> but G and L are new.
- TROMP (if that's a word) - not common.
- FROTH (F, R, O, T, H)

Also, ""DRUGS"": D R U G S -> S excluded -> invalid.

""TRUMP"": T R U M P -> U and M allowed? Yes.

""GRUMP"": G R U M P -> same.

Another one: ""PROUD"": P R O U D -> allowed? P, O, U, D: all allowed.

So, let me choose ""PROUD"" because it has common letters and tests P, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests P, O, W, L.

But W is less common? Maybe not.

I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice because it includes U which is a vowel we haven't tested.

So, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But let me confirm: ""PROUD"" - P R O U D -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, D are not excluded. Yes.

Therefore, we guess ""PROUD"".

So, the next guess word: PROUD.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has 'R' as the second letter (confirmed by both guesses).
- Excluded letters (marked 'x'): C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K. These do not appear in the secret word.
- The possible letters are now limited to D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K are excluded).

For the next guess:
- The word must have 'R' in the second position and avoid all excluded letters.
- I chose ""PROUD"" because it:
  - Fits the pattern: P (new letter) / R (fixed) / O (new vowel) / U (new vowel) / D (new consonant).
  - Tests high-frequency letters like O, U, and D.
  - Maximizes information gain by covering multiple untested letters.

Now, guessing: ""PROUD""

<guess>proud</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) K(x)
Guess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from Guess 3: ""proud"" -> P(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), D(x)

Combining with previous feedback:
- From Guess 1: R is in the correct position (second letter), and C,A,N,E are not in the word.
- From Guess 2: B,I,S,K are not in the word.
- From Guess 3: 
  - P is not in the word.
  - R is confirmed again (second letter).
  - O is in the word and in the correct position. Since O is the third letter in ""proud"", and it's marked ✓, that means the third letter of the secret word is O.
  - U is not in the word.
  - D is not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R O _ _
- Excluded letters (definitely not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D

We have fixed: second letter R, third letter O.

So the word is: [letter1] R O [letter4] [letter5]

We need to choose letter1, letter4, and letter5 from the remaining alphabet excluding the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D

Remaining letters: F, G, H, L, M, O*, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Note: O is already used in position 3, but it could potentially be used again? However, the feedback from ""proud"" had O marked as correct position only once, but we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But since in ""proud"" there was only one O, and it was marked correct, the secret word might have only one O or more. We must consider the possibility of duplicate letters. However, since we haven't seen multiple O's yet, we'll proceed cautiously.

But note: the excluded letters are only letters that are completely absent, so O is present at least in position 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O in position 3
- Does not use any excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D
- And we want to test new letters for positions 1,4,5.

So the pattern: ? R O ? ?

We have to pick letters from F,G,H,L,M,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z and possibly O again? But O in position 3 is already fixed, so in positions 1,4,5, the letters could be any from the remaining set including F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc. But note, Q is uncommon.

Common letters left: F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,Y,Z (since X is uncommon).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern ? R O ? ? and use only allowed letters:

Examples:
- TROTH: T R O T H -> T is allowed, H is allowed. But note: T is in position1 and position4? We don't know about duplicates.
- GROWL: G R O W L -> G and L allowed? Yes, but note: W and L are allowed.
- FROTH: F R O T H -> F allowed? Yes.
- THROW: But position: T H R O W -> R is not in second? Position: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> doesn't match (we need second letter R). So ""THROW"", ""GROWL"", etc. must have R exactly at position 2.
- WRONG: W R O N G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.
- PROWL: P is excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""TROLL"" - T R O L L -> L allowed? Yes. But letters: T, L.
- ""TROMB"": not a word?
- ""GROUP"": G R O U P -> U excluded -> invalid.

With U excluded, words with U are out.

Another possibility: ""TROOP"" - T R O O P -> P excluded -> invalid.

""GROVE"": G R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""FROZE"" - F R O Z E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""WROTE"": W R O T E -> E excluded -> invalid.

So we cannot use E.

Perhaps ""GROWL"" is good: G R O W L

But note, we have the pattern: ? R O ? ? so position4 and5: in ""GROWL"" it's W and L.

Similarly, ""TROTH"": T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T? Duplicate T? Okay, but it's a valid word? Troth (meaning faith, or vow).

Also possible: ""FROWN"" - F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.

""CROWD"": C excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""TROVE"": T R O V E -> E excluded -> invalid.

""GROSS"": G R O S S -> S excluded -> invalid.

""PROXY"": P excluded -> invalid.

So without E, U, P, etc., the options are limited.

Possibly: ""GROWL"", ""TROLL"", ""TROTH"", ""TROYS"" (if that's a word? Troy, but Troy is 4 letters? Troys might not be common).

Another: ""FROSH"" - F R O S H -> S excluded -> invalid.

""VROOM"": V is allowed? V R O O M -> note: O is duplicated? Vrooom is not a standard five-letter word? ""Vroom"" might be 5: V-R-O-O-M? But then it has two O's? Let me check: V R O O M -> positions: 1:V, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:M. But the third letter is fixed as O, and the fourth is also O? That is possible because O could be duplicated.

But we don't know if O appears multiple times. The feedback so far only showed O in position 3, not necessarily duplicated.

Word ""vroom"" is accepted? We'll assume standard words. But let's avoid ambiguity.

Perhaps ""GROMY"" is not valid.

Better option: ""TROMP"" (as previously?) but might not be common.

Perhaps ""THROB"": T H R O B -> but position: T(1), H(2)? H is at position 2, when we need R at position 2 -> invalid.

We must have R at position 2 and O at position 3.

So back to:

- Groan: G R O A N -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
- Drool: D R O O L -> D excluded -> invalid.

Another idea: WROTH - W R O T H -> W and T allowed? Yes.

Also, ""FROWL"" not a word.

I think ""GROWL"" is acceptable.

Similarly, ""TROLL"" is a word.

Also, ""TROPHY"" is 6 letters.

""TROUT"": T R O U T -> U excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose ""TROLL"" because it uses T, L which are common.

But wait, position1:T, position4:L, position5:L? ""TROLL"" is T-R-O-L-L -> so last letter L? Actually, T R O L L: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:L, 5:L -> so letter4 and letter5 are both L? Duplicates.

Similarly, ""TROTH"" has duplicate T: T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T.

Both are possible.

We could also consider ""VROOM"": V R O O M, which has two O's: position3 O and position4 O.

But again, O is already known at position3, and we are testing for duplicates.

But we don't have any information on duplicates yet.

Another word: ""WRACK"" -> K excluded -> invalid.

Perhaps ""GRAMY"" not a word.

Let me think of common words:

""FROST"": F R O S T -> S excluded -> invalid.

""TRIPY"" not a word.

Alternative: ""WRYLY"" - W R Y L Y -> but does not have O in third position -> invalid.

We need O exactly at third.

Perhaps ""ARROW"" is A excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""TROOP"" -> O at third? T-R-O-O-P: but O at third and fourth, but P excluded -> invalid.

""GORGE"": position: G(1), O(2)? But we need R at second -> invalid.

Focus on words with pattern [F,G,H,L,M,T,V,W,Y,Z]R O [same set] [same set]

For example:
- From L: ""TROLL"" (TRO?L but with double L)
- From G: ""GROWL"" (GROWL)
- From F: ""FROTH"" - F R O T H -> T and H allowed? Yes.

""FROTH"" uses F, T, H.

Also, ""THROW"" is not pattern.

Another: ""WROTE"" -> E excluded.

But ""WROOT"": not a word.

""TROYS"" - if plural of troy, but not typical.

I think ""GROWL"" is safer.

But note: in ""GROWL"", we use G, W, L. And O is duplicated? No, only one O at position 3.

Similarly, ""TROLL"": uses T, L, L.

We have to choose one that maximizes new letters.

Since we have more possibilities, I'll go with ""GROWL"" because it tests G and W and L.

But L appears only once? GROWL: G-R-O-W-L -> letters: G,W,L. No duplicates.

Similarly, ""FROTH"" is F-R-O-T-H -> F,T,H.

Either is good.

Let me choose ""GROWL"" to test G.

So, guess is ""GROWL"".

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess).

Therefore, we make the guess: GROWL.

But let me confirm: GROWL is a valid word? Yes.

Now, output the guess.

<guess>growl</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

- **Secret word pattern**: The second letter is confirmed as 'R' (from both Guess 1 and 2), and the third letter is confirmed as 'O' (from Guess 3). The secret word has the pattern: `_ R O _ _`.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), B, I, S, K (from Guess 2), P, U, D (from Guess 3). These letters do not appear anywhere in the secret word.
- **Available letters**: The remaining letters are F, G, H, L, M, T, V, W, Y, Z (and Q/X are rare but possible). We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with new letters to maximize information gain.
- **Goal**: Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R O _ _`, avoids excluded letters, and tests common unused letters (e.g., G, W, L, F) to narrow down possibilities.
- **Possible words considered**:
  - Words like `TROLL` (T, L) or `FROTH` (F, T, H) were evaluated but have duplicates or test fewer letters.
  - `GROWL` fits perfectly: it starts with G, ends with W and L, all new high-frequency letters. This tests G in position 1, W in position 4, and L in position 5, providing broad coverage.
- **Why this guess?**: `GROWL` efficiently probes for presence/absence of three key unused letters (G, W, L) while maintaining the known `R O` in positions 2-3. Even if incorrect, the feedback will significantly reduce the solution space.

No, we need second letter to be R. So ""THROW"" has R as third letter? T-H-R-O-W: position 1:T, 2:H, 3:R -> so doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the pattern: [anything] R [anything] [anything] [anything] with the first anything at position1, then R at position2, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n- CROWD: C is excluded -> invalid.\n- FROWN: F R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.\n- DROWN: D R O W N -> N excluded -> invalid.\n- PROOF: P R O O F -> allowed?

However, the feedback from ""proud"" had O marked as correct position only once, but we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters.

However, since we haven\'t seen multiple O\'s yet, we\'ll proceed cautiously.\n\nBut note: the excluded letters are only letters that are completely absent, so O is present at least in position 3.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that:\n- Has R in position 2\n- Has O in position 3\n- Does not use any excluded letters: C,A,N,E,B,I,S,K,P,U,D\n- And we want to test new letters for positions 1,4,5.\n\nSo the pattern: ?

Duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""TROTH"" has duplicate T: T R O T H -> position1:T, position4:T.\n\nBoth are possible.\n\nWe could also consider ""VROOM"": V R O O M, which has two O\'s: position3 O and position4 O.\n\nBut again, O is already known at position3, and we are testing for duplicates.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information on duplicates yet.\n\nAnother word: ""WRACK"" -> K excluded -> invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""GRAMY"" not a word.\n\nLet me think of common words:\n\n""FROST"": F R O S T -> S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TRIPY"" not a word.\n\nAlternative: ""WRYLY"" - W R Y L Y -> but does not have O in third position -> invalid.\n\nWe need O exactly at third.\n\nPerhaps ""ARROW"" is A excluded -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""TROOP"" -> O at third?

Yes.\n\nNow, output the guess.\n\n<guess>growl</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here\'s the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:\n\n- **Secret word pattern**: The second letter is confirmed as \'R\' (from both Guess 1 and 2), and the third letter is confirmed as \'O\' (from Guess 3). The secret word has the pattern: `_ R O _ _`.\n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), B, I, S, K (from Guess 2), P, U, D (from Guess 3). These letters do not appear anywhere in the secret word.\n- **Available letters**: The remaining letters are F, G, H, L, M, T, V, W, Y, Z (and Q/X are rare but possible). We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with new letters to maximize information gain.\n- **Goal**: Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R O _ _`, avoids excluded letters, and tests common unused letters (e.g., G, W, L, F) to narrow down possibilities.\n- **Possible words considered**:\n  - Words like `TROLL` (T, L) or `FROTH` (F, T, H) were evaluated but have duplicates or test fewer letters.\n  - `GROWL` fits perfectly: it starts with G, ends with W and L, all new high-frequency letters. This tests G in position 1, W in position 4, and L in position 5, providing broad coverage.\n- **Why this guess?**: `GROWL` efficiently probes for presence/absence of three key unused letters (G, W, L) while maintaining the known `R O` in positions 2-3. Even if incorrect, the feedback will significantly reduce the solution space.\n\n<guess>growl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: growl -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from Guess 4: ""growl"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(✓)

Combining with previous feedback:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and O in position 3 (already known).
- Now, L is marked as correct and in the correct position. Since L is the fifth letter in ""growl"", that means the fifth letter of the secret word is L.
- Also, G is not in the word (x), and W is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R O _ L
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D, G, W (all marked x in previous guesses)

So the word is: [letter1] R O [letter4] L

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from the remaining alphabet excluding the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D, G, W

Remaining letters: F, H, M, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but note: O is already used but could be duplicated? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, and we are only missing two letters.)

But note: the word must be 5 letters, and we have positions 1 and 4 to fill.

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Now, what are the possible words that fit: ? R O ? L

We can list possible words:

- TROLL: T R O L L -> but we have L at position 5, and in TROLL, position 4 is L and position 5 is L? Actually, TROLL is T-R-O-L-L, so position 4 is L and position 5 is L. But we have position 5 fixed as L, so position 4 could be L? That would be a duplicate L. But in our pattern, we have position 5 as L, and position 4 is unknown. So TROLL would have two L's: one at position 4 and one at position 5. However, in our feedback for ""growl"", we had L at position 5 marked correct, but we don't know about position 4. So TROLL is a candidate? But note: in ""growl"", we had W at position 4 which was marked x, so position 4 is not W, but it could be L? However, if position 4 were L, then in ""growl"" we would have had L at position 4? But ""growl"" has G-R-O-W-L, so position 4 is W (which was x) and position 5 is L (which was ✓). So the secret word has L at position 5, but we don't know about position 4.

But if the secret word were ""TROLL"", then position 4 is L and position 5 is L. Then when we guessed ""growl"", which has W at position 4 and L at position 5, the feedback for position 5 would be ✓ (correct letter and position), and for position 4 (W) it would be x (not in word). But what about the L at position 4 in the secret word? Since we didn't guess an L at position 4, we don't get feedback for that. So it's possible that the secret word has an L at position 4? But we haven't tested that.

However, in the feedback for ""growl"", we only have one L (at position 5) and it was correct. If the secret word had two L's, then we would have expected the feedback to show that the L is present, but it doesn't indicate if there are duplicates. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess an L at position 4, we don't know if there is an L at position 4.

But note: the feedback for ""growl"" had L at position 5 as ✓, and no other L. But if the secret word had an L at position 4, and we didn't guess it, then the feedback wouldn't show it. So it's possible.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters.

However, to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list possible words that fit the pattern ? R O ? L and use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: F, H, M, T, V, Y, Z (and Q, X, but less common)

Possible words:

- TROLL: T R O L L -> but this has L at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is L, so if we use TROLL, then position 4 is L. But we haven't tested that. Also, T is allowed? Yes, T is not excluded. But note: in TROLL, the fourth letter is L, which we haven't tested. But we are allowed to use L? L is not excluded because we only know that L is in the word at position 5, but we don't know if it can be at other positions? Actually, we don't have information that L is absent elsewhere. But in the feedback, we only know that L is at position 5. So L could be at other positions? However, we are not restricted from using L again? But we are trying to find the word, so we can use it.

But note: we are making a guess, and we want to get the word. If we think TROLL is possible, we can guess it.

But let's see other options.

- FROTH: F R O T H -> but we need the last letter to be L, not H. So not.

- THROL? Not a word.

- BROIL: B excluded.

- DROOL: D excluded.

- GROWL: we already guessed, and it had W at position 4 which is excluded.

Another word: ""TROWL"" - not a word.

""PROWL"": P excluded.

""VROOM"": V R O O L? No, VROOM ends with M.

""TROOP"": P and O at position 4? But P excluded.

""TROVE"": E excluded.

""GROVE"": E excluded.

""TROY L"": not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""TROLL"" is the only common word that fits? But let's think.

Another possibility: ""TROTH"" - T R O T H -> but we need the last letter to be L, not H. So not.

""FROSH"": S excluded.

""WRACK"": K and W excluded.

""WRYLY"": no O.

What about ""TROLL""?

But note: in ""TROLL"", the fourth letter is L. So if we guess ""TROLL"", then the pattern would be T R O L L.

We know position 5 is L, so that matches. Position 4 would be L, which we haven't tested.

But we have to see if there are other words.

Another word: ""DROLL"" -> D excluded.

""ROLLS"": R is not at position 2? R O L L S -> position 1: R? No, we need R at position 2.

We need the pattern: [1] R O [4] L

So:

- If we take TROLL: T at 1, R at 2, O at 3, L at 4, L at 5 -> so [4] is L.

But we don't know if [4] is L, but it could be.

Is there a word with a different letter at position 4?

For example, ""TROIL"" -> not a word.

""TROML"" not a word.

""TROVL"" not a word.

""TROYL"" not a word.

""TROM L"" not.

Perhaps ""TROLL"" is the only common word.

But what about ""FROWL""? Not a word.

""THROB"": position 2 is H, not R.

Another idea: ""CROWL"" -> C excluded.

So, it seems ""TROLL"" is a strong candidate.

But note: we have not excluded T, and T is a common letter.

Also, we have not tested T at position 1.

In ""TROLL"", we would be testing T at position 1 and L at position 4.

But we already know L is in the word at position 5, so if we guess L at position 4, and if it is correct, we get a ✓, or if not, we get a - or x? But we know L is in the word, so if we put L at position 4 and it is not correct, we would get a - (wrong position) because L is in the word but not at position 4? But we know L is at position 5, so if we put L at position 4, it might be a duplicate? Or not.

But in the secret word, if there is only one L, then if we put L at position 4, it would be marked as - (if the L is at position 5, then position 4 is not L) or ✓ if position 4 is also L? But we don't know.

But to win, we can guess ""TROLL"" and if it's correct, we get it.

But there might be other words.

Another word: ""HROLL"" not a word.

""YROWL"" - Y R O W L -> but W is excluded, so invalid.

""ZROIL"" not a word.

""METRO"" -> pattern not matching.

Perhaps ""TROLL"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

But let me confirm: the pattern is ? R O ? L

With ? being from F, H, M, T, V, Y, Z.

And the word must be English.

TROLL: T (allowed) R O L (allowed) L -> and L is allowed? But we know L is in the word, so we can use it again? Yes, because we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: ""TROAL"" not a word.

""TRODL"" not.

So, I think ""TROLL"" is the best guess.

But note: we have not used T yet, and it's a common letter.

We could guess a word that tests T and another letter, but we have only one position to test? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 4.

In ""TROLL"", we are testing T at 1 and L at 4 (but we already know L is present, so we are only testing the position of L at 4?).

But if we want to test a different letter at position 4, we need a word that has a different letter at 4.

For example, is there a word like ? R O ? L with a letter other than L at position 4?

For instance, ""TROIL"" is not a word.

""TROM L"" not.

""TROTH"" ends with H, not L.

""TROPH"" not a word.

""TROY L"" not.

So, it seems ""TROLL"" is the only possibility.

Perhaps ""FROWL"" is not valid, but ""GROWL"" we already tried.

Another word: ""CROOL"" not a word, and C excluded.

Therefore, I think the secret word is likely ""TROLL"".

So, we guess ""TROLL"".

But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""TROLL"":

- T: at position 1. If the secret word is ""TROLL"", then T is correct and in position? Yes, so ✓.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- O: ✓ (position 3)
- L: at position 4. In ""TROLL"", we have L at position 4, which is correct? Yes, so ✓.
- L: at position 5, which is also correct, so ✓.

But in our guess ""TROLL"", we have two L's. The feedback would mark both L's as ✓ if they are in the correct positions.

But in the secret word ""TROLL"", both L's are present and in correct positions.

So, it would be all ✓.

But we don't know for sure, but it's a candidate.

Is there any other word?

What about ""TROWL""? Not a word.

""THROL"" not.

So, I think we should guess ""TROLL"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""TROLL"".

But note: we have excluded G and W, so no.

So, <guess>troll</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - The secret word has the pattern: `_ R O _ L` (from previous feedback).
     - Position 2 is `R` (confirmed in all guesses).
     - Position 3 is `O` (confirmed in Guess 3 and 4).
     - Position 5 is `L` (confirmed in Guess 4).
   - **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), B, I, S, K (from Guess 2), P, U, D (from Guess 3), G, W (from Guess 4). These letters do not appear in the secret word.
   - **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4**: F, H, M, T, V, Y, Z (and rare letters like Q, X, but these are less common).

2. **Analyzing the Pattern `_ R O _ L`**:
   - Position 1 must be one of the remaining letters (F, H, M, T, V, Y, Z).
   - Position 4 must also be one of these letters, but it could potentially be a duplicate of `L` (since we know `L` is in the word at position 5, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere).
   - We need a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters.

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - Common words matching `_ R O _ L`:
     - `TROLL`: Uses `T` (position 1) and `L` (position 4). `T` is a high-frequency letter not yet tested, and `L` is already confirmed at position 5 (so position 4 could be `L` if there's a duplicate). This is a strong candidate.
     - Other possibilities like `FROWL` (invalid word), `TROIL` (invalid), `TROTH` (ends with `H`, not `L`), or `TROVE` (contains excluded `E`) are not viable.
     - After checking, `TROLL` is the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters. It tests:
       - `T` at position 1 (new letter).
       - `L` at position 4 (to check for duplication, since `L` is already at position 5).

4. **Why Guess ""TROLL""?**:
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle.
   - If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if `T` is in the word and/or if `L` appears at position 4, drastically reducing possibilities (e.g., if `T` is absent, we focus on `H`, `M`, `V`, etc. for position 1).
   - Given the constraints, no other common words fit, making `TROLL` the optimal guess.

<guess>troll</guess>",troll,"We are given feedback from Guess 4: ""growl"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(✓)

Combining with previous feedback:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and O in position 3 (already known).
- Now, L is marked as correct and in the correct position. Since L is the fifth letter in ""growl"", that means the fifth letter of the secret word is L.
- Also, G is not in the word (x), and W is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R O _ L
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D, G, W (all marked x in previous guesses)

So the word is: [letter1] R O [letter4] L

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from the remaining alphabet excluding the excluded ones.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, U, D, G, W

Remaining letters: F, H, M, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but note: O is already used but could be duplicated? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, and we are only missing two letters.)

So TROLL would have two L's: one at position 4 and one at position 5. However, in our feedback for ""growl"", we had L at position 5 marked correct, but we don't know about position 4. So TROLL is a candidate? But note: in ""growl"", we had W at position 4 which was marked x, so position 4 is not W, but it could be L? However, if position 4 were L, then in ""growl"" we would have had L at position 4? But ""growl"" has G-R-O-W-L, so position 4 is W (which was x) and position 5 is L (which was ✓). So the secret word has L at position 5, but we don't know about position 4.

But if the secret word were ""TROLL"", then position 4 is L and position 5 is L. Then when we guessed ""growl"", which has W at position 4 and L at position 5, the feedback for position 5 would be ✓ (correct letter and position), and for position 4 (W) it would be x (not in word). But what about the L at position 4 in the secret word? Since we didn't guess an L at position 4, we don't get feedback for that. So it's possible that the secret word has an L at position 4? But we haven't tested that.

""FROSH"": S excluded.

""WRACK"": K and W excluded.

""WRYLY"": no O.

What about ""TROLL""?

But note: in ""TROLL"", the fourth letter is L. So if we guess ""TROLL"", then the pattern would be T R O L L.

We know position 5 is L, so that matches. Position 4 would be L, which we haven't tested.

But we have to see if there are other words.

Another word: ""DROLL"" -> D excluded.

""ROLLS"": R is not at position 2? R O L L S -> position 1: R? No, we need R at position 2.

We need the pattern: [1] R O [4] L

So:

- If we take TROLL: T at 1, R at 2, O at 3, L at 4, L at 5 -> so [4] is L.

But we don't know if [4] is L, but it could be.

Is there a word with a different letter at position 4?

For example, ""TROIL"" -> not a word.

""TROML"" not a word.

""TROVL"" not a word.

""TROYL"" not a word.

""TROM L"" not.

Perhaps ""TROLL"" is the only common word.

But what about ""FROWL""? Not a word.

""THROB"": position 2 is H, not R.

Another idea: ""CROWL"" -> C excluded.

So, it seems ""TROLL"" is a strong candidate.

But note: we have not excluded T, and T is a common letter.

Also, we have not tested T at position 1.

In ""TROLL"", we would be testing T at position 1 and L at position 4.

But we already know L is in the word at position 5, so if we guess L at position 4, and if it is correct, we get a ✓, or if not, we get a - or x?

But if we want to test a different letter at position 4, we need a word that has a different letter at 4.

For example, is there a word like ? R O ? L with a letter other than L at position 4?

For instance, ""TROIL"" is not a word.

""TROM L"" not.

""TROTH"" ends with H, not L.

""TROPH"" not a word.

""TROY L"" not.

Perhaps ""FROWL"" is not valid, but ""GROWL"" we already tried.

So, we guess ""TROLL"".

But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""TROLL"":

- T: at position 1. If the secret word is ""TROLL"", then T is correct and in position? Yes, so ✓.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- O: ✓ (position 3)
- L: at position 4. In ""TROLL"", we have L at position 4, which is correct? Yes, so ✓.
- L: at position 5, which is also correct, so ✓.

But in our guess ""TROLL"", we have two L's. The feedback would mark both L's as ✓ if they are in the correct positions.

But in the secret word ""TROLL"", both L's are present and in correct positions.

So, it would be all ✓.

But we don't know for sure, but it's a candidate.

Is there any other word?

What about ""TROWL""? Not a word.

""THROL"" not.

So, I think we should guess ""TROLL"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""TROLL"".

But note: we have excluded G and W, so no.

So, <guess>troll</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - The secret word has the pattern: `_ R O _ L` (from previous feedback).
     - Position 2 is `R` (confirmed in all guesses).
     - Position 3 is `O` (confirmed in Guess 3 and 4).
     - Position 5 is `L` (confirmed in Guess 4).
   - **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), B, I, S, K (from Guess 2), P, U, D (from Guess 3), G, W (from Guess 4). These letters do not appear in the secret word.
   - **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4**: F, H, M, T, V, Y, Z (and rare letters like Q, X, but these are less common).

2. **Analyzing the Pattern `_ R O _ L`**:
   - Position 1 must be one of the remaining letters (F, H, M, T, V, Y, Z).
   - Position 4 must also be one of these letters, but it could potentially be a duplicate of `L` (since we know `L` is in the word at position 5, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere).
   - We need a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters.

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - Common words matching `_ R O _ L`:
     - `TROLL`: Uses `T` (position 1) and `L` (position 4). `T` is a high-frequency letter not yet tested, and `L` is already confirmed at position 5 (so position 4 could be `L` if there's a duplicate). This is a strong candidate.
     - Other possibilities like `FROWL` (invalid word), `TROIL` (invalid), `TROTH` (ends with `H`, not `L`), or `TROVE` (contains excluded `E`) are not viable.
     - After checking, `TROLL` is the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters. It tests:
       - `T` at position 1 (new letter).
       - `L` at position 4 (to check for duplication, since `L` is already at position 5).

4. **Why Guess ""TROLL""?**:
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle.
   - If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if `T` is in the word and/or if `L` appears at position 4, drastically reducing possibilities (e.g., if `T` is absent, we focus on `H`, `M`, `V`, etc. for position 1).
   - Given the constraints, no other common words fit, making `TROLL` the optimal guess.",Guess 5: troll -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
