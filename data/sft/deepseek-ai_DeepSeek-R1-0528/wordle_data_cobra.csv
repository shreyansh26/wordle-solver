We are starting the game. We have no feedback yet, so we need to choose a good starting word.
A good starting word typically contains common letters and vowels to maximize information.
Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.
One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" which has three common vowels and two common consonants.
But note: we are to return a 5-letter word. Another common one is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"".

Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. 
The word ""RAISE"" is also a good one because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
Alternatively, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E.

I think I'll go with ""RAINY"" but wait, that has Y which is less common. Instead, ""STARE"" might be good: 
S, T, A, R, E -> which covers common letters and includes three vowels (A, E) and common consonants.

However, I recall that the word ""SOARE"" is an accepted word (meaning a young hawk) but might be obscure? 
But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". We should use a common one.

Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and covers a mix of vowels and consonants.

Option 1: ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> includes A and E, and common consonants.
Option 2: ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> has A, E and common consonants.

I think ""CRANE"" is a fine starting word.

Alternatively, ""ROAST"" is good: R, O, A, S, T -> has O, A and common consonants.

But note: we are allowed only six guesses. We want to maximize information.

I will choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.
</think>
For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained. A good starting word should include a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used because they contain multiple vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N or S, L, T). I'll go with ""CRANE"" since it provides broad coverage of common letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word:
- Has 'C' as the first letter (because C is in the correct position).
- Contains 'R' and 'A', but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Specifically, 'R' was in the second position and 'A' in the third, but in the secret word they are elsewhere.
- Does not contain 'N' or 'E'.

We know the word starts with 'C'. The second letter is not 'R' (because R is present but in the wrong position), and the third letter is not 'A' (for the same reason). Also, the word does not have 'N' or 'E' at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is C).
- Includes 'R' and 'A' (because they are in the secret word) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Avoids the letters 'N' and 'E' (since they are not in the word).
- Also, we can try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Possible positions for 'R': it cannot be in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already taken by 'C', so actually positions 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, 'A' cannot be in position 3, so it could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that start with 'C', have 'R' and 'A', and avoid 'N' and 'E'.

Common words: 
- ""CARTY""? Not a word.
- ""CARBY""? Not common.
- ""CARDS""? But we have to avoid 'E' and 'N', and 'D' and 'S' are new. But wait, we don't know about 'D' and 'S' yet.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: 'R' and 'A'. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We have positions 2, 4, and 5 to test for 'A' and positions 3,4,5 for 'R'. But note, we also need to fill the other letters with new letters to get more information.

We should avoid repeating the same positions for 'R' and 'A'. For example, in the next guess, we can put 'R' in position 3 or 4 or 5, and 'A' in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not the same as in the first guess).

Let me try to list some words that start with 'C', have 'R' and 'A', and are 5 letters.

- ""CARAT"": but we have to avoid 'E' and 'N', and 'T' is new. Also, in ""CARAT"", the 'A' is in position 3? Let's see: C A R A T -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:A, 5:T. But in our feedback, we know that the secret word has 'A' but not in position 3. In this word, there is an 'A' in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has one or two A's? The feedback only tells us that at least one 'A' is present and not in position 3. Similarly for 'R', not in position 2.

But in ""CARAT"", we have:
- Position 2: A -> we haven't tested A in position 2? In the first guess, we had A in position 3. So position 2 is new for A.
- Position 3: R -> we haven't tested R in position 3? In the first guess, R was in position 2, so position 3 is new for R.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""CARAT"", we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2 and 4. This is acceptable.

However, we also need to avoid 'N' and 'E', which ""CARAT"" does.

But is ""CARAT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a unit of weight for precious stones.

But we have two A's? The secret word might have only one A? We don't know. The feedback for the first guess only said that there is at least one A and it's not in position 3. Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another word: ""CRAFT"". 
- C R A F T -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:F, 5:T.

But wait, in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. The feedback said R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3. So in ""CRAFT"", we are putting R in position 2 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

Therefore, ""CRAFT"" is invalid because it has R in position 2 and A in position 3, which we know are incorrect.

We must avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

So ""CARAT"" has:
- Position 2: A (which is new for A, since previously A was in 3)
- Position 3: R (which is new for R, since previously R was in 2)

So that's acceptable.

Another word: ""CRAMP"". 
- C R A M P -> but again, R is in position 2 and A in position 3, which we know are wrong. So invalid.

We need a word that has R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

Let me think of words starting with C, then having R and A in other positions.

Possible words:
- ""CRAWL"": but R is in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.
- ""CROAK"": O is new, K is new. Positions: C(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), K(5). Here, R is in position 2 -> invalid because we know R is not in position 2.

We must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So how about:
- ""CLASP"": but no R? We know the word has R, so we must include R.

We must include R and A.

Another idea: ""SCRAP"" but that starts with S, not C.

We need to start with C.

Try ""CHARM"": 
- C H A R M -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M.
But A is in position 3 -> we know A is not in position 3. So invalid.

""CRASH"": R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CARGO"": 
- C A R G O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:G, 5:O.
Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). This is acceptable. Also, avoids 'N' and 'E'. And it's a valid word.

""CAROB"": similar: C A R O B -> A in 2, R in 3.

""CAROM"": C A R O M -> same.

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and now we are putting R in position 3. Similarly, A was in position 3 and now we put it in position 2. This is good because we are testing new positions.

We can also consider putting R and A in positions 4 or 5.

For example, ""CABAR""? Not a word.

""CAPER"": but E is in the word? We know E is not in the secret word. So we cannot use E. ""CAPER"" has E -> invalid.

""CAIRN"": but N is in the word? We know N is not in the secret word. So invalid.

So ""CARGO"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""CARTY"" is not a word. ""CARVY""? Not a word.

""CARDS"": has D and S. But we don't know about D and S. However, we must avoid E and N, which it does. But ""CARDS"": C A R D S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. Same as ""CARGO"". But ""CARDS"" is a valid word.

But we have two options: ""CARGO"" and ""CARDS"". Both are valid.

We might also consider ""CRAWL"" but it has R in position 2 -> invalid.

Another word: ""CROWD""? But R is in position 2 -> invalid.

""CRWTH""? Not common and no A.

We need to include A.

What about ""CORAL"": 
- C O R A L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L.
Here, R is in position 3 (new) and A is in position 4 (new). This is acceptable. Also, avoids E and N.

""CORAL"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""CIVIC""? No R or A.

""CHARD"": but H and D. But A is in position 3? C H A R D -> A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CLARO"": C L A R O -> A in position 3 -> invalid.

""COARB""? Not common.

So we have a few options: ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", ""CORAL"", ""CARAT"", etc.

We want to maximize information by including new common letters.

In ""CARGO"": letters C, A, R, G, O -> G and O are new.
In ""CARDS"": C, A, R, D, S -> D and S are new.
In ""CORAL"": C, O, R, A, L -> O and L are new.
In ""CARAT"": C, A, R, A, T -> T is new, but A repeated.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, it's better to have distinct letters. So ""CARAT"" has two A's, which might not be ideal.

Similarly, ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", and ""CORAL"" have distinct letters.

Among these, which one tests more common letters? S, T, D, G, O, L are common.

But we have no information about the fourth and fifth letters yet.

We know the first letter is C, and we have R and A to place. We are testing positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""CORAL"", we put A in position 4 and R in position 3. This is different from the first guess.

In ""CARGO"", we put A in position 2 and R in position 3.

In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are swapping them? That might be a good test.

But note: if the secret word has R in position 3 and A in position 2, then in ""CARGO"" we would get:
- C: correct (position 1)
- A: in the word but not in position 2? Or if the secret word has A in position 2, then it would be correct? But we don't know if A is in position 2 or not.

We are testing A in position 2 and R in position 3.

Similarly, in ""CORAL"", we are testing R in position 3 and A in position 4.

We don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other. But note that in the first guess, we had no correct letters except the first one, and R and A were misplaced. So they are likely in the latter part of the word.

Perhaps ""CORAL"" is better because it tests R and A in positions we haven't tested at all (position 3 and 4) and also tests O and L.

But in ""CARGO"", we test A in position 2 and R in position 3.

Another candidate: ""CRAAL""? Not a word.

I think ""CORAL"" is a good choice because it tests new positions for both R and A.

Alternatively, ""CURLY""? But U and L, Y. And no A? We must include A.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""CABIN""? But N is not allowed.

""CAPRI""? But I is new, but no R? Wait, C A P R I -> that has R. Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:P, 4:R, 5:I. So A in position 2 and R in position 4. This is acceptable. And avoids E and N.

""CAPRI"" is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word (an island).

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""CARGO"" is a solid choice.

But let me check the feedback again: the secret word has C in position 1, and R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

So possible secret words: 
- Could be ""CIVIC""? But no, because it must have R and A.
- ""CHINA""? But has N and A in position 3? A in position 3 is not allowed, and N is not in the word.
- ""CRASS""? But R in position 2 -> invalid.
- ""CROSS""? No A.
- ""CRAMS""? R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

So the secret word must have C first, then one of the positions 2,3,4,5 must be R (but not 2) and one must be A (but not 3). And no N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""CATER""? But E is not allowed.
- ""CAULK""? But A in position 2? Then R must be somewhere? But no R in ""CAULK"". So missing R.
- ""CAROL"": C A R O L -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable. And no E or N.

""CAROL"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""CROAK"" has R in position 2 -> invalid.

""CLARK"": C L A R K -> A in position 3? Position 3 is A -> invalid because A cannot be in position 3.

""CLARK"" has A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CRACK"": R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CREAK"": has E -> invalid.

So back to ""CAROL"", ""CARGO"", ""CORAL"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""CORAL"" because it tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are new positions, and also introduces O and L.

But note: in ""CORAL"", we have:
- C: should be correct (position 1)
- O: new letter, position 2
- R: in position 3 (we know R is in the word, but not in position 2, so position 3 is a candidate)
- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, not in position 3, so position 4 is candidate)
- L: new letter, position 5

This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""CARGO"" tests A in position 2 and R in position 3.

But we don't know if A can be in position 2 or not. Similarly for R in position 3.

I think both are reasonable. I'll choose ""CORAL"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more possibilities. For example, a word that has R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 2 or 5.

For instance, ""CABAR"" is not a word.

""CANARY"" is 6 letters.

""CARET"" has E -> invalid.

""CARPAL""? 6 letters.

""CARPY""? Not a word.

""CARRS""? Not common and repeated R.

I think ""CORAL"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""CORAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

The secret word starts with C, contains R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively), and excludes N and E. For the second guess, I need to test new positions for R and A while avoiding N and E. I chose ""coral"" because:
- It starts with C (already confirmed).
- It places R in position 3 (a new position to test, since R was previously in position 2).
- It places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A was previously in position 3).
- It introduces new common letters (O and L) to gather more information.
- It avoids N and E, as required.

This guess should help narrow down the possible positions for R and A and test new letters.

- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word:
- Has 'C' as the first letter (because C is in the correct position).
- Contains 'R' and 'A', but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Specifically, 'R' was in the second position and 'A' in the third, but in the secret word they are elsewhere.
- Does not contain 'N' or 'E'.

We know the word starts with 'C'. The second letter is not 'R' (because R is present but in the wrong position), and the third letter is not 'A' (for the same reason). Also, the word does not have 'N' or 'E' at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is C).
- Includes 'R' and 'A' (because they are in the secret word) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Avoids the letters 'N' and 'E' (since they are not in the word).
- Also, we can try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Possible positions for 'R': it cannot be in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already taken by 'C', so actually positions 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, 'A' cannot be in position 3, so it could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that start with 'C', have 'R' and 'A', and avoid 'N' and 'E'.

Common words: 
- ""CARTY""? Not a word.
- ""CARBY""? Not common.
- ""CARDS""? But we have to avoid 'E' and 'N', and 'D' and 'S' are new. But wait, we don't know about 'D' and 'S' yet.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: 'R' and 'A'. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We have positions 2, 4, and 5 to test for 'A' and positions 3,4,5 for 'R'. But note, we also need to fill the other letters with new letters to get more information.

We should avoid repeating the same positions for 'R' and 'A'. For example, in the next guess, we can put 'R' in position 3 or 4 or 5, and 'A' in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not the same as in the first guess).

Let me try to list some words that start with 'C', have 'R' and 'A', and are 5 letters.

- ""CARAT"": but we have to avoid 'E' and 'N', and 'T' is new. Also, in ""CARAT"", the 'A' is in position 3? Let's see: C A R A T -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:A, 5:T. But in our feedback, we know that the secret word has 'A' but not in position 3. In this word, there is an 'A' in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has one or two A's? The feedback only tells us that at least one 'A' is present and not in position 3. Similarly for 'R', not in position 2.

But in ""CARAT"", we have:
- Position 2: A -> we haven't tested A in position 2? In the first guess, we had A in position 3. So position 2 is new for A.
- Position 3: R -> we haven't tested R in position 3? In the first guess, R was in position 2, so position 3 is new for R.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""CARAT"", we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2 and 4. This is acceptable.

However, we also need to avoid 'N' and 'E', which ""CARAT"" does.

But is ""CARAT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a unit of weight for precious stones.

But we have two A's? The secret word might have only one A? We don't know. The feedback for the first guess only said that there is at least one A and it's not in position 3. Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another word: ""CRAFT"". 
- C R A F T -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:F, 5:T.

But wait, in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. The feedback said R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3. So in ""CRAFT"", we are putting R in position 2 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

Therefore, ""CRAFT"" is invalid because it has R in position 2 and A in position 3, which we know are incorrect.

We must avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

So ""CARAT"" has:
- Position 2: A (which is new for A, since previously A was in 3)
- Position 3: R (which is new for R, since previously R was in 2)

So that's acceptable.

Another word: ""CRAMP"". 
- C R A M P -> but again, R is in position 2 and A in position 3, which we know are wrong. So invalid.

We need a word that has R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

Let me think of words starting with C, then having R and A in other positions.

Possible words:
- ""CRAWL"": but R is in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.
- ""CROAK"": O is new, K is new. Positions: C(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), K(5). Here, R is in position 2 -> invalid because we know R is not in position 2.

We must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So how about:
- ""CLASP"": but no R? We know the word has R, so we must include R.

We must include R and A.

Another idea: ""SCRAP"" but that starts with S, not C.

We need to start with C.

Try ""CHARM"": 
- C H A R M -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M.
But A is in position 3 -> we know A is not in position 3. So invalid.

""CRASH"": R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CARGO"": 
- C A R G O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:G, 5:O.
Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). This is acceptable. Also, avoids 'N' and 'E'. And it's a valid word.

""CAROB"": similar: C A R O B -> A in 2, R in 3.

""CAROM"": C A R O M -> same.

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and now we are putting R in position 3. Similarly, A was in position 3 and now we put it in position 2. This is good because we are testing new positions.

We can also consider putting R and A in positions 4 or 5.

For example, ""CABAR""? Not a word.

""CAPER"": but E is in the word? We know E is not in the secret word. So we cannot use E. ""CAPER"" has E -> invalid.

""CAIRN"": but N is in the word? We know N is not in the secret word. So invalid.

So ""CARGO"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""CARTY"" is not a word. ""CARVY""? Not a word.

""CARDS"": has D and S. But we don't know about D and S. However, we must avoid E and N, which it does. But ""CARDS"": C A R D S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. Same as ""CARGO"". But ""CARDS"" is a valid word.

But we have two options: ""CARGO"" and ""CARDS"". Both are valid.

We might also consider ""CRAWL"" but it has R in position 2 -> invalid.

Another word: ""CROWD""? But R is in position 2 -> invalid.

""CRWTH""? Not common and no A.

We need to include A.

What about ""CORAL"": 
- C O R A L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L.
Here, R is in position 3 (new) and A is in position 4 (new). This is acceptable. Also, avoids E and N.

""CORAL"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""CIVIC""? No R or A.

""CHARD"": but H and D. But A is in position 3? C H A R D -> A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CLARO"": C L A R O -> A in position 3 -> invalid.

""COARB""? Not common.

So we have a few options: ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", ""CORAL"", ""CARAT"", etc.

We want to maximize information by including new common letters.

In ""CARGO"": letters C, A, R, G, O -> G and O are new.
In ""CARDS"": C, A, R, D, S -> D and S are new.
In ""CORAL"": C, O, R, A, L -> O and L are new.
In ""CARAT"": C, A, R, A, T -> T is new, but A repeated.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, it's better to have distinct letters. So ""CARAT"" has two A's, which might not be ideal.

Similarly, ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", and ""CORAL"" have distinct letters.

Among these, which one tests more common letters? S, T, D, G, O, L are common.

But we have no information about the fourth and fifth letters yet.

We know the first letter is C, and we have R and A to place. We are testing positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""CORAL"", we put A in position 4 and R in position 3. This is different from the first guess.

In ""CARGO"", we put A in position 2 and R in position 3.

In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are swapping them? That might be a good test.

But note: if the secret word has R in position 3 and A in position 2, then in ""CARGO"" we would get:
- C: correct (position 1)
- A: in the word but not in position 2? Or if the secret word has A in position 2, then it would be correct? But we don't know if A is in position 2 or not.

We are testing A in position 2 and R in position 3.

Similarly, in ""CORAL"", we are testing R in position 3 and A in position 4.

We don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other. But note that in the first guess, we had no correct letters except the first one, and R and A were misplaced. So they are likely in the latter part of the word.

Perhaps ""CORAL"" is better because it tests R and A in positions we haven't tested at all (position 3 and 4) and also tests O and L.

But in ""CARGO"", we test A in position 2 and R in position 3.

Another candidate: ""CRAAL""? Not a word.

I think ""CORAL"" is a good choice because it tests new positions for both R and A.

Alternatively, ""CURLY""? But U and L, Y. And no A? We must include A.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""CABIN""? But N is not allowed.

""CAPRI""? But I is new, but no R? Wait, C A P R I -> that has R. Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:P, 4:R, 5:I. So A in position 2 and R in position 4. This is acceptable. And avoids E and N.

""CAPRI"" is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word (an island).

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""CARGO"" is a solid choice.

But let me check the feedback again: the secret word has C in position 1, and R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

So possible secret words: 
- Could be ""CIVIC""? But no, because it must have R and A.
- ""CHINA""? But has N and A in position 3? A in position 3 is not allowed, and N is not in the word.
- ""CRASS""? But R in position 2 -> invalid.
- ""CROSS""? No A.
- ""CRAMS""? R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

So the secret word must have C first, then one of the positions 2,3,4,5 must be R (but not 2) and one must be A (but not 3). And no N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""CATER""? But E is not allowed.
- ""CAULK""? But A in position 2? Then R must be somewhere? But no R in ""CAULK"". So missing R.
- ""CAROL"": C A R O L -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable. And no E or N.

""CAROL"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""CROAK"" has R in position 2 -> invalid.

""CLARK"": C L A R K -> A in position 3? Position 3 is A -> invalid because A cannot be in position 3.

""CLARK"" has A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CRACK"": R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CREAK"": has E -> invalid.

So back to ""CAROL"", ""CARGO"", ""CORAL"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""CORAL"" because it tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are new positions, and also introduces O and L.

But note: in ""CORAL"", we have:
- C: should be correct (position 1)
- O: new letter, position 2
- R: in position 3 (we know R is in the word, but not in position 2, so position 3 is a candidate)
- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, not in position 3, so position 4 is candidate)
- L: new letter, position 5

This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""CARGO"" tests A in position 2 and R in position 3.

But we don't know if A can be in position 2 or not. Similarly for R in position 3.

I think both are reasonable. I'll choose ""CORAL"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more possibilities. For example, a word that has R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 2 or 5.

For instance, ""CABAR"" is not a word.

""CANARY"" is 6 letters.

""CARET"" has E -> invalid.

""CARPAL""? 6 letters.

""CARPY""? Not a word.

""CARRS""? Not common and repeated R.

I think ""CORAL"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

The secret word starts with C, contains R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively), and excludes N and E. For the second guess, I need to test new positions for R and A while avoiding N and E. I chose ""coral"" because:
- It starts with C (already confirmed).
- It places R in position 3 (a new position to test, since R was previously in position 2).
- It places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A was previously in position 3).
- It introduces new common letters (O and L) to gather more information.
- It avoids N and E, as required.

This guess should help narrow down the possible positions for R and A and test new letters.",Guess 2: coral -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) R(-) A(-) L(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no feedback yet, so we need to choose a good starting word.
A good starting word typically contains common letters and vowels to maximize information.
Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.
One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" which has three common vowels and two common consonants.
But note: we are to return a 5-letter word. Another common one is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"".

Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. 
The word ""RAISE"" is also a good one because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
Alternatively, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E.

I think I'll go with ""RAINY"" but wait, that has Y which is less common. Instead, ""STARE"" might be good: 
S, T, A, R, E -> which covers common letters and includes three vowels (A, E) and common consonants.

However, I recall that the word ""SOARE"" is an accepted word (meaning a young hawk) but might be obscure? 
But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". We should use a common one.

Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and covers a mix of vowels and consonants.

Option 1: ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> includes A and E, and common consonants.
Option 2: ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> has A, E and common consonants.

I think ""CRANE"" is a fine starting word.

Alternatively, ""ROAST"" is good: R, O, A, S, T -> has O, A and common consonants.

But note: we are allowed only six guesses. We want to maximize information.

I will choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained. A good starting word should include a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used because they contain multiple vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N or S, L, T). I'll go with ""CRANE"" since it provides broad coverage of common letters.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word:
- Has 'C' as the first letter (because C is in the correct position).
- Contains 'R' and 'A', but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Specifically, 'R' was in the second position and 'A' in the third, but in the secret word they are elsewhere.
- Does not contain 'N' or 'E'.

We know the word starts with 'C'. The second letter is not 'R' (because R is present but in the wrong position), and the third letter is not 'A' (for the same reason). Also, the word does not have 'N' or 'E' at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is C).
- Includes 'R' and 'A' (because they are in the secret word) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Avoids the letters 'N' and 'E' (since they are not in the word).
- Also, we can try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Possible positions for 'R': it cannot be in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already taken by 'C', so actually positions 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, 'A' cannot be in position 3, so it could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that start with 'C', have 'R' and 'A', and avoid 'N' and 'E'.

Common words: 
- ""CARTY""? Not a word.
- ""CARBY""? Not common.
- ""CARDS""? But we have to avoid 'E' and 'N', and 'D' and 'S' are new. But wait, we don't know about 'D' and 'S' yet.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: 'R' and 'A'. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We have positions 2, 4, and 5 to test for 'A' and positions 3,4,5 for 'R'. But note, we also need to fill the other letters with new letters to get more information.

We should avoid repeating the same positions for 'R' and 'A'. For example, in the next guess, we can put 'R' in position 3 or 4 or 5, and 'A' in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not the same as in the first guess).

Let me try to list some words that start with 'C', have 'R' and 'A', and are 5 letters.

- ""CARAT"": but we have to avoid 'E' and 'N', and 'T' is new. Also, in ""CARAT"", the 'A' is in position 3? Let's see: C A R A T -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:A, 5:T. But in our feedback, we know that the secret word has 'A' but not in position 3. In this word, there is an 'A' in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has one or two A's? The feedback only tells us that at least one 'A' is present and not in position 3. Similarly for 'R', not in position 2.

But in ""CARAT"", we have:
- Position 2: A -> we haven't tested A in position 2? In the first guess, we had A in position 3. So position 2 is new for A.
- Position 3: R -> we haven't tested R in position 3? In the first guess, R was in position 2, so position 3 is new for R.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""CARAT"", we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2 and 4. This is acceptable.

However, we also need to avoid 'N' and 'E', which ""CARAT"" does.

But is ""CARAT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a unit of weight for precious stones.

But we have two A's? The secret word might have only one A? We don't know. The feedback for the first guess only said that there is at least one A and it's not in position 3. Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another word: ""CRAFT"". 
- C R A F T -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:F, 5:T.

But wait, in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. The feedback said R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3. So in ""CRAFT"", we are putting R in position 2 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

Therefore, ""CRAFT"" is invalid because it has R in position 2 and A in position 3, which we know are incorrect.

We must avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

So ""CARAT"" has:
- Position 2: A (which is new for A, since previously A was in 3)
- Position 3: R (which is new for R, since previously R was in 2)

So that's acceptable.

Another word: ""CRAMP"". 
- C R A M P -> but again, R is in position 2 and A in position 3, which we know are wrong. So invalid.

We need a word that has R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

Let me think of words starting with C, then having R and A in other positions.

Possible words:
- ""CRAWL"": but R is in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.
- ""CROAK"": O is new, K is new. Positions: C(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), K(5). Here, R is in position 2 -> invalid because we know R is not in position 2.

We must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So how about:
- ""CLASP"": but no R? We know the word has R, so we must include R.

We must include R and A.

Another idea: ""SCRAP"" but that starts with S, not C.

We need to start with C.

Try ""CHARM"": 
- C H A R M -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M.
But A is in position 3 -> we know A is not in position 3. So invalid.

""CRASH"": R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CARGO"": 
- C A R G O -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:G, 5:O.
Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). This is acceptable. Also, avoids 'N' and 'E'. And it's a valid word.

""CAROB"": similar: C A R O B -> A in 2, R in 3.

""CAROM"": C A R O M -> same.

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and now we are putting R in position 3. Similarly, A was in position 3 and now we put it in position 2. This is good because we are testing new positions.

We can also consider putting R and A in positions 4 or 5.

For example, ""CABAR""? Not a word.

""CAPER"": but E is in the word? We know E is not in the secret word. So we cannot use E. ""CAPER"" has E -> invalid.

""CAIRN"": but N is in the word? We know N is not in the secret word. So invalid.

So ""CARGO"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""CARTY"" is not a word. ""CARVY""? Not a word.

""CARDS"": has D and S. But we don't know about D and S. However, we must avoid E and N, which it does. But ""CARDS"": C A R D S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. Same as ""CARGO"". But ""CARDS"" is a valid word.

But we have two options: ""CARGO"" and ""CARDS"". Both are valid.

We might also consider ""CRAWL"" but it has R in position 2 -> invalid.

Another word: ""CROWD""? But R is in position 2 -> invalid.

""CRWTH""? Not common and no A.

We need to include A.

What about ""CORAL"": 
- C O R A L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L.
Here, R is in position 3 (new) and A is in position 4 (new). This is acceptable. Also, avoids E and N.

""CORAL"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""CIVIC""? No R or A.

""CHARD"": but H and D. But A is in position 3? C H A R D -> A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CLARO"": C L A R O -> A in position 3 -> invalid.

""COARB""? Not common.

So we have a few options: ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", ""CORAL"", ""CARAT"", etc.

We want to maximize information by including new common letters.

In ""CARGO"": letters C, A, R, G, O -> G and O are new.
In ""CARDS"": C, A, R, D, S -> D and S are new.
In ""CORAL"": C, O, R, A, L -> O and L are new.
In ""CARAT"": C, A, R, A, T -> T is new, but A repeated.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, it's better to have distinct letters. So ""CARAT"" has two A's, which might not be ideal.

Similarly, ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", and ""CORAL"" have distinct letters.

Among these, which one tests more common letters? S, T, D, G, O, L are common.

But we have no information about the fourth and fifth letters yet.

We know the first letter is C, and we have R and A to place. We are testing positions 2,3,4,5.

In ""CORAL"", we put A in position 4 and R in position 3. This is different from the first guess.

In ""CARGO"", we put A in position 2 and R in position 3.

In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are swapping them? That might be a good test.

But note: if the secret word has R in position 3 and A in position 2, then in ""CARGO"" we would get:
- C: correct (position 1)
- A: in the word but not in position 2? Or if the secret word has A in position 2, then it would be correct? But we don't know if A is in position 2 or not.

We are testing A in position 2 and R in position 3.

Similarly, in ""CORAL"", we are testing R in position 3 and A in position 4.

We don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other. But note that in the first guess, we had no correct letters except the first one, and R and A were misplaced. So they are likely in the latter part of the word.

Perhaps ""CORAL"" is better because it tests R and A in positions we haven't tested at all (position 3 and 4) and also tests O and L.

But in ""CARGO"", we test A in position 2 and R in position 3.

Another candidate: ""CRAAL""? Not a word.

I think ""CORAL"" is a good choice because it tests new positions for both R and A.

Alternatively, ""CURLY""? But U and L, Y. And no A? We must include A.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""CABIN""? But N is not allowed.

""CAPRI""? But I is new, but no R? Wait, C A P R I -> that has R. Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:P, 4:R, 5:I. So A in position 2 and R in position 4. This is acceptable. And avoids E and N.

""CAPRI"" is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word (an island).

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""CARGO"" is a solid choice.

But let me check the feedback again: the secret word has C in position 1, and R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

So possible secret words: 
- Could be ""CIVIC""? But no, because it must have R and A.
- ""CHINA""? But has N and A in position 3? A in position 3 is not allowed, and N is not in the word.
- ""CRASS""? But R in position 2 -> invalid.
- ""CROSS""? No A.
- ""CRAMS""? R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

So the secret word must have C first, then one of the positions 2,3,4,5 must be R (but not 2) and one must be A (but not 3). And no N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""CATER""? But E is not allowed.
- ""CAULK""? But A in position 2? Then R must be somewhere? But no R in ""CAULK"". So missing R.
- ""CAROL"": C A R O L -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable. And no E or N.

""CAROL"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""CROAK"" has R in position 2 -> invalid.

""CLARK"": C L A R K -> A in position 3? Position 3 is A -> invalid because A cannot be in position 3.

""CLARK"" has A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CRACK"": R in position 2 and A in position 3 -> invalid.

""CREAK"": has E -> invalid.

So back to ""CAROL"", ""CARGO"", ""CORAL"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""CORAL"" because it tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are new positions, and also introduces O and L.

But note: in ""CORAL"", we have:
- C: should be correct (position 1)
- O: new letter, position 2
- R: in position 3 (we know R is in the word, but not in position 2, so position 3 is a candidate)
- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, not in position 3, so position 4 is candidate)
- L: new letter, position 5

This will give us good information.

Alternatively, ""CARGO"" tests A in position 2 and R in position 3.

But we don't know if A can be in position 2 or not. Similarly for R in position 3.

I think both are reasonable. I'll choose ""CORAL"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more possibilities. For example, a word that has R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 2 or 5.

For instance, ""CABAR"" is not a word.

""CANARY"" is 6 letters.

""CARET"" has E -> invalid.

""CARPAL""? 6 letters.

""CARPY""? Not a word.

""CARRS""? Not common and repeated R.

I think ""CORAL"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

The secret word starts with C, contains R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively), and excludes N and E. For the second guess, I need to test new positions for R and A while avoiding N and E. I chose ""coral"" because:
- It starts with C (already confirmed).
- It places R in position 3 (a new position to test, since R was previously in position 2).
- It places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A was previously in position 3).
- It introduces new common letters (O and L) to gather more information.
- It avoids N and E, as required.

This guess should help narrow down the possible positions for R and A and test new letters.

The second letter is not \'R\' (because R is present but in the wrong position), and the third letter is not \'A\' (for the same reason). Also, the word does not have \'N\' or \'E\' at all.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:\n- Starts with \'C\' (since we know the first letter is C).\n- Includes \'R\' and \'A\' (because they are in the secret word) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n- Avoids the letters \'N\' and \'E\' (since they are not in the word).\n- Also, we can try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nPossible positions for \'R\': it cannot be in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5?

In this word, there is an \'A\' in position 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if the secret word has one or two A\'s? The feedback only tells us that at least one \'A\' is present and not in position 3. Similarly for \'R\', not in position 2.\n\nBut in ""CARAT"", we have:\n- Position 2: A -> we haven\'t tested A in position 2? In the first guess, we had A in position 3.

In the first guess, R was in position 2, so position 3 is new for R.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""CARAT"", we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2 and 4. This is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we also need to avoid \'N\' and \'E\', which ""CARAT"" does.\n\nBut is ""CARAT"" a valid word? Yes, it means a unit of weight for precious stones.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? The secret word might have only one A? We don\'t know.

This is acceptable. Also, avoids \'N\' and \'E\'. And it\'s a valid word.\n\n""CAROB"": similar: C A R O B -> A in 2, R in 3.\n\n""CAROM"": C A R O M -> same.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and now we are putting R in position 3. Similarly, A was in position 3 and now we put it in position 2. This is good because we are testing new positions.\n\nWe can also consider putting R and A in positions 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, ""CABAR""? Not a word.\n\n""CAPER"": but E is in the word? We know E is not in the secret word. So we cannot use E. ""CAPER"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""CAIRN"": but N is in the word? We know N is not in the secret word. So invalid.\n\nSo ""CARGO"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""CARTY"" is not a word. ""CARVY""? Not a word.\n\n""CARDS"": has D and S. But we don\'t know about D and S. However, we must avoid E and N, which it does. But ""CARDS"": C A R D S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. Same as ""CARGO"". But ""CARDS"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have two options: ""CARGO"" and ""CARDS"". Both are valid.\n\nWe might also consider ""CRAWL"" but it has R in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWD""? But R is in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""CRWTH""? Not common and no A.\n\nWe need to include A.\n\nWhat about ""CORAL"": \n- C O R A L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L.\nHere, R is in position 3 (new) and A is in position 4 (new).

But to maximize information, it\'s better to have distinct letters. So ""CARAT"" has two A\'s, which might not be ideal.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARGO"", ""CARDS"", and ""CORAL"" have distinct letters.\n\nAmong these, which one tests more common letters? S, T, D, G, O, L are common.\n\nBut we have no information about the fourth and fifth letters yet.\n\nWe know the first letter is C, and we have R and A to place. We are testing positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn ""CORAL"", we put A in position 4 and R in position 3. This is different from the first guess.\n\nIn ""CARGO"", we put A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\nIn the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are swapping them?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""coral"" -> C(✓) O(✓) R(-) A(-) L(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1 (same as before).
- O is correct and in position 2 (new information).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in this guess and marked as wrong position).
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and marked as wrong position).
- L is not in the word.

So, combining the information:

1. The word starts with ""CO"" (positions 1 and 2 are C and O respectively).
2. The word contains R and A, but:
   - R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
   - A is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So A must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is now O (fixed), so A cannot be in position 2. Therefore, A must be in position 5? But we have only positions 3,4,5 left? Let's see:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ?
5: ?

We know A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4. Since position 2 is taken by O, the only position left for A is 5? But we have position 3,4, and 5. So A must be in position 5? Not necessarily, because the word might have more than one A? But we don't know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one A that is not in position 3 or 4. Since position 2 is fixed and not A, then A must be in position 5? 

But what if the word has two A's? For example, one in position 5 and one in position 3? But we know from the first guess that A is not in position 3. So if there is an A in position 3, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, no: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and the feedback said A is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is an A but not in position 3. So if there were an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct. Therefore, there is no A in position 3. Similarly, from the second guess, no A in position 4.

Therefore, the only position left for A is position 5? Because positions 1 and 2 are fixed and not A (position 1 is C, position 2 is O). So A must be in position 5.

Similarly, for R: we know it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 4 or 5. But if A is in position 5, then R cannot be in position 5? Unless the word has two of the same letter? But R and A are different. So if A is in position 5, then R must be in position 4.

But we don't know for sure that A is in position 5. Let me confirm:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: O (fixed)
3: ? (must not be A, and not R? But R is also not allowed in position 3)
4: ? 
5: ?

We know:
- A is present, but not in 3 or 4. Also, it cannot be in 1 or 2 (since 1 is C, 2 is O). So the only possibility is position 5. Therefore, A must be in position 5.

Similarly, R is present, not in 2 or 3. So R must be in 4? Because position 5 is A? So R in position 4.

But what if the word has two R's? Then R could be in position 5? But position 5 is A? No, position 5 is A, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore, R must be in position 4.

So we have:
Position 1: C
Position 2: O
Position 3: ? (unknown)
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

But wait, in the second guess, we had ""coral"" which is C O R A L, and the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 3 (which is where we put it). But if the secret word has R in position 4, then in ""coral"" we put R in position 3 and A in position 4, but the secret word has R in position 4 and A in position 5. So the feedback for R would be that it is present (because R is in the word, but in position 4, not 3) and for A, it is present (but in position 5, not 4). So that matches the feedback: R(-) and A(-).

Now, we also know that L is not in the word. And from the first guess, N and E are not in the word.

So the word is: C O _ R A

We need to fill the third letter. The third letter must be a letter that is not N, E, L (since we know these are absent) and it must form a valid English word.

What are the possibilities? The word is ""CO?RA"". 

Common English words: 
- CORAL? But we guessed that and it had L, which is not in the word. Also, in our guess ""coral"", the L was marked as absent, so the word is not ""coral"".
- COBRA: B is a new letter. Is B in the word? We don't know. But we haven't ruled it out.
- COMA? But that's 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters: CO?RA -> so the word must have 5 letters. ""COBRA"" is 5 letters: C O B R A.
- COPRA: C O P R A -> which is a word (dried coconut kernels).
- COSRA? Not a word.
- COVRA? Not a word.
- COERA? Not a word.

So possible words: ""COBRA"" and ""COPRA"".

We need to check if they meet the criteria.

First, both have:
- C in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 4
- A in position 5

And the third letter is B for ""COBRA"" and P for ""COPRA"".

We also know that the word does not contain: N, E, L (from previous feedback). Both ""COBRA"" and ""COPRA"" do not have N, E, or L.

So we have two candidates.

We need to make a guess that can distinguish between these two or confirm one.

We have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can guess one of them. But if we guess ""COBRA"" and it's wrong, we get feedback and then we know it's ""COPRA"". Similarly, if we guess ""COPRA"" and it's wrong, then it must be ""COBRA"".

But we can also try to guess a word that includes both B and P to test? But we don't have to, because we only have two options.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a letter that is in one but not the other? But both words have distinct letters: ""COBRA"" has B and ""COPRA"" has P.

So if we guess a word that contains B, then if B is present, it might be ""COBRA"", if absent, then ""COPRA"". But we don't have to, because we can just guess one of the candidates.

Since we have limited guesses, and we are on the third guess, we can guess ""COBRA"". If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's ""COPRA"" and we can guess that next.

But let me see: we have 6 guesses total, and we are on the third. So we can afford to guess one of them.

I think ""COBRA"" is a more common word, so I'll guess that.

But to be safe, we can also consider if there are other possibilities? 

What about ""COURA""? Not a word.
""COXRA""? Not a word.
""COZRA""? Not a word.

So only two: ""COBRA"" and ""COPRA"".

We also have to make sure that the third letter is not one of the absent letters. We know N, E, L are absent. Also, from the first guess, we had C, R, A, N, E. We know N and E are absent. In the second guess, we had C, O, R, A, L. We know L is absent. So the third letter must not be any of these: N, E, L.

B and P are not in the absent list, so they are possible.

Therefore, I will guess ""COBRA"".

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""COBRA"", R is in position 4, which is not position 2, so that's consistent. Similarly for A: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. In ""COBRA"", A is in position 5, which is not 3, so consistent.

Similarly for ""COPRA"".

So I think it's safe to guess ""COBRA"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2: coral** → C(✓) O(✓) R(-) A(-) L(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (consistent).
  - O is correct and in position 2 (new).
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.
  - L is absent.

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C** (confirmed).  
   - Position 2: **O** (confirmed).  
2. **R and A placement**:  
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback), so it must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Since positions 1 and 2 are fixed (C and O), A must be in position 5 (the only remaining position).  
   - With A in position 5, R must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: N, E, L are not in the word.  
4. **Word structure**: The secret word is **C O _ R A**.  
   - The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not in {N, E, L} and form a valid English word.  
   - Possible words: **COBRA** (with B) or **COPRA** (with P).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **COBRA** to directly check one of the candidate words.  
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm the word is **COPRA** (since only two options exist).  
- This approach efficiently narrows down the solution with minimal guesses.  

<guess>cobra</guess>",cobra,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""coral"" -> C(✓) O(✓) R(-) A(-) L(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1 (same as before).
- O is correct and in position 2 (new information).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in this guess and marked as wrong position).
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and marked as wrong position).
- L is not in the word.

So, combining the information:

1. The word starts with ""CO"" (positions 1 and 2 are C and O respectively).
2. The word contains R and A, but:
   - R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
   - A is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So A must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is now O (fixed), so A cannot be in position 2. Therefore, A must be in position 5? But we have only positions 3,4,5 left? Let's see:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ?
5: ?

We know A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4. Since position 2 is taken by O, the only position left for A is 5? But we have position 3,4, and 5. So A must be in position 5? Not necessarily, because the word might have more than one A? But we don't know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one A that is not in position 3 or 4. Since position 2 is fixed and not A, then A must be in position 5? 

But what if the word has two A's? For example, one in position 5 and one in position 3? But we know from the first guess that A is not in position 3. So if there is an A in position 3, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, no: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and the feedback said A is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is an A but not in position 3. So if there were an A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct. Therefore, there is no A in position 3. Similarly, from the second guess, no A in position 4.

Therefore, the only position left for A is position 5? Because positions 1 and 2 are fixed and not A (position 1 is C, position 2 is O). So A must be in position 5.

Similarly, for R: we know it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 4 or 5. But if A is in position 5, then R cannot be in position 5? Unless the word has two of the same letter? But R and A are different. So if A is in position 5, then R must be in position 4.

But we don't know for sure that A is in position 5. Let me confirm:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: O (fixed)
3: ? (must not be A, and not R? But R is also not allowed in position 3)
4: ? 
5: ?

We know:
- A is present, but not in 3 or 4. Also, it cannot be in 1 or 2 (since 1 is C, 2 is O). So the only possibility is position 5. Therefore, A must be in position 5.

Similarly, R is present, not in 2 or 3. So R must be in 4? Because position 5 is A? So R in position 4.

But what if the word has two R's? Then R could be in position 5? But position 5 is A? No, position 5 is A, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore, R must be in position 4.

So we have:
Position 1: C
Position 2: O
Position 3: ? (unknown)
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

But wait, in the second guess, we had ""coral"" which is C O R A L, and the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 3 (which is where we put it). But if the secret word has R in position 4, then in ""coral"" we put R in position 3 and A in position 4, but the secret word has R in position 4 and A in position 5. So the feedback for R would be that it is present (because R is in the word, but in position 4, not 3) and for A, it is present (but in position 5, not 4). So that matches the feedback: R(-) and A(-).

Now, we also know that L is not in the word. And from the first guess, N and E are not in the word.

So the word is: C O _ R A

- COPRA: C O P R A -> which is a word (dried coconut kernels).

B and P are not in the absent list, so they are possible.

Therefore, I will guess ""COBRA"".

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""COBRA"", R is in position 4, which is not position 2, so that's consistent. Similarly for A: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. In ""COBRA"", A is in position 5, which is not 3, so consistent.
