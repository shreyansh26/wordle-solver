We are going to make our first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback to go on.
 The goal is to maximize the information we get about the letters in the word. 
 A common strategy is to choose a word that has a combination of common letters and that also covers multiple common vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, etc. because they have common letters.

 Let me choose a word that uses 5 common letters: 
 We want a word that has distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

 For example, ""CRANE"" has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 But note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

 So my first guess is: CRANE
</think>
I'll start with a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) which can reveal key information about the secret word based on the feedback.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses left (since we used one).

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the word).
- Must contain the letter A, but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong). However, note that the feedback only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position (1,2,4,5). But we don't know which one.

We also want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to place A in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A and other common letters.

We can try to put A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in the first position or not. It could be.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a different position, say second or fourth.

Also, we want to cover more ground by including other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants.

One common strategy is to use a word that has as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some possibilities:

- We could try ""salad"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has S and L and D.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""stamp"": but it has S, T, A, M, P. However, note that we haven't tried S, T, M, P.

But wait: we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. So ""stamp"" is okay.

But let's see the feedback we might get: we can test S, T, A (again, but in a different position), M, P.

But we already know A is in the word, so we are using A to see if we can get its position.

However, we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: ""audio"" - but that has the vowels and we know E is out, but it has A, U, I, D, O. But note: we have 5 letters and we are testing 5 new letters. However, the word ""audio"" is valid.

But wait: we know that the secret word has an A, so we are including A. Also, we are testing U, I, D, O.

But the problem: we don't know if the word has any of these other vowels. And we are using a word that doesn't have many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and some common consonants.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common starting words after eliminating C,R,N,E: we might try ""sault"" or ""sandy"" but ""sandy"" has N and we know N is not in the word? Wait, no: we know N is not in the word because we got x for N in the first guess.

So we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, E.

So ""sandy"" is invalid because it has N and we know N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""stamp"" is okay because it has S, T, A, M, P and none of the forbidden letters.

But note: we have A in the second position in ""stamp"". We know A is in the word but not in the third position. It might be in the second? We don't know.

We can try ""stamp"".

Another option: ""laugh"" - has L, A, U, G, H. But we don't know if U is common? And we are testing two vowels (A and U) and three consonants.

But we want to maximize information.

Another common word: ""piano"" - but it has P, I, A, N, O. But wait, N is forbidden! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""piano"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""house"" has E and we know E is not in the word.

So we must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have A and other common letters without the forbidden ones.

Possible words:

- ""salad"": but has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it ends with D. But we can use it? But duplicate A might not be ideal for information.

- ""stamp"": S, T, A, M, P -> all new letters and no duplicates.

- ""blast"": but has B, L, A, S, T. But note: we haven't tried B, L, S, T. And A. But ""blast"" has A in the third position? We know A is not in the third position? No, we only know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third and it was wrong. But it could be in the third in the secret word? No, because if it were in the third, we would have gotten a check (✓) for A in the third. But we got a minus (-), meaning A is in the word but not in the third. So the secret word has A, but not in the third position. Therefore, in ""blast"", if we put A in the third, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for the next guess, we should put A in a position that we haven't tried and that is possible: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In ""stamp"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

In ""blast"", if we use it, we have A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we would get a minus for A again, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So let's avoid words that have A in the third position.

We can try:

- ""adapt"": but has A in first and fourth? And D, A, P, T. But note: it has two A's? Actually, ""adapt"" has A at position 1 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it has D, P, T. But we haven't tried these. However, we are repeating A? But we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the word at least once. But if we get two minuses, we don't know if there are two A's or one. So it might be confusing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with A in one new position and four new letters.

Let me list:

- Position 1: words like ""about"" -> but has O, U, B, T. But also, we know E is not in the word, so we avoid E. But ""about"" is valid? But it has A in first.

- ""table"": has E -> forbidden, so invalid.

- ""adult"": A in first, D, U, L, T.

- ""album"": A in first, L, B, U, M.

But we don't know if the word has U or not.

Another idea: ""pasta"" -> has A in second and fifth? And P, S, T. But we are testing two positions for A? And we know A is in the word, so we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don't know if there are two A's.

To avoid confusion, let's use a word with only one A and in a new position.

So:

- Position 1: ""adios"" -> but has O, S, D, I. But ""adios"" is 5 letters? A, D, I, O, S -> yes. And no forbidden letters.

- Position 2: ""stamp"" (as before) -> S, T, A, M, P.

- Position 4: ""delta"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

- Position 4: ""vocal"" -> has C and we know C is not in the word. Invalid.

- Position 4: ""focal"" -> again, has C.

- Position 4: ""modal"" -> M, O, D, A, L -> no forbidden letters. A in fourth position.

- Position 5: ""pizza"" -> has Z and two Z's? And A at the end. But we don't know about Z. Also, duplicate Z.

- Position 5: ""vodka"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> no forbidden letters.

But we want common letters.

I think ""stamp"" is a good candidate: common letters S, T, A, M, P.

Alternatively, ""adios"" is also good: tests A in first position and also the letters D, I, O, S.

But note: we are trying to find the word, and we have limited guesses. We want to get as much information as possible.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, it's hard.

Another word: ""splat"" -> S, P, L, A, T. A in the fourth position. And we test S, P, L, T.

But ""splat"" is a valid word? Yes.

Now, comparing:

- ""stamp"": tests S, T, A (position 2), M, P.
- ""adios"": tests A (position 1), D, I, O, S.
- ""splat"": tests S, P, L, A (position 4), T.

We haven't tried any of these letters, so any of them would be good.

But note: we have to avoid the third position for A.

I think I'll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).

So my next guess: stamp

But let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""stamp"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include A (since it's confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).
- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.

This guess will help identify:
- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.

But note: we have to avoid the third position for A.

I think I'll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).

So my next guess: stamp

But let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""stamp"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include A (since it's confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).
- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.

This guess will help identify:
- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.",Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

 The goal is to maximize the information we get about the letters in the word. 
 A common strategy is to choose a word that has a combination of common letters and that also covers multiple common vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, etc. because they have common letters.

 Let me choose a word that uses 5 common letters: 
 We want a word that has distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

 For example, ""CRANE"" has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 But note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

 So my first guess is: CRANEI'll start with a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) which can reveal key information about the secret word based on the feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses left (since we used one).

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the word).
- Must contain the letter A, but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong). However, note that the feedback only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position (1,2,4,5). But we don't know which one.

We also want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to place A in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A and other common letters.

We can try to put A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in the first position or not. It could be.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a different position, say second or fourth.

Also, we want to cover more ground by including other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants.

One common strategy is to use a word that has as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some possibilities:

- We could try ""salad"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has S and L and D.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""stamp"": but it has S, T, A, M, P. However, note that we haven't tried S, T, M, P.

But wait: we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. So ""stamp"" is okay.

But let's see the feedback we might get: we can test S, T, A (again, but in a different position), M, P.

But we already know A is in the word, so we are using A to see if we can get its position.

However, we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: ""audio"" - but that has the vowels and we know E is out, but it has A, U, I, D, O. But note: we have 5 letters and we are testing 5 new letters. However, the word ""audio"" is valid.

But wait: we know that the secret word has an A, so we are including A. Also, we are testing U, I, D, O.

But the problem: we don't know if the word has any of these other vowels. And we are using a word that doesn't have many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and some common consonants.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common starting words after eliminating C,R,N,E: we might try ""sault"" or ""sandy"" but ""sandy"" has N and we know N is not in the word? Wait, no: we know N is not in the word because we got x for N in the first guess.

So we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, E.

So ""sandy"" is invalid because it has N and we know N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""stamp"" is okay because it has S, T, A, M, P and none of the forbidden letters.

But note: we have A in the second position in ""stamp"". We know A is in the word but not in the third position. It might be in the second? We don't know.

We can try ""stamp"".

Another option: ""laugh"" - has L, A, U, G, H. But we don't know if U is common? And we are testing two vowels (A and U) and three consonants.

But we want to maximize information.

Another common word: ""piano"" - but it has P, I, A, N, O. But wait, N is forbidden! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""piano"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""house"" has E and we know E is not in the word.

So we must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have A and other common letters without the forbidden ones.

Possible words:

- ""salad"": but has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it ends with D. But we can use it? But duplicate A might not be ideal for information.

- ""stamp"": S, T, A, M, P -> all new letters and no duplicates.

- ""blast"": but has B, L, A, S, T. But note: we haven't tried B, L, S, T. And A. But ""blast"" has A in the third position? We know A is not in the third position? No, we only know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third and it was wrong. But it could be in the third in the secret word? No, because if it were in the third, we would have gotten a check (✓) for A in the third. But we got a minus (-), meaning A is in the word but not in the third. So the secret word has A, but not in the third position. Therefore, in ""blast"", if we put A in the third, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for the next guess, we should put A in a position that we haven't tried and that is possible: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In ""stamp"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

In ""blast"", if we use it, we have A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we would get a minus for A again, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So let's avoid words that have A in the third position.

We can try:

- ""adapt"": but has A in first and fourth? And D, A, P, T. But note: it has two A's? Actually, ""adapt"" has A at position 1 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it has D, P, T. But we haven't tried these. However, we are repeating A? But we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the word at least once. But if we get two minuses, we don't know if there are two A's or one. So it might be confusing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with A in one new position and four new letters.

Let me list:

- Position 1: words like ""about"" -> but has O, U, B, T. But also, we know E is not in the word, so we avoid E. But ""about"" is valid? But it has A in first.

- ""table"": has E -> forbidden, so invalid.

- ""adult"": A in first, D, U, L, T.

- ""album"": A in first, L, B, U, M.

But we don't know if the word has U or not.

Another idea: ""pasta"" -> has A in second and fifth? And P, S, T. But we are testing two positions for A? And we know A is in the word, so we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don't know if there are two A's.

To avoid confusion, let's use a word with only one A and in a new position.

So:

- Position 1: ""adios"" -> but has O, S, D, I. But ""adios"" is 5 letters? A, D, I, O, S -> yes. And no forbidden letters.

- Position 2: ""stamp"" (as before) -> S, T, A, M, P.

- Position 4: ""delta"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

- Position 4: ""vocal"" -> has C and we know C is not in the word. Invalid.

- Position 4: ""focal"" -> again, has C.

- Position 4: ""modal"" -> M, O, D, A, L -> no forbidden letters. A in fourth position.

- Position 5: ""pizza"" -> has Z and two Z's? And A at the end. But we don't know about Z. Also, duplicate Z.

- Position 5: ""vodka"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> no forbidden letters.

But we want common letters.

I think ""stamp"" is a good candidate: common letters S, T, A, M, P.

Alternatively, ""adios"" is also good: tests A in first position and also the letters D, I, O, S.

But note: we are trying to find the word, and we have limited guesses. We want to get as much information as possible.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, it's hard.

Another word: ""splat"" -> S, P, L, A, T. A in the fourth position. And we test S, P, L, T.

But ""splat"" is a valid word? Yes.

Now, comparing:

- ""stamp"": tests S, T, A (position 2), M, P.
- ""adios"": tests A (position 1), D, I, O, S.
- ""splat"": tests S, P, L, A (position 4), T.

We haven't tried any of these letters, so any of them would be good.

But note: we have to avoid the third position for A.

I think I'll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).

So my next guess: stamp

But let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""stamp"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include A (since it's confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).
- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.

This guess will help identify:
- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.

  Now in STAMP, A is again in position 3 and again got '-'. This is consistent: A is in the word but not in position 3.

But also, we have:
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, M, P

Letters in the word but position unknown: A and T

We know A is in the word but not in position 3. We know T is in the word but not in position 2 (from STAMP feedback).

Also, we have no information about other letters.

We have used 2 guesses, so we have 4 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P
- Tries to place A and T in positions we haven't tried for them.

For A, we have tried position 3 (twice, but same position) and it was wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

For T, we have tried position 2 (in STAMP) and it was wrong. So T cannot be in position 2. Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to include three new letters to test.

We should choose common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A and T, and three new letters, with A not in position 3 and T not in position 2.

Let's think of words that have A and T.

Possible words:

- With A and T, and avoiding the bad letters.

For example, ""TABLE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""TRAIN"" - R is bad, so no.

""PLANT"" - P, L, A, N, T -> but P and N are bad.

""LIGHT"" - no A.

""FIGHT"" - no A.

""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> this has A and T, and B, O, U are new. Also, positions: A in 1, T in 5. 
But we have to check if the positions are allowed: 
- A is in position 1: we haven't tried A in position 1 before, so that's good.
- T is in position 5: we haven't tried T in position 5, so that's okay.

Also, the word ""about"" is valid.

Another word: ""ADULT"" - A, D, U, L, T -> A in 1, T in 5. Also, D, U, L are new.

""ADOPT"" - but P is bad.

""ADULT"" is okay? But let's see: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 

But we have to avoid T in position 2? In ADULT, T is in position 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""TAKEN"" - N and E are bad.

""FAULT"" - F, A, U, L, T -> A in 2, T in 5. 
But A in position 2: we haven't tried A in position 2? In STAMP, A was in position 3, not 2. So position 2 for A is new.

Similarly, T in position 5 is new.

""FAULT"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the bad letters, and F, U, L are not in the bad list.

Another word: ""HAULT"" - not common, but ""halt"" is 4 letters. ""HAULT"" might not be a word. Better to use common words.

""FAULT"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""BALDY"" - B, A, L, D, Y -> but no T. We must include T because we know T is in the word.

We must include both A and T.

""TAXIS"" - but S is bad.

""LATIN"" - N is bad.

""DAILY"" - no T.

""OCTAL"" - C and O, but C is bad.

So let's consider ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"".

In ""ABOUT"": 
- A in position 1 (new position for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests B, O, U

In ""FAULT"":
- A in position 2 (new for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests F, U, L

We also have the possibility of placing A and T in other positions.

For example, A in position 4 and T in position 1? 

Word like ""TABOO"" - T, A, B, O, O -> but duplicate O? And A in position 2? Actually, T(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), O(5). But we have T in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new). But duplicate O might not be ideal.

""TALON"" - N is bad.

""VALID"" - no T.

""PATIO"" - P is bad.

""RADIO"" - R is bad.

So ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"" seem good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" - A, U, D, I, O -> but no T. We must include T.

""ADMIT"" - M and T, but M is bad.

""ADOPT"" - P bad.

So I think ""ABOUT"" or ""FAULT"" are good choices.

But let's see which one tests more common letters.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

In ""ABOUT"": B, O, U
In ""FAULT"": F, U, L

Both U is common. B and O are common, F and L are also common.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has A, and we haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

In ""ABOUT"", we test O and U, which are vowels.

In ""FAULT"", we test U and L (consonant).

But we also know that the word has at least two letters: A and T. So we need to find three more.

We have 5 positions to fill.

We might also consider that the word might have more common consonants.

But without more information, both are fine.

I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests three new common letters and places A and T in new positions.

So guess: ABOUT

But let's double-check the positions:

ABOUT: 
- A in position 1
- B in position 2
- O in position 3
- U in position 4
- T in position 5

We know:
- A cannot be in position 3 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 1.
- T cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 5.

So if we get:
- If A is in position 1, we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, we get a minus (-) and know A is not in position 1.
- Similarly for T in position 5.

Also, we get feedback on B, O, U.

This will help narrow down.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""about"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (STAMP)**: T is in the word but not in position 2. A is still not in position 3 (consistent with Guess 1). S, M, P are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, M, P (not in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (tried twice).
  - T cannot be in position 2.
- **Remaining possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A and T while introducing untested common letters (e.g., B, O, U, L, F, D) to maximize information.

### Why ""ABOUT"" is a strong guess:
- **Tests A in a new position (1)**: We haven't checked position 1 for A yet.
- **Tests T in a new position (5)**: We haven't checked position 5 for T yet.
- **Introduces new common letters**: B, O, U are high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
- **Word validity**: ""ABOUT"" is a common 5-letter word.

This guess will help:
- Confirm or rule out A in position 1 and T in position 5.
- Check if B, O, or U are in the word and their positions.
- Narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

<guess>about</guess>",about,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3? Wait, in STAMP, A is in position 3? Let's check:
  STAMP: S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5)
  But in the feedback for STAMP, A is marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3? 
  However, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's not in position 3. 
  Now in STAMP, A is again in position 3 and again got '-'. This is consistent: A is in the word but not in position 3.

But also, we have:
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, M, P

Letters in the word but position unknown: A and T

We know A is in the word but not in position 3. We know T is in the word but not in position 2 (from STAMP feedback).

Also, we have no information about other letters.

We have used 2 guesses, so we have 4 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P
- Tries to place A and T in positions we haven't tried for them.

For A, we have tried position 3 (twice, but same position) and it was wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

For T, we have tried position 2 (in STAMP) and it was wrong. So T cannot be in position 2. Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to include three new letters to test.

We should choose common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A and T, and three new letters, with A not in position 3 and T not in position 2.

Let's think of words that have A and T.

Possible words:

- With A and T, and avoiding the bad letters.

For example, ""TABLE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""TRAIN"" - R is bad, so no.

""PLANT"" - P, L, A, N, T -> but P and N are bad.

""LIGHT"" - no A.

""FIGHT"" - no A.

""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> this has A and T, and B, O, U are new. Also, positions: A in 1, T in 5. 
But we have to check if the positions are allowed: 
- A is in position 1: we haven't tried A in position 1 before, so that's good.
- T is in position 5: we haven't tried T in position 5, so that's okay.

Also, the word ""about"" is valid.

Another word: ""ADULT"" - A, D, U, L, T -> A in 1, T in 5. Also, D, U, L are new.

""ADOPT"" - but P is bad.

""ADULT"" is okay? But let's see: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 

But we have to avoid T in position 2? In ADULT, T is in position 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""TAKEN"" - N and E are bad.

""FAULT"" - F, A, U, L, T -> A in 2, T in 5. 
But A in position 2: we haven't tried A in position 2? In STAMP, A was in position 3, not 2. So position 2 for A is new.

Similarly, T in position 5 is new.

""FAULT"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the bad letters, and F, U, L are not in the bad list.

Another word: ""HAULT"" - not common, but ""halt"" is 4 letters. ""HAULT"" might not be a word. Better to use common words.

""FAULT"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""BALDY"" - B, A, L, D, Y -> but no T. We must include T because we know T is in the word.

We must include both A and T.

""TAXIS"" - but S is bad.

""LATIN"" - N is bad.

""DAILY"" - no T.

""OCTAL"" - C and O, but C is bad.

So let's consider ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"".

In ""ABOUT"": 
- A in position 1 (new position for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests B, O, U

In ""FAULT"":
- A in position 2 (new for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests F, U, L

We also have the possibility of placing A and T in other positions.

For example, A in position 4 and T in position 1? 

Word like ""TABOO"" - T, A, B, O, O -> but duplicate O? And A in position 2? Actually, T(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), O(5). But we have T in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new). But duplicate O might not be ideal.

""TALON"" - N is bad.

""VALID"" - no T.

""PATIO"" - P is bad.

""RADIO"" - R is bad.

So ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"" seem good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" - A, U, D, I, O -> but no T. We must include T.

""ADMIT"" - M and T, but M is bad.

""ADOPT"" - P bad.

So I think ""ABOUT"" or ""FAULT"" are good choices.

But let's see which one tests more common letters.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

In ""ABOUT"": B, O, U
In ""FAULT"": F, U, L

Both U is common. B and O are common, F and L are also common.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has A, and we haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

In ""ABOUT"", we test O and U, which are vowels.

In ""FAULT"", we test U and L (consonant).

But we also know that the word has at least two letters: A and T. So we need to find three more.

We have 5 positions to fill.

We might also consider that the word might have more common consonants.

But without more information, both are fine.

I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests three new common letters and places A and T in new positions.

So guess: ABOUT

But let's double-check the positions:

ABOUT: 
- A in position 1
- B in position 2
- O in position 3
- U in position 4
- T in position 5

We know:
- A cannot be in position 3 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 1.
- T cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 5.

So if we get:
- If A is in position 1, we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, we get a minus (-) and know A is not in position 1.
- Similarly for T in position 5.

Also, we get feedback on B, O, U.

This will help narrow down.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""about"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (STAMP)**: T is in the word but not in position 2. A is still not in position 3 (consistent with Guess 1). S, M, P are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, M, P (not in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (tried twice).
  - T cannot be in position 2.
- **Remaining possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A and T while introducing untested common letters (e.g., B, O, U, L, F, D) to maximize information.

### Why ""ABOUT"" is a strong guess:

- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
- **Word validity**: ""ABOUT"" is a common 5-letter word.

This guess will help:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are going to make our first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback to go on.
 The goal is to maximize the information we get about the letters in the word. 
 A common strategy is to choose a word that has a combination of common letters and that also covers multiple common vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, etc. because they have common letters.

 Let me choose a word that uses 5 common letters: 
 We want a word that has distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

 For example, ""CRANE"" has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 But note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

 So my first guess is: CRANEI'll start with a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) which can reveal key information about the secret word based on the feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses left (since we used one).

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the word).
- Must contain the letter A, but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong). However, note that the feedback only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position (1,2,4,5). But we don't know which one.

We also want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to place A in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A and other common letters.

We can try to put A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in the first position or not. It could be.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a different position, say second or fourth.

Also, we want to cover more ground by including other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants.

One common strategy is to use a word that has as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some possibilities:

- We could try ""salad"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has S and L and D.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""stamp"": but it has S, T, A, M, P. However, note that we haven't tried S, T, M, P.

But wait: we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. So ""stamp"" is okay.

But let's see the feedback we might get: we can test S, T, A (again, but in a different position), M, P.

But we already know A is in the word, so we are using A to see if we can get its position.

However, we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: ""audio"" - but that has the vowels and we know E is out, but it has A, U, I, D, O. But note: we have 5 letters and we are testing 5 new letters. However, the word ""audio"" is valid.

But wait: we know that the secret word has an A, so we are including A. Also, we are testing U, I, D, O.

But the problem: we don't know if the word has any of these other vowels. And we are using a word that doesn't have many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and some common consonants.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common starting words after eliminating C,R,N,E: we might try ""sault"" or ""sandy"" but ""sandy"" has N and we know N is not in the word? Wait, no: we know N is not in the word because we got x for N in the first guess.

So we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, E.

So ""sandy"" is invalid because it has N and we know N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""stamp"" is okay because it has S, T, A, M, P and none of the forbidden letters.

But note: we have A in the second position in ""stamp"". We know A is in the word but not in the third position. It might be in the second? We don't know.

We can try ""stamp"".

Another option: ""laugh"" - has L, A, U, G, H. But we don't know if U is common? And we are testing two vowels (A and U) and three consonants.

But we want to maximize information.

Another common word: ""piano"" - but it has P, I, A, N, O. But wait, N is forbidden! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""piano"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""house"" has E and we know E is not in the word.

So we must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have A and other common letters without the forbidden ones.

Possible words:

- ""salad"": but has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it ends with D. But we can use it? But duplicate A might not be ideal for information.

- ""stamp"": S, T, A, M, P -> all new letters and no duplicates.

- ""blast"": but has B, L, A, S, T. But note: we haven't tried B, L, S, T. And A. But ""blast"" has A in the third position? We know A is not in the third position? No, we only know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third and it was wrong. But it could be in the third in the secret word? No, because if it were in the third, we would have gotten a check (✓) for A in the third. But we got a minus (-), meaning A is in the word but not in the third. So the secret word has A, but not in the third position. Therefore, in ""blast"", if we put A in the third, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for the next guess, we should put A in a position that we haven't tried and that is possible: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In ""stamp"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

In ""blast"", if we use it, we have A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we would get a minus for A again, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So let's avoid words that have A in the third position.

We can try:

- ""adapt"": but has A in first and fourth? And D, A, P, T. But note: it has two A's? Actually, ""adapt"" has A at position 1 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it has D, P, T. But we haven't tried these. However, we are repeating A? But we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the word at least once. But if we get two minuses, we don't know if there are two A's or one. So it might be confusing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with A in one new position and four new letters.

Let me list:

- Position 1: words like ""about"" -> but has O, U, B, T. But also, we know E is not in the word, so we avoid E. But ""about"" is valid? But it has A in first.

- ""table"": has E -> forbidden, so invalid.

- ""adult"": A in first, D, U, L, T.

- ""album"": A in first, L, B, U, M.

But we don't know if the word has U or not.

Another idea: ""pasta"" -> has A in second and fifth? And P, S, T. But we are testing two positions for A? And we know A is in the word, so we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don't know if there are two A's.

To avoid confusion, let's use a word with only one A and in a new position.

So:

- Position 1: ""adios"" -> but has O, S, D, I. But ""adios"" is 5 letters? A, D, I, O, S -> yes. And no forbidden letters.

- Position 2: ""stamp"" (as before) -> S, T, A, M, P.

- Position 4: ""delta"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

- Position 4: ""vocal"" -> has C and we know C is not in the word. Invalid.

- Position 4: ""focal"" -> again, has C.

- Position 4: ""modal"" -> M, O, D, A, L -> no forbidden letters. A in fourth position.

- Position 5: ""pizza"" -> has Z and two Z's? And A at the end. But we don't know about Z. Also, duplicate Z.

- Position 5: ""vodka"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> no forbidden letters.

But we want common letters.

I think ""stamp"" is a good candidate: common letters S, T, A, M, P.

Alternatively, ""adios"" is also good: tests A in first position and also the letters D, I, O, S.

But note: we are trying to find the word, and we have limited guesses. We want to get as much information as possible.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, it's hard.

Another word: ""splat"" -> S, P, L, A, T. A in the fourth position. And we test S, P, L, T.

But ""splat"" is a valid word? Yes.

Now, comparing:

- ""stamp"": tests S, T, A (position 2), M, P.
- ""adios"": tests A (position 1), D, I, O, S.
- ""splat"": tests S, P, L, A (position 4), T.

We haven't tried any of these letters, so any of them would be good.

But note: we have to avoid the third position for A.

I think I'll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).

So my next guess: stamp

But let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""stamp"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include A (since it's confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).
- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.

This guess will help identify:
- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>stamp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3? Wait, in STAMP, A is in position 3? Let's check:
  STAMP: S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5)
  But in the feedback for STAMP, A is marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3? 
  However, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's not in position 3. 
  Now in STAMP, A is again in position 3 and again got '-'. This is consistent: A is in the word but not in position 3.

But also, we have:
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, M, P

Letters in the word but position unknown: A and T

We know A is in the word but not in position 3. We know T is in the word but not in position 2 (from STAMP feedback).

Also, we have no information about other letters.

We have used 2 guesses, so we have 4 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P
- Tries to place A and T in positions we haven't tried for them.

For A, we have tried position 3 (twice, but same position) and it was wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

For T, we have tried position 2 (in STAMP) and it was wrong. So T cannot be in position 2. Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to include three new letters to test.

We should choose common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A and T, and three new letters, with A not in position 3 and T not in position 2.

Let's think of words that have A and T.

Possible words:

- With A and T, and avoiding the bad letters.

For example, ""TABLE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""TRAIN"" - R is bad, so no.

""PLANT"" - P, L, A, N, T -> but P and N are bad.

""LIGHT"" - no A.

""FIGHT"" - no A.

""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> this has A and T, and B, O, U are new. Also, positions: A in 1, T in 5. 
But we have to check if the positions are allowed: 
- A is in position 1: we haven't tried A in position 1 before, so that's good.
- T is in position 5: we haven't tried T in position 5, so that's okay.

Also, the word ""about"" is valid.

Another word: ""ADULT"" - A, D, U, L, T -> A in 1, T in 5. Also, D, U, L are new.

""ADOPT"" - but P is bad.

""ADULT"" is okay? But let's see: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 

But we have to avoid T in position 2? In ADULT, T is in position 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""TAKEN"" - N and E are bad.

""FAULT"" - F, A, U, L, T -> A in 2, T in 5. 
But A in position 2: we haven't tried A in position 2? In STAMP, A was in position 3, not 2. So position 2 for A is new.

Similarly, T in position 5 is new.

""FAULT"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the bad letters, and F, U, L are not in the bad list.

Another word: ""HAULT"" - not common, but ""halt"" is 4 letters. ""HAULT"" might not be a word. Better to use common words.

""FAULT"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""BALDY"" - B, A, L, D, Y -> but no T. We must include T because we know T is in the word.

We must include both A and T.

""TAXIS"" - but S is bad.

""LATIN"" - N is bad.

""DAILY"" - no T.

""OCTAL"" - C and O, but C is bad.

So let's consider ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"".

In ""ABOUT"": 
- A in position 1 (new position for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests B, O, U

In ""FAULT"":
- A in position 2 (new for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests F, U, L

We also have the possibility of placing A and T in other positions.

For example, A in position 4 and T in position 1? 

Word like ""TABOO"" - T, A, B, O, O -> but duplicate O? And A in position 2? Actually, T(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), O(5). But we have T in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new). But duplicate O might not be ideal.

""TALON"" - N is bad.

""VALID"" - no T.

""PATIO"" - P is bad.

""RADIO"" - R is bad.

So ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"" seem good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" - A, U, D, I, O -> but no T. We must include T.

""ADMIT"" - M and T, but M is bad.

""ADOPT"" - P bad.

So I think ""ABOUT"" or ""FAULT"" are good choices.

But let's see which one tests more common letters.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

In ""ABOUT"": B, O, U
In ""FAULT"": F, U, L

Both U is common. B and O are common, F and L are also common.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has A, and we haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

In ""ABOUT"", we test O and U, which are vowels.

In ""FAULT"", we test U and L (consonant).

But we also know that the word has at least two letters: A and T. So we need to find three more.

We have 5 positions to fill.

We might also consider that the word might have more common consonants.

But without more information, both are fine.

I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests three new common letters and places A and T in new positions.

So guess: ABOUT

But let's double-check the positions:

ABOUT: 
- A in position 1
- B in position 2
- O in position 3
- U in position 4
- T in position 5

We know:
- A cannot be in position 3 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 1.
- T cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 5.

So if we get:
- If A is in position 1, we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, we get a minus (-) and know A is not in position 1.
- Similarly for T in position 5.

Also, we get feedback on B, O, U.

This will help narrow down.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""about"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (STAMP)**: T is in the word but not in position 2. A is still not in position 3 (consistent with Guess 1). S, M, P are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, M, P (not in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (tried twice).
  - T cannot be in position 2.
- **Remaining possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A and T while introducing untested common letters (e.g., B, O, U, L, F, D) to maximize information.

### Why ""ABOUT"" is a strong guess:
- **Tests A in a new position (1)**: We haven't checked position 1 for A yet.
- **Tests T in a new position (5)**: We haven't checked position 5 for T yet.
- **Introduces new common letters**: B, O, U are high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
- **Word validity**: ""ABOUT"" is a common 5-letter word.

This guess will help:
- Confirm or rule out A in position 1 and T in position 5.
- Check if B, O, or U are in the word and their positions.
- Narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

However, note that we haven\'t tried S, T, M, P.\n\nBut wait: we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. So ""stamp"" is okay.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get: we can test S, T, A (again, but in a different position), M, P.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so we are using A to see if we can get its position.\n\nHowever, we also want to test new letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""audio"" - but that has the vowels and we know E is out, but it has A, U, I, D, O. But note: we have 5 letters and we are testing 5 new letters. However, the word ""audio"" is valid.\n\nBut wait: we know that the secret word has an A, so we are including A. Also, we are testing U, I, D, O.\n\nBut the problem: we don\'t know if the word has any of these other vowels. And we are using a word that doesn\'t have many consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A and some common consonants.\n\nLet me think of words without C, R, N, E.\n\nCommon starting words after eliminating C,R,N,E: we might try ""sault"" or ""sandy"" but ""sandy"" has N and we know N is not in the word? Wait, no: we know N is not in the word because we got x for N in the first guess.\n\nSo we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, E.\n\nSo ""sandy"" is invalid because it has N and we know N is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""stamp"" is okay because it has S, T, A, M, P and none of the forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: we have A in the second position in ""stamp"". We know A is in the word but not in the third position. It might be in the second? We don\'t know.\n\nWe can try ""stamp"".\n\nAnother option: ""laugh"" - has L, A, U, G, H. But we don\'t know if U is common? And we are testing two vowels (A and U) and three consonants.\n\nBut we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother common word: ""piano"" - but it has P, I, A, N, O. But wait, N is forbidden! We cannot use N because we know it\'s not in the word. So ""piano"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""house"" has E and we know E is not in the word.\n\nSo we must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have A and other common letters without the forbidden ones.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""salad"": but has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, it ends with D. But we can use it? But duplicate A might not be ideal for information.\n\n- ""stamp"": S, T, A, M, P -> all new letters and no duplicates.\n\n- ""blast"": but has B, L, A, S, T. But note: we haven\'t tried B, L, S, T. And A. But ""blast"" has A in the third position? We know A is not in the third position? No, we only know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third and it was wrong. But it could be in the third in the secret word? No, because if it were in the third, we would have gotten a check (✓) for A in the third. But we got a minus (-), meaning A is in the word but not in the third. So the secret word has A, but not in the third position. Therefore, in ""blast"", if we put A in the third, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should put A in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is possible: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""stamp"", A is in position 2. That\'s a new position.\n\nIn ""blast"", if we use it, we have A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we would get a minus for A again, but we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid words that have A in the third position.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- ""adapt"": but has A in first and fourth? And D, A, P, T. But note: it has two A\'s? Actually, ""adapt"" has A at position 1 and 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, it has D, P, T. But we haven\'t tried these. However, we are repeating A? But we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the word at least once. But if we get two minuses, we don\'t know if there are two A\'s or one. So it might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word with A in one new position and four new letters.\n\nLet me list:\n\n- Position 1: words like ""about"" -> but has O, U, B, T. But also, we know E is not in the word, so we avoid E. But ""about"" is valid? But it has A in first.\n\n- ""table"": has E -> forbidden, so invalid.\n\n- ""adult"": A in first, D, U, L, T.\n\n- ""album"": A in first, L, B, U, M.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has U or not.\n\nAnother idea: ""pasta"" -> has A in second and fifth? And P, S, T. But we are testing two positions for A? And we know A is in the word, so we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s use a word with only one A and in a new position.\n\nSo:\n\n- Position 1: ""adios"" -> but has O, S, D, I. But ""adios"" is 5 letters? A, D, I, O, S -> yes. And no forbidden letters.\n\n- Position 2: ""stamp"" (as before) -> S, T, A, M, P.\n\n- Position 4: ""delta"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. So invalid.\n\n- Position 4: ""vocal"" -> has C and we know C is not in the word. Invalid.\n\n- Position 4: ""focal"" -> again, has C.\n\n- Position 4: ""modal"" -> M, O, D, A, L -> no forbidden letters. A in fourth position.\n\n- Position 5: ""pizza"" -> has Z and two Z\'s? And A at the end. But we don\'t know about Z. Also, duplicate Z.\n\n- Position 5: ""vodka"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> no forbidden letters.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nI think ""stamp"" is a good candidate: common letters S, T, A, M, P.\n\nAlternatively, ""adios"" is also good: tests A in first position and also the letters D, I, O, S.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the word, and we have limited guesses. We want to get as much information as possible.\n\nSince we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""splat"" -> S, P, L, A, T. A in the fourth position. And we test S, P, L, T.\n\nBut ""splat"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\n- ""stamp"": tests S, T, A (position 2), M, P.\n- ""adios"": tests A (position 1), D, I, O, S.\n- ""splat"": tests S, P, L, A (position 4), T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried any of these letters, so any of them would be good.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the third position for A.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).\n\nSo my next guess: stamp\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""stamp"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include A (since it\'s confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.\n- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).\n- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify:\n- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it\'s elsewhere (-).\n- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>stamp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: STAMP\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3?

Also, positions: A in 1, T in 5. \nBut we have to check if the positions are allowed: \n- A is in position 1: we haven\'t tried A in position 1 before, so that\'s good.\n- T is in position 5: we haven\'t tried T in position 5, so that\'s okay.\n\nAlso, the word ""about"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ADULT"" - A, D, U, L, T -> A in 1, T in 5. Also, D, U, L are new.\n\n""ADOPT"" - but P is bad.\n\n""ADULT"" is okay? But let\'s see: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). \n\nBut we have to avoid T in position 2? In ADULT, T is in position 5, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""TAKEN"" - N and E are bad.\n\n""FAULT"" - F, A, U, L, T -> A in 2, T in 5. \nBut A in position 2: we haven\'t tried A in position 2? In STAMP, A was in position 3, not 2. So position 2 for A is new.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 5 is new.\n\n""FAULT"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the bad letters, and F, U, L are not in the bad list.\n\nAnother word: ""HAULT"" - not common, but ""halt"" is 4 letters. ""HAULT"" might not be a word. Better to use common words.\n\n""FAULT"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""BALDY"" - B, A, L, D, Y -> but no T. We must include T because we know T is in the word.\n\nWe must include both A and T.\n\n""TAXIS"" - but S is bad.\n\n""LATIN"" - N is bad.\n\n""DAILY"" - no T.\n\n""OCTAL"" - C and O, but C is bad.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"".\n\nIn ""ABOUT"": \n- A in position 1 (new position for A)\n- T in position 5 (new for T)\n- Tests B, O, U\n\nIn ""FAULT"":\n- A in position 2 (new for A)\n- T in position 5 (new for T)\n- Tests F, U, L\n\nWe also have the possibility of placing A and T in other positions.\n\nFor example, A in position 4 and T in position 1? \n\nWord like ""TABOO"" - T, A, B, O, O -> but duplicate O? And A in position 2? Actually, T(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), O(5). But we have T in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new). But duplicate O might not be ideal.\n\n""TALON"" - N is bad.\n\n""VALID"" - no T.\n\n""PATIO"" - P is bad.\n\n""RADIO"" - R is bad.\n\nSo ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"" seem good.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" - A, U, D, I, O -> but no T. We must include T.\n\n""ADMIT"" - M and T, but M is bad.\n\n""ADOPT"" - P bad.\n\nSo I think ""ABOUT"" or ""FAULT"" are good choices.\n\nBut let\'s see which one tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.\n\nIn ""ABOUT"": B, O, U\nIn ""FAULT"": F, U, L\n\nBoth U is common. B and O are common, F and L are also common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has A, and we haven\'t tested O, U, I, etc.\n\nIn ""ABOUT"", we test O and U, which are vowels.\n\nIn ""FAULT"", we test U and L (consonant).\n\nBut we also know that the word has at least two letters: A and T. So we need to find three more.\n\nWe have 5 positions to fill.\n\nWe might also consider that the word might have more common consonants.\n\nBut without more information, both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests three new common letters and places A and T in new positions.\n\nSo guess: ABOUT\n\nBut let\'s double-check the positions:\n\nABOUT: \n- A in position 1\n- B in position 2\n- O in position 3\n- U in position 4\n- T in position 5\n\nWe know:\n- A cannot be in position 3 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 1.\n- T cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 5.\n\nSo if we get:\n- If A is in position 1, we get a check (✓) for A.\n- If not, we get a minus (-) and know A is not in position 1.\n- Similarly for T in position 5.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on B, O, U.\n\nThis will help narrow down.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""about"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (STAMP)**: T is in the word but not in position 2. A is still not in position 3 (consistent with Guess 1). S, M, P are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, M, P (not in the word).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - A cannot be in position 3 (tried twice).\n  - T cannot be in position 2.\n- **Remaining possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A and T while introducing untested common letters (e.g., B, O, U, L, F, D) to maximize information.\n\n### Why ""ABOUT"" is a strong guess:\n- **Tests A in a new position (1)**: We haven\'t checked position 1 for A yet.\n- **Tests T in a new position (5)**: We haven\'t checked position 5 for T yet.\n- **Introduces new common letters**: B, O, U are high-frequency letters not yet tested.\n- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No C, R, N, E, S, M, P.\n- **Word validity**: ""ABOUT"" is a common 5-letter word.\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm or rule out A in position 1 and T in position 5.\n- Check if B, O, or U are in the word and their positions.\n- Narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3, again)
- M: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ABOUT
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 1)
- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 5)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains A and T, but we don't know their positions.
- A is not in positions 1, 3 (tried in 1 and 3, both gave '-')
- T is not in positions 2, 5 (tried in 2 and 5, both gave '-')
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P, B, O, U (all marked 'x' in at least one guess)

Therefore, the remaining possible positions for A are: 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
For T, the remaining possible positions are: 1, 3, or 4 (positions 2 and 5 are ruled out).

We have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the eliminated letters: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U
- Tries A in one of the new possible positions (2,4,5) and T in one of the new possible positions (1,3,4)
- Introduces new letters to test, from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (not eliminated and not yet tried): 
- Vowels: I (since A is already in, but we need to test I? But we don't know if I is in the word) and Y (sometimes vowel).
- Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y.

We need to choose a word that has A and T, and three new letters from the available set.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,3,4

Note: Position 4 is possible for both A and T, but they can't both be in position 4. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Let's try to find words that fit.

Option 1: Place A in position 2 and T in position 1? 
- Word pattern: T _ A _ _
But we need to fill the blanks with new letters.

Option 2: A in position 2 and T in position 3: _ A T _ _
Option 3: A in position 2 and T in position 4: _ A _ T _
Option 4: A in position 4 and T in position 1: T _ _ A _
Option 5: A in position 4 and T in position 3: _ _ T A _
Option 6: A in position 5 and T in position 1: T _ _ _ A
Option 7: A in position 5 and T in position 3: _ _ T _ A
Option 8: A in position 5 and T in position 4: _ _ _ T A

We also have to use only available letters.

Let's try to form words:

For example, option 2: _ A T _ _ 
We need a word with A in second and T in third. Possible words: 
- ""BATHE"" but B and E are eliminated.
- ""LATCH"" but C is eliminated.
- ""HATCH"" same issue.
- ""MATCH"" M and C eliminated.
- ""PATCH"" P and C eliminated.

With available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y, etc.

""LATHY"" - not a common word? L, A, T, H, Y -> but we have A in 2, T in 3: L-A-T-H-Y. Is ""lathy"" a word? It means something slender or flexible, but might be obscure.

""PATHY"" - not a word.

""BATTY"" - B eliminated.

""FATTY"" - F, A, T, T, Y -> but duplicate T? We don't know if T can be duplicated. But we have only one T confirmed so far? The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we must consider the possibility. But to be safe, avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""HATYL"" - not a word.

So option 2 might be hard.

Option 3: _ A _ T _
For example, ""FAITH"" - F, A, I, T, H -> but I and H are available. However, we haven't tried I. But ""faith"" has A in 2, T in 4? Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), T(4), H(5). So T is in 4, which is allowed? But we have T in position 4, and we haven't tried T in 4 before? Yes, we tried T in 2 and 5, not 4.

But we also have A in 2, which is a new position for A (we tried 1 and 3, not 2).

So ""faith"" is a valid word. Letters: F, A, I, T, H. All are available (since F, I, H not eliminated).

But note: we are testing I, which is a vowel.

Another word: ""DAILY"" - but no T.

""GAWKY"" - no A or T.

""HASTY"" - S is eliminated.

So ""faith"" seems a candidate.

Option 4: T _ _ A _
For example, ""TODAY"" - O and D, but O is eliminated? O is marked x in guess 3 (ABOUT), so O is not in the word. So ""today"" invalid.

""TIDAL"" - T, I, D, A, L -> positions: T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5). So A in 4 (new) and T in 1 (new). Letters: T, I, D, A, L. All available? I, D, L are available.

""TIDAL"" is a valid word.

Option 5: _ _ T A _
For example, ""OPTAL"" - not a word.
""FATAL"" - F, A, T, A, L -> duplicate A? And positions: F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). But we have A in 2 and 4? We don't know if there are two A's. But we have only one A confirmed? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So it's possible, but we should avoid for now to not complicate.

""FATAL"" has A in 2 and 4, but we are testing A in 2 and 4? We know A is not in 1 or 3, but 2 and 4 are possible. But if we use ""fatal"", we are testing two positions for A at once. But we might get two minuses and not know if one is correct or both are wrong? Actually, if A is in the word only once, then one of the positions will be minus and the other might be minus if not correct, but if it's in one of them, we get one minus and one check? But we don't know.

But to avoid confusion, let's try to have only one A.

So ""FATAL"" is not ideal.

""LATTE"" - E eliminated.

""WATTY"" - duplicate T? and Y.

So option 5 might not be good.

Option 6: T _ _ _ A
For example, ""TABLA"" - B eliminated? B is out.
""TARGA"" - R eliminated.
""TANGA"" - N eliminated.
""TALKA"" - L, K, A -> T(1), A(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? and A in 2 and 5. But we are trying A in 5? But we have A in 2 as well? Not ideal.

""TIGZA"" - not a word.

Hard to find.

Option 7: _ _ T _ A
For example, ""CUTTA"" - C and U eliminated.
""BUTTA"" - B and U eliminated.
""MITTA"" - M eliminated? and not common.

Option 8: _ _ _ T A
For example, ""VISTA"" - S eliminated.
""FASTA"" - S eliminated? and A in 5? But we have A in 5? We haven't tried A in 5. But we need to fill the first three with new letters.

""DELTA"" - E and L? E eliminated.

""KAPUT"" - K, A, P, U, T -> P and U eliminated.

So not easy.

Therefore, the best candidates so far are:
- ""faith"" (from option 3: _ A _ T _ ) -> F, A, I, T, H
- ""tidal"" (from option 4: T _ _ A _ ) -> T, I, D, A, L

Both are valid and use available letters.

Now, which one to choose?

In ""faith"":
- A is in position 2 (new)
- T is in position 4 (new)
- Tests F, I, H

In ""tidal"":
- T is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 4 (new)
- Tests I, D, L

We need to test new letters. Both test I, which is a common vowel.

But ""faith"" tests F and H, while ""tidal"" tests D and L.

Both are reasonable.

We might also consider the frequency of letters. But let's see if we can cover more ground.

Another word: what about ""LATHE""? But E is eliminated.

Or ""WIDTH"" - no A.

I think either ""faith"" or ""tidal"" is fine.

But note: in ""tidal"", we are putting T in position 1, which we haven't tried. And A in position 4, which we haven't tried.

Similarly, in ""faith"", A in 2 and T in 4.

We have to choose one.

Let me think about the remaining possible positions.

We know A can be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,3,4.

In ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.

In ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.

If we choose ""faith"", and if A is not in 2 and T is not in 4, then we get minuses for both, and we know A must be in 4 or 5, and T must be in 1 or 3.

Similarly, if we choose ""tidal"", and if T is not in 1 and A is not in 4, then T must be in 3 or 4, and A must be in 2 or 5.

But position 4 is common for both, so it might be efficient to test position 4 for one of them.

In ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.

In ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.

So both test position 4 for one letter.

I think I'll go with ""faith"" because it tests the vowel I and two consonants F and H.

So guess: FAITH

But let's confirm the word: F-A-I-T-H.

Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:T, 5:H

We are testing:
- A in position 2 (new)
- T in position 4 (new)
- And new letters F, I, H

All letters are not eliminated.

So it should be a valid guess.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **Eliminated Letters**: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (tried in Guess 1 and 3 for position 3, and Guess 3 for position 1, all resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
  - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (tried in Guess 2 for position 2 and Guess 3 for position 5, both resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
- **Goal for Next Guess**: 
  - Test new positions for A and T (e.g., A in position 2 or 4, T in position 1 or 3).
  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool (available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.
  - Avoid duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

### Why ""FAITH"" is the Next Guess:
- **Tests New Positions**:
  - A is placed in **position 2** (a previously untested position for A).
  - T is placed in **position 4** (a previously untested position for T).
- **New Letters Tested**: 
  - F (position 1), I (position 3), and H (position 5). These are common, untested letters that could appear in the secret word.
- **Avoids Issues**:
  - No eliminated letters (F, I, T, A, H are all still possible).
  - No duplicate letters (minimizes ambiguity).
- **Information Gain**:
  - If A is in position 2, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.
  - If T is in position 4, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 1 or 3.
  - Feedback on F, I, and H will reveal if they are in the word and their positions (or rule them out).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and T while testing three new letters. If the secret word is not guessed, the feedback will significantly reduce the remaining possibilities.

<guess>faith</guess>",faith,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3, again)
- M: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ABOUT

- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 5)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains A and T, but we don't know their positions.
- A is not in positions 1, 3 (tried in 1 and 3, both gave '-')
- T is not in positions 2, 5 (tried in 2 and 5, both gave '-')
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P, B, O, U (all marked 'x' in at least one guess)

Therefore, the remaining possible positions for A are: 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
For T, the remaining possible positions are: 1, 3, or 4 (positions 2 and 5 are ruled out).

We have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the eliminated letters: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U
- Tries A in one of the new possible positions (2,4,5) and T in one of the new possible positions (1,3,4)
- Introduces new letters to test, from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (not eliminated and not yet tried): 
- Vowels: I (since A is already in, but we need to test I? But we don't know if I is in the word) and Y (sometimes vowel).
- Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y.

We need to choose a word that has A and T, and three new letters from the available set.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,3,4

Note: Position 4 is possible for both A and T, but they can't both be in position 4. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Let's try to find words that fit.

Option 1: Place A in position 2 and T in position 1? 
- Word pattern: T _ A _ _
But we need to fill the blanks with new letters.

Option 2: A in position 2 and T in position 3: _ A T _ _
Option 3: A in position 2 and T in position 4: _ A _ T _
Option 4: A in position 4 and T in position 1: T _ _ A _
Option 5: A in position 4 and T in position 3: _ _ T A _
Option 6: A in position 5 and T in position 1: T _ _ _ A
Option 7: A in position 5 and T in position 3: _ _ T _ A
Option 8: A in position 5 and T in position 4: _ _ _ T A

We also have to use only available letters.

Let's try to form words:

For example, option 2: _ A T _ _

So ""faith"" seems a candidate.

Option 4: T _ _ A _
For example, ""TODAY"" - O and D, but O is eliminated? O is marked x in guess 3 (ABOUT), so O is not in the word. So ""today"" invalid.

""TIDAL"" - T, I, D, A, L -> positions: T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5). So A in 4 (new) and T in 1 (new). Letters: T, I, D, A, L. All available? I, D, L are available.

""TIDAL"" is a valid word.

Option 5: _ _ T A _
For example, ""OPTAL"" - not a word.
""FATAL"" - F, A, T, A, L -> duplicate A? And positions: F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). But we have A in 2 and 4? We don't know if there are two A's. But we have only one A confirmed? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So it's possible, but we should avoid for now to not complicate.

Option 7: _ _ T _ A

""DELTA"" - E and L? E eliminated.

""KAPUT"" - K, A, P, U, T -> P and U eliminated.

So not easy.

Therefore, the best candidates so far are:
- ""faith"" (from option 3: _ A _ T _ ) -> F, A, I, T, H
- ""tidal"" (from option 4: T _ _ A _ ) -> T, I, D, A, L

Both are valid and use available letters.

Now, which one to choose?

In ""faith"":
- A is in position 2 (new)
- T is in position 4 (new)
- Tests F, I, H

In ""tidal"":
- T is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 4 (new)
- Tests I, D, L

We need to test new letters. Both test I, which is a common vowel.

But ""faith"" tests F and H, while ""tidal"" tests D and L.

Both are reasonable.

We might also consider the frequency of letters. But let's see if we can cover more ground.

Another word: what about ""LATHE""? But E is eliminated.

Or ""WIDTH"" - no A.

I think either ""faith"" or ""tidal"" is fine.

But note: in ""tidal"", we are putting T in position 1, which we haven't tried. And A in position 4, which we haven't tried.

Similarly, in ""faith"", A in 2 and T in 4.

We have to choose one.

Let me think about the remaining possible positions.

We know A can be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,3,4.

In ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.

In ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.

If we choose ""faith"", and if A is not in 2 and T is not in 4, then we get minuses for both, and we know A must be in 4 or 5, and T must be in 1 or 3.

Similarly, if we choose ""tidal"", and if T is not in 1 and A is not in 4, then T must be in 3 or 4, and A must be in 2 or 5.

But position 4 is common for both, so it might be efficient to test position 4 for one of them.

In ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.

In ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.

So both test position 4 for one letter.

I think I'll go with ""faith"" because it tests the vowel I and two consonants F and H.

So guess: FAITH

But let's confirm the word: F-A-I-T-H.

Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:T, 5:H

We are testing:
- A in position 2 (new)
- T in position 4 (new)
- And new letters F, I, H

All letters are not eliminated.

So it should be a valid guess.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **Eliminated Letters**: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (tried in Guess 1 and 3 for position 3, and Guess 3 for position 1, all resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
  - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (tried in Guess 2 for position 2 and Guess 3 for position 5, both resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
- **Goal for Next Guess**: 
  - Test new positions for A and T (e.g., A in position 2 or 4, T in position 1 or 3).
  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool (available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.
  - Avoid duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

### Why ""FAITH"" is the Next Guess:
- **Tests New Positions**:
  - A is placed in **position 2** (a previously untested position for A).
  - T is placed in **position 4** (a previously untested position for T).
- **New Letters Tested**: 
  - F (position 1), I (position 3), and H (position 5). These are common, untested letters that could appear in the secret word.
- **Avoids Issues**:
  - No eliminated letters (F, I, T, A, H are all still possible).
  - No duplicate letters (minimizes ambiguity).
- **Information Gain**:
  - If A is in position 2, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.
  - If T is in position 4, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 1 or 3.
  - Feedback on F, I, and H will reveal if they are in the word and their positions (or rule them out).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and T while testing three new letters. If the secret word is not guessed, the feedback will significantly reduce the remaining possibilities.",Guess 4: faith -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) I(-) T(-) H(x),FAIL

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are going to make our first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback to go on.
 The goal is to maximize the information we get about the letters in the word. 
 A common strategy is to choose a word that has a combination of common letters and that also covers multiple common vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, etc. because they have common letters.

 Let me choose a word that uses 5 common letters: 
 We want a word that has distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

 For example, ""CRANE"" has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 But note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

 So my first guess is: CRANEI'll start with a word that includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) which can reveal key information about the secret word based on the feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses left (since we used one).

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the word).
- Must contain the letter A, but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong). However, note that the feedback only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position (1,2,4,5). But we don't know which one.

We also want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to place A in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A and other common letters.

We can try to put A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in the first position or not. It could be.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a different position, say second or fourth.

Also, we want to cover more ground by including other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants.

One common strategy is to use a word that has as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some possibilities:

- We could try ""salad"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has S and L and D.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""stamp"": but it has S, T, A, M, P. However, note that we haven't tried S, T, M, P.

But wait: we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. So ""stamp"" is okay.

But let's see the feedback we might get: we can test S, T, A (again, but in a different position), M, P.

But we already know A is in the word, so we are using A to see if we can get its position.

However, we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: ""audio"" - but that has the vowels and we know E is out, but it has A, U, I, D, O. But note: we have 5 letters and we are testing 5 new letters. However, the word ""audio"" is valid.

But wait: we know that the secret word has an A, so we are including A. Also, we are testing U, I, D, O.

But the problem: we don't know if the word has any of these other vowels. And we are using a word that doesn't have many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and some common consonants.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E.

Common starting words after eliminating C,R,N,E: we might try ""sault"" or ""sandy"" but ""sandy"" has N and we know N is not in the word? Wait, no: we know N is not in the word because we got x for N in the first guess.

So we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, E.

So ""sandy"" is invalid because it has N and we know N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""stamp"" is okay because it has S, T, A, M, P and none of the forbidden letters.

But note: we have A in the second position in ""stamp"". We know A is in the word but not in the third position. It might be in the second? We don't know.

We can try ""stamp"".

Another option: ""laugh"" - has L, A, U, G, H. But we don't know if U is common? And we are testing two vowels (A and U) and three consonants.

But we want to maximize information.

Another common word: ""piano"" - but it has P, I, A, N, O. But wait, N is forbidden! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""piano"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""house"" has E and we know E is not in the word.

So we must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have A and other common letters without the forbidden ones.

Possible words:

- ""salad"": but has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it ends with D. But we can use it? But duplicate A might not be ideal for information.

- ""stamp"": S, T, A, M, P -> all new letters and no duplicates.

- ""blast"": but has B, L, A, S, T. But note: we haven't tried B, L, S, T. And A. But ""blast"" has A in the third position? We know A is not in the third position? No, we only know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third and it was wrong. But it could be in the third in the secret word? No, because if it were in the third, we would have gotten a check (✓) for A in the third. But we got a minus (-), meaning A is in the word but not in the third. So the secret word has A, but not in the third position. Therefore, in ""blast"", if we put A in the third, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for the next guess, we should put A in a position that we haven't tried and that is possible: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In ""stamp"", A is in position 2. That's a new position.

In ""blast"", if we use it, we have A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we would get a minus for A again, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

So let's avoid words that have A in the third position.

We can try:

- ""adapt"": but has A in first and fourth? And D, A, P, T. But note: it has two A's? Actually, ""adapt"" has A at position 1 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it has D, P, T. But we haven't tried these. However, we are repeating A? But we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the word at least once. But if we get two minuses, we don't know if there are two A's or one. So it might be confusing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with A in one new position and four new letters.

Let me list:

- Position 1: words like ""about"" -> but has O, U, B, T. But also, we know E is not in the word, so we avoid E. But ""about"" is valid? But it has A in first.

- ""table"": has E -> forbidden, so invalid.

- ""adult"": A in first, D, U, L, T.

- ""album"": A in first, L, B, U, M.

But we don't know if the word has U or not.

Another idea: ""pasta"" -> has A in second and fifth? And P, S, T. But we are testing two positions for A? And we know A is in the word, so we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don't know if there are two A's.

To avoid confusion, let's use a word with only one A and in a new position.

So:

- Position 1: ""adios"" -> but has O, S, D, I. But ""adios"" is 5 letters? A, D, I, O, S -> yes. And no forbidden letters.

- Position 2: ""stamp"" (as before) -> S, T, A, M, P.

- Position 4: ""delta"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

- Position 4: ""vocal"" -> has C and we know C is not in the word. Invalid.

- Position 4: ""focal"" -> again, has C.

- Position 4: ""modal"" -> M, O, D, A, L -> no forbidden letters. A in fourth position.

- Position 5: ""pizza"" -> has Z and two Z's? And A at the end. But we don't know about Z. Also, duplicate Z.

- Position 5: ""vodka"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> no forbidden letters.

But we want common letters.

I think ""stamp"" is a good candidate: common letters S, T, A, M, P.

Alternatively, ""adios"" is also good: tests A in first position and also the letters D, I, O, S.

But note: we are trying to find the word, and we have limited guesses. We want to get as much information as possible.

Since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, it's hard.

Another word: ""splat"" -> S, P, L, A, T. A in the fourth position. And we test S, P, L, T.

But ""splat"" is a valid word? Yes.

Now, comparing:

- ""stamp"": tests S, T, A (position 2), M, P.
- ""adios"": tests A (position 1), D, I, O, S.
- ""splat"": tests S, P, L, A (position 4), T.

We haven't tried any of these letters, so any of them would be good.

But note: we have to avoid the third position for A.

I think I'll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).

So my next guess: stamp

But let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""stamp"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include A (since it's confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).
- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.

This guess will help identify:
- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>stamp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3? Wait, in STAMP, A is in position 3? Let's check:
  STAMP: S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5)
  But in the feedback for STAMP, A is marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3? 
  However, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's not in position 3. 
  Now in STAMP, A is again in position 3 and again got '-'. This is consistent: A is in the word but not in position 3.

But also, we have:
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, M, P

Letters in the word but position unknown: A and T

We know A is in the word but not in position 3. We know T is in the word but not in position 2 (from STAMP feedback).

Also, we have no information about other letters.

We have used 2 guesses, so we have 4 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P
- Tries to place A and T in positions we haven't tried for them.

For A, we have tried position 3 (twice, but same position) and it was wrong. So A cannot be in position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

For T, we have tried position 2 (in STAMP) and it was wrong. So T cannot be in position 2. Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to include three new letters to test.

We should choose common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A and T, and three new letters, with A not in position 3 and T not in position 2.

Let's think of words that have A and T.

Possible words:

- With A and T, and avoiding the bad letters.

For example, ""TABLE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""TRAIN"" - R is bad, so no.

""PLANT"" - P, L, A, N, T -> but P and N are bad.

""LIGHT"" - no A.

""FIGHT"" - no A.

""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> this has A and T, and B, O, U are new. Also, positions: A in 1, T in 5. 
But we have to check if the positions are allowed: 
- A is in position 1: we haven't tried A in position 1 before, so that's good.
- T is in position 5: we haven't tried T in position 5, so that's okay.

Also, the word ""about"" is valid.

Another word: ""ADULT"" - A, D, U, L, T -> A in 1, T in 5. Also, D, U, L are new.

""ADOPT"" - but P is bad.

""ADULT"" is okay? But let's see: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 

But we have to avoid T in position 2? In ADULT, T is in position 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""TAKEN"" - N and E are bad.

""FAULT"" - F, A, U, L, T -> A in 2, T in 5. 
But A in position 2: we haven't tried A in position 2? In STAMP, A was in position 3, not 2. So position 2 for A is new.

Similarly, T in position 5 is new.

""FAULT"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the bad letters, and F, U, L are not in the bad list.

Another word: ""HAULT"" - not common, but ""halt"" is 4 letters. ""HAULT"" might not be a word. Better to use common words.

""FAULT"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""BALDY"" - B, A, L, D, Y -> but no T. We must include T because we know T is in the word.

We must include both A and T.

""TAXIS"" - but S is bad.

""LATIN"" - N is bad.

""DAILY"" - no T.

""OCTAL"" - C and O, but C is bad.

So let's consider ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"".

In ""ABOUT"": 
- A in position 1 (new position for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests B, O, U

In ""FAULT"":
- A in position 2 (new for A)
- T in position 5 (new for T)
- Tests F, U, L

We also have the possibility of placing A and T in other positions.

For example, A in position 4 and T in position 1? 

Word like ""TABOO"" - T, A, B, O, O -> but duplicate O? And A in position 2? Actually, T(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), O(5). But we have T in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new). But duplicate O might not be ideal.

""TALON"" - N is bad.

""VALID"" - no T.

""PATIO"" - P is bad.

""RADIO"" - R is bad.

So ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"" seem good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" - A, U, D, I, O -> but no T. We must include T.

""ADMIT"" - M and T, but M is bad.

""ADOPT"" - P bad.

So I think ""ABOUT"" or ""FAULT"" are good choices.

But let's see which one tests more common letters.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

In ""ABOUT"": B, O, U
In ""FAULT"": F, U, L

Both U is common. B and O are common, F and L are also common.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has A, and we haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

In ""ABOUT"", we test O and U, which are vowels.

In ""FAULT"", we test U and L (consonant).

But we also know that the word has at least two letters: A and T. So we need to find three more.

We have 5 positions to fill.

We might also consider that the word might have more common consonants.

But without more information, both are fine.

I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests three new common letters and places A and T in new positions.

So guess: ABOUT

But let's double-check the positions:

ABOUT: 
- A in position 1
- B in position 2
- O in position 3
- U in position 4
- T in position 5

We know:
- A cannot be in position 3 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 1.
- T cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 5.

So if we get:
- If A is in position 1, we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, we get a minus (-) and know A is not in position 1.
- Similarly for T in position 5.

Also, we get feedback on B, O, U.

This will help narrow down.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""about"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (STAMP)**: T is in the word but not in position 2. A is still not in position 3 (consistent with Guess 1). S, M, P are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, M, P (not in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (tried twice).
  - T cannot be in position 2.
- **Remaining possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A and T while introducing untested common letters (e.g., B, O, U, L, F, D) to maximize information.

### Why ""ABOUT"" is a strong guess:
- **Tests A in a new position (1)**: We haven't checked position 1 for A yet.
- **Tests T in a new position (5)**: We haven't checked position 5 for T yet.
- **Introduces new common letters**: B, O, U are high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
- **Word validity**: ""ABOUT"" is a common 5-letter word.

This guess will help:
- Confirm or rule out A in position 1 and T in position 5.
- Check if B, O, or U are in the word and their positions.
- Narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P, B, O, U (all marked 'x' in at least one guess)

Therefore, the remaining possible positions for A are: 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
For T, the remaining possible positions are: 1, 3, or 4 (positions 2 and 5 are ruled out).

We have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)
- Avoids the eliminated letters: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U
- Tries A in one of the new possible positions (2,4,5) and T in one of the new possible positions (1,3,4)
- Introduces new letters to test, from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (not eliminated and not yet tried): 
- Vowels: I (since A is already in, but we need to test I? But we don't know if I is in the word) and Y (sometimes vowel).
- Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y.

We need to choose a word that has A and T, and three new letters from the available set.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,3,4

Note: Position 4 is possible for both A and T, but they can't both be in position 4. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Let's try to find words that fit.

Option 1: Place A in position 2 and T in position 1? 
- Word pattern: T _ A _ _
But we need to fill the blanks with new letters.

Option 2: A in position 2 and T in position 3: _ A T _ _
Option 3: A in position 2 and T in position 4: _ A _ T _
Option 4: A in position 4 and T in position 1: T _ _ A _
Option 5: A in position 4 and T in position 3: _ _ T A _
Option 6: A in position 5 and T in position 1: T _ _ _ A
Option 7: A in position 5 and T in position 3: _ _ T _ A
Option 8: A in position 5 and T in position 4: _ _ _ T A

We also have to use only available letters.

Let's try to form words:

For example, option 2: _ A T _ _ 
We need a word with A in second and T in third. Possible words: 
- ""BATHE"" but B and E are eliminated.
- ""LATCH"" but C is eliminated.
- ""HATCH"" same issue.
- ""MATCH"" M and C eliminated.
- ""PATCH"" P and C eliminated.

With available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y, etc.

""LATHY"" - not a common word? L, A, T, H, Y -> but we have A in 2, T in 3: L-A-T-H-Y. Is ""lathy"" a word? It means something slender or flexible, but might be obscure.

""PATHY"" - not a word.

""BATTY"" - B eliminated.

""FATTY"" - F, A, T, T, Y -> but duplicate T? We don't know if T can be duplicated. But we have only one T confirmed so far? The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we must consider the possibility. But to be safe, avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""HATYL"" - not a word.

So option 2 might be hard.

Option 3: _ A _ T _
For example, ""FAITH"" - F, A, I, T, H -> but I and H are available. However, we haven't tried I. But ""faith"" has A in 2, T in 4? Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), T(4), H(5). So T is in 4, which is allowed? But we have T in position 4, and we haven't tried T in 4 before? Yes, we tried T in 2 and 5, not 4.

But we also have A in 2, which is a new position for A (we tried 1 and 3, not 2).

So ""faith"" is a valid word. Letters: F, A, I, T, H. All are available (since F, I, H not eliminated).

But note: we are testing I, which is a vowel.

Another word: ""DAILY"" - but no T.

""GAWKY"" - no A or T.

""HASTY"" - S is eliminated.

So ""faith"" seems a candidate.

Option 4: T _ _ A _
For example, ""TODAY"" - O and D, but O is eliminated? O is marked x in guess 3 (ABOUT), so O is not in the word. So ""today"" invalid.

""TIDAL"" - T, I, D, A, L -> positions: T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5). So A in 4 (new) and T in 1 (new). Letters: T, I, D, A, L. All available? I, D, L are available.

""TIDAL"" is a valid word.

Option 5: _ _ T A _
For example, ""OPTAL"" - not a word.
""FATAL"" - F, A, T, A, L -> duplicate A? And positions: F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). But we have A in 2 and 4? We don't know if there are two A's. But we have only one A confirmed? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So it's possible, but we should avoid for now to not complicate.

""FATAL"" has A in 2 and 4, but we are testing A in 2 and 4? We know A is not in 1 or 3, but 2 and 4 are possible. But if we use ""fatal"", we are testing two positions for A at once. But we might get two minuses and not know if one is correct or both are wrong? Actually, if A is in the word only once, then one of the positions will be minus and the other might be minus if not correct, but if it's in one of them, we get one minus and one check? But we don't know.

But to avoid confusion, let's try to have only one A.

So ""FATAL"" is not ideal.

""LATTE"" - E eliminated.

""WATTY"" - duplicate T? and Y.

So option 5 might not be good.

Option 6: T _ _ _ A
For example, ""TABLA"" - B eliminated? B is out.
""TARGA"" - R eliminated.
""TANGA"" - N eliminated.
""TALKA"" - L, K, A -> T(1), A(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? and A in 2 and 5. But we are trying A in 5? But we have A in 2 as well? Not ideal.

""TIGZA"" - not a word.

Hard to find.

Option 7: _ _ T _ A
For example, ""CUTTA"" - C and U eliminated.
""BUTTA"" - B and U eliminated.
""MITTA"" - M eliminated? and not common.

Option 8: _ _ _ T A
For example, ""VISTA"" - S eliminated.
""FASTA"" - S eliminated? and A in 5? But we have A in 5? We haven't tried A in 5. But we need to fill the first three with new letters.

""DELTA"" - E and L? E eliminated.

""KAPUT"" - K, A, P, U, T -> P and U eliminated.

So not easy.

Therefore, the best candidates so far are:
- ""faith"" (from option 3: _ A _ T _ ) -> F, A, I, T, H
- ""tidal"" (from option 4: T _ _ A _ ) -> T, I, D, A, L

Both are valid and use available letters.

Now, which one to choose?

In ""faith"":
- A is in position 2 (new)
- T is in position 4 (new)
- Tests F, I, H

In ""tidal"":
- T is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 4 (new)
- Tests I, D, L

We need to test new letters. Both test I, which is a common vowel.

But ""faith"" tests F and H, while ""tidal"" tests D and L.

Both are reasonable.

We might also consider the frequency of letters. But let's see if we can cover more ground.

Another word: what about ""LATHE""? But E is eliminated.

Or ""WIDTH"" - no A.

I think either ""faith"" or ""tidal"" is fine.

But note: in ""tidal"", we are putting T in position 1, which we haven't tried. And A in position 4, which we haven't tried.

Similarly, in ""faith"", A in 2 and T in 4.

We have to choose one.

Let me think about the remaining possible positions.

We know A can be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,3,4.

In ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.

In ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.

If we choose ""faith"", and if A is not in 2 and T is not in 4, then we get minuses for both, and we know A must be in 4 or 5, and T must be in 1 or 3.

Similarly, if we choose ""tidal"", and if T is not in 1 and A is not in 4, then T must be in 3 or 4, and A must be in 2 or 5.

But position 4 is common for both, so it might be efficient to test position 4 for one of them.

In ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.

In ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.

So both test position 4 for one letter.

I think I'll go with ""faith"" because it tests the vowel I and two consonants F and H.

So guess: FAITH

But let's confirm the word: F-A-I-T-H.

Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:T, 5:H

We are testing:
- A in position 2 (new)
- T in position 4 (new)
- And new letters F, I, H

All letters are not eliminated.

So it should be a valid guess.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **Eliminated Letters**: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (tried in Guess 1 and 3 for position 3, and Guess 3 for position 1, all resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
  - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (tried in Guess 2 for position 2 and Guess 3 for position 5, both resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
- **Goal for Next Guess**: 
  - Test new positions for A and T (e.g., A in position 2 or 4, T in position 1 or 3).
  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool (available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.
  - Avoid duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

### Why ""FAITH"" is the Next Guess:
- **Tests New Positions**:
  - A is placed in **position 2** (a previously untested position for A).
  - T is placed in **position 4** (a previously untested position for T).
- **New Letters Tested**: 
  - F (position 1), I (position 3), and H (position 5). These are common, untested letters that could appear in the secret word.
- **Avoids Issues**:
  - No eliminated letters (F, I, T, A, H are all still possible).
  - No duplicate letters (minimizes ambiguity).
- **Information Gain**:
  - If A is in position 2, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.
  - If T is in position 4, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 1 or 3.
  - Feedback on F, I, and H will reveal if they are in the word and their positions (or rule them out).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and T while testing three new letters. If the secret word is not guessed, the feedback will significantly reduce the remaining possibilities.

But note: we don\'t know if A is in the first position or not. It could be.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in a different position, say second or fourth.\n\nAlso, we want to cover more ground by including other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants.\n\nOne common strategy is to use a word that has as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n- We could try ""salad"", but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? Also, it has S and L and D.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, ""stamp"": but it has S, T, A, M, P. However, note that we haven\'t tried S, T, M, P.\n\nBut wait: we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. So ""stamp"" is okay.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get: we can test S, T, A (again, but in a different position), M, P.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so we are using A to see if we can get its position.\n\nHowever, we also want to test new letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""audio"" - but that has the vowels and we know E is out, but it has A, U, I, D, O. But note: we have 5 letters and we are testing 5 new letters. However, the word ""audio"" is valid.\n\nBut wait: we know that the secret word has an A, so we are including A. Also, we are testing U, I, D, O.\n\nBut the problem: we don\'t know if the word has any of these other vowels. And we are using a word that doesn\'t have many consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A and some common consonants.\n\nLet me think of words without C, R, N, E.\n\nCommon starting words after eliminating C,R,N,E: we might try ""sault"" or ""sandy"" but ""sandy"" has N and we know N is not in the word? Wait, no: we know N is not in the word because we got x for N in the first guess.\n\nSo we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, E.\n\nSo ""sandy"" is invalid because it has N and we know N is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""stamp"" is okay because it has S, T, A, M, P and none of the forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: we have A in the second position in ""stamp"". We know A is in the word but not in the third position. It might be in the second? We don\'t know.\n\nWe can try ""stamp"".\n\nAnother option: ""laugh"" - has L, A, U, G, H. But we don\'t know if U is common? And we are testing two vowels (A and U) and three consonants.\n\nBut we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother common word: ""piano"" - but it has P, I, A, N, O. But wait, N is forbidden! We cannot use N because we know it\'s not in the word. So ""piano"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""house"" has E and we know E is not in the word.\n\nSo we must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have A and other common letters without the forbidden ones.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""salad"": but has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, it ends with D. But we can use it? But duplicate A might not be ideal for information.\n\n- ""stamp"": S, T, A, M, P -> all new letters and no duplicates.\n\n- ""blast"": but has B, L, A, S, T. But note: we haven\'t tried B, L, S, T. And A. But ""blast"" has A in the third position? We know A is not in the third position? No, we only know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third and it was wrong. But it could be in the third in the secret word? No, because if it were in the third, we would have gotten a check (✓) for A in the third. But we got a minus (-), meaning A is in the word but not in the third. So the secret word has A, but not in the third position. Therefore, in ""blast"", if we put A in the third, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should put A in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is possible: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""stamp"", A is in position 2. That\'s a new position.\n\nIn ""blast"", if we use it, we have A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we would get a minus for A again, but we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid words that have A in the third position.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- ""adapt"": but has A in first and fourth? And D, A, P, T. But note: it has two A\'s? Actually, ""adapt"" has A at position 1 and 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, it has D, P, T. But we haven\'t tried these. However, we are repeating A? But we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the word at least once. But if we get two minuses, we don\'t know if there are two A\'s or one. So it might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word with A in one new position and four new letters.\n\nLet me list:\n\n- Position 1: words like ""about"" -> but has O, U, B, T. But also, we know E is not in the word, so we avoid E. But ""about"" is valid? But it has A in first.\n\n- ""table"": has E -> forbidden, so invalid.\n\n- ""adult"": A in first, D, U, L, T.\n\n- ""album"": A in first, L, B, U, M.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has U or not.\n\nAnother idea: ""pasta"" -> has A in second and fifth? And P, S, T. But we are testing two positions for A? And we know A is in the word, so we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s use a word with only one A and in a new position.\n\nSo:\n\n- Position 1: ""adios"" -> but has O, S, D, I. But ""adios"" is 5 letters? A, D, I, O, S -> yes. And no forbidden letters.\n\n- Position 2: ""stamp"" (as before) -> S, T, A, M, P.\n\n- Position 4: ""delta"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. So invalid.\n\n- Position 4: ""vocal"" -> has C and we know C is not in the word. Invalid.\n\n- Position 4: ""focal"" -> again, has C.\n\n- Position 4: ""modal"" -> M, O, D, A, L -> no forbidden letters. A in fourth position.\n\n- Position 5: ""pizza"" -> has Z and two Z\'s? And A at the end. But we don\'t know about Z. Also, duplicate Z.\n\n- Position 5: ""vodka"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> no forbidden letters.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nI think ""stamp"" is a good candidate: common letters S, T, A, M, P.\n\nAlternatively, ""adios"" is also good: tests A in first position and also the letters D, I, O, S.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the word, and we have limited guesses. We want to get as much information as possible.\n\nSince we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""splat"" -> S, P, L, A, T. A in the fourth position. And we test S, P, L, T.\n\nBut ""splat"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\n- ""stamp"": tests S, T, A (position 2), M, P.\n- ""adios"": tests A (position 1), D, I, O, S.\n- ""splat"": tests S, P, L, A (position 4), T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried any of these letters, so any of them would be good.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the third position for A.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""stamp"" because it has common consonants and A in a new position (position 2).\n\nSo my next guess: stamp\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""stamp"" is valid and 5 letters.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""stamp"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include A (since it\'s confirmed in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are not in the secret word.\n- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common letters (e.g., S, T, M, P) and place A in a new position (e.g., position 2).\n- ""stamp"" fits these criteria: it has A in the second position and introduces S, T, M, and P—all untested letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify:\n- If A is in the second position (✓) or if it\'s elsewhere (-).\n- Which of S, T, M, or P are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>stamp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: STAMP\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3?

The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that has A and T, and three new letters, with A not in position 3 and T not in position 2.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and T.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- With A and T, and avoiding the bad letters.\n\nFor example, ""TABLE"" - but E is bad, so no.\n\n""TRAIN"" - R is bad, so no.\n\n""PLANT"" - P, L, A, N, T -> but P and N are bad.\n\n""LIGHT"" - no A.\n\n""FIGHT"" - no A.\n\n""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> this has A and T, and B, O, U are new. Also, positions: A in 1, T in 5. \nBut we have to check if the positions are allowed: \n- A is in position 1: we haven\'t tried A in position 1 before, so that\'s good.\n- T is in position 5: we haven\'t tried T in position 5, so that\'s okay.\n\nAlso, the word ""about"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ADULT"" - A, D, U, L, T -> A in 1, T in 5. Also, D, U, L are new.\n\n""ADOPT"" - but P is bad.\n\n""ADULT"" is okay? But let\'s see: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). \n\nBut we have to avoid T in position 2? In ADULT, T is in position 5, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""TAKEN"" - N and E are bad.\n\n""FAULT"" - F, A, U, L, T -> A in 2, T in 5. \nBut A in position 2: we haven\'t tried A in position 2? In STAMP, A was in position 3, not 2. So position 2 for A is new.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 5 is new.\n\n""FAULT"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the bad letters, and F, U, L are not in the bad list.\n\nAnother word: ""HAULT"" - not common, but ""halt"" is 4 letters. ""HAULT"" might not be a word. Better to use common words.\n\n""FAULT"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""BALDY"" - B, A, L, D, Y -> but no T. We must include T because we know T is in the word.\n\nWe must include both A and T.\n\n""TAXIS"" - but S is bad.\n\n""LATIN"" - N is bad.\n\n""DAILY"" - no T.\n\n""OCTAL"" - C and O, but C is bad.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"".\n\nIn ""ABOUT"": \n- A in position 1 (new position for A)\n- T in position 5 (new for T)\n- Tests B, O, U\n\nIn ""FAULT"":\n- A in position 2 (new for A)\n- T in position 5 (new for T)\n- Tests F, U, L\n\nWe also have the possibility of placing A and T in other positions.\n\nFor example, A in position 4 and T in position 1? \n\nWord like ""TABOO"" - T, A, B, O, O -> but duplicate O? And A in position 2? Actually, T(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), O(5). But we have T in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new). But duplicate O might not be ideal.\n\n""TALON"" - N is bad.\n\n""VALID"" - no T.\n\n""PATIO"" - P is bad.\n\n""RADIO"" - R is bad.\n\nSo ""ABOUT"" and ""FAULT"" seem good.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" - A, U, D, I, O -> but no T. We must include T.\n\n""ADMIT"" - M and T, but M is bad.\n\n""ADOPT"" - P bad.\n\nSo I think ""ABOUT"" or ""FAULT"" are good choices.\n\nBut let\'s see which one tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.\n\nIn ""ABOUT"": B, O, U\nIn ""FAULT"": F, U, L\n\nBoth U is common. B and O are common, F and L are also common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has A, and we haven\'t tested O, U, I, etc.\n\nIn ""ABOUT"", we test O and U, which are vowels.\n\nIn ""FAULT"", we test U and L (consonant).\n\nBut we also know that the word has at least two letters: A and T. So we need to find three more.\n\nWe have 5 positions to fill.\n\nWe might also consider that the word might have more common consonants.\n\nBut without more information, both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests three new common letters and places A and T in new positions.\n\nSo guess: ABOUT\n\nBut let\'s double-check the positions:\n\nABOUT: \n- A in position 1\n- B in position 2\n- O in position 3\n- U in position 4\n- T in position 5\n\nWe know:\n- A cannot be in position 3 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 1.\n- T cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) and now we are trying position 5.\n\nSo if we get:\n- If A is in position 1, we get a check (✓) for A.\n- If not, we get a minus (-) and know A is not in position 1.\n- Similarly for T in position 5.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on B, O, U.\n\nThis will help narrow down.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""about"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (STAMP)**: T is in the word but not in position 2. A is still not in position 3 (consistent with Guess 1). S, M, P are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, M, P (not in the word).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - A cannot be in position 3 (tried twice).\n  - T cannot be in position 2.\n- **Remaining possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A and T while introducing untested common letters (e.g., B, O, U, L, F, D) to maximize information.\n\n### Why ""ABOUT"" is a strong guess:\n- **Tests A in a new position (1)**: We haven\'t checked position 1 for A yet.\n- **Tests T in a new position (5)**: We haven\'t checked position 5 for T yet.\n- **Introduces new common letters**: B, O, U are high-frequency letters not yet tested.\n- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No C, R, N, E, S, M, P.\n- **Word validity**: ""ABOUT"" is a common 5-letter word.\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm or rule out A in position 1 and T in position 5.\n- Check if B, O, or U are in the word and their positions.\n- Narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: STAMP\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3, again)\n- M: x (not in word)\n- P: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ABOUT\n- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 1)\n- B: x (not in word)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- U: x (not in word)\n- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 5)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains A and T, but we don\'t know their positions.\n- A is not in positions 1, 3 (tried in 1 and 3, both gave \'-\')\n- T is not in positions 2, 5 (tried in 2 and 5, both gave \'-\')\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P, B, O, U (all marked \'x\' in at least one guess)\n\nTherefore, the remaining possible positions for A are: 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).\nFor T, the remaining possible positions are: 1, 3, or 4 (positions 2 and 5 are ruled out).\n\nWe have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Includes A and T (since they are in the word)\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U\n- Tries A in one of the new possible positions (2,4,5) and T in one of the new possible positions (1,3,4)\n- Introduces new letters to test, from the remaining available letters.\n\nAvailable letters (not eliminated and not yet tried): \n- Vowels: I (since A is already in, but we need to test I?

Possible words: \n- ""BATHE"" but B and E are eliminated.\n- ""LATCH"" but C is eliminated.\n- ""HATCH"" same issue.\n- ""MATCH"" M and C eliminated.\n- ""PATCH"" P and C eliminated.\n\nWith available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n""LATHY"" - not a common word? L, A, T, H, Y -> but we have A in 2, T in 3: L-A-T-H-Y. Is ""lathy"" a word? It means something slender or flexible, but might be obscure.\n\n""PATHY"" - not a word.\n\n""BATTY"" - B eliminated.\n\n""FATTY"" - F, A, T, T, Y -> but duplicate T? We don\'t know if T can be duplicated. But we have only one T confirmed so far? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we must consider the possibility. But to be safe, avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""HATYL"" - not a word.\n\nSo option 2 might be hard.\n\nOption 3: _ A _ T _\nFor example, ""FAITH"" - F, A, I, T, H -> but I and H are available. However, we haven\'t tried I. But ""faith"" has A in 2, T in 4? Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), T(4), H(5). So T is in 4, which is allowed? But we have T in position 4, and we haven\'t tried T in 4 before? Yes, we tried T in 2 and 5, not 4.\n\nBut we also have A in 2, which is a new position for A (we tried 1 and 3, not 2).\n\nSo ""faith"" is a valid word. Letters: F, A, I, T, H. All are available (since F, I, H not eliminated).\n\nBut note: we are testing I, which is a vowel.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY"" - but no T.\n\n""GAWKY"" - no A or T.\n\n""HASTY"" - S is eliminated.\n\nSo ""faith"" seems a candidate.\n\nOption 4: T _ _ A _\nFor example, ""TODAY"" - O and D, but O is eliminated? O is marked x in guess 3 (ABOUT), so O is not in the word. So ""today"" invalid.\n\n""TIDAL"" - T, I, D, A, L -> positions: T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5). So A in 4 (new) and T in 1 (new). Letters: T, I, D, A, L. All available? I, D, L are available.\n\n""TIDAL"" is a valid word.\n\nOption 5: _ _ T A _\nFor example, ""OPTAL"" - not a word.\n""FATAL"" - F, A, T, A, L -> duplicate A? And positions: F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). But we have A in 2 and 4? We don\'t know if there are two A\'s. But we have only one A confirmed? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. So it\'s possible, but we should avoid for now to not complicate.\n\n""FATAL"" has A in 2 and 4, but we are testing A in 2 and 4? We know A is not in 1 or 3, but 2 and 4 are possible. But if we use ""fatal"", we are testing two positions for A at once. But we might get two minuses and not know if one is correct or both are wrong? Actually, if A is in the word only once, then one of the positions will be minus and the other might be minus if not correct, but if it\'s in one of them, we get one minus and one check? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let\'s try to have only one A.\n\nSo ""FATAL"" is not ideal.\n\n""LATTE"" - E eliminated.\n\n""WATTY"" - duplicate T? and Y.\n\nSo option 5 might not be good.\n\nOption 6: T _ _ _ A\nFor example, ""TABLA"" - B eliminated? B is out.\n""TARGA"" - R eliminated.\n""TANGA"" - N eliminated.\n""TALKA"" - L, K, A -> T(1), A(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? and A in 2 and 5. But we are trying A in 5? But we have A in 2 as well? Not ideal.\n\n""TIGZA"" - not a word.\n\nHard to find.\n\nOption 7: _ _ T _ A\nFor example, ""CUTTA"" - C and U eliminated.\n""BUTTA"" - B and U eliminated.\n""MITTA"" - M eliminated? and not common.\n\nOption 8: _ _ _ T A\nFor example, ""VISTA"" - S eliminated.\n""FASTA"" - S eliminated? and A in 5? But we have A in 5? We haven\'t tried A in 5. But we need to fill the first three with new letters.\n\n""DELTA"" - E and L? E eliminated.\n\n""KAPUT"" - K, A, P, U, T -> P and U eliminated.\n\nSo not easy.\n\nTherefore, the best candidates so far are:\n- ""faith"" (from option 3: _ A _ T _ ) -> F, A, I, T, H\n- ""tidal"" (from option 4: T _ _ A _ ) -> T, I, D, A, L\n\nBoth are valid and use available letters.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nIn ""faith"":\n- A is in position 2 (new)\n- T is in position 4 (new)\n- Tests F, I, H\n\nIn ""tidal"":\n- T is in position 1 (new)\n- A is in position 4 (new)\n- Tests I, D, L\n\nWe need to test new letters. Both test I, which is a common vowel.\n\nBut ""faith"" tests F and H, while ""tidal"" tests D and L.\n\nBoth are reasonable.\n\nWe might also consider the frequency of letters. But let\'s see if we can cover more ground.\n\nAnother word: what about ""LATHE""? But E is eliminated.\n\nOr ""WIDTH"" - no A.\n\nI think either ""faith"" or ""tidal"" is fine.\n\nBut note: in ""tidal"", we are putting T in position 1, which we haven\'t tried. And A in position 4, which we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, in ""faith"", A in 2 and T in 4.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nLet me think about the remaining possible positions.\n\nWe know A can be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,3,4.\n\nIn ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.\n\nIn ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.\n\nIf we choose ""faith"", and if A is not in 2 and T is not in 4, then we get minuses for both, and we know A must be in 4 or 5, and T must be in 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""tidal"", and if T is not in 1 and A is not in 4, then T must be in 3 or 4, and A must be in 2 or 5.\n\nBut position 4 is common for both, so it might be efficient to test position 4 for one of them.\n\nIn ""faith"", we test A in 2 and T in 4.\n\nIn ""tidal"", we test T in 1 and A in 4.\n\nSo both test position 4 for one letter.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""faith"" because it tests the vowel I and two consonants F and H.\n\nSo guess: FAITH\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: F-A-I-T-H.\n\nPositions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:T, 5:H\n\nWe are testing:\n- A in position 2 (new)\n- T in position 4 (new)\n- And new letters F, I, H\n\nAll letters are not eliminated.\n\nSo it should be a valid guess.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Eliminated Letters**: B, C, E, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n- **Position Constraints**:\n  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (tried in Guess 1 and 3 for position 3, and Guess 3 for position 1, all resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.\n  - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (tried in Guess 2 for position 2 and Guess 3 for position 5, both resulted in ""-""). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Goal for Next Guess**: \n  - Test new positions for A and T (e.g., A in position 2 or 4, T in position 1 or 3).\n  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool (available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.\n  - Avoid duplicate letters and eliminated letters.\n\n### Why ""FAITH"" is the Next Guess:\n- **Tests New Positions**:\n  - A is placed in **position 2** (a previously untested position for A).\n  - T is placed in **position 4** (a previously untested position for T).\n- **New Letters Tested**: \n  - F (position 1), I (position 3), and H (position 5). These are common, untested letters that could appear in the secret word.\n- **Avoids Issues**:\n  - No eliminated letters (F, I, T, A, H are all still possible).\n  - No duplicate letters (minimizes ambiguity).\n- **Information Gain**:\n  - If A is in position 2, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.\n  - If T is in position 4, it will get ""✓""; if not, ""-"" will confirm it must be in 1 or 3.\n  - Feedback on F, I, and H will reveal if they are in the word and their positions (or rule them out).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and T while testing three new letters. If the secret word is not guessed, the feedback will significantly reduce the remaining possibilities.\n\n<guess>faith</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: faith -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) I(-) T(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3 again)
- M: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ABOUT
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 1)
- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 4: FAITH
- F: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)
- I: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

So, we know:

Confirmed letters in the word: A, T, and now I (from guess 4, I is marked as '-', so it is in the word but not in position 3).

Eliminated letters: B, C, E, F, H, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).

Also, we have position constraints:

For A:
- Not in position 1 (tried in ABOUT)
- Not in position 2 (tried in FAITH)
- Not in position 3 (tried in CRANE and STAMP)
- So A must be in position 4 or 5.

For T:
- Not in position 2 (tried in STAMP)
- Not in position 4 (tried in FAITH)
- Not in position 5 (tried in ABOUT)
- So T must be in position 1 or 3.

For I:
- Not in position 3 (tried in FAITH)
- Since we don't know other positions, I can be in 1,2,4,5? But we have to consider the positions for A and T.

Also, we have three confirmed letters: A, T, I.

The word has 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.

We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 left.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Contains A, T, I
- A must be in position 4 or 5
- T must be in position 1 or 3
- I must not be in position 3 (but since T might be in 3, I can be elsewhere)
- Avoids eliminated letters: B,C,E,F,H,M,N,O,P,R,S,U

Available letters: D, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we might have more, but we need common ones).

We also need to assign the positions.

Let's list possible positions:

Position 1: T (since T must be in 1 or 3)
Position 2: ? (cannot be A, T, or I? but we don't know, it could be I or a new letter)
Position 3: T (if not in 1) or a new letter? But if T is in 3, then position 3 is taken.
Position 4: A (if not in 5) or a new letter
Position 5: A (if not in 4) or a new letter

But we have to place A, T, I.

Case 1: T in position 1.
Then, position 3 is free for a new letter? But T is only in 1 or 3, so if T is in 1, then position 3 is not T.
Then, we have to place I and A.

A must be in 4 or 5.
I must be placed, and not in 3. So I can be in 2,4,5? But if A is in 4, then I cannot be in 4? So I must be in 2 or 5? Or if A is in 5, then I in 2 or 4.

But we also have position 3 to fill with a new letter.

Similarly, position 2 and the remaining position for A/I.

Case 2: T in position 3.
Then, position 1 is free for a new letter? But T is in 3, so position 1 is not T.
Then, A must be in 4 or 5.
I must not be in 3 (but 3 is taken by T, so that's fine), so I can be in 1,2,4,5? But we have to assign.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits.

First, let's try to form words with T in position 1.

Pattern: T _ _ A _  or T _ _ _ A

But we also have to place I.

If pattern T _ _ A _, then A is in 4. Then I must be in 2 or 5? But position 5 is free? The pattern is T(1), ?, ?, A(4), ?

So position 2,3,5 are free. I can be in 2,3, or 5? But I cannot be in 3? From feedback, I is not in position 3. So I can be in 2 or 5.

Similarly, if pattern T _ _ _ A, then A is in 5. Then I can be in 2 or 4? (since not 3).

Now, let's try to find words:

For T _ _ A _ (A in 4) and I in 2 or 5.

- If I in 2: T I ? A ? 
  We need to fill position 3 and 5 with new letters (not eliminated). 
  Example: T I D A L -> ""TIDAL"" but we already considered? But in previous, we didn't use it. But now, we have I in 2? But in this pattern, I is in 2. 
  ""TIDAL"" has T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5). 
  But we have to check if D and L are available? Yes, not eliminated. 
  But note: in guess 4, we have I marked as in the word but not in position 3. Here I is in 2, which is allowed. 
  Also, A is in 4, which is allowed. T in 1, allowed.

  But is ""tidal"" a valid word? Yes.

- If I in 5: T ? ? A I -> T(1), ?, ?, A(4), I(5). 
  We need to fill position 2 and 3. 
  Example: T O D A I -> but O is eliminated. 
  T A D A I -> duplicate A? and A in 2? But A must be in 4 or 5, not 2. 
  T W I A I -> duplicate I? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 
  T R A A I -> R eliminated. 
  T L A A I -> duplicate A. 
  Hard to find: T G Y A I -> ""Tgya i"" not a word. 
  So probably not common.

Now, for pattern T _ _ _ A (A in 5) and I in 2 or 4.

- If I in 2: T I ? ? A -> T(1), I(2), ?, ?, A(5). 
  Example: T I D O A -> O eliminated. 
  T I M E A -> E and M eliminated. 
  T I L L A -> duplicate L? and L is available. ""TILLA"" is not common? ""TILLA"" might not be a word. 
  ""TIGZA"" not a word. 
  So hard.

- If I in 4: T ? ? I A -> T(1), ?, ?, I(4), A(5). 
  Example: T O D I A -> O eliminated. 
  T A D I A -> duplicate A? and A in 2? But A must be in 4 or 5, not 2. 
  T W I I A -> duplicate I? 
  T U P I A -> U and P eliminated. 
  Not easy.

Now, case 2: T in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ T A _ or _ _ T _ A

And A in 4 or 5? But in the pattern, if T in 3, then for A: if in 4, then pattern _ _ T A _; if in 5, then _ _ T _ A.

Now, place I: cannot be in 3 (taken by T), so I in 1,2,4,5? But we have to assign.

First, pattern _ _ T A _ (A in 4)
Then I can be in 1,2, or 5? (since 3 and 4 taken by T and A).

- If I in 1: I ? T A ? 
  Example: I D T A L -> ""IDTAL"" not a word. 
  I L T A K -> ""ILTAK"" not a word. 
  Hard.

- If I in 2: ? I T A ? 
  Example: D I T A L -> ""DITAL"" not common. 
  L I T A Y -> ""LITAY"" not a word. 
  G I T A ? 

- If I in 5: ? ? T A I 
  Example: D A T A I -> duplicate A? and A in 2? But A must be in 4 or 5, not 2. 
  Here A is in 4, so position 2 is not A. 
  So: ? ? T A I 
  We need two letters for position 1 and 2. 
  Example: D O T A I -> O eliminated. 
  D G T A I -> ""DGT AI"" not a word. 
  W H T A I -> H eliminated. 
  Not easy.

Now, pattern _ _ T _ A (A in 5)
Then I can be in 1,2, or 4? (since 3 and 5 taken by T and A).

- If I in 1: I ? T ? A 
  Example: I D T H A -> H eliminated. 
  I D T L A -> ""IDTLA"" not a word. 
  I L T Y A -> ""ILTYA"" not a word.

- If I in 2: ? I T ? A 
  Example: D I T E A -> E eliminated. 
  D I T L A -> ""DITLA"" not a word. 
  G I T A A -> duplicate A? 
  Not good.

- If I in 4: ? ? T I A 
  Example: D A T I A -> duplicate A? 
  D O T I A -> O eliminated. 
  W H T I A -> H eliminated. 
  L A T I A -> duplicate A? 
  But we can try: ""LATIA"" not common? 
  ""KATIA"" is a name? But let's stick to common words.

From above, the only reasonable word we found is ""TIDAL"" for the case T in 1 and A in 4 and I in 2.

In ""TIDAL"":
- T in position 1 (allowed, since T can be in 1)
- I in position 2 (allowed, I not in 3, and we haven't tried I in 2)
- A in position 4 (allowed, A must be in 4 or 5)
- D and L are new letters.

But we have to check if I can be in position 2? Yes, because the feedback only said I is not in position 3, so it can be in 2.

Also, in ""TIDAL"", we have:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

Now, we need to confirm that D and L are not eliminated. Yes, they are still available.

So ""tidal"" is a valid guess.

But note: we already guessed ""about"" and ""faith"", but not ""tidal"".

So let's go with ""tidal"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 4 (FAITH), we have I marked as in the word but not in position 3. In ""tidal"", I is in position 2, which is fine.

Also, T in 1 and A in 4 are new positions.

We are testing D and L.

So this seems a good guess.

Alternatively, we might have other words.

What about if T is in 3 and A in 5? And I in 1 or 2.

For example, pattern: _ I T _ A 
But we need to fill position 1 and 4.

With available letters: D, G, K, L, V, W, Y, etc.

Example: D I T L A -> ""DITLA"" not a word.

L I T D A -> ""LITDA"" not a word.

Not common.

Pattern: I _ T _ A 
Example: I D T L A -> not a word.

So I think ""tidal"" is the best option.

Therefore, we guess ""tidal"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: A, T, and I are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **Eliminated Letters**: B, C, E, F, H, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (tried in Guesses 1–4). **Must be in position 4 or 5**.
  - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (tried in Guesses 2–4). **Must be in position 1 or 3**.
  - **I**: Cannot be in position 3 (tried in Guess 4). Must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Goal for Next Guess**: 
  - Place A in position 4 or 5, T in position 1 or 3, and I in a valid position (not 3).
  - Introduce new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool (available letters: D, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
  - Avoid duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

### Why ""TIDAL"" is the Next Guess:
- **Tests Critical Positions**:
  - T in **position 1** (a possible position for T, untested so far).
  - I in **position 2** (a valid position for I, not yet tested).
  - A in **position 4** (a possible position for A, untested so far).
- **New Letters Tested**: 
  - D (position 3) and L (position 5). These are common, untested consonants.
- **Information Gain**:
  - Confirms or rules out T in position 1 and A in position 4.
  - Tests I in position 2 (if incorrect, I must be in position 4 or 5).
  - Feedback on D and L will reveal if they are in the word and their positions (or rule them out).
- **Word Validity**: ""TIDAL"" is a common 5-letter word (meaning ""relating to tides"").

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A, T, and I while testing two new letters. If the secret word is not guessed, the feedback will leave very few possibilities for the final guess.

<guess>tidal</guess>",tidal,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3 again)
- M: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ABOUT
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 1)
- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 4: FAITH
- F: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 2)
- I: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- T: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

So, we know:

Confirmed letters in the word: A, T, and now I (from guess 4, I is marked as '-', so it is in the word but not in position 3).

Eliminated letters: B, C, E, F, H, M, N, O, P, R, S, U (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).

Also, we have position constraints:

For A:
- Not in position 1 (tried in ABOUT)
- Not in position 2 (tried in FAITH)
- Not in position 3 (tried in CRANE and STAMP)
- So A must be in position 4 or 5.

For T:
- Not in position 2 (tried in STAMP)
- Not in position 4 (tried in FAITH)
- Not in position 5 (tried in ABOUT)
- So T must be in position 1 or 3.

For I:
- Not in position 3 (tried in FAITH)
- Since we don't know other positions, I can be in 1,2,4,5? But we have to consider the positions for A and T.

Also, we have three confirmed letters: A, T, I.

The word has 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.

We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 left.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Contains A, T, I
- A must be in position 4 or 5
- T must be in position 1 or 3
- I must not be in position 3 (but since T might be in 3, I can be elsewhere)
- Avoids eliminated letters: B,C,E,F,H,M,N,O,P,R,S,U

Available letters: D, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we might have more, but we need common ones).

We also need to assign the positions.

Let's list possible positions:

Position 1: T (since T must be in 1 or 3)
Position 2: ? (cannot be A, T, or I? but we don't know, it could be I or a new letter)
Position 3: T (if not in 1) or a new letter? But if T is in 3, then position 3 is taken.
Position 4: A (if not in 5) or a new letter
Position 5: A (if not in 4) or a new letter

But we have to place A, T, I.

Case 1: T in position 1.
Then, position 3 is free for a new letter? But T is only in 1 or 3, so if T is in 1, then position 3 is not T.
Then, we have to place I and A.

A must be in 4 or 5.
I must be placed, and not in 3. So I can be in 2,4,5? But if A is in 4, then I cannot be in 4? So I must be in 2 or 5? Or if A is in 5, then I in 2 or 4.

But we also have position 3 to fill with a new letter.

Similarly, position 2 and the remaining position for A/I.

Case 2: T in position 3.
Then, position 1 is free for a new letter? But T is in 3, so position 1 is not T.
Then, A must be in 4 or 5.
I must not be in 3 (but 3 is taken by T, so that's fine), so I can be in 1,2,4,5? But we have to assign.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits.

First, let's try to form words with T in position 1.

Pattern: T _ _ A _  or T _ _ _ A

But we also have to place I.

If pattern T _ _ A _, then A is in 4. Then I must be in 2 or 5? But position 5 is free? The pattern is T(1), ?, ?, A(4), ?

So position 2,3,5 are free. I can be in 2,3, or 5? But I cannot be in 3? From feedback, I is not in position 3. So I can be in 2 or 5.

Similarly, if pattern T _ _ _ A, then A is in 5. Then I can be in 2 or 4? (since not 3).

Now, let's try to find words:

For T _ _ A _ (A in 4) and I in 2 or 5.

- If I in 2: T I ? A ? 
  We need to fill position 3 and 5 with new letters (not eliminated). 
  Example: T I D A L -> ""TIDAL"" but we already considered? But in previous, we didn't use it. But now, we have I in 2? But in this pattern, I is in 2. 
  ""TIDAL"" has T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5). 
  But we have to check if D and L are available? Yes, not eliminated. 
  But note: in guess 4, we have I marked as in the word but not in position 3. Here I is in 2, which is allowed. 
  Also, A is in 4, which is allowed. T in 1, allowed.

  But is ""tidal"" a valid word? Yes.

- If I in 5: T ? ? A I -> T(1), ?, ?, A(4), I(5). 
  We need to fill position 2 and 3. 
  Example: T O D A I -> but O is eliminated. 
  T A D A I -> duplicate A? and A in 2? But A must be in 4 or 5, not 2. 
  T W I A I -> duplicate I? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 
  T R A A I -> R eliminated. 
  T L A A I -> duplicate A. 
  Hard to find: T G Y A I -> ""Tgya i"" not a word. 
  So probably not common.

Now, for pattern T _ _ _ A (A in 5) and I in 2 or 4.

- If I in 2: T I ? ? A -> T(1), I(2), ?, ?, A(5). 
  Example: T I D O A -> O eliminated. 
  T I M E A -> E and M eliminated. 
  T I L L A -> duplicate L? and L is available. ""TILLA"" is not common? ""TILLA"" might not be a word. 
  ""TIGZA"" not a word. 
  So hard.

- If I in 4: T ? ? I A -> T(1), ?, ?, I(4), A(5). 
  Example: T O D I A -> O eliminated. 
  T A D I A -> duplicate A? and A in 2? But A must be in 4 or 5, not 2. 
  T W I I A -> duplicate I? 
  T U P I A -> U and P eliminated. 
  Not easy.

Now, case 2: T in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ T A _ or _ _ T _ A

And A in 4 or 5? But in the pattern, if T in 3, then for A: if in 4, then pattern _ _ T A _; if in 5, then _ _ T _ A.

Now, place I: cannot be in 3 (taken by T), so I in 1,2,4,5? But we have to assign.

First, pattern _ _ T A _ (A in 4)
Then I can be in 1,2, or 5? (since 3 and 4 taken by T and A).

- If I in 1: I ? T A ? 
  Example: I D T A L -> ""IDTAL"" not a word. 
  I L T A K -> ""ILTAK"" not a word. 
  Hard.

- If I in 2: ? I T A ? 
  Example: D I T A L -> ""DITAL"" not common. 
  L I T A Y -> ""LITAY"" not a word. 
  G I T A ? 

- If I in 5: ? ? T A I 
  Example: D A T A I -> duplicate A? and A in 2? But A must be in 4 or 5, not 2. 
  Here A is in 4, so position 2 is not A. 
  So: ? ? T A I 
  We need two letters for position 1 and 2. 
  Example: D O T A I -> O eliminated. 
  D G T A I -> ""DGT AI"" not a word. 
  W H T A I -> H eliminated. 
  Not easy.

Now, pattern _ _ T _ A (A in 5)
Then I can be in 1,2, or 4? (since 3 and 5 taken by T and A).

- If I in 1: I ? T ? A 
  Example: I D T H A -> H eliminated. 
  I D T L A -> ""IDTLA"" not a word. 
  I L T Y A -> ""ILTYA"" not a word.

- If I in 2: ? I T ? A 
  Example: D I T E A -> E eliminated. 
  D I T L A -> ""DITLA"" not a word. 
  G I T A A -> duplicate A? 
  Not good.

- If I in 4: ? ? T I A 
  Example: D A T I A -> duplicate A? 
  D O T I A -> O eliminated. 
  W H T I A -> H eliminated. 
  L A T I A -> duplicate A? 
  But we can try: ""LATIA"" not common? 
  ""KATIA"" is a name? But let's stick to common words.

From above, the only reasonable word we found is ""TIDAL"" for the case T in 1 and A in 4 and I in 2.

In ""TIDAL"":
- T in position 1 (allowed, since T can be in 1)
- I in position 2 (allowed, I not in 3, and we haven't tried I in 2)
- A in position 4 (allowed, A must be in 4 or 5)
- D and L are new letters.

But we have to check if I can be in position 2? Yes, because the feedback only said I is not in position 3, so it can be in 2.

Also, in ""TIDAL"", we have:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

Now, we need to confirm that D and L are not eliminated. Yes, they are still available.

So ""tidal"" is a valid guess.

But note: we already guessed ""about"" and ""faith"", but not ""tidal"".

So let's go with ""tidal"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 4 (FAITH), we have I marked as in the word but not in position 3. In ""tidal"", I is in position 2, which is fine.

Also, T in 1 and A in 4 are new positions.

We are testing D and L.

So this seems a good guess.

But we need to fill position 1 and 4.

Example: D I T L A -> ""DITLA"" not a word.

L I T D A -> ""LITDA"" not a word.

Not common.

Pattern: I _ T _ A 
Example: I D T L A -> not a word.

So I think ""tidal"" is the best option.

Therefore, we guess ""tidal"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
