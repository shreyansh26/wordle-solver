We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Now we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Important constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Must not contain C, A, or N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word).
 4. The letter R cannot be in the second position, and E cannot be in the fifth position.

 We can try to use another word that has R and E, plus three other letters that we haven't eliminated.

 Since the word has R and E, and we have to avoid C, A, N, and also the positions we know are wrong.

 We should also aim to test other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Let's recall that the remaining vowels are: O, I, U (since A and E are already considered, but E is in the word and A is not).
 But note: A is not in the word, so we avoid A.

 Common consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 Since E is in the word and we know it's not at the end, we can try putting E in a different position.

 We know R is in the word but not in the second position, so R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Our goal is to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.

 Let's brainstorm words that have R and E, without C, A, N.

 Some examples: 
   ""TRIBE"" -> but has B and we don't know about B? Also, note that in ""crane"", the third letter (A) is absent, but that doesn't affect T and B.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are already eliminated: C, A, N.

 Also, note that we have two positions known to be absent for R and E.

 Let me list a few words:
   ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> but E is at the end, which we know is wrong. So avoid putting E at position 5.
   ""ROBES"" -> R at position 1? But R is not in the second position, so position 1 is allowed. However, we don't know if R is at position 1. Also, E is at position 4? That could be okay.

 But let's think: we haven't tested O, S, T, etc.

 We might consider a word with E in the middle and R in a different position.

 Possibilities: 
   ""PILER"" -> but has L and I, and E is at position 4? But note E is not fifth? Actually, fifth letter is R. So E is at fourth? That's okay because we only know E is not fifth. Similarly, R is at fifth? We know R is not second, but fifth is okay.

 However, we must pick a word that maximizes new information.

 Another idea: ""ROTED"" is not a word? Let's think of common words.

 Let me think of words with E not in fifth and R not in second:

   ""RESET"" -> R at 1, E at 2? But then we are putting E in the second position? That might be okay because we don't know if the word has E in second? The feedback only said E is not in fifth. So second is possible? However, note that we cannot use A, C, N. But ""RESET"" has two E's? Actually, ""RESET"" has E at positions 2 and 4? And S and T.

 But we are not sure if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. But in the example, ""BRISK"" has distinct letters. So we assume duplicates are possible? Actually, Wordle words generally do not have duplicates? But let me check: the rules don't specify. However, to be safe, we avoid using duplicate letters until we have evidence.

 Actually, feedback in Wordle does indicate duplicates: for example, if the word has one E and you guess two E's, then one might be correct and the other shown as absent? But we don't know for sure without experiment.

 The problem says: 
   Each letter in the guess will receive one of three symbols.

 And the example ""STORM"" for ""BRISK"" put S and R both as not correct position? But note: BRISK has one R? So if we guess two R's, it would be tricky? Hence, it's safer to assume the word might have duplicate letters? But actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters (e.g., ""SLEEP"").

 However, in the absence of information, we try to avoid duplicates to maximize coverage.

 For our second guess, we want:

   Must include R and E (since they are present).
   Avoid C, A, N.
   E cannot be at position 5.
   R cannot be at position 2.
   We prefer distinct letters.

 So, let's consider:

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1 (okay, not position 2), O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? We know E is not at position 5.

   So avoid words with E at 5.

   Another: ""TRUED"": not a word.

   ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> E at position 2? And R at position 3? This avoids E at 5 and R at 2? Positions: 
        P (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), L (5)
        E is at 2: we don't know if that's possible? 
        R is at 3: that's a new position.

   Also, we test P, I, L, which haven't been tested.

   This seems good.

   Another option: ""DRIVE"" -> D, R, I, V, E -> R at second position? But that is not allowed! Because we know R is in the word but not in second position. So we cannot put R in the second position.

   Therefore, we exclude any guess that has R in the second position.

   So ""PERIL"" has R at third? That's not second, so okay.

   What about ""ELDER""? Has E at position 1? Then L, D, E, R -> but has duplicate E? We want to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 1 is acceptable? But the word has two E's? 

   Let me avoid duplicates for now.

   ""PERIL"" is a valid English word and meets criteria.

   Another candidate: ""GIVER"" -> G, I, V, E, R -> R at fifth? That is not second? And E at fourth? Not fifth? So that's okay? But then E is at 4? We haven't tested G, I, V.

   However, ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"" both are valid.

   But note: in ""crane"", the feedback said E is absent? No, wait: E was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So E is definitely in the word, so it's good we are including it.

   We should include E again to test it in a new position? Also, R in a new position.

   Between ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"", which is better? They both cover new letters.

   Let's pick ""PERIL"".

   But wait: the feedback from the first word had R at second position and E at fifth position. Now in our new guess ""PERIL"", we put E at the second position? That's different. Similarly, R is at third.

   We are testing if E can be at second? That would be new information.

   However, note: if E were to be at the second position, then we haven't tested E in that position? So it's a good test.

   But wait, we know E is in the word and not at fifth. However, it could be at second? So we are testing that possibility.

   But also, maybe E is at position 1? We didn't try that.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts E at position we haven't tried? And R at a position we haven't tried? 

   Since in the first word E was at fifth (which is wrong) and now we put E at second? That's a different position.

   Similarly, R was at second? Now we put at third.

   Also, using letters: P, E, R, I, L (we already know R and E are present, but P, I, L are new).

   This should give us good information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but A is eliminated? Because in the first guess, A was marked as absent. So we cannot use A. So ""OPERA"" has A -> invalid.

   How about ""QUERY""? Has Q and Y? But we don't know about Q and Y? Also, E is at fourth? R at fifth? And U? This is okay? But note: we must use only words without A, C, N. ""QUERY"" has Q, U, E, R, Y -> so no A, C, N. But Q and U are uncommon? We might want to test more common letters.

   Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> has O, but we have two O's? Also, no E? We must include E.

   We must include E? Because E is in the word? But our guess must be a valid word. We can choose words without E? But if we know E is in the word, why wouldn't we use it? Also, if we don't include E, we might leave out a known letter? Actually, including E in a different position helps us locate it.

   Therefore, we choose ""PERIL"".

   So the second guess: PERIL

   However, note: we haven't tested S, T, or other very common letters? But PERIL has P and L and I? That's acceptable.

   Alternatively, ""ARISE"" has A? Eliminated.

   ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at third? Not second? E at fourth? Not fifth? And avoids A, C, N? But it has R and E? Also, T, I, D? That's good? Wait, R at third? Yes. And E at fourth? Avoids fifth.

   However, we don't know if T, I, or D are in the word.

   Compare ""PERIL"" and ""TIRED"":

        ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L
        ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D

    Both have I? And common letters? 

    The word might contain T? It might be more common? Or D? 

    We can choose ""TIRED"" because T is very common? Also, D is common? 

    But note: we already know E and R. So including them again is important? Because we need to get their positions? 

    So either is acceptable? But ""TIRED"" has E at fourth? Which we haven't tried? And R at third? Also, we test T, I, D.

    Let me pick ""TIRED"". Why? Because T is more common than P? And we avoid L? Which is less common? But it's subjective.

    However, we must not reuse eliminated letters? Both TIRED and PERIL are valid.

    Another consideration: the position of E: in ""crane"" we had E at fifth? Now in ""tired"" we test E at fourth? And in ""peril"" we test E at second? We don't know what position E is? So testing a different position might be good? But we don't know which? Both are valid tests.

    Let me choose ""TIRED"".

    Alternatively, a word that includes E in an entirely new position? But fifth is ruled out? So E can be in 1,2,3,4. We haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried 5? So any of 1,2,3,4? 

    In ""crane"" we tried E at fifth? Now we can try E at, say, first? That might be good? 

    For example: ""EARLY"" -> has A? Eliminated.

    ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> R is at second? But position 2? We cannot put R at second? Because we know R is absent at position 2? So ""ERUPT"" has R at second? Forbidden? 

    We must avoid putting R at position 2? So that limits us.

    What about ""ROUSE""? R at first? O, U, S, E? And E at fifth? But we cannot put E at fifth? Forbidden? 

    So E cannot be fifth? So in another candidate: ""ENTRY"": has N? Eliminated.

    ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E -> R at fourth? and E at fifth? But E at fifth is forbidden? So that's bad? 

    So let's see: we need E not at fifth? So E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4? And R at positions 1,3,4,5? 

    Also, no A, C, N? 

    ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R at third? E at fourth? So E not fifth? Okay? And R not second? Positions: 
        1: B, 2: O, 3: R, 4: E, 5: D -> and R not at second? Condition satisfied.

    Why not ""BORED""? We test B, O, R, E, D? We know R and E are in? So we test B, O, D? 

    But note: we tested O? So it is a new letter? 

    However, ""TIRED"" is similar? T, I, R, E, D -> same E and R? Same D? But T and I? 

    Actually, we have not tested B, O, T, I, D, P, etc.

    We are free to choose? 

    After consideration, I will go with ""TIRED"" because T is very common? And we haven't tested T? 

    But note that in the word, we know that common letters? So testing T, D, I? 

    Final choice: TIRED

    But wait, let's think: ""TIRED"" places R at the third position? That might be? Then E at fourth? 

    We'll get feedback on each letter? So if R is indeed at third? then we get a check? If E is at fourth? check? Otherwise? 

    So that's good.

    Or if E is at fourth? we get '-'? because we probably have to avoid fifth? 

    Actually, we don't know? Maybe E is second? 

    But we are testing.

    I think ""TIRED"" is a valid choice.

    However, I notice we haven't tested S? which is very common. 

    A word with R, E, S and without A, C, N? And avoids E at fifth and R at second? 

    Example: ""RESIN"" -> has N? Eliminated.

    ""PRESS"" -> has two S's? Duplicate? Avoid? 

    ""TRESS"" -> same? Duplicate.

    ""RESTY"" -> E at the second? R at first? Then S, T, Y? But E at second? and R at first? That's valid? 

    ""RESTY"": R(1), E(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? 

    But in the first guess? We know E is not at fifth? But here E is second? which is a new position? And R is first? which is also a new position? 

    And we test S, T, Y? 

    Also, no duplicate letters? 

    But we know R is in the word? and R at first here? So this is valid? 

    However, we must avoid using any eliminated letter? ""RESTY"" doesn't have A, C, N? 

    So that is a candidate? 

    Then we get to test S and T? very common? 

    Compare: ""RESTY"", ""TIRED"", ""PERIL""

    ""RESTY"" has E at second? But wait: in the first guess we had R at second? Now we are putting E at second? and R at first? 

    We know R is not at second? But E could be at second? 

    So that's fine? 

    Also, note: we are testing two new positions for R and E? 

    Specifically, R at the first position? and E at the second? 

    Why not? 

    I think ""RESTY"" is a good candidate? 

    But wait: what does the feedback tell us? If we guess ""RESTY"", and the word doesn't have S, T, or Y? But that's okay? Because we get information about them? 

    Alternatively, if the word has R at first? and E at second? We hit the jackpot? 

    Actually, the word has R? but we don't know the position? So testing first? 

    We know E is in the word? so testing E at second? 

    Therefore, I choose ""RESTY"". 

    But note: R and E are both being tested in new positions? 

    Also, we haven't tested S, T, Y? 

    So that provides maximal information? 

    Alternatively, we can think: we don't want to put known present letters in an arbitrary position? But we are trying to find exactly? 

    So ""RESTY"" seems a strong candidate? 

    Final decision: RESTY

    But wait: in the first guess, E was marked as present but wrong position? Now we are putting E at the second position? 

    Also, R was marked as present but wrong position? Then we put R at the first? 

    This might help to pin down their positions? 

    Yes? 

    However, if E is actually at the first? Then we have no test? But we don't know? So we should have a test for E at first? But we cannot test everything? 

    So let's hope that by testing in one of the positions? we can eliminate? 

    We'll do ""RESTY"".

    But note: the word might be ""RESTY""? Then we win? 

    But likely not? 

    So our second guess: RESTY

    However, let me double-check: 
        Positions: 1:R, 2:E, 03:S, 4:T, 5:Y
        We know R cannot be at position 2? We put it at 1? That's allowed.
        We know E cannot be at position 5? We put it at 2? That's allowed.

    Yes.

    If we get feedback:
        If R is at position 1? then ✓ for R
        If E is at position 2? ✓ for E

        Otherwise? '-' or 'x'? 

    We will get to know.

    So <guess>resty</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C absent, R present but wrong position, A absent, N absent, E present but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R and E (with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5), while excluding C, A, and N. 

For the next guess:
- We must include R and E, using positions other than 2 for R and 5 for E to gather new positional insights.
- We should prioritize common untested letters like S and T for efficiency.
- ""RESTY"" fits these requirements: R in position 1 (new position), E in position 2 (new position), and tests new letters S, T, Y.

This maximizes informational coverage by testing R and E in fresh positions and adding three new common letters.

<guess>resty</guess>",resty,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Now we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Important constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Must not contain C, A, or N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word).
 4. The letter R cannot be in the second position, and E cannot be in the fifth position.

 We can try to use another word that has R and E, plus three other letters that we haven't eliminated.

 Since the word has R and E, and we have to avoid C, A, N, and also the positions we know are wrong.

 We should also aim to test other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Let's recall that the remaining vowels are: O, I, U (since A and E are already considered, but E is in the word and A is not).
 But note: A is not in the word, so we avoid A.

 Common consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 Since E is in the word and we know it's not at the end, we can try putting E in a different position.

 We know R is in the word but not in the second position, so R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Our goal is to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.

 Let's brainstorm words that have R and E, without C, A, N.

 Some examples: 
   ""TRIBE"" -> but has B and we don't know about B? Also, note that in ""crane"", the third letter (A) is absent, but that doesn't affect T and B.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are already eliminated: C, A, N.

 Also, note that we have two positions known to be absent for R and E.

 Let me list a few words:
   ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> but E is at the end, which we know is wrong. So avoid putting E at position 5.
   ""ROBES"" -> R at position 1? But R is not in the second position, so position 1 is allowed. However, we don't know if R is at position 1. Also, E is at position 4? That could be okay.

 But let's think: we haven't tested O, S, T, etc.

 We might consider a word with E in the middle and R in a different position.

 Possibilities: 
   ""PILER"" -> but has L and I, and E is at position 4? But note E is not fifth? Actually, fifth letter is R. So E is at fourth? That's okay because we only know E is not fifth. Similarly, R is at fifth? We know R is not second, but fifth is okay.

 However, we must pick a word that maximizes new information.

 Another idea: ""ROTED"" is not a word? Let's think of common words.

 Let me think of words with E not in fifth and R not in second:

   ""RESET"" -> R at 1, E at 2? But then we are putting E in the second position? That might be okay because we don't know if the word has E in second? The feedback only said E is not in fifth. So second is possible? However, note that we cannot use A, C, N. But ""RESET"" has two E's? Actually, ""RESET"" has E at positions 2 and 4? And S and T.

 But we are not sure if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. But in the example, ""BRISK"" has distinct letters. So we assume duplicates are possible? Actually, Wordle words generally do not have duplicates? But let me check: the rules don't specify. However, to be safe, we avoid using duplicate letters until we have evidence.

 Actually, feedback in Wordle does indicate duplicates: for example, if the word has one E and you guess two E's, then one might be correct and the other shown as absent? But we don't know for sure without experiment.

 The problem says: 
   Each letter in the guess will receive one of three symbols.

 And the example ""STORM"" for ""BRISK"" put S and R both as not correct position? But note: BRISK has one R? So if we guess two R's, it would be tricky? Hence, it's safer to assume the word might have duplicate letters? But actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters (e.g., ""SLEEP"").

 However, in the absence of information, we try to avoid duplicates to maximize coverage.

 For our second guess, we want:

   Must include R and E (since they are present).
   Avoid C, A, N.
   E cannot be at position 5.
   R cannot be at position 2.
   We prefer distinct letters.

 So, let's consider:

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1 (okay, not position 2), O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? We know E is not at position 5.

   So avoid words with E at 5.

   Another: ""TRUED"": not a word.

   ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> E at position 2? And R at position 3? This avoids E at 5 and R at 2? Positions: 
        P (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), L (5)
        E is at 2: we don't know if that's possible? 
        R is at 3: that's a new position.

   Also, we test P, I, L, which haven't been tested.

   This seems good.

   Another option: ""DRIVE"" -> D, R, I, V, E -> R at second position? But that is not allowed! Because we know R is in the word but not in second position. So we cannot put R in the second position.

   Therefore, we exclude any guess that has R in the second position.

   So ""PERIL"" has R at third? That's not second, so okay.

   What about ""ELDER""? Has E at position 1? Then L, D, E, R -> but has duplicate E? We want to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 1 is acceptable? But the word has two E's? 

   Let me avoid duplicates for now.

   ""PERIL"" is a valid English word and meets criteria.

   Another candidate: ""GIVER"" -> G, I, V, E, R -> R at fifth? That is not second? And E at fourth? Not fifth? So that's okay? But then E is at 4? We haven't tested G, I, V.

   However, ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"" both are valid.

   But note: in ""crane"", the feedback said E is absent? No, wait: E was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So E is definitely in the word, so it's good we are including it.

   We should include E again to test it in a new position? Also, R in a new position.

   Between ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"", which is better? They both cover new letters.

   Let's pick ""PERIL"".

   But wait: the feedback from the first word had R at second position and E at fifth position. Now in our new guess ""PERIL"", we put E at the second position? That's different. Similarly, R is at third.

   We are testing if E can be at second? That would be new information.

   However, note: if E were to be at the second position, then we haven't tested E in that position? So it's a good test.

   But wait, we know E is in the word and not at fifth. However, it could be at second? So we are testing that possibility.

   But also, maybe E is at position 1? We didn't try that.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts E at position we haven't tried? And R at a position we haven't tried? 

   Since in the first word E was at fifth (which is wrong) and now we put E at second? That's a different position.

   Similarly, R was at second? Now we put at third.

   Also, using letters: P, E, R, I, L (we already know R and E are present, but P, I, L are new).

   This should give us good information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but A is eliminated? Because in the first guess, A was marked as absent. So we cannot use A. So ""OPERA"" has A -> invalid.

   How about ""QUERY""? Has Q and Y? But we don't know about Q and Y? Also, E is at fourth? R at fifth? And U? This is okay? But note: we must use only words without A, C, N. ""QUERY"" has Q, U, E, R, Y -> so no A, C, N. But Q and U are uncommon? We might want to test more common letters.

   Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> has O, but we have two O's? Also, no E? We must include E.

   We must include E? Because E is in the word? But our guess must be a valid word. We can choose words without E? But if we know E is in the word, why wouldn't we use it? Also, if we don't include E, we might leave out a known letter? Actually, including E in a different position helps us locate it.

   Therefore, we choose ""PERIL"".

   So the second guess: PERIL

   However, note: we haven't tested S, T, or other very common letters? But PERIL has P and L and I? That's acceptable.

   Alternatively, ""ARISE"" has A? Eliminated.

   ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at third? Not second? E at fourth? Not fifth? And avoids A, C, N? But it has R and E? Also, T, I, D? That's good? Wait, R at third? Yes. And E at fourth? Avoids fifth.

   However, we don't know if T, I, or D are in the word.

   Compare ""PERIL"" and ""TIRED"":

        ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L
        ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D

    Both have I? And common letters? 

    The word might contain T? It might be more common? Or D? 

    We can choose ""TIRED"" because T is very common? Also, D is common? 

    But note: we already know E and R. So including them again is important? Because we need to get their positions? 

    So either is acceptable? But ""TIRED"" has E at fourth? Which we haven't tried? And R at third? Also, we test T, I, D.

    Let me pick ""TIRED"". Why? Because T is more common than P? And we avoid L? Which is less common? But it's subjective.

    However, we must not reuse eliminated letters? Both TIRED and PERIL are valid.

    Another consideration: the position of E: in ""crane"" we had E at fifth? Now in ""tired"" we test E at fourth? And in ""peril"" we test E at second? We don't know what position E is? So testing a different position might be good? But we don't know which? Both are valid tests.

    Let me choose ""TIRED"".

    Alternatively, a word that includes E in an entirely new position? But fifth is ruled out? So E can be in 1,2,3,4. We haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried 5? So any of 1,2,3,4? 

    In ""crane"" we tried E at fifth? Now we can try E at, say, first? That might be good? 

    For example: ""EARLY"" -> has A? Eliminated.

    ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> R is at second? But position 2? We cannot put R at second? Because we know R is absent at position 2? So ""ERUPT"" has R at second? Forbidden? 

    We must avoid putting R at position 2? So that limits us.

    What about ""ROUSE""? R at first? O, U, S, E? And E at fifth? But we cannot put E at fifth? Forbidden? 

    So E cannot be fifth? So in another candidate: ""ENTRY"": has N? Eliminated.

    ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E -> R at fourth? and E at fifth? But E at fifth is forbidden? So that's bad? 

    So let's see: we need E not at fifth? So E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4? And R at positions 1,3,4,5? 

    Also, no A, C, N? 

    ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R at third? E at fourth? So E not fifth? Okay? And R not second? Positions: 
        1: B, 2: O, 3: R, 4: E, 5: D -> and R not at second? Condition satisfied.

    Why not ""BORED""? We test B, O, R, E, D? We know R and E are in? So we test B, O, D? 

    But note: we tested O? So it is a new letter? 

    However, ""TIRED"" is similar? T, I, R, E, D -> same E and R? Same D? But T and I? 

    Actually, we have not tested B, O, T, I, D, P, etc.

    We are free to choose? 

    After consideration, I will go with ""TIRED"" because T is very common? And we haven't tested T? 

    But note that in the word, we know that common letters? So testing T, D, I? 

    Final choice: TIRED

    But wait, let's think: ""TIRED"" places R at the third position? That might be? Then E at fourth? 

    We'll get feedback on each letter? So if R is indeed at third? then we get a check? If E is at fourth? check? Otherwise? 

    So that's good.

    Or if E is at fourth? we get '-'? because we probably have to avoid fifth? 

    Actually, we don't know? Maybe E is second? 

    But we are testing.

    I think ""TIRED"" is a valid choice.

    However, I notice we haven't tested S? which is very common. 

    A word with R, E, S and without A, C, N? And avoids E at fifth and R at second? 

    Example: ""RESIN"" -> has N? Eliminated.

    ""PRESS"" -> has two S's? Duplicate? Avoid? 

    ""TRESS"" -> same? Duplicate.

    ""RESTY"" -> E at the second? R at first? Then S, T, Y? But E at second? and R at first? That's valid? 

    ""RESTY"": R(1), E(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? 

    But in the first guess? We know E is not at fifth? But here E is second? which is a new position? And R is first? which is also a new position? 

    And we test S, T, Y? 

    Also, no duplicate letters? 

    But we know R is in the word? and R at first here? So this is valid? 

    However, we must avoid using any eliminated letter? ""RESTY"" doesn't have A, C, N? 

    So that is a candidate? 

    Then we get to test S and T? very common? 

    Compare: ""RESTY"", ""TIRED"", ""PERIL""

    ""RESTY"" has E at second? But wait: in the first guess we had R at second? Now we are putting E at second? and R at first? 

    We know R is not at second? But E could be at second? 

    So that's fine? 

    Also, note: we are testing two new positions for R and E? 

    Specifically, R at the first position? and E at the second? 

    Why not? 

    I think ""RESTY"" is a good candidate? 

    But wait: what does the feedback tell us? If we guess ""RESTY"", and the word doesn't have S, T, or Y? But that's okay? Because we get information about them? 

    Alternatively, if the word has R at first? and E at second? We hit the jackpot? 

    Actually, the word has R? but we don't know the position? So testing first? 

    We know E is in the word? so testing E at second? 

    Therefore, I choose ""RESTY"". 

    But note: R and E are both being tested in new positions? 

    Also, we haven't tested S, T, Y? 

    So that provides maximal information? 

    Alternatively, we can think: we don't want to put known present letters in an arbitrary position? But we are trying to find exactly? 

    So ""RESTY"" seems a strong candidate? 

    Final decision: RESTY

    But wait: in the first guess, E was marked as present but wrong position? Now we are putting E at the second position? 

    Also, R was marked as present but wrong position? Then we put R at the first? 

    This might help to pin down their positions? 

    Yes? 

    However, if E is actually at the first? Then we have no test? But we don't know? So we should have a test for E at first? But we cannot test everything? 

    So let's hope that by testing in one of the positions? we can eliminate? 

    We'll do ""RESTY"".

    But note: the word might be ""RESTY""? Then we win? 

    But likely not? 

    So our second guess: RESTY

    However, let me double-check: 
        Positions: 1:R, 2:E, 03:S, 4:T, 5:Y
        We know R cannot be at position 2? We put it at 1? That's allowed.
        We know E cannot be at position 5? We put it at 2? That's allowed.

    Yes.

    If we get feedback:
        If R is at position 1? then ✓ for R
        If E is at position 2? ✓ for E

        Otherwise? '-' or 'x'? 

    We will get to know.

    So <guess>resty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C absent, R present but wrong position, A absent, N absent, E present but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R and E (with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5), while excluding C, A, and N. 

For the next guess:
- We must include R and E, using positions other than 2 for R and 5 for E to gather new positional insights.
- We should prioritize common untested letters like S and T for efficiency.
- ""RESTY"" fits these requirements: R in position 1 (new position), E in position 2 (new position), and tests new letters S, T, Y.

This maximizes informational coverage by testing R and E in fresh positions and adding three new common letters.",Guess 2: resty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(✓) S(-) T(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SERUM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Now we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Important constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Must not contain C, A, or N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word).
 4. The letter R cannot be in the second position, and E cannot be in the fifth position.

 We can try to use another word that has R and E, plus three other letters that we haven't eliminated.

 Since the word has R and E, and we have to avoid C, A, N, and also the positions we know are wrong.

 We should also aim to test other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Let's recall that the remaining vowels are: O, I, U (since A and E are already considered, but E is in the word and A is not).
 But note: A is not in the word, so we avoid A.

 Common consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 Since E is in the word and we know it's not at the end, we can try putting E in a different position.

 We know R is in the word but not in the second position, so R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Our goal is to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.

 Let's brainstorm words that have R and E, without C, A, N.

 Some examples: 
   ""TRIBE"" -> but has B and we don't know about B? Also, note that in ""crane"", the third letter (A) is absent, but that doesn't affect T and B.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are already eliminated: C, A, N.

 Also, note that we have two positions known to be absent for R and E.

 Let me list a few words:
   ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> but E is at the end, which we know is wrong. So avoid putting E at position 5.
   ""ROBES"" -> R at position 1? But R is not in the second position, so position 1 is allowed. However, we don't know if R is at position 1. Also, E is at position 4? That could be okay.

 But let's think: we haven't tested O, S, T, etc.

 We might consider a word with E in the middle and R in a different position.

 Possibilities: 
   ""PILER"" -> but has L and I, and E is at position 4? But note E is not fifth? Actually, fifth letter is R. So E is at fourth? That's okay because we only know E is not fifth. Similarly, R is at fifth? We know R is not second, but fifth is okay.

 However, we must pick a word that maximizes new information.

 Another idea: ""ROTED"" is not a word? Let's think of common words.

 Let me think of words with E not in fifth and R not in second:

   ""RESET"" -> R at 1, E at 2? But then we are putting E in the second position? That might be okay because we don't know if the word has E in second? The feedback only said E is not in fifth. So second is possible? However, note that we cannot use A, C, N. But ""RESET"" has two E's? Actually, ""RESET"" has E at positions 2 and 4? And S and T.

 But we are not sure if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. But in the example, ""BRISK"" has distinct letters. So we assume duplicates are possible? Actually, Wordle words generally do not have duplicates? But let me check: the rules don't specify. However, to be safe, we avoid using duplicate letters until we have evidence.

 Actually, feedback in Wordle does indicate duplicates: for example, if the word has one E and you guess two E's, then one might be correct and the other shown as absent? But we don't know for sure without experiment.

 The problem says: 
   Each letter in the guess will receive one of three symbols.

 And the example ""STORM"" for ""BRISK"" put S and R both as not correct position? But note: BRISK has one R? So if we guess two R's, it would be tricky? Hence, it's safer to assume the word might have duplicate letters? But actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters (e.g., ""SLEEP"").

 However, in the absence of information, we try to avoid duplicates to maximize coverage.

 For our second guess, we want:

   Must include R and E (since they are present).
   Avoid C, A, N.
   E cannot be at position 5.
   R cannot be at position 2.
   We prefer distinct letters.

 So, let's consider:

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1 (okay, not position 2), O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? We know E is not at position 5.

   So avoid words with E at 5.

   Another: ""TRUED"": not a word.

   ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> E at position 2? And R at position 3? This avoids E at 5 and R at 2? Positions: 
        P (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), L (5)
        E is at 2: we don't know if that's possible? 
        R is at 3: that's a new position.

   Also, we test P, I, L, which haven't been tested.

   This seems good.

   Another option: ""DRIVE"" -> D, R, I, V, E -> R at second position? But that is not allowed! Because we know R is in the word but not in second position. So we cannot put R in the second position.

   Therefore, we exclude any guess that has R in the second position.

   So ""PERIL"" has R at third? That's not second, so okay.

   What about ""ELDER""? Has E at position 1? Then L, D, E, R -> but has duplicate E? We want to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 1 is acceptable? But the word has two E's? 

   Let me avoid duplicates for now.

   ""PERIL"" is a valid English word and meets criteria.

   Another candidate: ""GIVER"" -> G, I, V, E, R -> R at fifth? That is not second? And E at fourth? Not fifth? So that's okay? But then E is at 4? We haven't tested G, I, V.

   However, ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"" both are valid.

   But note: in ""crane"", the feedback said E is absent? No, wait: E was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So E is definitely in the word, so it's good we are including it.

   We should include E again to test it in a new position? Also, R in a new position.

   Between ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"", which is better? They both cover new letters.

   Let's pick ""PERIL"".

   But wait: the feedback from the first word had R at second position and E at fifth position. Now in our new guess ""PERIL"", we put E at the second position? That's different. Similarly, R is at third.

   We are testing if E can be at second? That would be new information.

   However, note: if E were to be at the second position, then we haven't tested E in that position? So it's a good test.

   But wait, we know E is in the word and not at fifth. However, it could be at second? So we are testing that possibility.

   But also, maybe E is at position 1? We didn't try that.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts E at position we haven't tried? And R at a position we haven't tried? 

   Since in the first word E was at fifth (which is wrong) and now we put E at second? That's a different position.

   Similarly, R was at second? Now we put at third.

   Also, using letters: P, E, R, I, L (we already know R and E are present, but P, I, L are new).

   This should give us good information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but A is eliminated? Because in the first guess, A was marked as absent. So we cannot use A. So ""OPERA"" has A -> invalid.

   How about ""QUERY""? Has Q and Y? But we don't know about Q and Y? Also, E is at fourth? R at fifth? And U? This is okay? But note: we must use only words without A, C, N. ""QUERY"" has Q, U, E, R, Y -> so no A, C, N. But Q and U are uncommon? We might want to test more common letters.

   Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> has O, but we have two O's? Also, no E? We must include E.

   We must include E? Because E is in the word? But our guess must be a valid word. We can choose words without E? But if we know E is in the word, why wouldn't we use it? Also, if we don't include E, we might leave out a known letter? Actually, including E in a different position helps us locate it.

   Therefore, we choose ""PERIL"".

   So the second guess: PERIL

   However, note: we haven't tested S, T, or other very common letters? But PERIL has P and L and I? That's acceptable.

   Alternatively, ""ARISE"" has A? Eliminated.

   ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at third? Not second? E at fourth? Not fifth? And avoids A, C, N? But it has R and E? Also, T, I, D? That's good? Wait, R at third? Yes. And E at fourth? Avoids fifth.

   However, we don't know if T, I, or D are in the word.

   Compare ""PERIL"" and ""TIRED"":

        ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L
        ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D

    Both have I? And common letters? 

    The word might contain T? It might be more common? Or D? 

    We can choose ""TIRED"" because T is very common? Also, D is common? 

    But note: we already know E and R. So including them again is important? Because we need to get their positions? 

    So either is acceptable? But ""TIRED"" has E at fourth? Which we haven't tried? And R at third? Also, we test T, I, D.

    Let me pick ""TIRED"". Why? Because T is more common than P? And we avoid L? Which is less common? But it's subjective.

    However, we must not reuse eliminated letters? Both TIRED and PERIL are valid.

    Another consideration: the position of E: in ""crane"" we had E at fifth? Now in ""tired"" we test E at fourth? And in ""peril"" we test E at second? We don't know what position E is? So testing a different position might be good? But we don't know which? Both are valid tests.

    Let me choose ""TIRED"".

    Alternatively, a word that includes E in an entirely new position? But fifth is ruled out? So E can be in 1,2,3,4. We haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried 5? So any of 1,2,3,4? 

    In ""crane"" we tried E at fifth? Now we can try E at, say, first? That might be good? 

    For example: ""EARLY"" -> has A? Eliminated.

    ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> R is at second? But position 2? We cannot put R at second? Because we know R is absent at position 2? So ""ERUPT"" has R at second? Forbidden? 

    We must avoid putting R at position 2? So that limits us.

    What about ""ROUSE""? R at first? O, U, S, E? And E at fifth? But we cannot put E at fifth? Forbidden? 

    So E cannot be fifth? So in another candidate: ""ENTRY"": has N? Eliminated.

    ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E -> R at fourth? and E at fifth? But E at fifth is forbidden? So that's bad? 

    So let's see: we need E not at fifth? So E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4? And R at positions 1,3,4,5? 

    Also, no A, C, N? 

    ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R at third? E at fourth? So E not fifth? Okay? And R not second? Positions: 
        1: B, 2: O, 3: R, 4: E, 5: D -> and R not at second? Condition satisfied.

    Why not ""BORED""? We test B, O, R, E, D? We know R and E are in? So we test B, O, D? 

    But note: we tested O? So it is a new letter? 

    However, ""TIRED"" is similar? T, I, R, E, D -> same E and R? Same D? But T and I? 

    Actually, we have not tested B, O, T, I, D, P, etc.

    We are free to choose? 

    After consideration, I will go with ""TIRED"" because T is very common? And we haven't tested T? 

    But note that in the word, we know that common letters? So testing T, D, I? 

    Final choice: TIRED

    But wait, let's think: ""TIRED"" places R at the third position? That might be? Then E at fourth? 

    We'll get feedback on each letter? So if R is indeed at third? then we get a check? If E is at fourth? check? Otherwise? 

    So that's good.

    Or if E is at fourth? we get '-'? because we probably have to avoid fifth? 

    Actually, we don't know? Maybe E is second? 

    But we are testing.

    I think ""TIRED"" is a valid choice.

    However, I notice we haven't tested S? which is very common. 

    A word with R, E, S and without A, C, N? And avoids E at fifth and R at second? 

    Example: ""RESIN"" -> has N? Eliminated.

    ""PRESS"" -> has two S's? Duplicate? Avoid? 

    ""TRESS"" -> same? Duplicate.

    ""RESTY"" -> E at the second? R at first? Then S, T, Y? But E at second? and R at first? That's valid? 

    ""RESTY"": R(1), E(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? 

    But in the first guess? We know E is not at fifth? But here E is second? which is a new position? And R is first? which is also a new position? 

    And we test S, T, Y? 

    Also, no duplicate letters? 

    But we know R is in the word? and R at first here? So this is valid? 

    However, we must avoid using any eliminated letter? ""RESTY"" doesn't have A, C, N? 

    So that is a candidate? 

    Then we get to test S and T? very common? 

    Compare: ""RESTY"", ""TIRED"", ""PERIL""

    ""RESTY"" has E at second? But wait: in the first guess we had R at second? Now we are putting E at second? and R at first? 

    We know R is not at second? But E could be at second? 

    So that's fine? 

    Also, note: we are testing two new positions for R and E? 

    Specifically, R at the first position? and E at the second? 

    Why not? 

    I think ""RESTY"" is a good candidate? 

    But wait: what does the feedback tell us? If we guess ""RESTY"", and the word doesn't have S, T, or Y? But that's okay? Because we get information about them? 

    Alternatively, if the word has R at first? and E at second? We hit the jackpot? 

    Actually, the word has R? but we don't know the position? So testing first? 

    We know E is in the word? so testing E at second? 

    Therefore, I choose ""RESTY"". 

    But note: R and E are both being tested in new positions? 

    Also, we haven't tested S, T, Y? 

    So that provides maximal information? 

    Alternatively, we can think: we don't want to put known present letters in an arbitrary position? But we are trying to find exactly? 

    So ""RESTY"" seems a strong candidate? 

    Final decision: RESTY

    But wait: in the first guess, E was marked as present but wrong position? Now we are putting E at the second position? 

    Also, R was marked as present but wrong position? Then we put R at the first? 

    This might help to pin down their positions? 

    Yes? 

    However, if E is actually at the first? Then we have no test? But we don't know? So we should have a test for E at first? But we cannot test everything? 

    So let's hope that by testing in one of the positions? we can eliminate? 

    We'll do ""RESTY"".

    But note: the word might be ""RESTY""? Then we win? 

    But likely not? 

    So our second guess: RESTY

    However, let me double-check: 
        Positions: 1:R, 2:E, 03:S, 4:T, 5:Y
        We know R cannot be at position 2? We put it at 1? That's allowed.
        We know E cannot be at position 5? We put it at 2? That's allowed.

    Yes.

    If we get feedback:
        If R is at position 1? then ✓ for R
        If E is at position 2? ✓ for E

        Otherwise? '-' or 'x'? 

    We will get to know.

    So <guess>resty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C absent, R present but wrong position, A absent, N absent, E present but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R and E (with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5), while excluding C, A, and N. 

For the next guess:
- We must include R and E, using positions other than 2 for R and 5 for E to gather new positional insights.
- We should prioritize common untested letters like S and T for efficiency.
- ""RESTY"" fits these requirements: R in position 1 (new position), E in position 2 (new position), and tests new letters S, T, Y.

This maximizes informational coverage by testing R and E in fresh positions and adding three new common letters.

Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n 2. Must not contain C, A, or N (since they are not in the word).\n 3. Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word).\n 4. The letter R cannot be in the second position, and E cannot be in the fifth position.\n\n We can try to use another word that has R and E, plus three other letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\n Since the word has R and E, and we have to avoid C, A, N, and also the positions we know are wrong.\n\n We should also aim to test other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.\n\n Let\'s recall that the remaining vowels are: O, I, U (since A and E are already considered, but E is in the word and A is not).\n But note: A is not in the word, so we avoid A.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.\n\n Since E is in the word and we know it\'s not at the end, we can try putting E in a different position.\n\n We know R is in the word but not in the second position, so R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Our goal is to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm words that have R and E, without C, A, N.\n\n Some examples: \n   ""TRIBE"" -> but has B and we don\'t know about B? Also, note that in ""crane"", the third letter (A) is absent, but that doesn\'t affect T and B.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that are already eliminated: C, A, N.\n\n Also, note that we have two positions known to be absent for R and E.\n\n Let me list a few words:\n   ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> but E is at the end, which we know is wrong. So avoid putting E at position 5.\n   ""ROBES"" -> R at position 1? But R is not in the second position, so position 1 is allowed. However, we don\'t know if R is at position 1. Also, E is at position 4? That could be okay.\n\n But let\'s think: we haven\'t tested O, S, T, etc.\n\n We might consider a word with E in the middle and R in a different position.\n\n Possibilities: \n   ""PILER"" -> but has L and I, and E is at position 4? But note E is not fifth? Actually, fifth letter is R. So E is at fourth? That\'s okay because we only know E is not fifth. Similarly, R is at fifth? We know R is not second, but fifth is okay.\n\n However, we must pick a word that maximizes new information.\n\n Another idea: ""ROTED"" is not a word? Let\'s think of common words.\n\n Let me think of words with E not in fifth and R not in second:\n\n   ""RESET"" -> R at 1, E at 2? But then we are putting E in the second position? That might be okay because we don\'t know if the word has E in second? The feedback only said E is not in fifth. So second is possible? However, note that we cannot use A, C, N. But ""RESET"" has two E\'s? Actually, ""RESET"" has E at positions 2 and 4? And S and T.\n\n But we are not sure if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say the word has distinct letters. But in the example, ""BRISK"" has distinct letters. So we assume duplicates are possible? Actually, Wordle words generally do not have duplicates? But let me check: the rules don\'t specify. However, to be safe, we avoid using duplicate letters until we have evidence.\n\n Actually, feedback in Wordle does indicate duplicates: for example, if the word has one E and you guess two E\'s, then one might be correct and the other shown as absent? But we don\'t know for sure without experiment.\n\n The problem says: \n   Each letter in the guess will receive one of three symbols.\n\n And the example ""STORM"" for ""BRISK"" put S and R both as not correct position? But note: BRISK has one R? So if we guess two R\'s, it would be tricky? Hence, it\'s safer to assume the word might have duplicate letters? But actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters (e.g., ""SLEEP"").\n\n However, in the absence of information, we try to avoid duplicates to maximize coverage.\n\n For our second guess, we want:\n\n   Must include R and E (since they are present).\n   Avoid C, A, N.\n   E cannot be at position 5.\n   R cannot be at position 2.\n   We prefer distinct letters.\n\n So, let\'s consider:\n\n   ""ROGUE"": R at 1 (okay, not position 2), O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? We know E is not at position 5.\n\n   So avoid words with E at 5.\n\n   Another: ""TRUED"": not a word.\n\n   ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> E at position 2? And R at position 3? This avoids E at 5 and R at 2? Positions: \n        P (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), L (5)\n        E is at 2: we don\'t know if that\'s possible? \n        R is at 3: that\'s a new position.\n\n   Also, we test P, I, L, which haven\'t been tested.\n\n   This seems good.\n\n   Another option: ""DRIVE"" -> D, R, I, V, E -> R at second position? But that is not allowed! Because we know R is in the word but not in second position. So we cannot put R in the second position.\n\n   Therefore, we exclude any guess that has R in the second position.\n\n   So ""PERIL"" has R at third? That\'s not second, so okay.\n\n   What about ""ELDER""? Has E at position 1? Then L, D, E, R -> but has duplicate E? We want to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 1 is acceptable? But the word has two E\'s? \n\n   Let me avoid duplicates for now.\n\n   ""PERIL"" is a valid English word and meets criteria.\n\n   Another candidate: ""GIVER"" -> G, I, V, E, R -> R at fifth? That is not second? And E at fourth? Not fifth? So that\'s okay? But then E is at 4? We haven\'t tested G, I, V.\n\n   However, ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"" both are valid.\n\n   But note: in ""crane"", the feedback said E is absent? No, wait: E was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So E is definitely in the word, so it\'s good we are including it.\n\n   We should include E again to test it in a new position? Also, R in a new position.\n\n   Between ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"", which is better? They both cover new letters.\n\n   Let\'s pick ""PERIL"".\n\n   But wait: the feedback from the first word had R at second position and E at fifth position. Now in our new guess ""PERIL"", we put E at the second position? That\'s different. Similarly, R is at third.\n\n   We are testing if E can be at second? That would be new information.\n\n   However, note: if E were to be at the second position, then we haven\'t tested E in that position? So it\'s a good test.\n\n   But wait, we know E is in the word and not at fifth. However, it could be at second? So we are testing that possibility.\n\n   But also, maybe E is at position 1? We didn\'t try that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts E at position we haven\'t tried? And R at a position we haven\'t tried? \n\n   Since in the first word E was at fifth (which is wrong) and now we put E at second? That\'s a different position.\n\n   Similarly, R was at second? Now we put at third.\n\n   Also, using letters: P, E, R, I, L (we already know R and E are present, but P, I, L are new).\n\n   This should give us good information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but A is eliminated? Because in the first guess, A was marked as absent. So we cannot use A. So ""OPERA"" has A -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""QUERY""? Has Q and Y? But we don\'t know about Q and Y? Also, E is at fourth? R at fifth? And U? This is okay? But note: we must use only words without A, C, N. ""QUERY"" has Q, U, E, R, Y -> so no A, C, N. But Q and U are uncommon? We might want to test more common letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> has O, but we have two O\'s? Also, no E? We must include E.\n\n   We must include E? Because E is in the word? But our guess must be a valid word. We can choose words without E? But if we know E is in the word, why wouldn\'t we use it? Also, if we don\'t include E, we might leave out a known letter? Actually, including E in a different position helps us locate it.\n\n   Therefore, we choose ""PERIL"".\n\n   So the second guess: PERIL\n\n   However, note: we haven\'t tested S, T, or other very common letters? But PERIL has P and L and I? That\'s acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ARISE"" has A? Eliminated.\n\n   ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at third? Not second? E at fourth? Not fifth? And avoids A, C, N? But it has R and E? Also, T, I, D? That\'s good? Wait, R at third? Yes. And E at fourth? Avoids fifth.\n\n   However, we don\'t know if T, I, or D are in the word.\n\n   Compare ""PERIL"" and ""TIRED"":\n\n        ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L\n        ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D\n\n    Both have I? And common letters? \n\n    The word might contain T? It might be more common? Or D? \n\n    We can choose ""TIRED"" because T is very common? Also, D is common? \n\n    But note: we already know E and R. So including them again is important? Because we need to get their positions? \n\n    So either is acceptable? But ""TIRED"" has E at fourth? Which we haven\'t tried? And R at third? Also, we test T, I, D.\n\n    Let me pick ""TIRED"". Why? Because T is more common than P? And we avoid L? Which is less common? But it\'s subjective.\n\n    However, we must not reuse eliminated letters? Both TIRED and PERIL are valid.\n\n    Another consideration: the position of E: in ""crane"" we had E at fifth? Now in ""tired"" we test E at fourth? And in ""peril"" we test E at second? We don\'t know what position E is? So testing a different position might be good? But we don\'t know which? Both are valid tests.\n\n    Let me choose ""TIRED"".\n\n    Alternatively, a word that includes E in an entirely new position? But fifth is ruled out? So E can be in 1,2,3,4. We haven\'t tried 1,2,3,4? We tried 5? So any of 1,2,3,4? \n\n    In ""crane"" we tried E at fifth? Now we can try E at, say, first? That might be good? \n\n    For example: ""EARLY"" -> has A? Eliminated.\n\n    ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> R is at second? But position 2? We cannot put R at second? Because we know R is absent at position 2? So ""ERUPT"" has R at second? Forbidden? \n\n    We must avoid putting R at position 2? So that limits us.\n\n    What about ""ROUSE""? R at first? O, U, S, E? And E at fifth? But we cannot put E at fifth? Forbidden? \n\n    So E cannot be fifth? So in another candidate: ""ENTRY"": has N? Eliminated.\n\n    ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E -> R at fourth? and E at fifth? But E at fifth is forbidden? So that\'s bad? \n\n    So let\'s see: we need E not at fifth? So E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4? And R at positions 1,3,4,5? \n\n    Also, no A, C, N? \n\n    ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R at third? E at fourth? So E not fifth? Okay? And R not second? Positions: \n        1: B, 2: O, 3: R, 4: E, 5: D -> and R not at second? Condition satisfied.\n\n    Why not ""BORED""? We test B, O, R, E, D? We know R and E are in? So we test B, O, D? \n\n    But note: we tested O? So it is a new letter? \n\n    However, ""TIRED"" is similar? T, I, R, E, D -> same E and R? Same D? But T and I? \n\n    Actually, we have not tested B, O, T, I, D, P, etc.\n\n    We are free to choose? \n\n    After consideration, I will go with ""TIRED"" because T is very common? And we haven\'t tested T? \n\n    But note that in the word, we know that common letters? So testing T, D, I? \n\n    Final choice: TIRED\n\n    But wait, let\'s think: ""TIRED"" places R at the third position? That might be? Then E at fourth? \n\n    We\'ll get feedback on each letter? So if R is indeed at third? then we get a check? If E is at fourth? check? Otherwise? \n\n    So that\'s good.\n\n    Or if E is at fourth? we get \'-\'? because we probably have to avoid fifth? \n\n    Actually, we don\'t know? Maybe E is second? \n\n    But we are testing.\n\n    I think ""TIRED"" is a valid choice.\n\n    However, I notice we haven\'t tested S? which is very common. \n\n    A word with R, E, S and without A, C, N? And avoids E at fifth and R at second? \n\n    Example: ""RESIN"" -> has N? Eliminated.\n\n    ""PRESS"" -> has two S\'s? Duplicate? Avoid? \n\n    ""TRESS"" -> same? Duplicate.\n\n    ""RESTY"" -> E at the second? R at first? Then S, T, Y? But E at second? and R at first? That\'s valid? \n\n    ""RESTY"": R(1), E(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? \n\n    But in the first guess? We know E is not at fifth? But here E is second? which is a new position? And R is first? which is also a new position? \n\n    And we test S, T, Y? \n\n    Also, no duplicate letters? \n\n    But we know R is in the word? and R at first here? So this is valid? \n\n    However, we must avoid using any eliminated letter? ""RESTY"" doesn\'t have A, C, N? \n\n    So that is a candidate? \n\n    Then we get to test S and T? very common? \n\n    Compare: ""RESTY"", ""TIRED"", ""PERIL""\n\n    ""RESTY"" has E at second?

We are given feedback from the second guess ""resty"":
  R: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  S: - (present but wrong position)
  T: x (absent)
  Y: x (absent)

Combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:
  From guess 1: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  From guess 2: R(-), E(✓), S(-), T(x), Y(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word contains: R, E, S (because they are present in at least one guess).
   - E is in the correct position: position 2 (since in ""resty"", E is at position 2 and marked correct).
   - R is present but not in position 1 (from ""resty"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane"").
   - S is present but not in position 3 (from ""resty"").

2. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y (marked absent in at least one guess and not present in any other).

3. The letter E is fixed at position 2.

4. We have two more known letters: R and S, which must be in the word but not in the positions we've tried.

5. We have two unknown letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we know E at position 2, and two other letters R and S, but there might be one more letter we haven't found? Actually, we know three letters: R, E, S. So the word has E at position 2, and two more letters that are R and S, and two other letters that we haven't identified? But wait, we have 5 positions.

Actually, we know the word has at least R, E, S. But there could be more letters? We have two more positions to fill (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but E is at 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are for the other four letters? But we only have two known letters (R and S) so far? That means there are two more letters we haven't found.

But note: we have eliminated C, A, N, T, Y. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet without these.

Also, we have two positions where we know the letter must be one of the remaining possibilities.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be R (because in ""resty"", R at position 1 was marked as present but wrong, meaning it's not position 1). Also, cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: cannot be S (because in ""resty"", S at position 3 was marked as present but wrong) and cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.
- Position 4: cannot be T (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, Y. Also, in ""resty"", we had T at position 4 and it was absent, so T is not in the word? But wait, in the feedback for ""resty"", T is marked as absent (x). So T is not in the word at all? Similarly, Y is absent. So we can eliminate T and Y entirely.
- Position 5: cannot be E (from first guess) and cannot be Y (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, T.

So the word has:
  Position 2: E
  The letters R and S must be in the word, but not at:
      R: not at position 1 (from ""resty"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"")
      S: not at position 3 (from ""resty"")

Also, the word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y.

We need to find two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We know one letter (E) and two more (R and S). So we are missing two letters? But wait, R and S are two, plus E is three, so we need two more? But that would be five? Actually, the word has five letters: one of them is E (at position 2), and the other four are from the set of letters that include R and S and two others that we haven't found.

But we have two more letters to find? And we have to place R and S in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but with constraints.

Let me denote the positions:
  Pos1: ? (cannot be R, C, A, N, T, Y; and must be a letter we haven't eliminated)
  Pos2: E (fixed)
  Pos3: ? (cannot be S, C, A, N, T, Y)
  Pos4: ? (cannot be T, C, A, N, Y; and T is absent so any letter except eliminated ones)
  Pos5: ? (cannot be E, C, A, N, T, Y)

And the word must contain R and S, which are not yet placed.

Also, note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? And we don't have evidence for duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? But we must be cautious.

Given the constraints, we can try to form a word.

We know R must be in one of positions 3,4,5? Because it cannot be in 1 or 2? 
  - Position 1: not allowed (from ""resty"" feedback: R at pos1 is wrong position, meaning it's present but not at 1, so it must be in 3,4, or 5? 
  - But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2? which we know is wrong? So R is in the word but not at 2? and now we know not at 1? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for R.

Similarly, S must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Because it cannot be at position 3? (from ""resty"" feedback: S at pos3 is present but wrong, so it must be in 1,4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is available? and 4,5? 

But note: we have two letters R and S to place in the four positions? But we have two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters that are not eliminated.

We can think of the word as: [not R] [E] [not S] [any except eliminated] [any except eliminated and not E]

But we must have R and S in the word? So in the positions 1,3,4,5, we must have R and S and two other letters.

We can try to guess a word that includes R and S and two new letters? and places E at 2.

We should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to maximize information? So we should try to cover common letters and avoid repeating positions we know are wrong.

We also know that R must be in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5? But note: if we put S at position 1? that is allowed? because we haven't tried S at 1? Similarly, R at 3? 

But we must avoid putting R and S in positions that are already known to be wrong? We don't have any constraint that says R cannot be at 3? or 4? or 5? Similarly for S? 

So let's try to form a word.

We can try to put S at position 1? Then we have:
  S ? ? ? ?
But position 2 is E? So: S E ? ? ?

Then we need to place R? and two other letters? 

But R must be in 3,4,5? So we can put R at 3? Then: S E R ? ?

But then we have two more positions? and we need one more letter? Actually, we have two more letters? But we already have S, E, R? So we need two more? 

Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:R, 4:?, 5:?

But we also know that S is in the word? and we have it at position 1? and R at 3? 

But we need to choose two more letters? 

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

Also, we have to avoid the eliminated letters.

But what if the word is ""SERUM""? 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Then U at 4, M at 5? 
  But we haven't tested U and M? 

But let's check constraints:
  Position 1: S -> allowed? We don't know if S can be at 1? We only know it cannot be at 3? So 1 is new? 
  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R cannot be at 1 or 2? 3 is new? 
  Position 4: U -> not eliminated? 
  Position 5: M -> not eliminated? 

But we must check if ""SERUM"" is a word? Yes, it is.

But we don't know if U and M are in the word? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests more common letters? 

But note: we have two more letters to find? So we need to test two new letters? 

We can also consider: what if we put R at position 5? and S at position 4? 

For example: ? E ? S R

But we need to fill position 1 and 3? 

Example: ""LEVER""? But has E at 4? and duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicate? Also, E is fixed at 2? So ""LEVER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

But we have no evidence of duplicates? So avoid? 

Another: ""PERSO""? Not a word? 

""BERSK""? Not a word? 

We need a valid word.

We can try ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? 
  This tests I and F? 

But is ""SERIF"" a word? Yes.

We can also try ""SERVE"": but has V? and duplicate E? 

We avoid duplicate? 

So ""SERIF"" is a candidate? 

But we have to consider: we know that in the word, S cannot be at 3? and we are putting it at 1? which is allowed? R at 3? which is allowed? 

But what if R is not at 3? Then we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 4? and R at position 5? 

For example: ? E ? S R

What word? ""PESKY""? But Y is eliminated? 

""DESKS""? duplicate S? 

""JESUS""? duplicate S? and U? 

""FESTS""? duplicate S? 

We avoid duplicates? 

""HELPS"": H, E, L, P, S -> S at 5? 
  But then we are not using R? We must use R? Because we know R is in the word? 

We must include R? 

So we cannot make a word without R? 

Therefore, we must include R and S? 

So the word must have R and S? 

So in our guess, we must include R and S? 

So ""SERIF"" includes R and S? 

But we have to test two new letters? 

Another candidate: ""SERUM"" as above? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We want to maximize information? 

We can also consider: we haven't tested O, U, L, D, etc? 

But we have to choose? 

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 4? and S at position 1? 

For example: S E ? R ?

What word? ""SEWER""? duplicate E? 

""SEPAR""? has A? eliminated? 

""SEPIA""? has A? 

""SEMIS""? duplicate S? 

""SEHRI""? not a word? 

""SEORL""? not a word? 

""SEGUR""? not a word? 

How about ""SERGE""? S, E, R, G, E -> duplicate E? 

We avoid duplicates? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, putting R at position 3 might be easier? 

So let's go with ""SERIF"" or ""SERUM""? 

But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? 

We can also try ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? 

But what if the word has duplicate E? We don't know? But we have no evidence? So we avoid? 

Therefore, I choose ""SERIF"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5.

This way, we test I and F? 

But note: we have to consider that R might not be at position 3? Then we get feedback that R is present but not at 3? Then we know it must be at 4 or 5? 

Similarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get feedback? 

But we know S must be at 1,4, or 5? We are testing 1? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, we can test S at position 4? 

For example: ? E ? S R

But we need a word: ""LEVSR"" not a word? 

""PESKY"" not? 

""RESID""? but R at 1? which we know is not allowed? Because R cannot be at 1? 

In ""RESID"": R at 1? which we know is wrong? So we cannot use that? 

""DESIR"": D, E, S, I, R -> positions: 
  1: D, 2: E, 3: S, 4: I, 5: R

But we know S cannot be at position 3? Because in ""resty"", S at 3 was marked as present but wrong? So we cannot put S at 3? 

Therefore, ""DESIR"" is invalid? 

""DISER""? not a word? 

So it's difficult to put S at 4? 

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a reasonable guess? 

But let me check: in ""SERIF"", we have:
  Position 1: S -> we are testing if S is at 1? 
  Position 3: R -> testing if R is at 3? 

If both are correct? Then we get two checks? 

If not? We get feedback? 

Also, we test I and F? 

So that's good? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? I and F are not eliminated? 

So I choose ""SERIF"". 

But wait, what about the possibility that R is at position 5? and S at position 4? 

We haven't tested that? But we can test in the next guess? 

We have 6 tries? So we can do this? 

Therefore, let's go with ""SERIF"". 

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? 

For example, ""SHIRE"": S, H, I, R, E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is at position 2? So we cannot put E at 5? 

We have E fixed at 2? 

So we cannot use ""SHIRE"" because it has E at the end? 

""SHORE"": has O? and E at 5? not allowed? 

""SHARE"": has A? eliminated? 

So ""SERIF"" seems good? 

Another candidate: ""SERUM"" as I thought? 

""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M -> tests U and M? 

Which is less common? 

But we don't know? 

I think ""SERIF"" is better? 

But let me see: we haven't tested I? and F? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? 

I think we should avoid duplicates? 

So final decision: ""SERIF""

But wait, what if the word is ""PERSO"" or something? But we have to have R and S? 

We are including them? 

So <guess>serif</guess> 

But let me double-check the constraints for ""SERIF"":
  Position 1: S -> allowed? We know S is present and not at 3? 1 is a new position? 
  Position 2: E -> correct and fixed? 
  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R is present and not at 1 or 2? 3 is new? 
  Position 4: I -> not eliminated? 
  Position 5: F -> not eliminated? 

And the word ""serif"" is valid? 

Yes? 

So we go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  - *Inference*: The word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5. Letters **C, A, N** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: RESTY** → Feedback: R (present, wrong position), E (correct position), S (present, wrong position), T (absent), Y (absent).  
  - *Inference*:  
    - **E** is confirmed at position 2.  
    - **R** is present but not in position 1 (new) or 2 (known).  
    - **S** is present but not in position 3.  
    - **T** and **Y** are absent.  
    - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, T, Y**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - **E** at position 2.  
  - **R** and **S** are present but not placed.  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **R** cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
  - **S** cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters needed (since E, R, S account for 3 letters, and the word has 5). These must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include **R** and **S** to test their positions while introducing new letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, L, D) and avoid eliminated letters.  
- Test **R** in position 3 (a valid position) and **S** in position 1 (a valid position) to resolve uncertainty.  
- Choose a word that maximizes new information: **SERIF** (S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5).  
  - Tests **S** at position 1 and **R** at position 3.  
  - Introduces new letters **I** and **F**.  
  - Valid 5-letter word without duplicates or eliminated letters.  

<guess>serif</guess>",serif,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""resty"":
  R: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  S: - (present but wrong position)
  T: x (absent)
  Y: x (absent)

Combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:
  From guess 1: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  From guess 2: R(-), E(✓), S(-), T(x), Y(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word contains: R, E, S (because they are present in at least one guess).
   - E is in the correct position: position 2 (since in ""resty"", E is at position 2 and marked correct).
   - R is present but not in position 1 (from ""resty"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane"").
   - S is present but not in position 3 (from ""resty"").

2. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y (marked absent in at least one guess and not present in any other).

3. The letter E is fixed at position 2.

4. We have two more known letters: R and S, which must be in the word but not in the positions we've tried.

5. We have two unknown letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we know E at position 2, and two other letters R and S, but there might be one more letter we haven't found? Actually, we know three letters: R, E, S. So the word has E at position 2, and two more letters that are R and S, and two other letters that we haven't identified? But wait, we have 5 positions.

Actually, we know the word has at least R, E, S. But there could be more letters? We have two more positions to fill (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but E is at 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are for the other four letters? But we only have two known letters (R and S) so far? That means there are two more letters we haven't found.

But note: we have eliminated C, A, N, T, Y. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet without these.

Also, we have two positions where we know the letter must be one of the remaining possibilities.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be R (because in ""resty"", R at position 1 was marked as present but wrong, meaning it's not position 1). Also, cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: cannot be S (because in ""resty"", S at position 3 was marked as present but wrong) and cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.
- Position 4: cannot be T (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, Y. Also, in ""resty"", we had T at position 4 and it was absent, so T is not in the word? But wait, in the feedback for ""resty"", T is marked as absent (x). So T is not in the word at all? Similarly, Y is absent. So we can eliminate T and Y entirely.
- Position 5: cannot be E (from first guess) and cannot be Y (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, T.

So the word has:
  Position 2: E
  The letters R and S must be in the word, but not at:
      R: not at position 1 (from ""resty"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"")
      S: not at position 3 (from ""resty"")

Also, the word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y.

We need to find two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We know one letter (E) and two more (R and S). So we are missing two letters? But wait, R and S are two, plus E is three, so we need two more? But that would be five? Actually, the word has five letters: one of them is E (at position 2), and the other four are from the set of letters that include R and S and two others that we haven't found.

But we have two more letters to find? And we have to place R and S in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but with constraints.

Let me denote the positions:
  Pos1: ? (cannot be R, C, A, N, T, Y; and must be a letter we haven't eliminated)
  Pos2: E (fixed)
  Pos3: ? (cannot be S, C, A, N, T, Y)
  Pos4: ? (cannot be T, C, A, N, Y; and T is absent so any letter except eliminated ones)
  Pos5: ? (cannot be E, C, A, N, T, Y)

And the word must contain R and S, which are not yet placed.

Also, note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? And we don't have evidence for duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? But we must be cautious.

Given the constraints, we can try to form a word.

We know R must be in one of positions 3,4,5? Because it cannot be in 1 or 2? 
  - Position 1: not allowed (from ""resty"" feedback: R at pos1 is wrong position, meaning it's present but not at 1, so it must be in 3,4, or 5? 
  - But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2? which we know is wrong? So R is in the word but not at 2? and now we know not at 1? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for R.

Similarly, S must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Because it cannot be at position 3? (from ""resty"" feedback: S at pos3 is present but wrong, so it must be in 1,4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is available? and 4,5? 

But note: we have two letters R and S to place in the four positions? But we have two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters that are not eliminated.

We can think of the word as: [not R] [E] [not S] [any except eliminated] [any except eliminated and not E]

But we must have R and S in the word? So in the positions 1,3,4,5, we must have R and S and two other letters.

We can try to guess a word that includes R and S and two new letters? and places E at 2.

We should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to maximize information? So we should try to cover common letters and avoid repeating positions we know are wrong.

We also know that R must be in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5? But note: if we put S at position 1? that is allowed? because we haven't tried S at 1? Similarly, R at 3? 

But we must avoid putting R and S in positions that are already known to be wrong? We don't have any constraint that says R cannot be at 3? or 4? or 5? Similarly for S? 

So let's try to form a word.

We can try to put S at position 1? Then we have:
  S ? ? ? ?
But position 2 is E? So: S E ? ? ?

Then we need to place R? and two other letters? 

But R must be in 3,4,5? So we can put R at 3? Then: S E R ? ?

But then we have two more positions? and we need one more letter? Actually, we have two more letters? But we already have S, E, R? So we need two more? 

Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:R, 4:?, 5:?

But we also know that S is in the word? and we have it at position 1? and R at 3? 

But we need to choose two more letters? 

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

Also, we have to avoid the eliminated letters.

But what if the word is ""SERUM""? 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Then U at 4, M at 5? 
  But we haven't tested U and M? 

But let's check constraints:
  Position 1: S -> allowed? We don't know if S can be at 1? We only know it cannot be at 3? So 1 is new? 
  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R cannot be at 1 or 2? 3 is new? 
  Position 4: U -> not eliminated? 
  Position 5: M -> not eliminated? 

But we must check if ""SERUM"" is a word? Yes, it is.

But we don't know if U and M are in the word? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests more common letters? 

But note: we have two more letters to find? So we need to test two new letters? 

We can also consider: what if we put R at position 5? and S at position 4? 

For example: ? E ? S R

But we need to fill position 1 and 3? 

Example: ""LEVER""? But has E at 4? and duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicate? Also, E is fixed at 2? So ""LEVER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

But we have no evidence of duplicates? So avoid? 

Another: ""PERSO""? Not a word? 

""BERSK""? Not a word? 

We need a valid word.

We can try ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? 
  This tests I and F? 

But is ""SERIF"" a word? Yes.

We can also try ""SERVE"": but has V? and duplicate E? 

We avoid duplicate? 

So ""SERIF"" is a candidate? 

But we have to consider: we know that in the word, S cannot be at 3? and we are putting it at 1? which is allowed? R at 3? which is allowed? 

But what if R is not at 3? Then we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 4? and R at position 5? 

For example: ? E ? S R

What word? ""PESKY""? But Y is eliminated? 

""DESKS""? duplicate S? 

""JESUS""? duplicate S? and U? 

""FESTS""? duplicate S? 

We avoid duplicates? 

""HELPS"": H, E, L, P, S -> S at 5? 
  But then we are not using R? We must use R? Because we know R is in the word? 

We must include R? 

So we cannot make a word without R? 

Therefore, we must include R and S? 

So the word must have R and S? 

So in our guess, we must include R and S? 

So ""SERIF"" includes R and S? 

But we have to test two new letters? 

Another candidate: ""SERUM"" as above? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We want to maximize information? 

We can also consider: we haven't tested O, U, L, D, etc? 

But we have to choose? 

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 4? and S at position 1? 

For example: S E ? R ?

What word? ""SEWER""? duplicate E? 

""SEPAR""? has A? eliminated? 

""SEPIA""? has A? 

""SEMIS""? duplicate S? 

""SEHRI""? not a word? 

""SEORL""? not a word? 

""SEGUR""? not a word? 

How about ""SERGE""? S, E, R, G, E -> duplicate E? 

We avoid duplicates? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, putting R at position 3 might be easier? 

So let's go with ""SERIF"" or ""SERUM""? 

But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? 

We can also try ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? 

But what if the word has duplicate E? We don't know? But we have no evidence? So we avoid? 

Therefore, I choose ""SERIF"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5.

This way, we test I and F? 

But note: we have to consider that R might not be at position 3? Then we get feedback that R is present but not at 3? Then we know it must be at 4 or 5? 

Similarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get feedback? 

But we know S must be at 1,4, or 5? We are testing 1? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, we can test S at position 4? 

For example: ? E ? S R

But we need a word: ""LEVSR"" not a word? 

""PESKY"" not? 

""RESID""? but R at 1? which we know is not allowed? Because R cannot be at 1? 

In ""RESID"": R at 1? which we know is wrong? So we cannot use that? 

""DESIR"": D, E, S, I, R -> positions: 
  1: D, 2: E, 3: S, 4: I, 5: R

But we know S cannot be at position 3? Because in ""resty"", S at 3 was marked as present but wrong? So we cannot put S at 3? 

Therefore, ""DESIR"" is invalid? 

""DISER""? not a word? 

So it's difficult to put S at 4? 

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a reasonable guess? 

But let me check: in ""SERIF"", we have:
  Position 1: S -> we are testing if S is at 1? 
  Position 3: R -> testing if R is at 3? 

If both are correct? Then we get two checks? 

If not? We get feedback? 

Also, we test I and F? 

So that's good? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? I and F are not eliminated? 

So I choose ""SERIF"". 

But wait, what about the possibility that R is at position 5? and S at position 4? 

We haven't tested that? But we can test in the next guess? 

We have 6 tries? So we can do this? 

Therefore, let's go with ""SERIF"". 

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? 

For example, ""SHIRE"": S, H, I, R, E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is at position 2? So we cannot put E at 5? 

We have E fixed at 2? 

So we cannot use ""SHIRE"" because it has E at the end? 

""SHORE"": has O? and E at 5? not allowed? 

""SHARE"": has A? eliminated? 

So ""SERIF"" seems good? 

Another candidate: ""SERUM"" as I thought? 

""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M -> tests U and M? 

Which is less common? 

But we don't know? 

I think ""SERIF"" is better? 

But let me see: we haven't tested I? and F? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? 

I think we should avoid duplicates? 

So final decision: ""SERIF""

But wait, what if the word is ""PERSO"" or something? But we have to have R and S? 

We are including them? 

So <guess>serif</guess> 

But let me double-check the constraints for ""SERIF"":
  Position 1: S -> allowed? We know S is present and not at 3? 1 is a new position? 
  Position 2: E -> correct and fixed? 
  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R is present and not at 1 or 2? 3 is new? 
  Position 4: I -> not eliminated? 
  Position 5: F -> not eliminated? 

And the word ""serif"" is valid? 

Yes? 

So we go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  - *Inference*: The word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5. Letters **C, A, N** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: RESTY** → Feedback: R (present, wrong position), E (correct position), S (present, wrong position), T (absent), Y (absent).  
  - *Inference*:  
    - **E** is confirmed at position 2.  
    - **R** is present but not in position 1 (new) or 2 (known).  
    - **S** is present but not in position 3.  
    - **T** and **Y** are absent.  
    - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, T, Y**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - **E** at position 2.  
  - **R** and **S** are present but not placed.  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **R** cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
  - **S** cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters needed (since E, R, S account for 3 letters, and the word has 5). These must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include **R** and **S** to test their positions while introducing new letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, L, D) and avoid eliminated letters.  
- Test **R** in position 3 (a valid position) and **S** in position 1 (a valid position) to resolve uncertainty.  
- Choose a word that maximizes new information: **SERIF** (S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5).  
  - Tests **S** at position 1 and **R** at position 3.  
  - Introduces new letters **I** and **F**.  
  - Valid 5-letter word without duplicates or eliminated letters.",Guess 3: serif -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) R(✓) I(x) F(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SERUM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Now we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Important constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Must not contain C, A, or N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word).
 4. The letter R cannot be in the second position, and E cannot be in the fifth position.

 We can try to use another word that has R and E, plus three other letters that we haven't eliminated.

 Since the word has R and E, and we have to avoid C, A, N, and also the positions we know are wrong.

 We should also aim to test other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Let's recall that the remaining vowels are: O, I, U (since A and E are already considered, but E is in the word and A is not).
 But note: A is not in the word, so we avoid A.

 Common consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

 Since E is in the word and we know it's not at the end, we can try putting E in a different position.

 We know R is in the word but not in the second position, so R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Our goal is to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.

 Let's brainstorm words that have R and E, without C, A, N.

 Some examples: 
   ""TRIBE"" -> but has B and we don't know about B? Also, note that in ""crane"", the third letter (A) is absent, but that doesn't affect T and B.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are already eliminated: C, A, N.

 Also, note that we have two positions known to be absent for R and E.

 Let me list a few words:
   ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> but E is at the end, which we know is wrong. So avoid putting E at position 5.
   ""ROBES"" -> R at position 1? But R is not in the second position, so position 1 is allowed. However, we don't know if R is at position 1. Also, E is at position 4? That could be okay.

 But let's think: we haven't tested O, S, T, etc.

 We might consider a word with E in the middle and R in a different position.

 Possibilities: 
   ""PILER"" -> but has L and I, and E is at position 4? But note E is not fifth? Actually, fifth letter is R. So E is at fourth? That's okay because we only know E is not fifth. Similarly, R is at fifth? We know R is not second, but fifth is okay.

 However, we must pick a word that maximizes new information.

 Another idea: ""ROTED"" is not a word? Let's think of common words.

 Let me think of words with E not in fifth and R not in second:

   ""RESET"" -> R at 1, E at 2? But then we are putting E in the second position? That might be okay because we don't know if the word has E in second? The feedback only said E is not in fifth. So second is possible? However, note that we cannot use A, C, N. But ""RESET"" has two E's? Actually, ""RESET"" has E at positions 2 and 4? And S and T.

 But we are not sure if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. But in the example, ""BRISK"" has distinct letters. So we assume duplicates are possible? Actually, Wordle words generally do not have duplicates? But let me check: the rules don't specify. However, to be safe, we avoid using duplicate letters until we have evidence.

 Actually, feedback in Wordle does indicate duplicates: for example, if the word has one E and you guess two E's, then one might be correct and the other shown as absent? But we don't know for sure without experiment.

 The problem says: 
   Each letter in the guess will receive one of three symbols.

 And the example ""STORM"" for ""BRISK"" put S and R both as not correct position? But note: BRISK has one R? So if we guess two R's, it would be tricky? Hence, it's safer to assume the word might have duplicate letters? But actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters (e.g., ""SLEEP"").

 However, in the absence of information, we try to avoid duplicates to maximize coverage.

 For our second guess, we want:

   Must include R and E (since they are present).
   Avoid C, A, N.
   E cannot be at position 5.
   R cannot be at position 2.
   We prefer distinct letters.

 So, let's consider:

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1 (okay, not position 2), O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? We know E is not at position 5.

   So avoid words with E at 5.

   Another: ""TRUED"": not a word.

   ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> E at position 2? And R at position 3? This avoids E at 5 and R at 2? Positions: 
        P (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), L (5)
        E is at 2: we don't know if that's possible? 
        R is at 3: that's a new position.

   Also, we test P, I, L, which haven't been tested.

   This seems good.

   Another option: ""DRIVE"" -> D, R, I, V, E -> R at second position? But that is not allowed! Because we know R is in the word but not in second position. So we cannot put R in the second position.

   Therefore, we exclude any guess that has R in the second position.

   So ""PERIL"" has R at third? That's not second, so okay.

   What about ""ELDER""? Has E at position 1? Then L, D, E, R -> but has duplicate E? We want to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 1 is acceptable? But the word has two E's? 

   Let me avoid duplicates for now.

   ""PERIL"" is a valid English word and meets criteria.

   Another candidate: ""GIVER"" -> G, I, V, E, R -> R at fifth? That is not second? And E at fourth? Not fifth? So that's okay? But then E is at 4? We haven't tested G, I, V.

   However, ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"" both are valid.

   But note: in ""crane"", the feedback said E is absent? No, wait: E was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So E is definitely in the word, so it's good we are including it.

   We should include E again to test it in a new position? Also, R in a new position.

   Between ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"", which is better? They both cover new letters.

   Let's pick ""PERIL"".

   But wait: the feedback from the first word had R at second position and E at fifth position. Now in our new guess ""PERIL"", we put E at the second position? That's different. Similarly, R is at third.

   We are testing if E can be at second? That would be new information.

   However, note: if E were to be at the second position, then we haven't tested E in that position? So it's a good test.

   But wait, we know E is in the word and not at fifth. However, it could be at second? So we are testing that possibility.

   But also, maybe E is at position 1? We didn't try that.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts E at position we haven't tried? And R at a position we haven't tried? 

   Since in the first word E was at fifth (which is wrong) and now we put E at second? That's a different position.

   Similarly, R was at second? Now we put at third.

   Also, using letters: P, E, R, I, L (we already know R and E are present, but P, I, L are new).

   This should give us good information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but A is eliminated? Because in the first guess, A was marked as absent. So we cannot use A. So ""OPERA"" has A -> invalid.

   How about ""QUERY""? Has Q and Y? But we don't know about Q and Y? Also, E is at fourth? R at fifth? And U? This is okay? But note: we must use only words without A, C, N. ""QUERY"" has Q, U, E, R, Y -> so no A, C, N. But Q and U are uncommon? We might want to test more common letters.

   Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> has O, but we have two O's? Also, no E? We must include E.

   We must include E? Because E is in the word? But our guess must be a valid word. We can choose words without E? But if we know E is in the word, why wouldn't we use it? Also, if we don't include E, we might leave out a known letter? Actually, including E in a different position helps us locate it.

   Therefore, we choose ""PERIL"".

   So the second guess: PERIL

   However, note: we haven't tested S, T, or other very common letters? But PERIL has P and L and I? That's acceptable.

   Alternatively, ""ARISE"" has A? Eliminated.

   ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at third? Not second? E at fourth? Not fifth? And avoids A, C, N? But it has R and E? Also, T, I, D? That's good? Wait, R at third? Yes. And E at fourth? Avoids fifth.

   However, we don't know if T, I, or D are in the word.

   Compare ""PERIL"" and ""TIRED"":

        ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L
        ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D

    Both have I? And common letters? 

    The word might contain T? It might be more common? Or D? 

    We can choose ""TIRED"" because T is very common? Also, D is common? 

    But note: we already know E and R. So including them again is important? Because we need to get their positions? 

    So either is acceptable? But ""TIRED"" has E at fourth? Which we haven't tried? And R at third? Also, we test T, I, D.

    Let me pick ""TIRED"". Why? Because T is more common than P? And we avoid L? Which is less common? But it's subjective.

    However, we must not reuse eliminated letters? Both TIRED and PERIL are valid.

    Another consideration: the position of E: in ""crane"" we had E at fifth? Now in ""tired"" we test E at fourth? And in ""peril"" we test E at second? We don't know what position E is? So testing a different position might be good? But we don't know which? Both are valid tests.

    Let me choose ""TIRED"".

    Alternatively, a word that includes E in an entirely new position? But fifth is ruled out? So E can be in 1,2,3,4. We haven't tried 1,2,3,4? We tried 5? So any of 1,2,3,4? 

    In ""crane"" we tried E at fifth? Now we can try E at, say, first? That might be good? 

    For example: ""EARLY"" -> has A? Eliminated.

    ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> R is at second? But position 2? We cannot put R at second? Because we know R is absent at position 2? So ""ERUPT"" has R at second? Forbidden? 

    We must avoid putting R at position 2? So that limits us.

    What about ""ROUSE""? R at first? O, U, S, E? And E at fifth? But we cannot put E at fifth? Forbidden? 

    So E cannot be fifth? So in another candidate: ""ENTRY"": has N? Eliminated.

    ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E -> R at fourth? and E at fifth? But E at fifth is forbidden? So that's bad? 

    So let's see: we need E not at fifth? So E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4? And R at positions 1,3,4,5? 

    Also, no A, C, N? 

    ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R at third? E at fourth? So E not fifth? Okay? And R not second? Positions: 
        1: B, 2: O, 3: R, 4: E, 5: D -> and R not at second? Condition satisfied.

    Why not ""BORED""? We test B, O, R, E, D? We know R and E are in? So we test B, O, D? 

    But note: we tested O? So it is a new letter? 

    However, ""TIRED"" is similar? T, I, R, E, D -> same E and R? Same D? But T and I? 

    Actually, we have not tested B, O, T, I, D, P, etc.

    We are free to choose? 

    After consideration, I will go with ""TIRED"" because T is very common? And we haven't tested T? 

    But note that in the word, we know that common letters? So testing T, D, I? 

    Final choice: TIRED

    But wait, let's think: ""TIRED"" places R at the third position? That might be? Then E at fourth? 

    We'll get feedback on each letter? So if R is indeed at third? then we get a check? If E is at fourth? check? Otherwise? 

    So that's good.

    Or if E is at fourth? we get '-'? because we probably have to avoid fifth? 

    Actually, we don't know? Maybe E is second? 

    But we are testing.

    I think ""TIRED"" is a valid choice.

    However, I notice we haven't tested S? which is very common. 

    A word with R, E, S and without A, C, N? And avoids E at fifth and R at second? 

    Example: ""RESIN"" -> has N? Eliminated.

    ""PRESS"" -> has two S's? Duplicate? Avoid? 

    ""TRESS"" -> same? Duplicate.

    ""RESTY"" -> E at the second? R at first? Then S, T, Y? But E at second? and R at first? That's valid? 

    ""RESTY"": R(1), E(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? 

    But in the first guess? We know E is not at fifth? But here E is second? which is a new position? And R is first? which is also a new position? 

    And we test S, T, Y? 

    Also, no duplicate letters? 

    But we know R is in the word? and R at first here? So this is valid? 

    However, we must avoid using any eliminated letter? ""RESTY"" doesn't have A, C, N? 

    So that is a candidate? 

    Then we get to test S and T? very common? 

    Compare: ""RESTY"", ""TIRED"", ""PERIL""

    ""RESTY"" has E at second? But wait: in the first guess we had R at second? Now we are putting E at second? and R at first? 

    We know R is not at second? But E could be at second? 

    So that's fine? 

    Also, note: we are testing two new positions for R and E? 

    Specifically, R at the first position? and E at the second? 

    Why not? 

    I think ""RESTY"" is a good candidate? 

    But wait: what does the feedback tell us? If we guess ""RESTY"", and the word doesn't have S, T, or Y? But that's okay? Because we get information about them? 

    Alternatively, if the word has R at first? and E at second? We hit the jackpot? 

    Actually, the word has R? but we don't know the position? So testing first? 

    We know E is in the word? so testing E at second? 

    Therefore, I choose ""RESTY"". 

    But note: R and E are both being tested in new positions? 

    Also, we haven't tested S, T, Y? 

    So that provides maximal information? 

    Alternatively, we can think: we don't want to put known present letters in an arbitrary position? But we are trying to find exactly? 

    So ""RESTY"" seems a strong candidate? 

    Final decision: RESTY

    But wait: in the first guess, E was marked as present but wrong position? Now we are putting E at the second position? 

    Also, R was marked as present but wrong position? Then we put R at the first? 

    This might help to pin down their positions? 

    Yes? 

    However, if E is actually at the first? Then we have no test? But we don't know? So we should have a test for E at first? But we cannot test everything? 

    So let's hope that by testing in one of the positions? we can eliminate? 

    We'll do ""RESTY"".

    But note: the word might be ""RESTY""? Then we win? 

    But likely not? 

    So our second guess: RESTY

    However, let me double-check: 
        Positions: 1:R, 2:E, 03:S, 4:T, 5:Y
        We know R cannot be at position 2? We put it at 1? That's allowed.
        We know E cannot be at position 5? We put it at 2? That's allowed.

    Yes.

    If we get feedback:
        If R is at position 1? then ✓ for R
        If E is at position 2? ✓ for E

        Otherwise? '-' or 'x'? 

    We will get to know.

    So <guess>resty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C absent, R present but wrong position, A absent, N absent, E present but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R and E (with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5), while excluding C, A, and N. 

For the next guess:
- We must include R and E, using positions other than 2 for R and 5 for E to gather new positional insights.
- We should prioritize common untested letters like S and T for efficiency.
- ""RESTY"" fits these requirements: R in position 1 (new position), E in position 2 (new position), and tests new letters S, T, Y.

This maximizes informational coverage by testing R and E in fresh positions and adding three new common letters.

<guess>resty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

   - R is present but not in position 1 (from ""resty"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane"").
   - S is present but not in position 3 (from ""resty"").

2. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y (marked absent in at least one guess and not present in any other).

3. The letter E is fixed at position 2.

4. We have two more known letters: R and S, which must be in the word but not in the positions we've tried.

5. We have two unknown letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we know E at position 2, and two other letters R and S, but there might be one more letter we haven't found? Actually, we know three letters: R, E, S. So the word has E at position 2, and two more letters that are R and S, and two other letters that we haven't identified? But wait, we have 5 positions.

Actually, we know the word has at least R, E, S. But there could be more letters? We have two more positions to fill (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but E is at 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are for the other four letters? But we only have two known letters (R and S) so far? That means there are two more letters we haven't found.

But note: we have eliminated C, A, N, T, Y. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet without these.

Also, we have two positions where we know the letter must be one of the remaining possibilities.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be R (because in ""resty"", R at position 1 was marked as present but wrong, meaning it's not position 1). Also, cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: cannot be S (because in ""resty"", S at position 3 was marked as present but wrong) and cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.
- Position 4: cannot be T (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, Y. Also, in ""resty"", we had T at position 4 and it was absent, so T is not in the word? But wait, in the feedback for ""resty"", T is marked as absent (x). So T is not in the word at all? Similarly, Y is absent. So we can eliminate T and Y entirely.
- Position 5: cannot be E (from first guess) and cannot be Y (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, T.

So the word has:
  Position 2: E
  The letters R and S must be in the word, but not at:
      R: not at position 1 (from ""resty"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"")
      S: not at position 3 (from ""resty"")

Also, the word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y.

We need to find two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We know one letter (E) and two more (R and S). So we are missing two letters? But wait, R and S are two, plus E is three, so we need two more? But that would be five? Actually, the word has five letters: one of them is E (at position 2), and the other four are from the set of letters that include R and S and two others that we haven't found.

But we have two more letters to find? And we have to place R and S in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but with constraints.

Let me denote the positions:
  Pos1: ? (cannot be R, C, A, N, T, Y; and must be a letter we haven't eliminated)
  Pos2: E (fixed)
  Pos3: ? (cannot be S, C, A, N, T, Y)
  Pos4: ? (cannot be T, C, A, N, Y; and T is absent so any letter except eliminated ones)
  Pos5: ? (cannot be E, C, A, N, T, Y)

And the word must contain R and S, which are not yet placed.

Also, note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicate so far? And we don't have evidence for duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? But we must be cautious.

Given the constraints, we can try to form a word.

We know R must be in one of positions 3,4,5? Because it cannot be in 1 or 2? 
  - Position 1: not allowed (from ""resty"" feedback: R at pos1 is wrong position, meaning it's present but not at 1, so it must be in 3,4, or 5? 
  - But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2? which we know is wrong? So R is in the word but not at 2? and now we know not at 1? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for R.

Similarly, S must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Because it cannot be at position 3? (from ""resty"" feedback: S at pos3 is present but wrong, so it must be in 1,4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is available? and 4,5? 

But note: we have two letters R and S to place in the four positions? But we have two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters that are not eliminated.

We can think of the word as: [not R] [E] [not S] [any except eliminated] [any except eliminated and not E]

But we must have R and S in the word? So in the positions 1,3,4,5, we must have R and S and two other letters.

We can try to guess a word that includes R and S and two new letters? and places E at 2.

We should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to maximize information? So we should try to cover common letters and avoid repeating positions we know are wrong.

We also know that R must be in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5? But note: if we put S at position 1? that is allowed? because we haven't tried S at 1? Similarly, R at 3? 

But we must avoid putting R and S in positions that are already known to be wrong? We don't have any constraint that says R cannot be at 3? or 4? or 5? Similarly for S? 

So let's try to form a word.

We can try to put S at position 1? Then we have:
  S ? ? ? ?
But position 2 is E? So: S E ? ? ?

Then we need to place R? and two other letters? 

But R must be in 3,4,5? So we can put R at 3? Then: S E R ? ?

But then we have two more positions? and we need one more letter? Actually, we have two more letters? But we already have S, E, R? So we need two more? 

Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:R, 4:?, 5:?

But we also know that S is in the word? and we have it at position 1? and R at 3? 

But we need to choose two more letters? 

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

Also, we have to avoid the eliminated letters.

But what if the word is ""SERUM""? 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Then U at 4, M at 5? 
  But we haven't tested U and M? 

But let's check constraints:
  Position 1: S -> allowed? We don't know if S can be at 1? We only know it cannot be at 3? So 1 is new? 
  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R cannot be at 1 or 2? 3 is new? 
  Position 4: U -> not eliminated? 
  Position 5: M -> not eliminated? 

But we must check if ""SERUM"" is a word? Yes, it is.

But we don't know if U and M are in the word? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests more common letters? 

But note: we have two more letters to find? So we need to test two new letters? 

We can also consider: what if we put R at position 5? and S at position 4? 

For example: ? E ? S R

But we need to fill position 1 and 3? 

Example: ""LEVER""? But has E at 4? and duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicate? Also, E is fixed at 2? So ""LEVER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

But we have no evidence of duplicates? So avoid? 

Another: ""PERSO""? Not a word? 

""BERSK""? Not a word? 

We need a valid word.

We can try ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? 
  This tests I and F? 

But is ""SERIF"" a word? Yes.

We can also try ""SERVE"": but has V? and duplicate E? 

We avoid duplicate? 

So ""SERIF"" is a candidate? 

But we have to consider: we know that in the word, S cannot be at 3? and we are putting it at 1? which is allowed? R at 3? which is allowed? 

But what if R is not at 3? Then we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 4? and R at position 5? 

For example: ? E ? S R

What word? ""PESKY""? But Y is eliminated? 

""DESKS""? duplicate S? 

""JESUS""? duplicate S? and U? 

""FESTS""? duplicate S? 

We avoid duplicates? 

""HELPS"": H, E, L, P, S -> S at 5? 
  But then we are not using R? We must use R? Because we know R is in the word? 

We must include R? 

So we cannot make a word without R? 

Therefore, we must include R and S? 

So the word must have R and S? 

So in our guess, we must include R and S? 

So ""SERIF"" includes R and S? 

But we have to test two new letters? 

Another candidate: ""SERUM"" as above? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We want to maximize information? 

We can also consider: we haven't tested O, U, L, D, etc? 

But we have to choose? 

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 4? and S at position 1? 

For example: S E ? R ?

What word? ""SEWER""? duplicate E? 

""SEPAR""? has A? eliminated? 

""SEPIA""? has A? 

""SEMIS""? duplicate S? 

""SEHRI""? not a word? 

""SEORL""? not a word? 

""SEGUR""? not a word? 

How about ""SERGE""? S, E, R, G, E -> duplicate E? 

We avoid duplicates? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, putting R at position 3 might be easier? 

So let's go with ""SERIF"" or ""SERUM""? 

But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? 

We can also try ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? 

But what if the word has duplicate E? We don't know? But we have no evidence? So we avoid? 

Therefore, I choose ""SERIF"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5.

This way, we test I and F? 

But note: we have to consider that R might not be at position 3? Then we get feedback that R is present but not at 3? Then we know it must be at 4 or 5? 

Similarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get feedback? 

But we know S must be at 1,4, or 5? We are testing 1? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, we can test S at position 4? 

For example: ? E ? S R

But we need a word: ""LEVSR"" not a word? 

""PESKY"" not? 

""RESID""? but R at 1? which we know is not allowed? Because R cannot be at 1? 

In ""RESID"": R at 1? which we know is wrong? So we cannot use that? 

""DESIR"": D, E, S, I, R -> positions: 
  1: D, 2: E, 3: S, 4: I, 5: R

But we know S cannot be at position 3? Because in ""resty"", S at 3 was marked as present but wrong? So we cannot put S at 3? 

Therefore, ""DESIR"" is invalid? 

""DISER""? not a word? 

So it's difficult to put S at 4? 

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a reasonable guess? 

But let me check: in ""SERIF"", we have:
  Position 1: S -> we are testing if S is at 1? 
  Position 3: R -> testing if R is at 3? 

If both are correct? Then we get two checks? 

If not? We get feedback? 

Also, we test I and F? 

So that's good? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? I and F are not eliminated? 

So I choose ""SERIF"". 

But wait, what about the possibility that R is at position 5? and S at position 4? 

We haven't tested that? But we can test in the next guess? 

We have 6 tries? So we can do this? 

Therefore, let's go with ""SERIF"". 

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? 

For example, ""SHIRE"": S, H, I, R, E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is at position 2? So we cannot put E at 5? 

We have E fixed at 2? 

So we cannot use ""SHIRE"" because it has E at the end? 

""SHORE"": has O? and E at 5? not allowed? 

""SHARE"": has A? eliminated? 

So ""SERIF"" seems good? 

Another candidate: ""SERUM"" as I thought? 

""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M -> tests U and M? 

Which is less common? 

But we don't know? 

I think ""SERIF"" is better? 

But let me see: we haven't tested I? and F? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? 

I think we should avoid duplicates? 

So final decision: ""SERIF""

But wait, what if the word is ""PERSO"" or something? But we have to have R and S? 

We are including them? 

So <guess>serif</guess> 

But let me double-check the constraints for ""SERIF"":
  Position 1: S -> allowed? We know S is present and not at 3? 1 is a new position? 
  Position 2: E -> correct and fixed? 
  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R is present and not at 1 or 2? 3 is new? 
  Position 4: I -> not eliminated? 
  Position 5: F -> not eliminated? 

And the word ""serif"" is valid? 

Yes? 

So we go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  - *Inference*: The word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5. Letters **C, A, N** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: RESTY** → Feedback: R (present, wrong position), E (correct position), S (present, wrong position), T (absent), Y (absent).  
  - *Inference*:  
    - **E** is confirmed at position 2.  
    - **R** is present but not in position 1 (new) or 2 (known).  
    - **S** is present but not in position 3.  
    - **T** and **Y** are absent.  
    - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, T, Y**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - **E** at position 2.  
  - **R** and **S** are present but not placed.  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **R** cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
  - **S** cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters needed (since E, R, S account for 3 letters, and the word has 5). These must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include **R** and **S** to test their positions while introducing new letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, L, D) and avoid eliminated letters.  
- Test **R** in position 3 (a valid position) and **S** in position 1 (a valid position) to resolve uncertainty.  
- Choose a word that maximizes new information: **SERIF** (S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5).  
  - Tests **S** at position 1 and **R** at position 3.  
  - Introduces new letters **I** and **F**.  
  - Valid 5-letter word without duplicates or eliminated letters.

Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n 2. Must not contain C, A, or N (since they are not in the word).\n 3. Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word).\n 4. The letter R cannot be in the second position, and E cannot be in the fifth position.\n\n We can try to use another word that has R and E, plus three other letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\n Since the word has R and E, and we have to avoid C, A, N, and also the positions we know are wrong.\n\n We should also aim to test other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.\n\n Let\'s recall that the remaining vowels are: O, I, U (since A and E are already considered, but E is in the word and A is not).\n But note: A is not in the word, so we avoid A.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.\n\n Since E is in the word and we know it\'s not at the end, we can try putting E in a different position.\n\n We know R is in the word but not in the second position, so R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Our goal is to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm words that have R and E, without C, A, N.\n\n Some examples: \n   ""TRIBE"" -> but has B and we don\'t know about B? Also, note that in ""crane"", the third letter (A) is absent, but that doesn\'t affect T and B.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that are already eliminated: C, A, N.\n\n Also, note that we have two positions known to be absent for R and E.\n\n Let me list a few words:\n   ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> but E is at the end, which we know is wrong. So avoid putting E at position 5.\n   ""ROBES"" -> R at position 1? But R is not in the second position, so position 1 is allowed. However, we don\'t know if R is at position 1. Also, E is at position 4? That could be okay.\n\n But let\'s think: we haven\'t tested O, S, T, etc.\n\n We might consider a word with E in the middle and R in a different position.\n\n Possibilities: \n   ""PILER"" -> but has L and I, and E is at position 4? But note E is not fifth? Actually, fifth letter is R. So E is at fourth? That\'s okay because we only know E is not fifth. Similarly, R is at fifth? We know R is not second, but fifth is okay.\n\n However, we must pick a word that maximizes new information.\n\n Another idea: ""ROTED"" is not a word? Let\'s think of common words.\n\n Let me think of words with E not in fifth and R not in second:\n\n   ""RESET"" -> R at 1, E at 2? But then we are putting E in the second position? That might be okay because we don\'t know if the word has E in second? The feedback only said E is not in fifth. So second is possible? However, note that we cannot use A, C, N. But ""RESET"" has two E\'s? Actually, ""RESET"" has E at positions 2 and 4? And S and T.\n\n But we are not sure if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say the word has distinct letters. But in the example, ""BRISK"" has distinct letters. So we assume duplicates are possible? Actually, Wordle words generally do not have duplicates? But let me check: the rules don\'t specify. However, to be safe, we avoid using duplicate letters until we have evidence.\n\n Actually, feedback in Wordle does indicate duplicates: for example, if the word has one E and you guess two E\'s, then one might be correct and the other shown as absent? But we don\'t know for sure without experiment.\n\n The problem says: \n   Each letter in the guess will receive one of three symbols.\n\n And the example ""STORM"" for ""BRISK"" put S and R both as not correct position? But note: BRISK has one R? So if we guess two R\'s, it would be tricky? Hence, it\'s safer to assume the word might have duplicate letters? But actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters (e.g., ""SLEEP"").\n\n However, in the absence of information, we try to avoid duplicates to maximize coverage.\n\n For our second guess, we want:\n\n   Must include R and E (since they are present).\n   Avoid C, A, N.\n   E cannot be at position 5.\n   R cannot be at position 2.\n   We prefer distinct letters.\n\n So, let\'s consider:\n\n   ""ROGUE"": R at 1 (okay, not position 2), O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? We know E is not at position 5.\n\n   So avoid words with E at 5.\n\n   Another: ""TRUED"": not a word.\n\n   ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> E at position 2? And R at position 3? This avoids E at 5 and R at 2? Positions: \n        P (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), L (5)\n        E is at 2: we don\'t know if that\'s possible? \n        R is at 3: that\'s a new position.\n\n   Also, we test P, I, L, which haven\'t been tested.\n\n   This seems good.\n\n   Another option: ""DRIVE"" -> D, R, I, V, E -> R at second position? But that is not allowed! Because we know R is in the word but not in second position. So we cannot put R in the second position.\n\n   Therefore, we exclude any guess that has R in the second position.\n\n   So ""PERIL"" has R at third? That\'s not second, so okay.\n\n   What about ""ELDER""? Has E at position 1? Then L, D, E, R -> but has duplicate E? We want to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 1 is acceptable? But the word has two E\'s? \n\n   Let me avoid duplicates for now.\n\n   ""PERIL"" is a valid English word and meets criteria.\n\n   Another candidate: ""GIVER"" -> G, I, V, E, R -> R at fifth? That is not second? And E at fourth? Not fifth? So that\'s okay? But then E is at 4? We haven\'t tested G, I, V.\n\n   However, ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"" both are valid.\n\n   But note: in ""crane"", the feedback said E is absent? No, wait: E was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So E is definitely in the word, so it\'s good we are including it.\n\n   We should include E again to test it in a new position? Also, R in a new position.\n\n   Between ""PERIL"" and ""GIVER"", which is better? They both cover new letters.\n\n   Let\'s pick ""PERIL"".\n\n   But wait: the feedback from the first word had R at second position and E at fifth position. Now in our new guess ""PERIL"", we put E at the second position? That\'s different. Similarly, R is at third.\n\n   We are testing if E can be at second? That would be new information.\n\n   However, note: if E were to be at the second position, then we haven\'t tested E in that position? So it\'s a good test.\n\n   But wait, we know E is in the word and not at fifth. However, it could be at second? So we are testing that possibility.\n\n   But also, maybe E is at position 1? We didn\'t try that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts E at position we haven\'t tried? And R at a position we haven\'t tried? \n\n   Since in the first word E was at fifth (which is wrong) and now we put E at second? That\'s a different position.\n\n   Similarly, R was at second? Now we put at third.\n\n   Also, using letters: P, E, R, I, L (we already know R and E are present, but P, I, L are new).\n\n   This should give us good information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but A is eliminated? Because in the first guess, A was marked as absent. So we cannot use A. So ""OPERA"" has A -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""QUERY""? Has Q and Y? But we don\'t know about Q and Y? Also, E is at fourth? R at fifth? And U? This is okay? But note: we must use only words without A, C, N. ""QUERY"" has Q, U, E, R, Y -> so no A, C, N. But Q and U are uncommon? We might want to test more common letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> has O, but we have two O\'s? Also, no E? We must include E.\n\n   We must include E? Because E is in the word? But our guess must be a valid word. We can choose words without E? But if we know E is in the word, why wouldn\'t we use it? Also, if we don\'t include E, we might leave out a known letter? Actually, including E in a different position helps us locate it.\n\n   Therefore, we choose ""PERIL"".\n\n   So the second guess: PERIL\n\n   However, note: we haven\'t tested S, T, or other very common letters? But PERIL has P and L and I? That\'s acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ARISE"" has A? Eliminated.\n\n   ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> R at third? Not second? E at fourth? Not fifth? And avoids A, C, N? But it has R and E? Also, T, I, D? That\'s good? Wait, R at third? Yes. And E at fourth? Avoids fifth.\n\n   However, we don\'t know if T, I, or D are in the word.\n\n   Compare ""PERIL"" and ""TIRED"":\n\n        ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L\n        ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D\n\n    Both have I? And common letters? \n\n    The word might contain T? It might be more common? Or D? \n\n    We can choose ""TIRED"" because T is very common? Also, D is common? \n\n    But note: we already know E and R. So including them again is important? Because we need to get their positions? \n\n    So either is acceptable? But ""TIRED"" has E at fourth? Which we haven\'t tried? And R at third? Also, we test T, I, D.\n\n    Let me pick ""TIRED"". Why? Because T is more common than P? And we avoid L? Which is less common? But it\'s subjective.\n\n    However, we must not reuse eliminated letters? Both TIRED and PERIL are valid.\n\n    Another consideration: the position of E: in ""crane"" we had E at fifth? Now in ""tired"" we test E at fourth? And in ""peril"" we test E at second? We don\'t know what position E is? So testing a different position might be good? But we don\'t know which? Both are valid tests.\n\n    Let me choose ""TIRED"".\n\n    Alternatively, a word that includes E in an entirely new position? But fifth is ruled out? So E can be in 1,2,3,4. We haven\'t tried 1,2,3,4? We tried 5? So any of 1,2,3,4? \n\n    In ""crane"" we tried E at fifth? Now we can try E at, say, first? That might be good? \n\n    For example: ""EARLY"" -> has A? Eliminated.\n\n    ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> R is at second? But position 2? We cannot put R at second? Because we know R is absent at position 2? So ""ERUPT"" has R at second? Forbidden? \n\n    We must avoid putting R at position 2? So that limits us.\n\n    What about ""ROUSE""? R at first? O, U, S, E? And E at fifth? But we cannot put E at fifth? Forbidden? \n\n    So E cannot be fifth? So in another candidate: ""ENTRY"": has N? Eliminated.\n\n    ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E -> R at fourth? and E at fifth? But E at fifth is forbidden? So that\'s bad? \n\n    So let\'s see: we need E not at fifth? So E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4? And R at positions 1,3,4,5? \n\n    Also, no A, C, N? \n\n    ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R at third? E at fourth? So E not fifth? Okay? And R not second? Positions: \n        1: B, 2: O, 3: R, 4: E, 5: D -> and R not at second? Condition satisfied.\n\n    Why not ""BORED""? We test B, O, R, E, D? We know R and E are in? So we test B, O, D? \n\n    But note: we tested O? So it is a new letter? \n\n    However, ""TIRED"" is similar? T, I, R, E, D -> same E and R? Same D? But T and I? \n\n    Actually, we have not tested B, O, T, I, D, P, etc.\n\n    We are free to choose? \n\n    After consideration, I will go with ""TIRED"" because T is very common? And we haven\'t tested T? \n\n    But note that in the word, we know that common letters? So testing T, D, I? \n\n    Final choice: TIRED\n\n    But wait, let\'s think: ""TIRED"" places R at the third position? That might be? Then E at fourth? \n\n    We\'ll get feedback on each letter? So if R is indeed at third? then we get a check? If E is at fourth? check? Otherwise? \n\n    So that\'s good.\n\n    Or if E is at fourth? we get \'-\'? because we probably have to avoid fifth? \n\n    Actually, we don\'t know? Maybe E is second? \n\n    But we are testing.\n\n    I think ""TIRED"" is a valid choice.\n\n    However, I notice we haven\'t tested S? which is very common. \n\n    A word with R, E, S and without A, C, N? And avoids E at fifth and R at second? \n\n    Example: ""RESIN"" -> has N? Eliminated.\n\n    ""PRESS"" -> has two S\'s? Duplicate? Avoid? \n\n    ""TRESS"" -> same? Duplicate.\n\n    ""RESTY"" -> E at the second? R at first? Then S, T, Y? But E at second? and R at first? That\'s valid? \n\n    ""RESTY"": R(1), E(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? \n\n    But in the first guess? We know E is not at fifth? But here E is second? which is a new position? And R is first? which is also a new position? \n\n    And we test S, T, Y? \n\n    Also, no duplicate letters? \n\n    But we know R is in the word? and R at first here? So this is valid? \n\n    However, we must avoid using any eliminated letter? ""RESTY"" doesn\'t have A, C, N? \n\n    So that is a candidate? \n\n    Then we get to test S and T? very common? \n\n    Compare: ""RESTY"", ""TIRED"", ""PERIL""\n\n    ""RESTY"" has E at second? But wait: in the first guess we had R at second? Now we are putting E at second? and R at first? \n\n    We know R is not at second? But E could be at second? \n\n    So that\'s fine? \n\n    Also, note: we are testing two new positions for R and E? \n\n    Specifically, R at the first position? and E at the second? \n\n    Why not? \n\n    I think ""RESTY"" is a good candidate? \n\n    But wait: what does the feedback tell us? If we guess ""RESTY"", and the word doesn\'t have S, T, or Y? But that\'s okay? Because we get information about them? \n\n    Alternatively, if the word has R at first? and E at second? We hit the jackpot? \n\n    Actually, the word has R? but we don\'t know the position? So testing first? \n\n    We know E is in the word? so testing E at second? \n\n    Therefore, I choose ""RESTY"". \n\n    But note: R and E are both being tested in new positions? \n\n    Also, we haven\'t tested S, T, Y? \n\n    So that provides maximal information? \n\n    Alternatively, we can think: we don\'t want to put known present letters in an arbitrary position? But we are trying to find exactly? \n\n    So ""RESTY"" seems a strong candidate? \n\n    Final decision: RESTY\n\n    But wait: in the first guess, E was marked as present but wrong position? Now we are putting E at the second position? \n\n    Also, R was marked as present but wrong position? Then we put R at the first? \n\n    This might help to pin down their positions? \n\n    Yes? \n\n    However, if E is actually at the first? Then we have no test? But we don\'t know? So we should have a test for E at first? But we cannot test everything? \n\n    So let\'s hope that by testing in one of the positions? we can eliminate? \n\n    We\'ll do ""RESTY"".\n\n    But note: the word might be ""RESTY""? Then we win? \n\n    But likely not? \n\n    So our second guess: RESTY\n\n    However, let me double-check: \n        Positions: 1:R, 2:E, 03:S, 4:T, 5:Y\n        We know R cannot be at position 2? We put it at 1? That\'s allowed.\n        We know E cannot be at position 5? We put it at 2? That\'s allowed.\n\n    Yes.\n\n    If we get feedback:\n        If R is at position 1? then ✓ for R\n        If E is at position 2? ✓ for E\n\n        Otherwise? \'-\' or \'x\'? \n\n    We will get to know.\n\n    So <guess>resty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C absent, R present but wrong position, A absent, N absent, E present but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R and E (with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5), while excluding C, A, and N. \n\nFor the next guess:\n- We must include R and E, using positions other than 2 for R and 5 for E to gather new positional insights.\n- We should prioritize common untested letters like S and T for efficiency.\n- ""RESTY"" fits these requirements: R in position 1 (new position), E in position 2 (new position), and tests new letters S, T, Y.\n\nThis maximizes informational coverage by testing R and E in fresh positions and adding three new common letters.\n\n<guess>resty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: resty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(✓) S(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""resty"":\n  R: - (present but wrong position)\n  E: ✓ (correct position)\n  S: - (present but wrong position)\n  T: x (absent)\n  Y: x (absent)\n\nCombining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:\n  From guess 1: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  From guess 2: R(-), E(✓), S(-), T(x), Y(x)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n1. The word contains: R, E, S (because they are present in at least one guess).\n   - E is in the correct position: position 2 (since in ""resty"", E is at position 2 and marked correct).\n   - R is present but not in position 1 (from ""resty"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane"").\n   - S is present but not in position 3 (from ""resty"").\n\n2. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y (marked absent in at least one guess and not present in any other).\n\n3. The letter E is fixed at position 2.\n\n4. We have two more known letters: R and S, which must be in the word but not in the positions we\'ve tried.\n\n5. We have two unknown letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we know E at position 2, and two other letters R and S, but there might be one more letter we haven\'t found? Actually, we know three letters: R, E, S. So the word has E at position 2, and two more letters that are R and S, and two other letters that we haven\'t identified? But wait, we have 5 positions.\n\nActually, we know the word has at least R, E, S. But there could be more letters? We have two more positions to fill (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but E is at 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are for the other four letters? But we only have two known letters (R and S) so far? That means there are two more letters we haven\'t found.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated C, A, N, T, Y. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet without these.\n\nAlso, we have two positions where we know the letter must be one of the remaining possibilities.\n\nNow, let\'s list the constraints:\n\n- Position 1: cannot be R (because in ""resty"", R at position 1 was marked as present but wrong, meaning it\'s not position 1). Also, cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.\n- Position 2: E (fixed).\n- Position 3: cannot be S (because in ""resty"", S at position 3 was marked as present but wrong) and cannot be C, A, N, T, Y.\n- Position 4: cannot be T (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, Y. Also, in ""resty"", we had T at position 4 and it was absent, so T is not in the word? But wait, in the feedback for ""resty"", T is marked as absent (x). So T is not in the word at all? Similarly, Y is absent. So we can eliminate T and Y entirely.\n- Position 5: cannot be E (from first guess) and cannot be Y (absent) and cannot be C, A, N, T.\n\nSo the word has:\n  Position 2: E\n  The letters R and S must be in the word, but not at:\n      R: not at position 1 (from ""resty"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"")\n      S: not at position 3 (from ""resty"")\n\nAlso, the word does not contain: C, A, N, T, Y.\n\nWe need to find two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We know one letter (E) and two more (R and S). So we are missing two letters? But wait, R and S are two, plus E is three, so we need two more? But that would be five? Actually, the word has five letters: one of them is E (at position 2), and the other four are from the set of letters that include R and S and two others that we haven\'t found.\n\nBut we have two more letters to find? And we have to place R and S in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but with constraints.\n\nLet me denote the positions:\n  Pos1: ? (cannot be R, C, A, N, T, Y; and must be a letter we haven\'t eliminated)\n  Pos2: E (fixed)\n  Pos3: ? (cannot be S, C, A, N, T, Y)\n  Pos4: ? (cannot be T, C, A, N, Y; and T is absent so any letter except eliminated ones)\n  Pos5: ? (cannot be E, C, A, N, T, Y)\n\nAnd the word must contain R and S, which are not yet placed.\n\nAlso, note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicate so far? And we don\'t have evidence for duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? But we must be cautious.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can try to form a word.\n\nWe know R must be in one of positions 3,4,5? Because it cannot be in 1 or 2? \n  - Position 1: not allowed (from ""resty"" feedback: R at pos1 is wrong position, meaning it\'s present but not at 1, so it must be in 3,4, or 5? \n  - But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2? which we know is wrong? So R is in the word but not at 2? and now we know not at 1? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for R.\n\nSimilarly, S must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Because it cannot be at position 3? (from ""resty"" feedback: S at pos3 is present but wrong, so it must be in 1,4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is available? and 4,5? \n\nBut note: we have two letters R and S to place in the four positions? But we have two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters that are not eliminated.\n\nWe can think of the word as: [not R] [E] [not S] [any except eliminated] [any except eliminated and not E]\n\nBut we must have R and S in the word? So in the positions 1,3,4,5, we must have R and S and two other letters.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that includes R and S and two new letters? and places E at 2.\n\nWe should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, Y.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information? So we should try to cover common letters and avoid repeating positions we know are wrong.\n\nWe also know that R must be in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5? But note: if we put S at position 1? that is allowed? because we haven\'t tried S at 1? Similarly, R at 3? \n\nBut we must avoid putting R and S in positions that are already known to be wrong? We don\'t have any constraint that says R cannot be at 3? or 4? or 5? Similarly for S? \n\nSo let\'s try to form a word.\n\nWe can try to put S at position 1? Then we have:\n  S ? ? ? ?\nBut position 2 is E? So: S E ? ? ?\n\nThen we need to place R? and two other letters? \n\nBut R must be in 3,4,5? So we can put R at 3? Then: S E R ? ?\n\nBut then we have two more positions? and we need one more letter? Actually, we have two more letters? But we already have S, E, R? So we need two more? \n\nWait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:R, 4:?, 5:?\n\nBut we also know that S is in the word? and we have it at position 1? and R at 3? \n\nBut we need to choose two more letters? \n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? \n\nAlso, we have to avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nBut what if the word is ""SERUM""? \n  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Then U at 4, M at 5? \n  But we haven\'t tested U and M? \n\nBut let\'s check constraints:\n  Position 1: S -> allowed? We don\'t know if S can be at 1? We only know it cannot be at 3? So 1 is new? \n  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R cannot be at 1 or 2? 3 is new? \n  Position 4: U -> not eliminated? \n  Position 5: M -> not eliminated? \n\nBut we must check if ""SERUM"" is a word? Yes, it is.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U and M are in the word? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that tests more common letters? \n\nBut note: we have two more letters to find? So we need to test two new letters? \n\nWe can also consider: what if we put R at position 5? and S at position 4? \n\nFor example: ? E ? S R\n\nBut we need to fill position 1 and 3? \n\nExample: ""LEVER""? But has E at 4? and duplicate E? And we don\'t know if duplicate? Also, E is fixed at 2? So ""LEVER"" has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? \n\nBut we have no evidence of duplicates? So avoid? \n\nAnother: ""PERSO""? Not a word? \n\n""BERSK""? Not a word? \n\nWe need a valid word.\n\nWe can try ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? \n  This tests I and F? \n\nBut is ""SERIF"" a word? Yes.\n\nWe can also try ""SERVE"": but has V? and duplicate E? \n\nWe avoid duplicate? \n\nSo ""SERIF"" is a candidate? \n\nBut we have to consider: we know that in the word, S cannot be at 3? and we are putting it at 1? which is allowed? R at 3? which is allowed? \n\nBut what if R is not at 3? Then we get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to put S at position 4? and R at position 5? \n\nFor example: ? E ? S R\n\nWhat word? ""PESKY""? But Y is eliminated? \n\n""DESKS""? duplicate S? \n\n""JESUS""? duplicate S? and U? \n\n""FESTS""? duplicate S? \n\nWe avoid duplicates? \n\n""HELPS"": H, E, L, P, S -> S at 5? \n  But then we are not using R? We must use R? Because we know R is in the word? \n\nWe must include R? \n\nSo we cannot make a word without R? \n\nTherefore, we must include R and S? \n\nSo the word must have R and S? \n\nSo in our guess, we must include R and S? \n\nSo ""SERIF"" includes R and S? \n\nBut we have to test two new letters? \n\nAnother candidate: ""SERUM"" as above? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nWe want to maximize information? \n\nWe can also consider: we haven\'t tested O, U, L, D, etc? \n\nBut we have to choose? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to put R at position 4? and S at position 1? \n\nFor example: S E ? R ?\n\nWhat word? ""SEWER""? duplicate E? \n\n""SEPAR""? has A? eliminated? \n\n""SEPIA""? has A? \n\n""SEMIS""? duplicate S? \n\n""SEHRI""? not a word? \n\n""SEORL""? not a word? \n\n""SEGUR""? not a word? \n\nHow about ""SERGE""? S, E, R, G, E -> duplicate E? \n\nWe avoid duplicates? \n\nSo it\'s hard? \n\nTherefore, putting R at position 3 might be easier? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""SERIF"" or ""SERUM""? \n\nBut we have to avoid the eliminated letters? \n\nWe can also try ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? \n\nBut what if the word has duplicate E? We don\'t know? But we have no evidence? So we avoid? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""SERIF"": \n  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5.\n\nThis way, we test I and F? \n\nBut note: we have to consider that R might not be at position 3? Then we get feedback that R is present but not at 3? Then we know it must be at 4 or 5? \n\nSimilarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get feedback? \n\nBut we know S must be at 1,4, or 5? We are testing 1? \n\nSo that\'s good? \n\nAlternatively, we can test S at position 4? \n\nFor example: ? E ? S R\n\nBut we need a word: ""LEVSR"" not a word? \n\n""PESKY"" not? \n\n""RESID""? but R at 1? which we know is not allowed? Because R cannot be at 1? \n\nIn ""RESID"": R at 1? which we know is wrong? So we cannot use that? \n\n""DESIR"": D, E, S, I, R -> positions: \n  1: D, 2: E, 3: S, 4: I, 5: R\n\nBut we know S cannot be at position 3? Because in ""resty"", S at 3 was marked as present but wrong? So we cannot put S at 3? \n\nTherefore, ""DESIR"" is invalid? \n\n""DISER""? not a word? \n\nSo it\'s difficult to put S at 4? \n\nTherefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a reasonable guess? \n\nBut let me check: in ""SERIF"", we have:\n  Position 1: S -> we are testing if S is at 1? \n  Position 3: R -> testing if R is at 3? \n\nIf both are correct? Then we get two checks? \n\nIf not? We get feedback? \n\nAlso, we test I and F? \n\nSo that\'s good? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? I and F are not eliminated? \n\nSo I choose ""SERIF"". \n\nBut wait, what about the possibility that R is at position 5? and S at position 4? \n\nWe haven\'t tested that? But we can test in the next guess? \n\nWe have 6 tries? So we can do this? \n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""SERIF"". \n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? \n\nFor example, ""SHIRE"": S, H, I, R, E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is at position 2? So we cannot put E at 5? \n\nWe have E fixed at 2? \n\nSo we cannot use ""SHIRE"" because it has E at the end? \n\n""SHORE"": has O? and E at 5? not allowed? \n\n""SHARE"": has A? eliminated? \n\nSo ""SERIF"" seems good? \n\nAnother candidate: ""SERUM"" as I thought? \n\n""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M -> tests U and M? \n\nWhich is less common? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nI think ""SERIF"" is better? \n\nBut let me see: we haven\'t tested I? and F? \n\nWe can also consider ""SERVE"" but duplicate E? \n\nI think we should avoid duplicates? \n\nSo final decision: ""SERIF""\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""PERSO"" or something? But we have to have R and S? \n\nWe are including them? \n\nSo <guess>serif</guess> \n\nBut let me double-check the constraints for ""SERIF"":\n  Position 1: S -> allowed? We know S is present and not at 3? 1 is a new position? \n  Position 2: E -> correct and fixed? \n  Position 3: R -> allowed? We know R is present and not at 1 or 2? 3 is new? \n  Position 4: I -> not eliminated? \n  Position 5: F -> not eliminated? \n\nAnd the word ""serif"" is valid? \n\nYes? \n\nSo we go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  \n  - *Inference*: The word contains **R** and **E**, but not in positions 2 or 5.

  I: x (absent)
  F: x (absent)

This is great! We have three correct letters in the correct positions: S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3.

So the word starts with ""S E R _ _""

We also know from the feedback that I and F are absent. So we can add I and F to the eliminated letters.

Now, combining all eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, Y, I, F.

We have two positions left: position 4 and 5.

We know the word must be ""S E R ? ?""

We need to find two letters for the last two positions, and they must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and note, we have not tested any of these)

We also know from previous feedback that the word does not have duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to form a valid English word that starts with ""SER"" and ends with two letters from the above set.

Common words that start with ""SER"":
  SERUM (but U and M are available? and we haven't eliminated them? But we have to check if they are in the list? Yes, they are not eliminated)
  SERVE (but V and E? but E is already used? and we avoid duplicates? and E is at position 2, so we cannot use E again? unless the word has two E's? But we have no evidence of duplicates? So we avoid? Also, in the feedback, we never had a duplicate, so we assume no duplicates? But note: the word might have duplicates? However, we have not seen any duplicate in feedback? So we avoid for now? But let's not assume, but we can try to avoid if possible? However, we have to consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can avoid using E again? Because we already have E at position 2? So if we use E again, it would be a duplicate? And we don't know if the word has two E's? So we avoid? 

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5? and it was marked as present but wrong position? That doesn't necessarily mean there is a duplicate? It could be the same E? But we now know E is at position 2? So if we put E at position 5? it would be the same E? But we cannot because E is already at 2? So the word has only one E? 

Therefore, we avoid using E again? 

Similarly, we avoid using S and R again? 

So the last two letters must be two new letters? 

Now, common words starting with ""SER"" and two more letters? 

Possible words:
  SERUM: S,E,R,U,M -> U and M? 
  SERGE: S,E,R,G,E -> has duplicate E? and we avoid? 
  SERFS: S,E,R,F,S -> but F is eliminated? and duplicate S? 
  SEROW: S,E,R,O,W -> O and W? 
  SERAC: but C is eliminated? 
  SERAI: but I is eliminated? 
  SERAL: but A is eliminated? 
  SERED: but E again? 
  SERIF: we already tried? 
  SERIN: N eliminated? 
  SERON: N eliminated? 
  SEROW: O and W? 
  SERRA: duplicate R? and A eliminated? 
  SERRY: duplicate R? and Y eliminated? 
  SERVE: V and E? duplicate E? 
  SERVO: V and O? but then duplicate? no, only one E? but wait, ""SERVO"" has V and O? and no duplicate? because E is only once? 
  But ""SERVO"" is a word? 

But we have to avoid E? No, ""SERVO"" has S,E,R,V,O -> E is at position 2? and then V and O? So no duplicate? 

But we have E at position 2? and then V and O? So that's fine? 

But we have eliminated? V and O are not eliminated? 

So ""SERVO"" is a candidate? 

But we have two positions: 4 and 5? So ""SERVO"" would be S(1),E(2),R(3),V(4),O(5)? 

Yes? 

Similarly, ""SERUM"": S(1),E(2),R(3),U(4),M(5)

We can also consider ""SEROW"": S,E,R,O,W

We need to choose one? 

But note: we have to test letters that are common? Or we can try to cover more letters? But we only have two positions? 

We can also consider that we have two guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries? We are at guess 3? So we have 3 more? 

But we want to solve in as few as possible? 

We can try ""SERUM"" to test U and M? 

But if it's not, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two common letters? 

But we don't know? 

We can also think: we have not tested many letters? So we can try to cover two new letters? 

But we have to form a valid word? 

Let me list possible words from the remaining letters? 

We have: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Words:
  SERUM: U, M
  SERVE: V, E -> but E is duplicate? No, in ""SERVE"", the letters are S,E,R,V,E -> two E's? So duplicate? We avoid? 
  SERVO: V, O -> no duplicate? 
  SEROW: O, W
  SERGE: G, E -> duplicate E? 
  SERFS: F, S -> F eliminated and duplicate S? 
  SERED: E, D -> duplicate E? 
  SERAC: A, C -> eliminated? 
  So the only ones without duplicates and without eliminated letters are: SERUM, SERVO, SEROW, and maybe others? 

  What about ""SERAL""? A eliminated? 
  ""SERAB""? A and B? A eliminated? 
  ""SERD""? not 5 letters? 

  ""SERON""? N eliminated? 

  ""SERRA""? duplicate R and A eliminated? 

  ""SERRY""? duplicate R and Y eliminated? 

  ""SERTH""? not a word? 

  ""SERMO""? M and O? but then it would be ""SERMO""? not a word? 

  ""SERUP""? U and P? ""SERUP"" is not a word? 

  ""SERVE"" is not allowed because of duplicate E? 

  So the valid words are: SERUM, SERVO, SEROW.

  Also, ""SERKB""? not a word? 

  ""SERPG""? not a word? 

  So we have three candidates: SERUM, SERVO, SEROW.

  We can choose one? 

  But note: we have to consider that the word might be one of these? 

  We can try ""SERUM"" first? 

  Or we can try a word that is more common? 

  ""SERUM"" is a valid word? 
  ""SERVO"" is a word (a type of mechanism)? 
  ""SEROW"" is a type of animal? 

  ""SERUM"" is more common? 

  But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests letters that are more common? 

  For example, in the remaining letters, common consonants: D, G, H, L, M, P, V? 

  But we have to form a word? 

  We can try ""SERVE"" but duplicate? 

  What about ""SERED""? not a word? 

  ""SERLE""? not a word? 

  So we stick to the three candidates? 

  We can also consider ""SERON"" but N is eliminated? 

  Another: ""SERAB"" not? 

  So I think we choose ""SERUM"". 

  But note: we have two positions? and we are testing U and M? 

  If we guess ""SERUM"", and it's not the word? Then we get feedback on U and M? 

  Then we can use that to guess the next? 

  But we have two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two very common letters? Like D and L? 

  But is there a word ""SERDL""? not a word? 

  ""SERLD""? not? 

  So no? 

  Therefore, I choose ""SERUM"". 

  So the guess is ""SERUM"". 

  But let me check: 
      Position 1: S (correct, we know)
      Position 2: E (correct, we know)
      Position 3: R (correct, we know)
      Position 4: U (new, not tested)
      Position 5: M (new, not tested)

  And we avoid eliminated letters? U and M are not eliminated? 

  So <guess>serum</guess> 

  But wait, what if the word is ""SERVE""? But we avoid because of duplicate? 

  But we have no evidence of duplicate? So we avoid? 

  We'll see? 

  So we go with ""SERUM"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
- **Guess 2: RESTY** → Feedback: R (present, wrong position), E (correct position), S (present, wrong position), T (absent), Y (absent).  
- **Guess 3: SERIF** → Feedback: S (correct position), E (correct position), R (correct position), I (absent), F (absent).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - **S** at position 1 (from SERIF).  
  - **E** at position 2 (from RESTY and confirmed in SERIF).  
  - **R** at position 3 (from SERIF).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, Y, I, F.  
- **Word structure**: The word is **S E R _ _** (positions 1–3 confirmed).  
- **Unknowns**: Positions 4 and 5 require two new letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Since positions 1–3 are confirmed, focus on testing plausible letters for positions 4 and 5.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., U, M, O, D) to maximize the chance of a valid word.  
- **SERUM** is a valid 5-letter word that fits:  
  - Tests **U** (position 4) and **M** (position 5), both untested and common.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and duplicates.
