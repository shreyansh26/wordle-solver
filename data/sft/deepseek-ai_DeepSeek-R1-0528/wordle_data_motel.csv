We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we know that E must be in one of the first four positions.

 Also, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to form a new guess.

 We know the word has an E, but not at the end. So possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We also know that the word does not contain: R, A, I, S.

 We should choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants we haven't used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoid R, A, I, S.

 Example: 
   Position 1: E? -> words like EGRET, but EGRET has R and we know R is not in the word. So avoid.
   Position 2: E? -> like MELON, but we don't know if M, L, O, N are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I, S and with E in one of the first four positions.

 Possibilities:
   E in position 1: 
      E -> words: ECLAT, EPOCH, ETHER, ... but we must avoid A? Wait, A is eliminated? 
          Actually, A is eliminated (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. 
          Similarly, we cannot use R, I, S.

   So for position 1: E, then the next letters must be from the remaining alphabet without R,A,I,S.

   Example: E + [not R,A,I,S] -> E + [B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] but also we have to form a word.

   Words: 
      ETHER: has E at start and end? But we know E is in the word but not at the end? 
          Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. 
          It could be at the start? But note: the feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had E at the 5th position and it was marked as '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at the 5th. 
          So E could be at position 1? 

      However, in ETHER, the E is at position 1 and 5. But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position 5. 
      So if we guess ETHER, then if the secret word has E at position 1, then we would get a check for the first E and a minus for the last E? 
      But we are only allowed to use 5-letter words.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We want to test other common letters. Let's try to cover T, O, N, L, etc.

   A good candidate: ""TOUCH"" doesn't have E. We need E.

   Another: ""CLONE"" -> has E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E at the end in our guess, then if the secret word has E at the end, it would be a contradiction? 
        But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th position. So the secret word does not have E at the 5th. 
        Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the end in our next guess? 
        Actually, we can put E at the end to test? But if we put E at the end, then we know it will be marked as either:
            - If the secret word has E at the end? -> but we know it doesn't (because first guess E at 5th was wrong position, meaning the secret word has E but not at 5th) -> so if we put E at the end, it will be marked as 'x'? 
            But wait: the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5. 
            Therefore, if we put E at the end again, we know it will be wrong. So we can avoid that.

   So we should put E in one of the positions 1-4.

   Let's try to form a word with E in position 1, and without R,A,I,S.

   Words: 
      E + [not R,A,I,S] + ... 
      Example: 
        E + L + O + T + H -> ELOTH? not a word.
        E + L + D + E + R -> but R is eliminated and we cannot use R. Also, E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end.

   How about: ""ELECT"" -> but has E at position 1 and 3? and ends with T? 
        But ""ELECT"" is 5 letters? No, ELECT is 5: E-L-E-C-T? Wait, that's 5. But it has two E's? 
        We don't know if the word has two E's? It might. But we know at least one E.

   But we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't. However, the feedback will mark each occurrence.

   However, we are trying to maximize information. Using a word with repeated E might not be optimal because if we get a check for one E and a minus for the other, we know the position of one E and that there is another E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

   Let's try to find a word without duplicate letters, without R,A,I,S, and with E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

   Position 1: 
      E + [B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] for the next four.

   Words: 
      EBONY: E at 1, then B, O, N, Y -> no R,A,I,S. 
      EGRET: has R -> invalid.
      EPOCH: E at 1, then P, O, C, H -> no R,A,I,S.

   Position 2:
      [letter] + E + [three letters] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        MELON: M, E, L, O, N -> no R,A,I,S? M, E, L, O, N are all new.

   Position 3:
      [letter1, letter2] + E + [letter4, letter5] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        PLUME: P, L, U, M, E -> but E at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we put E at the end, we expect it to be marked as not present? 
        But wait: the secret word has an E, but not at the end. So if we put E at the end, the feedback will show that E is present (because it's in the word) but in the wrong position? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark the E at the end as '-' because it is in the word but not at the end? 
        But note: the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more? We don't know. 
        However, if we put E at the end and the secret word has only one E and that E is at a different position, then the E at the end will be marked as '-'? 
        But that would be inconsistent because the secret word has an E, but not at the end, so the E at the end in our guess would be a different occurrence? 
        Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. So if the secret word has one E and it is at position 2, then in a guess:
          if we have an E at position 2: ✓
          if we have an E at position 5: - (because the E is present but not at position 5)
        But if the secret word has two E's? Then we might get two marks.

        However, we don't know. So it's acceptable to put E at the end? But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at the end. 
        So if we put E at the end, we will get a '-' for that E? Because the secret word has an E (somewhere else) and we are putting an E at the end, which is not the correct position for that E? 
        But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which occurrence. It just marks each letter in the guess.

        Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: 
          For each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, mark it ✓.
          If the letter is in the secret word but not in the correct position, mark it -.
          If the letter is not in the secret word, mark it x.

        And if there are duplicate letters, the feedback might be tricky: 
          For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's: 
            One of them might be in the correct position -> then that one is ✓, and the other might be x? 
            Or if both are in wrong positions, then both -? 
          But the rule is: the feedback only accounts for the number of times the letter appears. 
          Specifically, if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x? 
          Or if both are in wrong positions, then one gets - and the other gets x? 

        According to the rules: 
          ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

        And the example: 
          Secret: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word (but not at position 1) so -, T not in word so x, O not in word so x, R in the word but not at position 4 (it's at position 2 in secret) so -, M not in word so x.

        For duplicates: 
          Suppose secret: STEEL, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: in secret at position 1? but in guess at position 1: ✓
            L: not in secret -> x
            E: in secret at positions 2 and 3? In guess at position 2: E is at position 2 in secret? ✓. Then the second E in guess at position 3: but the secret has two E's? The first E in the guess already matched the first E in the secret? Then the second E in the guess: 
                There is still one E left in the secret (at position 3) so if the guess has E at position 3, that would be ✓? 
            But wait, the secret has two E's: positions 2 and 3. 
            So for the guess SLEEP: 
                S: ✓ (position 1)
                L: x (not in secret)
                E: at position 2: matches secret position 2 -> ✓
                E: at position 3: matches secret position 3 -> ✓
                P: not in secret -> x

          But if the secret has only one E? 
          Secret: STEAM, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: ✓ (position 1)
            L: x
            E: at position 2: secret has E at position 3? So not at position 2 -> but E is in the secret? So we mark the first E in the guess that is not matched? 
            How it works: 
              We match the exact positions first: 
                Position 1: S matches -> ✓
                Then for the E at position 2: the secret has an E at position 3, which hasn't been matched? So we mark it as - (because E is present but not at position 2)
                Then for the E at position 3: now the secret has an E at position 3, but we already used the E for the minus? 
                Actually, the rule is: each letter in the secret can only be matched once. 
                So we first check for exact matches, then for the remaining letters, we check for presence.

              Steps:
                1. Check for exact matches: 
                    position 1: S matches -> ✓ (and we mark the S in secret as used)
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? Actually, we haven't checked yet. 
                    position 3: E -> secret has E at position 3? So ✓? But wait, we haven't used the E at position 3? 
                2. Actually, we do exact matches first: 
                    position 1: S -> ✓ (secret position 1: S)
                    position 3: E -> ✓ (secret position 3: E) -> now the secret's E at position 3 is used.
                3. Then for the remaining letters in the guess that are not matched exactly:
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? x
                    position 4: E -> now the secret has an E at position 3 but it's already matched? And there is no other E? So E at position 4: not in secret? x? 
                    But wait, the secret has only one E? So the E at position 4 in the guess is not in the secret? -> x
                    position 5: P -> x

                So feedback: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(x) P(x)

          Therefore, in our case, we know the secret word has at least one E (from the first guess) and it is not at position 5. 
          So if we put an E at the end in our second guess, then:
            If the secret word has only one E (which is not at the end), then the E at the end in our guess will be marked as x? 
            But that would be confusing because we know there is an E? 
          Actually, no: the feedback for the E at the end would be x if the secret word has no E at the end and the one E in the secret is already matched by another E in our guess? 
          Or if we don't have another E in the guess, then the E at the end would be marked as -? 

          Let me clarify: 
            Secret: has one E at position 2 (for example, ""LEMON"" but we know our secret doesn't have A, R, I, S, so let's say ""TEPID"" but TEPID has E at position 2).
            Guess: we make a word with E at the end, say ""GUESS"" but we cannot use S. Let's say ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but we are going to use a word without R,A,I,S.

          Example: secret = TEPID (but note: TEPID has I? which is eliminated -> so not allowed). 

          Let me choose a valid secret: since we don't know, let's assume the secret has one E at position 2.

          We guess: ""MELON"" (which has E at position 2) -> then we would get:
            M: not in secret? x
            E: at position 2: in secret at position 2? ✓
            L: ... 

          But if we guess a word that has E at the end and no other E, and the secret has one E at position 2, then:
            Guess: ""BLUNT"" doesn't have E. 
            Guess: ""CUPEL"" (C,U,P,E,L) -> E at position 4? 
            Secret: say ""HOTEL"" but we don't know. Actually, we know the secret has E? and not at the end? So if secret is ""HOTEL"", then E is at the end? -> but that contradicts our first feedback? 
            Because first guess ""raise"" had E at the end and got '-', meaning the secret has E but not at the end. So secret cannot be ""HOTEL"".

          So let secret be ""BREAD"" but we know R and A are eliminated -> so not. 

          Actually, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. So the secret must be composed of letters from the remaining 22 letters? and including E.

          We'll avoid the complication and not put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. We can put E in positions 1-4 and avoid the end.

   So back to choosing a word.

   I think ""EPOCH"" is a good candidate: 
        E at position 1, and P, O, C, H are new letters.

   Another candidate: ""EBONY"" (E, B, O, N, Y)

   Also, ""MELON"": M, E, L, O, N -> E at position 2.

   We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words (without R,A,I,S) are: E, T, O, N, L, C, etc.

   ""EPOCH"" has E, P, O, C, H -> not the most common? T and N are more common than P and H.

   How about ""ETHOS"": 
        E at 1, then T, H, O, S -> but S is eliminated? We cannot use S. 

   ""ELECT"": has E twice and we avoid duplicates? But it's okay. But it has L, E, C, T. 
        But we have E at 1 and 3? and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's two. 
        Also, we avoid R,A,I,S? Yes.

   But let's consider: we want to maximize information. Using two E's might not be optimal because we already know E is in the word. We want to test other letters.

   So I think ""EBONY"" or ""MELON"" or ""EPOCH"" are good.

   Another: ""OUNCE"" -> but E at the end? We want to avoid E at the end.

   How about ""OUNCE"" is not good because of E at the end.

   ""CONE"" is 4 letters. 

   ""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable (position 4 is not the end? the end is position 5). 
        So E at position 4: that's okay.

   ""NOTED"": uses N, O, T, E, D -> all common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid R,A,I,S? Yes, ""NOTED"" doesn't have them.

   So ""NOTED"" is a valid word? Yes.

   We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   Let's choose ""TONED"": 
        T, O, N, E, D -> E is at position 4.

   Why not ""NOTED""? 

   Actually, both are similar. I'll go with ""TONED"".

   But note: we are not sure if T, O, N, D are in the word. We are testing.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position to cover more ground.

   Since we know E is not at the end, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. We already tried E at position 5 (in the first guess) and it was present but wrong position.

   In ""TONED"", E is at position 4 -> which is acceptable.

   So let's guess ""TONED"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we wouldn't test position 1? 
        We are testing E at position 4. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position 4. 
        If we get a '-', then E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 3? 
        If we get an 'x'? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word? 
        But note: if the secret word has only one E and we put E at position 4, and the E is at position 1, then we would get a '-' for the E? 
        Because the E is present but not at position 4.

   So it's safe.

   Therefore, I choose ""TONED"".

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested? The first guess had E at position 5. Now we test E at position 4? 

   But we might also consider testing E at position 1? 

   Since we have many possibilities, and we want to cover more common letters, I think ""TONED"" is a good choice.

   Let me check: 
        T, O, N, E, D -> all new letters, and E at position 4.

   So we'll guess ""toned"".

   But note: the word must be valid. ""toned"" is a valid word.

   Therefore, next guess: toned.

   We'll output: <guess>toned</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (positions 1–4).
- Test new common letters (T, O, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TONED"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in position 4 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency letters T, O, N, D.
  - Avoids eliminated letters and minimizes duplication.

<guess>toned</guess>",toned,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we know that E must be in one of the first four positions.

 Also, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to form a new guess.

 We know the word has an E, but not at the end. So possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We also know that the word does not contain: R, A, I, S.

 We should choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants we haven't used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoid R, A, I, S.

 Example: 
   Position 1: E? -> words like EGRET, but EGRET has R and we know R is not in the word. So avoid.
   Position 2: E? -> like MELON, but we don't know if M, L, O, N are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I, S and with E in one of the first four positions.

 Possibilities:
   E in position 1: 
      E -> words: ECLAT, EPOCH, ETHER, ... but we must avoid A? Wait, A is eliminated? 
          Actually, A is eliminated (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. 
          Similarly, we cannot use R, I, S.

   So for position 1: E, then the next letters must be from the remaining alphabet without R,A,I,S.

   Example: E + [not R,A,I,S] -> E + [B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] but also we have to form a word.

   Words: 
      ETHER: has E at start and end? But we know E is in the word but not at the end? 
          Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. 
          It could be at the start? But note: the feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had E at the 5th position and it was marked as '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at the 5th. 
          So E could be at position 1? 

      However, in ETHER, the E is at position 1 and 5. But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position 5. 
      So if we guess ETHER, then if the secret word has E at position 1, then we would get a check for the first E and a minus for the last E? 
      But we are only allowed to use 5-letter words.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We want to test other common letters. Let's try to cover T, O, N, L, etc.

   A good candidate: ""TOUCH"" doesn't have E. We need E.

   Another: ""CLONE"" -> has E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E at the end in our guess, then if the secret word has E at the end, it would be a contradiction? 
        But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th position. So the secret word does not have E at the 5th. 
        Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the end in our next guess? 
        Actually, we can put E at the end to test? But if we put E at the end, then we know it will be marked as either:
            - If the secret word has E at the end? -> but we know it doesn't (because first guess E at 5th was wrong position, meaning the secret word has E but not at 5th) -> so if we put E at the end, it will be marked as 'x'? 
            But wait: the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5. 
            Therefore, if we put E at the end again, we know it will be wrong. So we can avoid that.

   So we should put E in one of the positions 1-4.

   Let's try to form a word with E in position 1, and without R,A,I,S.

   Words: 
      E + [not R,A,I,S] + ... 
      Example: 
        E + L + O + T + H -> ELOTH? not a word.
        E + L + D + E + R -> but R is eliminated and we cannot use R. Also, E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end.

   How about: ""ELECT"" -> but has E at position 1 and 3? and ends with T? 
        But ""ELECT"" is 5 letters? No, ELECT is 5: E-L-E-C-T? Wait, that's 5. But it has two E's? 
        We don't know if the word has two E's? It might. But we know at least one E.

   But we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't. However, the feedback will mark each occurrence.

   However, we are trying to maximize information. Using a word with repeated E might not be optimal because if we get a check for one E and a minus for the other, we know the position of one E and that there is another E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

   Let's try to find a word without duplicate letters, without R,A,I,S, and with E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

   Position 1: 
      E + [B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] for the next four.

   Words: 
      EBONY: E at 1, then B, O, N, Y -> no R,A,I,S. 
      EGRET: has R -> invalid.
      EPOCH: E at 1, then P, O, C, H -> no R,A,I,S.

   Position 2:
      [letter] + E + [three letters] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        MELON: M, E, L, O, N -> no R,A,I,S? M, E, L, O, N are all new.

   Position 3:
      [letter1, letter2] + E + [letter4, letter5] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        PLUME: P, L, U, M, E -> but E at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we put E at the end, we expect it to be marked as not present? 
        But wait: the secret word has an E, but not at the end. So if we put E at the end, the feedback will show that E is present (because it's in the word) but in the wrong position? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark the E at the end as '-' because it is in the word but not at the end? 
        But note: the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more? We don't know. 
        However, if we put E at the end and the secret word has only one E and that E is at a different position, then the E at the end will be marked as '-'? 
        But that would be inconsistent because the secret word has an E, but not at the end, so the E at the end in our guess would be a different occurrence? 
        Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. So if the secret word has one E and it is at position 2, then in a guess:
          if we have an E at position 2: ✓
          if we have an E at position 5: - (because the E is present but not at position 5)
        But if the secret word has two E's? Then we might get two marks.

        However, we don't know. So it's acceptable to put E at the end? But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at the end. 
        So if we put E at the end, we will get a '-' for that E? Because the secret word has an E (somewhere else) and we are putting an E at the end, which is not the correct position for that E? 
        But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which occurrence. It just marks each letter in the guess.

        Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: 
          For each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, mark it ✓.
          If the letter is in the secret word but not in the correct position, mark it -.
          If the letter is not in the secret word, mark it x.

        And if there are duplicate letters, the feedback might be tricky: 
          For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's: 
            One of them might be in the correct position -> then that one is ✓, and the other might be x? 
            Or if both are in wrong positions, then both -? 
          But the rule is: the feedback only accounts for the number of times the letter appears. 
          Specifically, if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x? 
          Or if both are in wrong positions, then one gets - and the other gets x? 

        According to the rules: 
          ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

        And the example: 
          Secret: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word (but not at position 1) so -, T not in word so x, O not in word so x, R in the word but not at position 4 (it's at position 2 in secret) so -, M not in word so x.

        For duplicates: 
          Suppose secret: STEEL, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: in secret at position 1? but in guess at position 1: ✓
            L: not in secret -> x
            E: in secret at positions 2 and 3? In guess at position 2: E is at position 2 in secret? ✓. Then the second E in guess at position 3: but the secret has two E's? The first E in the guess already matched the first E in the secret? Then the second E in the guess: 
                There is still one E left in the secret (at position 3) so if the guess has E at position 3, that would be ✓? 
            But wait, the secret has two E's: positions 2 and 3. 
            So for the guess SLEEP: 
                S: ✓ (position 1)
                L: x (not in secret)
                E: at position 2: matches secret position 2 -> ✓
                E: at position 3: matches secret position 3 -> ✓
                P: not in secret -> x

          But if the secret has only one E? 
          Secret: STEAM, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: ✓ (position 1)
            L: x
            E: at position 2: secret has E at position 3? So not at position 2 -> but E is in the secret? So we mark the first E in the guess that is not matched? 
            How it works: 
              We match the exact positions first: 
                Position 1: S matches -> ✓
                Then for the E at position 2: the secret has an E at position 3, which hasn't been matched? So we mark it as - (because E is present but not at position 2)
                Then for the E at position 3: now the secret has an E at position 3, but we already used the E for the minus? 
                Actually, the rule is: each letter in the secret can only be matched once. 
                So we first check for exact matches, then for the remaining letters, we check for presence.

              Steps:
                1. Check for exact matches: 
                    position 1: S matches -> ✓ (and we mark the S in secret as used)
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? Actually, we haven't checked yet. 
                    position 3: E -> secret has E at position 3? So ✓? But wait, we haven't used the E at position 3? 
                2. Actually, we do exact matches first: 
                    position 1: S -> ✓ (secret position 1: S)
                    position 3: E -> ✓ (secret position 3: E) -> now the secret's E at position 3 is used.
                3. Then for the remaining letters in the guess that are not matched exactly:
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? x
                    position 4: E -> now the secret has an E at position 3 but it's already matched? And there is no other E? So E at position 4: not in secret? x? 
                    But wait, the secret has only one E? So the E at position 4 in the guess is not in the secret? -> x
                    position 5: P -> x

                So feedback: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(x) P(x)

          Therefore, in our case, we know the secret word has at least one E (from the first guess) and it is not at position 5. 
          So if we put an E at the end in our second guess, then:
            If the secret word has only one E (which is not at the end), then the E at the end in our guess will be marked as x? 
            But that would be confusing because we know there is an E? 
          Actually, no: the feedback for the E at the end would be x if the secret word has no E at the end and the one E in the secret is already matched by another E in our guess? 
          Or if we don't have another E in the guess, then the E at the end would be marked as -? 

          Let me clarify: 
            Secret: has one E at position 2 (for example, ""LEMON"" but we know our secret doesn't have A, R, I, S, so let's say ""TEPID"" but TEPID has E at position 2).
            Guess: we make a word with E at the end, say ""GUESS"" but we cannot use S. Let's say ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but we are going to use a word without R,A,I,S.

          Example: secret = TEPID (but note: TEPID has I? which is eliminated -> so not allowed). 

          Let me choose a valid secret: since we don't know, let's assume the secret has one E at position 2.

          We guess: ""MELON"" (which has E at position 2) -> then we would get:
            M: not in secret? x
            E: at position 2: in secret at position 2? ✓
            L: ... 

          But if we guess a word that has E at the end and no other E, and the secret has one E at position 2, then:
            Guess: ""BLUNT"" doesn't have E. 
            Guess: ""CUPEL"" (C,U,P,E,L) -> E at position 4? 
            Secret: say ""HOTEL"" but we don't know. Actually, we know the secret has E? and not at the end? So if secret is ""HOTEL"", then E is at the end? -> but that contradicts our first feedback? 
            Because first guess ""raise"" had E at the end and got '-', meaning the secret has E but not at the end. So secret cannot be ""HOTEL"".

          So let secret be ""BREAD"" but we know R and A are eliminated -> so not. 

          Actually, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. So the secret must be composed of letters from the remaining 22 letters? and including E.

          We'll avoid the complication and not put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. We can put E in positions 1-4 and avoid the end.

   So back to choosing a word.

   I think ""EPOCH"" is a good candidate: 
        E at position 1, and P, O, C, H are new letters.

   Another candidate: ""EBONY"" (E, B, O, N, Y)

   Also, ""MELON"": M, E, L, O, N -> E at position 2.

   We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words (without R,A,I,S) are: E, T, O, N, L, C, etc.

   ""EPOCH"" has E, P, O, C, H -> not the most common? T and N are more common than P and H.

   How about ""ETHOS"": 
        E at 1, then T, H, O, S -> but S is eliminated? We cannot use S. 

   ""ELECT"": has E twice and we avoid duplicates? But it's okay. But it has L, E, C, T. 
        But we have E at 1 and 3? and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's two. 
        Also, we avoid R,A,I,S? Yes.

   But let's consider: we want to maximize information. Using two E's might not be optimal because we already know E is in the word. We want to test other letters.

   So I think ""EBONY"" or ""MELON"" or ""EPOCH"" are good.

   Another: ""OUNCE"" -> but E at the end? We want to avoid E at the end.

   How about ""OUNCE"" is not good because of E at the end.

   ""CONE"" is 4 letters. 

   ""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable (position 4 is not the end? the end is position 5). 
        So E at position 4: that's okay.

   ""NOTED"": uses N, O, T, E, D -> all common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid R,A,I,S? Yes, ""NOTED"" doesn't have them.

   So ""NOTED"" is a valid word? Yes.

   We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   Let's choose ""TONED"": 
        T, O, N, E, D -> E is at position 4.

   Why not ""NOTED""? 

   Actually, both are similar. I'll go with ""TONED"".

   But note: we are not sure if T, O, N, D are in the word. We are testing.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position to cover more ground.

   Since we know E is not at the end, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. We already tried E at position 5 (in the first guess) and it was present but wrong position.

   In ""TONED"", E is at position 4 -> which is acceptable.

   So let's guess ""TONED"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we wouldn't test position 1? 
        We are testing E at position 4. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position 4. 
        If we get a '-', then E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 3? 
        If we get an 'x'? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word? 
        But note: if the secret word has only one E and we put E at position 4, and the E is at position 1, then we would get a '-' for the E? 
        Because the E is present but not at position 4.

   So it's safe.

   Therefore, I choose ""TONED"".

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested? The first guess had E at position 5. Now we test E at position 4? 

   But we might also consider testing E at position 1? 

   Since we have many possibilities, and we want to cover more common letters, I think ""TONED"" is a good choice.

   Let me check: 
        T, O, N, E, D -> all new letters, and E at position 4.

   So we'll guess ""toned"".

   But note: the word must be valid. ""toned"" is a valid word.

   Therefore, next guess: toned.

   We'll output: <guess>toned</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (positions 1–4).
- Test new common letters (T, O, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TONED"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in position 4 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency letters T, O, N, D.
  - Avoids eliminated letters and minimizes duplication.",Guess 2: toned -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which covers a lot of ground.

 However, note: the feedback format requires we return the guess in a specific way.

 We'll output: <guess> raise </guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and vowels. A good starting word is ""raise"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). It often helps quickly identify or eliminate several key letters.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we know that E must be in one of the first four positions.

 Also, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to form a new guess.

 We know the word has an E, but not at the end. So possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We also know that the word does not contain: R, A, I, S.

 We should choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants we haven't used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoid R, A, I, S.

 Example: 
   Position 1: E? -> words like EGRET, but EGRET has R and we know R is not in the word. So avoid.
   Position 2: E? -> like MELON, but we don't know if M, L, O, N are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I, S and with E in one of the first four positions.

 Possibilities:
   E in position 1: 
      E -> words: ECLAT, EPOCH, ETHER, ... but we must avoid A? Wait, A is eliminated? 
          Actually, A is eliminated (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. 
          Similarly, we cannot use R, I, S.

   So for position 1: E, then the next letters must be from the remaining alphabet without R,A,I,S.

   Example: E + [not R,A,I,S] -> E + [B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] but also we have to form a word.

   Words: 
      ETHER: has E at start and end? But we know E is in the word but not at the end? 
          Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. 
          It could be at the start? But note: the feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had E at the 5th position and it was marked as '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at the 5th. 
          So E could be at position 1? 

      However, in ETHER, the E is at position 1 and 5. But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position 5. 
      So if we guess ETHER, then if the secret word has E at position 1, then we would get a check for the first E and a minus for the last E? 
      But we are only allowed to use 5-letter words.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We want to test other common letters. Let's try to cover T, O, N, L, etc.

   A good candidate: ""TOUCH"" doesn't have E. We need E.

   Another: ""CLONE"" -> has E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E at the end in our guess, then if the secret word has E at the end, it would be a contradiction? 
        But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th position. So the secret word does not have E at the 5th. 
        Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the end in our next guess? 
        Actually, we can put E at the end to test? But if we put E at the end, then we know it will be marked as either:
            - If the secret word has E at the end? -> but we know it doesn't (because first guess E at 5th was wrong position, meaning the secret word has E but not at 5th) -> so if we put E at the end, it will be marked as 'x'? 
            But wait: the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5. 
            Therefore, if we put E at the end again, we know it will be wrong. So we can avoid that.

   So we should put E in one of the positions 1-4.

   Let's try to form a word with E in position 1, and without R,A,I,S.

   Words: 
      E + [not R,A,I,S] + ... 
      Example: 
        E + L + O + T + H -> ELOTH? not a word.
        E + L + D + E + R -> but R is eliminated and we cannot use R. Also, E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end.

   How about: ""ELECT"" -> but has E at position 1 and 3? and ends with T? 
        But ""ELECT"" is 5 letters? No, ELECT is 5: E-L-E-C-T? Wait, that's 5. But it has two E's? 
        We don't know if the word has two E's? It might. But we know at least one E.

   But we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't. However, the feedback will mark each occurrence.

   However, we are trying to maximize information. Using a word with repeated E might not be optimal because if we get a check for one E and a minus for the other, we know the position of one E and that there is another E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

   Let's try to find a word without duplicate letters, without R,A,I,S, and with E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

   Position 1: 
      E + [B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] for the next four.

   Words: 
      EBONY: E at 1, then B, O, N, Y -> no R,A,I,S. 
      EGRET: has R -> invalid.
      EPOCH: E at 1, then P, O, C, H -> no R,A,I,S.

   Position 2:
      [letter] + E + [three letters] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        MELON: M, E, L, O, N -> no R,A,I,S? M, E, L, O, N are all new.

   Position 3:
      [letter1, letter2] + E + [letter4, letter5] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        PLUME: P, L, U, M, E -> but E at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we put E at the end, we expect it to be marked as not present? 
        But wait: the secret word has an E, but not at the end. So if we put E at the end, the feedback will show that E is present (because it's in the word) but in the wrong position? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark the E at the end as '-' because it is in the word but not at the end? 
        But note: the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more? We don't know. 
        However, if we put E at the end and the secret word has only one E and that E is at a different position, then the E at the end will be marked as '-'? 
        But that would be inconsistent because the secret word has an E, but not at the end, so the E at the end in our guess would be a different occurrence? 
        Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. So if the secret word has one E and it is at position 2, then in a guess:
          if we have an E at position 2: ✓
          if we have an E at position 5: - (because the E is present but not at position 5)
        But if the secret word has two E's? Then we might get two marks.

        However, we don't know. So it's acceptable to put E at the end? But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at the end. 
        So if we put E at the end, we will get a '-' for that E? Because the secret word has an E (somewhere else) and we are putting an E at the end, which is not the correct position for that E? 
        But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which occurrence. It just marks each letter in the guess.

        Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: 
          For each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, mark it ✓.
          If the letter is in the secret word but not in the correct position, mark it -.
          If the letter is not in the secret word, mark it x.

        And if there are duplicate letters, the feedback might be tricky: 
          For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's: 
            One of them might be in the correct position -> then that one is ✓, and the other might be x? 
            Or if both are in wrong positions, then both -? 
          But the rule is: the feedback only accounts for the number of times the letter appears. 
          Specifically, if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x? 
          Or if both are in wrong positions, then one gets - and the other gets x? 

        According to the rules: 
          ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

        And the example: 
          Secret: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word (but not at position 1) so -, T not in word so x, O not in word so x, R in the word but not at position 4 (it's at position 2 in secret) so -, M not in word so x.

        For duplicates: 
          Suppose secret: STEEL, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: in secret at position 1? but in guess at position 1: ✓
            L: not in secret -> x
            E: in secret at positions 2 and 3? In guess at position 2: E is at position 2 in secret? ✓. Then the second E in guess at position 3: but the secret has two E's? The first E in the guess already matched the first E in the secret? Then the second E in the guess: 
                There is still one E left in the secret (at position 3) so if the guess has E at position 3, that would be ✓? 
            But wait, the secret has two E's: positions 2 and 3. 
            So for the guess SLEEP: 
                S: ✓ (position 1)
                L: x (not in secret)
                E: at position 2: matches secret position 2 -> ✓
                E: at position 3: matches secret position 3 -> ✓
                P: not in secret -> x

          But if the secret has only one E? 
          Secret: STEAM, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: ✓ (position 1)
            L: x
            E: at position 2: secret has E at position 3? So not at position 2 -> but E is in the secret? So we mark the first E in the guess that is not matched? 
            How it works: 
              We match the exact positions first: 
                Position 1: S matches -> ✓
                Then for the E at position 2: the secret has an E at position 3, which hasn't been matched? So we mark it as - (because E is present but not at position 2)
                Then for the E at position 3: now the secret has an E at position 3, but we already used the E for the minus? 
                Actually, the rule is: each letter in the secret can only be matched once. 
                So we first check for exact matches, then for the remaining letters, we check for presence.

              Steps:
                1. Check for exact matches: 
                    position 1: S matches -> ✓ (and we mark the S in secret as used)
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? Actually, we haven't checked yet. 
                    position 3: E -> secret has E at position 3? So ✓? But wait, we haven't used the E at position 3? 
                2. Actually, we do exact matches first: 
                    position 1: S -> ✓ (secret position 1: S)
                    position 3: E -> ✓ (secret position 3: E) -> now the secret's E at position 3 is used.
                3. Then for the remaining letters in the guess that are not matched exactly:
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? x
                    position 4: E -> now the secret has an E at position 3 but it's already matched? And there is no other E? So E at position 4: not in secret? x? 
                    But wait, the secret has only one E? So the E at position 4 in the guess is not in the secret? -> x
                    position 5: P -> x

                So feedback: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(x) P(x)

          Therefore, in our case, we know the secret word has at least one E (from the first guess) and it is not at position 5. 
          So if we put an E at the end in our second guess, then:
            If the secret word has only one E (which is not at the end), then the E at the end in our guess will be marked as x? 
            But that would be confusing because we know there is an E? 
          Actually, no: the feedback for the E at the end would be x if the secret word has no E at the end and the one E in the secret is already matched by another E in our guess? 
          Or if we don't have another E in the guess, then the E at the end would be marked as -? 

          Let me clarify: 
            Secret: has one E at position 2 (for example, ""LEMON"" but we know our secret doesn't have A, R, I, S, so let's say ""TEPID"" but TEPID has E at position 2).
            Guess: we make a word with E at the end, say ""GUESS"" but we cannot use S. Let's say ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but we are going to use a word without R,A,I,S.

          Example: secret = TEPID (but note: TEPID has I? which is eliminated -> so not allowed). 

          Let me choose a valid secret: since we don't know, let's assume the secret has one E at position 2.

          We guess: ""MELON"" (which has E at position 2) -> then we would get:
            M: not in secret? x
            E: at position 2: in secret at position 2? ✓
            L: ... 

          But if we guess a word that has E at the end and no other E, and the secret has one E at position 2, then:
            Guess: ""BLUNT"" doesn't have E. 
            Guess: ""CUPEL"" (C,U,P,E,L) -> E at position 4? 
            Secret: say ""HOTEL"" but we don't know. Actually, we know the secret has E? and not at the end? So if secret is ""HOTEL"", then E is at the end? -> but that contradicts our first feedback? 
            Because first guess ""raise"" had E at the end and got '-', meaning the secret has E but not at the end. So secret cannot be ""HOTEL"".

          So let secret be ""BREAD"" but we know R and A are eliminated -> so not. 

          Actually, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. So the secret must be composed of letters from the remaining 22 letters? and including E.

          We'll avoid the complication and not put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. We can put E in positions 1-4 and avoid the end.

   So back to choosing a word.

   I think ""EPOCH"" is a good candidate: 
        E at position 1, and P, O, C, H are new letters.

   Another candidate: ""EBONY"" (E, B, O, N, Y)

   Also, ""MELON"": M, E, L, O, N -> E at position 2.

   We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words (without R,A,I,S) are: E, T, O, N, L, C, etc.

   ""EPOCH"" has E, P, O, C, H -> not the most common? T and N are more common than P and H.

   How about ""ETHOS"": 
        E at 1, then T, H, O, S -> but S is eliminated? We cannot use S. 

   ""ELECT"": has E twice and we avoid duplicates? But it's okay. But it has L, E, C, T. 
        But we have E at 1 and 3? and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's two. 
        Also, we avoid R,A,I,S? Yes.

   But let's consider: we want to maximize information. Using two E's might not be optimal because we already know E is in the word. We want to test other letters.

   So I think ""EBONY"" or ""MELON"" or ""EPOCH"" are good.

   Another: ""OUNCE"" -> but E at the end? We want to avoid E at the end.

   How about ""OUNCE"" is not good because of E at the end.

   ""CONE"" is 4 letters. 

   ""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable (position 4 is not the end? the end is position 5). 
        So E at position 4: that's okay.

   ""NOTED"": uses N, O, T, E, D -> all common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid R,A,I,S? Yes, ""NOTED"" doesn't have them.

   So ""NOTED"" is a valid word? Yes.

   We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   Let's choose ""TONED"": 
        T, O, N, E, D -> E is at position 4.

   Why not ""NOTED""? 

   Actually, both are similar. I'll go with ""TONED"".

   But note: we are not sure if T, O, N, D are in the word. We are testing.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position to cover more ground.

   Since we know E is not at the end, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. We already tried E at position 5 (in the first guess) and it was present but wrong position.

   In ""TONED"", E is at position 4 -> which is acceptable.

   So let's guess ""TONED"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we wouldn't test position 1? 
        We are testing E at position 4. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position 4. 
        If we get a '-', then E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 3? 
        If we get an 'x'? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word? 
        But note: if the secret word has only one E and we put E at position 4, and the E is at position 1, then we would get a '-' for the E? 
        Because the E is present but not at position 4.

   So it's safe.

   Therefore, I choose ""TONED"".

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested? The first guess had E at position 5. Now we test E at position 4? 

   But we might also consider testing E at position 1? 

   Since we have many possibilities, and we want to cover more common letters, I think ""TONED"" is a good choice.

   Let me check: 
        T, O, N, E, D -> all new letters, and E at position 4.

   So we'll guess ""toned"".

   But note: the word must be valid. ""toned"" is a valid word.

   Therefore, next guess: toned.

   We'll output: <guess>toned</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (positions 1–4).
- Test new common letters (T, O, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TONED"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in position 4 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency letters T, O, N, D.
  - Avoids eliminated letters and minimizes duplication.

So possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\n We also know that the word does not contain: R, A, I, S.\n\n We should choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoid R, A, I, S.\n\n Example: \n   Position 1: E? -> words like EGRET, but EGRET has R and we know R is not in the word. So avoid.\n   Position 2: E? -> like MELON, but we don\'t know if M, L, O, N are in the word? But we can try.\n\n However, we must avoid R, A, I, S.\n\n Let\'s list some words without R, A, I, S and with E in one of the first four positions.\n\n Possibilities:\n   E in position 1: \n      E -> words: ECLAT, EPOCH, ETHER, ... but we must avoid A? Wait, A is eliminated? \n          Actually, A is eliminated (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. \n          Similarly, we cannot use R, I, S.\n\n   So for position 1: E, then the next letters must be from the remaining alphabet without R,A,I,S.\n\n   Example: E + [not R,A,I,S] -> E + [B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] but also we have to form a word.\n\n   Words: \n      ETHER: has E at start and end? But we know E is in the word but not at the end? \n          Actually, the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. \n          It could be at the start? But note: the feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had E at the 5th position and it was marked as \'-\' meaning that E is in the word but not at the 5th. \n          So E could be at position 1? \n\n      However, in ETHER, the E is at position 1 and 5. But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position 5. \n      So if we guess ETHER, then if the secret word has E at position 1, then we would get a check for the first E and a minus for the last E? \n      But we are only allowed to use 5-letter words.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position.\n\n   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   We want to test other common letters. Let\'s try to cover T, O, N, L, etc.\n\n   A good candidate: ""TOUCH"" doesn\'t have E. We need E.\n\n   Another: ""CLONE"" -> has E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? \n        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E at the end in our guess, then if the secret word has E at the end, it would be a contradiction? \n        But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th position. So the secret word does not have E at the 5th. \n        Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the end in our next guess? \n        Actually, we can put E at the end to test? But if we put E at the end, then we know it will be marked as either:\n            - If the secret word has E at the end? -> but we know it doesn\'t (because first guess E at 5th was wrong position, meaning the secret word has E but not at 5th) -> so if we put E at the end, it will be marked as \'x\'? \n            But wait: the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5. \n            Therefore, if we put E at the end again, we know it will be wrong. So we can avoid that.\n\n   So we should put E in one of the positions 1-4.\n\n   Let\'s try to form a word with E in position 1, and without R,A,I,S.\n\n   Words: \n      E + [not R,A,I,S] + ... \n      Example: \n        E + L + O + T + H -> ELOTH? not a word.\n        E + L + D + E + R -> but R is eliminated and we cannot use R. Also, E at the end? We don\'t want to put E at the end.\n\n   How about: ""ELECT"" -> but has E at position 1 and 3? and ends with T? \n        But ""ELECT"" is 5 letters? No, ELECT is 5: E-L-E-C-T? Wait, that\'s 5. But it has two E\'s? \n        We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? It might. But we know at least one E.\n\n   But we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? The rules don\'t say we can\'t. However, the feedback will mark each occurrence.\n\n   However, we are trying to maximize information. Using a word with repeated E might not be optimal because if we get a check for one E and a minus for the other, we know the position of one E and that there is another E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to cover more letters.\n\n   Let\'s try to find a word without duplicate letters, without R,A,I,S, and with E in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n   Position 1: \n      E + [B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] for the next four.\n\n   Words: \n      EBONY: E at 1, then B, O, N, Y -> no R,A,I,S. \n      EGRET: has R -> invalid.\n      EPOCH: E at 1, then P, O, C, H -> no R,A,I,S.\n\n   Position 2:\n      [letter] + E + [three letters] without R,A,I,S.\n\n      Example: \n        MELON: M, E, L, O, N -> no R,A,I,S? M, E, L, O, N are all new.\n\n   Position 3:\n      [letter1, letter2] + E + [letter4, letter5] without R,A,I,S.\n\n      Example: \n        PLUME: P, L, U, M, E -> but E at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we put E at the end, we expect it to be marked as not present? \n        But wait: the secret word has an E, but not at the end. So if we put E at the end, the feedback will show that E is present (because it\'s in the word) but in the wrong position? \n        Actually, the feedback will mark the E at the end as \'-\' because it is in the word but not at the end? \n        But note: the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more? We don\'t know. \n        However, if we put E at the end and the secret word has only one E and that E is at a different position, then the E at the end will be marked as \'-\'? \n        But that would be inconsistent because the secret word has an E, but not at the end, so the E at the end in our guess would be a different occurrence? \n        Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. So if the secret word has one E and it is at position 2, then in a guess:\n          if we have an E at position 2: ✓\n          if we have an E at position 5: - (because the E is present but not at position 5)\n        But if the secret word has two E\'s? Then we might get two marks.\n\n        However, we don\'t know. So it\'s acceptable to put E at the end? But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at the end. \n        So if we put E at the end, we will get a \'-\' for that E? Because the secret word has an E (somewhere else) and we are putting an E at the end, which is not the correct position for that E? \n        But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us which occurrence. It just marks each letter in the guess.\n\n        Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: \n          For each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, mark it ✓.\n          If the letter is in the secret word but not in the correct position, mark it -.\n          If the letter is not in the secret word, mark it x.\n\n        And if there are duplicate letters, the feedback might be tricky: \n          For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E\'s: \n            One of them might be in the correct position -> then that one is ✓, and the other might be x? \n            Or if both are in wrong positions, then both -? \n          But the rule is: the feedback only accounts for the number of times the letter appears. \n          Specifically, if the secret word has one E, and we have two E\'s in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x? \n          Or if both are in wrong positions, then one gets - and the other gets x? \n\n        According to the rules: \n          ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""\n\n        And the example: \n          Secret: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word (but not at position 1) so -, T not in word so x, O not in word so x, R in the word but not at position 4 (it\'s at position 2 in secret) so -, M not in word so x.\n\n        For duplicates: \n          Suppose secret: STEEL, guess: SLEEP -> \n            S: in secret at position 1? but in guess at position 1: ✓\n            L: not in secret -> x\n            E: in secret at positions 2 and 3? In guess at position 2: E is at position 2 in secret? ✓. Then the second E in guess at position 3: but the secret has two E\'s? The first E in the guess already matched the first E in the secret? Then the second E in the guess: \n                There is still one E left in the secret (at position 3) so if the guess has E at position 3, that would be ✓? \n            But wait, the secret has two E\'s: positions 2 and 3. \n            So for the guess SLEEP: \n                S: ✓ (position 1)\n                L: x (not in secret)\n                E: at position 2: matches secret position 2 -> ✓\n                E: at position 3: matches secret position 3 -> ✓\n                P: not in secret -> x\n\n          But if the secret has only one E? \n          Secret: STEAM, guess: SLEEP -> \n            S: ✓ (position 1)\n            L: x\n            E: at position 2: secret has E at position 3? So not at position 2 -> but E is in the secret? So we mark the first E in the guess that is not matched? \n            How it works: \n              We match the exact positions first: \n                Position 1: S matches -> ✓\n                Then for the E at position 2: the secret has an E at position 3, which hasn\'t been matched? So we mark it as - (because E is present but not at position 2)\n                Then for the E at position 3: now the secret has an E at position 3, but we already used the E for the minus? \n                Actually, the rule is: each letter in the secret can only be matched once. \n                So we first check for exact matches, then for the remaining letters, we check for presence.\n\n              Steps:\n                1. Check for exact matches: \n                    position 1: S matches -> ✓ (and we mark the S in secret as used)\n                    position 2: L -> not in secret? Actually, we haven\'t checked yet. \n                    position 3: E -> secret has E at position 3? So ✓? But wait, we haven\'t used the E at position 3? \n                2. Actually, we do exact matches first: \n                    position 1: S -> ✓ (secret position 1: S)\n                    position 3: E -> ✓ (secret position 3: E) -> now the secret\'s E at position 3 is used.\n                3. Then for the remaining letters in the guess that are not matched exactly:\n                    position 2: L -> not in secret? x\n                    position 4: E -> now the secret has an E at position 3 but it\'s already matched? And there is no other E? So E at position 4: not in secret? x? \n                    But wait, the secret has only one E? So the E at position 4 in the guess is not in the secret? -> x\n                    position 5: P -> x\n\n                So feedback: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(x) P(x)\n\n          Therefore, in our case, we know the secret word has at least one E (from the first guess) and it is not at position 5. \n          So if we put an E at the end in our second guess, then:\n            If the secret word has only one E (which is not at the end), then the E at the end in our guess will be marked as x? \n            But that would be confusing because we know there is an E? \n          Actually, no: the feedback for the E at the end would be x if the secret word has no E at the end and the one E in the secret is already matched by another E in our guess? \n          Or if we don\'t have another E in the guess, then the E at the end would be marked as -? \n\n          Let me clarify: \n            Secret: has one E at position 2 (for example, ""LEMON"" but we know our secret doesn\'t have A, R, I, S, so let\'s say ""TEPID"" but TEPID has E at position 2).\n            Guess: we make a word with E at the end, say ""GUESS"" but we cannot use S. Let\'s say ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but we are going to use a word without R,A,I,S.\n\n          Example: secret = TEPID (but note: TEPID has I? which is eliminated -> so not allowed). \n\n          Let me choose a valid secret: since we don\'t know, let\'s assume the secret has one E at position 2.\n\n          We guess: ""MELON"" (which has E at position 2) -> then we would get:\n            M: not in secret? x\n            E: at position 2: in secret at position 2? ✓\n            L: ... \n\n          But if we guess a word that has E at the end and no other E, and the secret has one E at position 2, then:\n            Guess: ""BLUNT"" doesn\'t have E. \n            Guess: ""CUPEL"" (C,U,P,E,L) -> E at position 4? \n            Secret: say ""HOTEL"" but we don\'t know. Actually, we know the secret has E? and not at the end? So if secret is ""HOTEL"", then E is at the end? -> but that contradicts our first feedback? \n            Because first guess ""raise"" had E at the end and got \'-\', meaning the secret has E but not at the end. So secret cannot be ""HOTEL"".\n\n          So let secret be ""BREAD"" but we know R and A are eliminated -> so not. \n\n          Actually, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. So the secret must be composed of letters from the remaining 22 letters? and including E.\n\n          We\'ll avoid the complication and not put E at the end because we know it\'s not at the end. We can put E in positions 1-4 and avoid the end.\n\n   So back to choosing a word.\n\n   I think ""EPOCH"" is a good candidate: \n        E at position 1, and P, O, C, H are new letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""EBONY"" (E, B, O, N, Y)\n\n   Also, ""MELON"": M, E, L, O, N -> E at position 2.\n\n   We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words (without R,A,I,S) are: E, T, O, N, L, C, etc.\n\n   ""EPOCH"" has E, P, O, C, H -> not the most common? T and N are more common than P and H.\n\n   How about ""ETHOS"": \n        E at 1, then T, H, O, S -> but S is eliminated? We cannot use S. \n\n   ""ELECT"": has E twice and we avoid duplicates? But it\'s okay. But it has L, E, C, T. \n        But we have E at 1 and 3? and we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s two. \n        Also, we avoid R,A,I,S? Yes.\n\n   But let\'s consider: we want to maximize information. Using two E\'s might not be optimal because we already know E is in the word. We want to test other letters.\n\n   So I think ""EBONY"" or ""MELON"" or ""EPOCH"" are good.\n\n   Another: ""OUNCE"" -> but E at the end? We want to avoid E at the end.\n\n   How about ""OUNCE"" is not good because of E at the end.\n\n   ""CONE"" is 4 letters. \n\n   ""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s acceptable (position 4 is not the end? the end is position 5). \n        So E at position 4: that\'s okay.\n\n   ""NOTED"": uses N, O, T, E, D -> all common letters.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid R,A,I,S? Yes, ""NOTED"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n   So ""NOTED"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n   We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D.\n\n   Both are valid.\n\n   Let\'s choose ""TONED"": \n        T, O, N, E, D -> E is at position 4.\n\n   Why not ""NOTED""? \n\n   Actually, both are similar. I\'ll go with ""TONED"".\n\n   But note: we are not sure if T, O, N, D are in the word. We are testing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position to cover more ground.\n\n   Since we know E is not at the end, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. We already tried E at position 5 (in the first guess) and it was present but wrong position.\n\n   In ""TONED"", E is at position 4 -> which is acceptable.\n\n   So let\'s guess ""TONED"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we wouldn\'t test position 1? \n        We are testing E at position 4. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position 4. \n        If we get a \'-\', then E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 3? \n        If we get an \'x\'? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word? \n        But note: if the secret word has only one E and we put E at position 4, and the E is at position 1, then we would get a \'-\' for the E? \n        Because the E is present but not at position 4.\n\n   So it\'s safe.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TONED"".\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tested? The first guess had E at position 5. Now we test E at position 4? \n\n   But we might also consider testing E at position 1? \n\n   Since we have many possibilities, and we want to cover more common letters, I think ""TONED"" is a good choice.\n\n   Let me check: \n        T, O, N, E, D -> all new letters, and E at position 4.\n\n   So we\'ll guess ""toned"".\n\n   But note: the word must be valid. ""toned"" is a valid word.\n\n   Therefore, next guess: toned.\n\n   We\'ll output: <guess>toned</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid R, A, I, S entirely.\n- Include E in a position other than 5th (positions 1–4).\n- Test new common letters (T, O, N, D) to gather more information.\n- ""TONED"" is chosen because:\n  - Contains E in position 4 (testing a new position).\n  - Uses high-frequency letters T, O, N, D.\n  - Avoids eliminated letters and minimizes duplication.\n\n<guess>toned</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: toned -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""toned""
  T: - (in word, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (in word and at position 2)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (in word and at position 4)
  D: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word contains: E, O, and T (but T is not at position 1).
2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, N, D.
3. E is at position 4 (because in ""toned"", E is at position 4 and got a check).
4. O is at position 2 (because in ""toned"", O is at position 2 and got a check).

Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with E being at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the following known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E

And we know T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""toned"" feedback: T at position 1 got '-', meaning T is present but not at 1).

The word structure so far: _ O _ E _

We know the word must have a T in it, but not at position 1, so T must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, we have eliminated: R, A, I, S, N, D.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has O at position 2
- Has E at position 4
- Includes T (but not at position 1, so at 3 or 5)
- Avoids R, A, I, S, N, D
- And we want to test other letters to fill in the blanks.

The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: cannot be T (because T is not at 1) and cannot be any eliminated letter. So available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Position 3: can be T (if T is at 3) or another letter. But note: if T is at 3, then we get a check. If not, we test a new letter.

Position 5: can be T (if T is at 5) or another letter.

We want to maximize information. We can try to cover common letters that haven't been tested.

Letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, C, U, M, P, etc.

We can form a word that has O at 2, E at 4, and then for positions 1, 3, and 5, use new letters.

But note: we must include T? Actually, we don't have to include T in this guess because we already know T is in the word, but we don't know its position. We can try to find the position of T by putting it in position 3 or 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid T in this guess and test three new letters? But that might not be efficient because we know T is in the word and we need to find where.

So let's try to include T in either position 3 or 5.

Option 1: Put T at position 3: then the word would be _ O T E _
Option 2: Put T at position 5: then the word would be _ O _ E T

We can choose one and then test the other positions.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's look for words that fit the pattern and include T at 3 or 5.

First, pattern: _ O T E _

Possible words: 
  COTED? Not a common word.
  DOTED? But D is eliminated.
  HOTEL? But H at 1, O at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> but we have eliminated D? D is eliminated, but L is not. However, we don't know about L. But ""HOTEL"" has no eliminated letters? 
      Eliminated: R,A,I,S,N,D -> so D is eliminated, but L is not. So ""HOTEL"" is acceptable? 
      But note: we have E at 4 and O at 2, and T at 3. 
      However, we don't know if T is at 3? We are assuming.

But ""HOTEL"" is a valid word.

Second pattern: _ O _ E T

Possible words:
  COMET: C O M E T -> but M is not eliminated, and T at 5. 
  COVET: C O V E T
  ROWET? Not a word.
  POWET? Not a word.
  HOWET? Not a word.

But note: we must avoid R,A,I,S,N,D.

""COMET"": C, O, M, E, T -> positions: C at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, T at 5. This fits the pattern and avoids eliminated letters.

""COVET"": C, O, V, E, T -> also fits.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and get information.

In ""HOTEL"": we test H, O, T, E, L -> but O and E are already known. So we are testing H, T, and L.

In ""COMET"": we test C, O, M, E, T -> O and E known, so testing C, M, T.

We know T is in the word, so we are going to get information about T's position.

But we also want to test new letters that might be in the word.

We have two good candidates: ""HOTEL"" and ""COMET"".

Let's see the frequency of the new letters.

H, L vs C, M.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think about the position of T.

We have two possibilities for T: position 3 or 5.

If we choose ""HOTEL"", we are putting T at position 3. Then:
  If T is actually at position 3, we get a check for T and we know T is at 3, and then we have H and L to test.
  If T is not at 3, then we get a minus for T (because T is in the word but not at 3) and then we know T must be at 5.

Similarly, if we choose ""COMET"", we are putting T at position 5. Then:
  If T is at 5, we get a check and we know T is at 5.
  If not, then T must be at 3.

So both are valid.

But note: in ""HOTEL"", we are also testing L at position 5. If T is at 5, then L would be wrong? But we don't know.

I think both are equally good. Let's choose ""HOTEL"" because it's a common word.

But wait: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""HOTEL"" is valid.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't include T? But that might not be efficient because we are not using the known information about T.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in the position we think is most likely? But we don't have data.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" to test T at position 3.

So the guess: ""HOTEL""

But let's check the pattern: 
  Position 1: H (unknown)
  Position 2: O (known, so we expect a check)
  Position 3: T (we are testing if T is here)
  Position 4: E (known, so we expect a check)
  Position 5: L (unknown)

We expect O and E to be checks, and then we get feedback on H, T, and L.

If T is at position 3, we get a check for T and then we know the word is H O T E L? 
  But then we have to check if H and L are correct? 
  Actually, if we get all checks, we win.

But if not, we get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the known positions? But we have to have O at 2 and E at 4.

I think ""HOTEL"" is a good guess.

So we'll go with that.

But note: we have eliminated N and D, and ""HOTEL"" doesn't have them.

Therefore, next guess: hotel

We output: <guess>hotel</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated letters**: R, A, I, S, N, D (not in the word).
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - O is in position 2 (✓ from ""toned"").
  - E is in position 4 (✓ from ""toned"").
- **Partially known**: 
  - T is in the word but not in position 1 (- from ""toned""), so it must be in position 3 or 5.

The secret word pattern is: `_ O _ E _`  
- Position 1: Cannot be T or eliminated letters. Must be a new letter (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).
- Position 3: Could be T or a new letter.
- Position 5: Could be T (if not in position 3) or a new letter.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test the position of T by placing it in position 3 (since position 5 is riskier if T is actually in position 3).
- Use new high-frequency letters (H, L) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.
- **Guess ""HOTEL""**:
  - H at position 1 (tests a new letter).
  - O at position 2 (known, expected ✓).
  - T at position 3 (tests if T is here).
  - E at position 4 (known, expected ✓).
  - L at position 5 (tests a new letter).

This guess efficiently narrows down T's position while testing two new letters (H, L). If T is in position 3, we get immediate confirmation. If not, T must be in position 5.

<guess>hotel</guess>",hotel,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""toned""
  T: - (in word, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (in word and at position 2)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (in word and at position 4)
  D: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word contains: E, O, and T (but T is not at position 1).
2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, N, D.
3. E is at position 4 (because in ""toned"", E is at position 4 and got a check).
4. O is at position 2 (because in ""toned"", O is at position 2 and got a check).

Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with E being at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the following known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E

And we know T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""toned"" feedback: T at position 1 got '-', meaning T is present but not at 1).

The word structure so far: _ O _ E _

We know the word must have a T in it, but not at position 1, so T must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, we have eliminated: R, A, I, S, N, D.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has O at position 2
- Has E at position 4
- Includes T (but not at position 1, so at 3 or 5)
- Avoids R, A, I, S, N, D
- And we want to test other letters to fill in the blanks.

The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: cannot be T (because T is not at 1) and cannot be any eliminated letter. So available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Position 3: can be T (if T is at 3) or another letter. But note: if T is at 3, then we get a check. If not, we test a new letter.

Position 5: can be T (if T is at 5) or another letter.

We want to maximize information. We can try to cover common letters that haven't been tested.

Letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, C, U, M, P, etc.

We can form a word that has O at 2, E at 4, and then for positions 1, 3, and 5, use new letters.

But note: we must include T? Actually, we don't have to include T in this guess because we already know T is in the word, but we don't know its position. We can try to find the position of T by putting it in position 3 or 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid T in this guess and test three new letters? But that might not be efficient because we know T is in the word and we need to find where.

So let's try to include T in either position 3 or 5.

Option 1: Put T at position 3: then the word would be _ O T E _
Option 2: Put T at position 5: then the word would be _ O _ E T

We can choose one and then test the other positions.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's look for words that fit the pattern and include T at 3 or 5.

First, pattern: _ O T E _

Possible words: 
  COTED? Not a common word.
  DOTED? But D is eliminated.
  HOTEL? But H at 1, O at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> but we have eliminated D? D is eliminated, but L is not. However, we don't know about L. But ""HOTEL"" has no eliminated letters? 
      Eliminated: R,A,I,S,N,D -> so D is eliminated, but L is not. So ""HOTEL"" is acceptable? 
      But note: we have E at 4 and O at 2, and T at 3. 
      However, we don't know if T is at 3? We are assuming.

But ""HOTEL"" is a valid word.

Second pattern: _ O _ E T

Possible words:
  COMET: C O M E T -> but M is not eliminated, and T at 5. 
  COVET: C O V E T
  ROWET? Not a word.
  POWET? Not a word.
  HOWET? Not a word.

But note: we must avoid R,A,I,S,N,D.

""COMET"": C, O, M, E, T -> positions: C at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, T at 5. This fits the pattern and avoids eliminated letters.

""COVET"": C, O, V, E, T -> also fits.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and get information.

In ""HOTEL"": we test H, O, T, E, L -> but O and E are already known. So we are testing H, T, and L.

In ""COMET"": we test C, O, M, E, T -> O and E known, so testing C, M, T.

We know T is in the word, so we are going to get information about T's position.

But we also want to test new letters that might be in the word.

We have two good candidates: ""HOTEL"" and ""COMET"".

Let's see the frequency of the new letters.

H, L vs C, M.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think about the position of T.

We have two possibilities for T: position 3 or 5.

If we choose ""HOTEL"", we are putting T at position 3. Then:
  If T is actually at position 3, we get a check for T and we know T is at 3, and then we have H and L to test.
  If T is not at 3, then we get a minus for T (because T is in the word but not at 3) and then we know T must be at 5.

Similarly, if we choose ""COMET"", we are putting T at position 5. Then:
  If T is at 5, we get a check and we know T is at 5.
  If not, then T must be at 3.

So both are valid.

But note: in ""HOTEL"", we are also testing L at position 5. If T is at 5, then L would be wrong? But we don't know.

I think both are equally good. Let's choose ""HOTEL"" because it's a common word.

But wait: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""HOTEL"" is valid.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't include T? But that might not be efficient because we are not using the known information about T.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in the position we think is most likely? But we don't have data.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" to test T at position 3.

So the guess: ""HOTEL""

But let's check the pattern: 
  Position 1: H (unknown)
  Position 2: O (known, so we expect a check)
  Position 3: T (we are testing if T is here)
  Position 4: E (known, so we expect a check)
  Position 5: L (unknown)

We expect O and E to be checks, and then we get feedback on H, T, and L.

If T is at position 3, we get a check for T and then we know the word is H O T E L? 
  But then we have to check if H and L are correct? 
  Actually, if we get all checks, we win.

But if not, we get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the known positions? But we have to have O at 2 and E at 4.

I think ""HOTEL"" is a good guess.

So we'll go with that.

But note: we have eliminated N and D, and ""HOTEL"" doesn't have them.

Therefore, next guess: hotel

We output: <guess>hotel</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated letters**: R, A, I, S, N, D (not in the word).
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - O is in position 2 (✓ from ""toned"").
  - E is in position 4 (✓ from ""toned"").
- **Partially known**: 
  - T is in the word but not in position 1 (- from ""toned""), so it must be in position 3 or 5.

The secret word pattern is: `_ O _ E _`  
- Position 1: Cannot be T or eliminated letters. Must be a new letter (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).
- Position 3: Could be T or a new letter.
- Position 5: Could be T (if not in position 3) or a new letter.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test the position of T by placing it in position 3 (since position 5 is riskier if T is actually in position 3).
- Use new high-frequency letters (H, L) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.
- **Guess ""HOTEL""**:
  - H at position 1 (tests a new letter).
  - O at position 2 (known, expected ✓).
  - T at position 3 (tests if T is here).
  - E at position 4 (known, expected ✓).
  - L at position 5 (tests a new letter).

This guess efficiently narrows down T's position while testing two new letters (H, L). If T is in position 3, we get immediate confirmation. If not, T must be in position 5.",Guess 3: hotel -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(✓) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,motel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which covers a lot of ground.

 However, note: the feedback format requires we return the guess in a specific way.

 We'll output: <guess> raise </guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and vowels. A good starting word is ""raise"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two of the most frequent consonants (R, S). It often helps quickly identify or eliminate several key letters.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we know that E must be in one of the first four positions.

 Also, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to form a new guess.

 We know the word has an E, but not at the end. So possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We also know that the word does not contain: R, A, I, S.

 We should choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants we haven't used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoid R, A, I, S.

 Example: 
   Position 1: E? -> words like EGRET, but EGRET has R and we know R is not in the word. So avoid.
   Position 2: E? -> like MELON, but we don't know if M, L, O, N are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I, S and with E in one of the first four positions.

 Possibilities:
   E in position 1: 
      E -> words: ECLAT, EPOCH, ETHER, ... but we must avoid A? Wait, A is eliminated? 
          Actually, A is eliminated (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. 
          Similarly, we cannot use R, I, S.

   So for position 1: E, then the next letters must be from the remaining alphabet without R,A,I,S.

   Example: E + [not R,A,I,S] -> E + [B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] but also we have to form a word.

   Words: 
      ETHER: has E at start and end? But we know E is in the word but not at the end? 
          Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position. 
          It could be at the start? But note: the feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had E at the 5th position and it was marked as '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at the 5th. 
          So E could be at position 1? 

      However, in ETHER, the E is at position 1 and 5. But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position 5. 
      So if we guess ETHER, then if the secret word has E at position 1, then we would get a check for the first E and a minus for the last E? 
      But we are only allowed to use 5-letter words.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We want to test other common letters. Let's try to cover T, O, N, L, etc.

   A good candidate: ""TOUCH"" doesn't have E. We need E.

   Another: ""CLONE"" -> has E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E at the end in our guess, then if the secret word has E at the end, it would be a contradiction? 
        But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th position. So the secret word does not have E at the 5th. 
        Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the end in our next guess? 
        Actually, we can put E at the end to test? But if we put E at the end, then we know it will be marked as either:
            - If the secret word has E at the end? -> but we know it doesn't (because first guess E at 5th was wrong position, meaning the secret word has E but not at 5th) -> so if we put E at the end, it will be marked as 'x'? 
            But wait: the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5. 
            Therefore, if we put E at the end again, we know it will be wrong. So we can avoid that.

   So we should put E in one of the positions 1-4.

   Let's try to form a word with E in position 1, and without R,A,I,S.

   Words: 
      E + [not R,A,I,S] + ... 
      Example: 
        E + L + O + T + H -> ELOTH? not a word.
        E + L + D + E + R -> but R is eliminated and we cannot use R. Also, E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end.

   How about: ""ELECT"" -> but has E at position 1 and 3? and ends with T? 
        But ""ELECT"" is 5 letters? No, ELECT is 5: E-L-E-C-T? Wait, that's 5. But it has two E's? 
        We don't know if the word has two E's? It might. But we know at least one E.

   But we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't. However, the feedback will mark each occurrence.

   However, we are trying to maximize information. Using a word with repeated E might not be optimal because if we get a check for one E and a minus for the other, we know the position of one E and that there is another E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

   Let's try to find a word without duplicate letters, without R,A,I,S, and with E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

   Position 1: 
      E + [B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] for the next four.

   Words: 
      EBONY: E at 1, then B, O, N, Y -> no R,A,I,S. 
      EGRET: has R -> invalid.
      EPOCH: E at 1, then P, O, C, H -> no R,A,I,S.

   Position 2:
      [letter] + E + [three letters] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        MELON: M, E, L, O, N -> no R,A,I,S? M, E, L, O, N are all new.

   Position 3:
      [letter1, letter2] + E + [letter4, letter5] without R,A,I,S.

      Example: 
        PLUME: P, L, U, M, E -> but E at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we put E at the end, we expect it to be marked as not present? 
        But wait: the secret word has an E, but not at the end. So if we put E at the end, the feedback will show that E is present (because it's in the word) but in the wrong position? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark the E at the end as '-' because it is in the word but not at the end? 
        But note: the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more? We don't know. 
        However, if we put E at the end and the secret word has only one E and that E is at a different position, then the E at the end will be marked as '-'? 
        But that would be inconsistent because the secret word has an E, but not at the end, so the E at the end in our guess would be a different occurrence? 
        Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. So if the secret word has one E and it is at position 2, then in a guess:
          if we have an E at position 2: ✓
          if we have an E at position 5: - (because the E is present but not at position 5)
        But if the secret word has two E's? Then we might get two marks.

        However, we don't know. So it's acceptable to put E at the end? But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at the end. 
        So if we put E at the end, we will get a '-' for that E? Because the secret word has an E (somewhere else) and we are putting an E at the end, which is not the correct position for that E? 
        But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which occurrence. It just marks each letter in the guess.

        Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: 
          For each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, mark it ✓.
          If the letter is in the secret word but not in the correct position, mark it -.
          If the letter is not in the secret word, mark it x.

        And if there are duplicate letters, the feedback might be tricky: 
          For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's: 
            One of them might be in the correct position -> then that one is ✓, and the other might be x? 
            Or if both are in wrong positions, then both -? 
          But the rule is: the feedback only accounts for the number of times the letter appears. 
          Specifically, if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x? 
          Or if both are in wrong positions, then one gets - and the other gets x? 

        According to the rules: 
          ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

        And the example: 
          Secret: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word (but not at position 1) so -, T not in word so x, O not in word so x, R in the word but not at position 4 (it's at position 2 in secret) so -, M not in word so x.

        For duplicates: 
          Suppose secret: STEEL, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: in secret at position 1? but in guess at position 1: ✓
            L: not in secret -> x
            E: in secret at positions 2 and 3? In guess at position 2: E is at position 2 in secret? ✓. Then the second E in guess at position 3: but the secret has two E's? The first E in the guess already matched the first E in the secret? Then the second E in the guess: 
                There is still one E left in the secret (at position 3) so if the guess has E at position 3, that would be ✓? 
            But wait, the secret has two E's: positions 2 and 3. 
            So for the guess SLEEP: 
                S: ✓ (position 1)
                L: x (not in secret)
                E: at position 2: matches secret position 2 -> ✓
                E: at position 3: matches secret position 3 -> ✓
                P: not in secret -> x

          But if the secret has only one E? 
          Secret: STEAM, guess: SLEEP -> 
            S: ✓ (position 1)
            L: x
            E: at position 2: secret has E at position 3? So not at position 2 -> but E is in the secret? So we mark the first E in the guess that is not matched? 
            How it works: 
              We match the exact positions first: 
                Position 1: S matches -> ✓
                Then for the E at position 2: the secret has an E at position 3, which hasn't been matched? So we mark it as - (because E is present but not at position 2)
                Then for the E at position 3: now the secret has an E at position 3, but we already used the E for the minus? 
                Actually, the rule is: each letter in the secret can only be matched once. 
                So we first check for exact matches, then for the remaining letters, we check for presence.

              Steps:
                1. Check for exact matches: 
                    position 1: S matches -> ✓ (and we mark the S in secret as used)
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? Actually, we haven't checked yet. 
                    position 3: E -> secret has E at position 3? So ✓? But wait, we haven't used the E at position 3? 
                2. Actually, we do exact matches first: 
                    position 1: S -> ✓ (secret position 1: S)
                    position 3: E -> ✓ (secret position 3: E) -> now the secret's E at position 3 is used.
                3. Then for the remaining letters in the guess that are not matched exactly:
                    position 2: L -> not in secret? x
                    position 4: E -> now the secret has an E at position 3 but it's already matched? And there is no other E? So E at position 4: not in secret? x? 
                    But wait, the secret has only one E? So the E at position 4 in the guess is not in the secret? -> x
                    position 5: P -> x

                So feedback: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(x) P(x)

          Therefore, in our case, we know the secret word has at least one E (from the first guess) and it is not at position 5. 
          So if we put an E at the end in our second guess, then:
            If the secret word has only one E (which is not at the end), then the E at the end in our guess will be marked as x? 
            But that would be confusing because we know there is an E? 
          Actually, no: the feedback for the E at the end would be x if the secret word has no E at the end and the one E in the secret is already matched by another E in our guess? 
          Or if we don't have another E in the guess, then the E at the end would be marked as -? 

          Let me clarify: 
            Secret: has one E at position 2 (for example, ""LEMON"" but we know our secret doesn't have A, R, I, S, so let's say ""TEPID"" but TEPID has E at position 2).
            Guess: we make a word with E at the end, say ""GUESS"" but we cannot use S. Let's say ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but we are going to use a word without R,A,I,S.

          Example: secret = TEPID (but note: TEPID has I? which is eliminated -> so not allowed). 

          Let me choose a valid secret: since we don't know, let's assume the secret has one E at position 2.

          We guess: ""MELON"" (which has E at position 2) -> then we would get:
            M: not in secret? x
            E: at position 2: in secret at position 2? ✓
            L: ... 

          But if we guess a word that has E at the end and no other E, and the secret has one E at position 2, then:
            Guess: ""BLUNT"" doesn't have E. 
            Guess: ""CUPEL"" (C,U,P,E,L) -> E at position 4? 
            Secret: say ""HOTEL"" but we don't know. Actually, we know the secret has E? and not at the end? So if secret is ""HOTEL"", then E is at the end? -> but that contradicts our first feedback? 
            Because first guess ""raise"" had E at the end and got '-', meaning the secret has E but not at the end. So secret cannot be ""HOTEL"".

          So let secret be ""BREAD"" but we know R and A are eliminated -> so not. 

          Actually, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. So the secret must be composed of letters from the remaining 22 letters? and including E.

          We'll avoid the complication and not put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. We can put E in positions 1-4 and avoid the end.

   So back to choosing a word.

   I think ""EPOCH"" is a good candidate: 
        E at position 1, and P, O, C, H are new letters.

   Another candidate: ""EBONY"" (E, B, O, N, Y)

   Also, ""MELON"": M, E, L, O, N -> E at position 2.

   We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words (without R,A,I,S) are: E, T, O, N, L, C, etc.

   ""EPOCH"" has E, P, O, C, H -> not the most common? T and N are more common than P and H.

   How about ""ETHOS"": 
        E at 1, then T, H, O, S -> but S is eliminated? We cannot use S. 

   ""ELECT"": has E twice and we avoid duplicates? But it's okay. But it has L, E, C, T. 
        But we have E at 1 and 3? and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's two. 
        Also, we avoid R,A,I,S? Yes.

   But let's consider: we want to maximize information. Using two E's might not be optimal because we already know E is in the word. We want to test other letters.

   So I think ""EBONY"" or ""MELON"" or ""EPOCH"" are good.

   Another: ""OUNCE"" -> but E at the end? We want to avoid E at the end.

   How about ""OUNCE"" is not good because of E at the end.

   ""CONE"" is 4 letters. 

   ""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable (position 4 is not the end? the end is position 5). 
        So E at position 4: that's okay.

   ""NOTED"": uses N, O, T, E, D -> all common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid R,A,I,S? Yes, ""NOTED"" doesn't have them.

   So ""NOTED"" is a valid word? Yes.

   We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   Let's choose ""TONED"": 
        T, O, N, E, D -> E is at position 4.

   Why not ""NOTED""? 

   Actually, both are similar. I'll go with ""TONED"".

   But note: we are not sure if T, O, N, D are in the word. We are testing.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position to cover more ground.

   Since we know E is not at the end, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. We already tried E at position 5 (in the first guess) and it was present but wrong position.

   In ""TONED"", E is at position 4 -> which is acceptable.

   So let's guess ""TONED"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we wouldn't test position 1? 
        We are testing E at position 4. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position 4. 
        If we get a '-', then E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 3? 
        If we get an 'x'? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word? 
        But note: if the secret word has only one E and we put E at position 4, and the E is at position 1, then we would get a '-' for the E? 
        Because the E is present but not at position 4.

   So it's safe.

   Therefore, I choose ""TONED"".

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested? The first guess had E at position 5. Now we test E at position 4? 

   But we might also consider testing E at position 1? 

   Since we have many possibilities, and we want to cover more common letters, I think ""TONED"" is a good choice.

   Let me check: 
        T, O, N, E, D -> all new letters, and E at position 4.

   So we'll guess ""toned"".

   But note: the word must be valid. ""toned"" is a valid word.

   Therefore, next guess: toned.

   We'll output: <guess>toned</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (positions 1–4).
- Test new common letters (T, O, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TONED"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in position 4 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency letters T, O, N, D.
  - Avoids eliminated letters and minimizes duplication.

<guess>toned</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: toned -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""toned""
  T: - (in word, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (in word and at position 2)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (in word and at position 4)
  D: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word contains: E, O, and T (but T is not at position 1).
2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, N, D.
3. E is at position 4 (because in ""toned"", E is at position 4 and got a check).
4. O is at position 2 (because in ""toned"", O is at position 2 and got a check).

Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with E being at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the following known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E

And we know T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""toned"" feedback: T at position 1 got '-', meaning T is present but not at 1).

The word structure so far: _ O _ E _

We know the word must have a T in it, but not at position 1, so T must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, we have eliminated: R, A, I, S, N, D.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has O at position 2
- Has E at position 4
- Includes T (but not at position 1, so at 3 or 5)
- Avoids R, A, I, S, N, D
- And we want to test other letters to fill in the blanks.

The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: cannot be T (because T is not at 1) and cannot be any eliminated letter. So available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Position 3: can be T (if T is at 3) or another letter. But note: if T is at 3, then we get a check. If not, we test a new letter.

Position 5: can be T (if T is at 5) or another letter.

We want to maximize information. We can try to cover common letters that haven't been tested.

Letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, C, U, M, P, etc.

We can form a word that has O at 2, E at 4, and then for positions 1, 3, and 5, use new letters.

But note: we must include T? Actually, we don't have to include T in this guess because we already know T is in the word, but we don't know its position. We can try to find the position of T by putting it in position 3 or 5.

Alternatively, we can avoid T in this guess and test three new letters? But that might not be efficient because we know T is in the word and we need to find where.

So let's try to include T in either position 3 or 5.

Option 1: Put T at position 3: then the word would be _ O T E _
Option 2: Put T at position 5: then the word would be _ O _ E T

We can choose one and then test the other positions.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's look for words that fit the pattern and include T at 3 or 5.

First, pattern: _ O T E _

Possible words: 
  COTED? Not a common word.
  DOTED? But D is eliminated.
  HOTEL? But H at 1, O at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> but we have eliminated D? D is eliminated, but L is not. However, we don't know about L. But ""HOTEL"" has no eliminated letters? 
      Eliminated: R,A,I,S,N,D -> so D is eliminated, but L is not. So ""HOTEL"" is acceptable? 
      But note: we have E at 4 and O at 2, and T at 3. 
      However, we don't know if T is at 3? We are assuming.

But ""HOTEL"" is a valid word.

Second pattern: _ O _ E T

Possible words:
  COMET: C O M E T -> but M is not eliminated, and T at 5. 
  COVET: C O V E T
  ROWET? Not a word.
  POWET? Not a word.
  HOWET? Not a word.

But note: we must avoid R,A,I,S,N,D.

""COMET"": C, O, M, E, T -> positions: C at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, T at 5. This fits the pattern and avoids eliminated letters.

""COVET"": C, O, V, E, T -> also fits.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and get information.

In ""HOTEL"": we test H, O, T, E, L -> but O and E are already known. So we are testing H, T, and L.

In ""COMET"": we test C, O, M, E, T -> O and E known, so testing C, M, T.

We know T is in the word, so we are going to get information about T's position.

But we also want to test new letters that might be in the word.

We have two good candidates: ""HOTEL"" and ""COMET"".

Let's see the frequency of the new letters.

H, L vs C, M.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think about the position of T.

We have two possibilities for T: position 3 or 5.

If we choose ""HOTEL"", we are putting T at position 3. Then:
  If T is actually at position 3, we get a check for T and we know T is at 3, and then we have H and L to test.
  If T is not at 3, then we get a minus for T (because T is in the word but not at 3) and then we know T must be at 5.

Similarly, if we choose ""COMET"", we are putting T at position 5. Then:
  If T is at 5, we get a check and we know T is at 5.
  If not, then T must be at 3.

So both are valid.

But note: in ""HOTEL"", we are also testing L at position 5. If T is at 5, then L would be wrong? But we don't know.

I think both are equally good. Let's choose ""HOTEL"" because it's a common word.

But wait: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""HOTEL"" is valid.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't include T? But that might not be efficient because we are not using the known information about T.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in the position we think is most likely? But we don't have data.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" to test T at position 3.

So the guess: ""HOTEL""

But let's check the pattern: 
  Position 1: H (unknown)
  Position 2: O (known, so we expect a check)
  Position 3: T (we are testing if T is here)
  Position 4: E (known, so we expect a check)
  Position 5: L (unknown)

We expect O and E to be checks, and then we get feedback on H, T, and L.

If T is at position 3, we get a check for T and then we know the word is H O T E L? 
  But then we have to check if H and L are correct? 
  Actually, if we get all checks, we win.

But if not, we get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the known positions? But we have to have O at 2 and E at 4.

I think ""HOTEL"" is a good guess.

So we'll go with that.

But note: we have eliminated N and D, and ""HOTEL"" doesn't have them.

Therefore, next guess: hotel

We output: <guess>hotel</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated letters**: R, A, I, S, N, D (not in the word).
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - O is in position 2 (✓ from ""toned"").
  - E is in position 4 (✓ from ""toned"").
- **Partially known**: 
  - T is in the word but not in position 1 (- from ""toned""), so it must be in position 3 or 5.

The secret word pattern is: `_ O _ E _`  
- Position 1: Cannot be T or eliminated letters. Must be a new letter (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).
- Position 3: Could be T or a new letter.
- Position 5: Could be T (if not in position 3) or a new letter.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test the position of T by placing it in position 3 (since position 5 is riskier if T is actually in position 3).
- Use new high-frequency letters (H, L) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.
- **Guess ""HOTEL""**:
  - H at position 1 (tests a new letter).
  - O at position 2 (known, expected ✓).
  - T at position 3 (tests if T is here).
  - E at position 4 (known, expected ✓).
  - L at position 5 (tests a new letter).

This guess efficiently narrows down T's position while testing two new letters (H, L). If T is in position 3, we get immediate confirmation. If not, T must be in position 5.

But if we put E at the end, then we know it will be marked as either:\n            - If the secret word has E at the end? -> but we know it doesn\'t (because first guess E at 5th was wrong position, meaning the secret word has E but not at 5th) -> so if we put E at the end, it will be marked as \'x\'? \n            But wait: the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5. \n            Therefore, if we put E at the end again, we know it will be wrong. So we can avoid that.\n\n   So we should put E in one of the positions 1-4.\n\n   Let\'s try to form a word with E in position 1, and without R,A,I,S.\n\n   Words: \n      E + [not R,A,I,S] + ... \n      Example: \n        E + L + O + T + H -> ELOTH? not a word.\n        E + L + D + E + R -> but R is eliminated and we cannot use R. Also, E at the end? We don\'t want to put E at the end.\n\n   How about: ""ELECT"" -> but has E at position 1 and 3? and ends with T? \n        But ""ELECT"" is 5 letters? No, ELECT is 5: E-L-E-C-T? Wait, that\'s 5. But it has two E\'s? \n        We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? It might. But we know at least one E.\n\n   But we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? The rules don\'t say we can\'t. However, the feedback will mark each occurrence.\n\n   However, we are trying to maximize information. Using a word with repeated E might not be optimal because if we get a check for one E and a minus for the other, we know the position of one E and that there is another E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to cover more letters.\n\n   Let\'s try to find a word without duplicate letters, without R,A,I,S, and with E in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n   Position 1: \n      E + [B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] for the next four.\n\n   Words: \n      EBONY: E at 1, then B, O, N, Y -> no R,A,I,S. \n      EGRET: has R -> invalid.\n      EPOCH: E at 1, then P, O, C, H -> no R,A,I,S.\n\n   Position 2:\n      [letter] + E + [three letters] without R,A,I,S.\n\n      Example: \n        MELON: M, E, L, O, N -> no R,A,I,S? M, E, L, O, N are all new.\n\n   Position 3:\n      [letter1, letter2] + E + [letter4, letter5] without R,A,I,S.\n\n      Example: \n        PLUME: P, L, U, M, E -> but E at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we put E at the end, we expect it to be marked as not present? \n        But wait: the secret word has an E, but not at the end. So if we put E at the end, the feedback will show that E is present (because it\'s in the word) but in the wrong position? \n        Actually, the feedback will mark the E at the end as \'-\' because it is in the word but not at the end? \n        But note: the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more? We don\'t know. \n        However, if we put E at the end and the secret word has only one E and that E is at a different position, then the E at the end will be marked as \'-\'? \n        But that would be inconsistent because the secret word has an E, but not at the end, so the E at the end in our guess would be a different occurrence? \n        Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. So if the secret word has one E and it is at position 2, then in a guess:\n          if we have an E at position 2: ✓\n          if we have an E at position 5: - (because the E is present but not at position 5)\n        But if the secret word has two E\'s? Then we might get two marks.\n\n        However, we don\'t know. So it\'s acceptable to put E at the end? But we know the secret word has at least one E and it is not at the end. \n        So if we put E at the end, we will get a \'-\' for that E? Because the secret word has an E (somewhere else) and we are putting an E at the end, which is not the correct position for that E? \n        But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us which occurrence. It just marks each letter in the guess.\n\n        Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: \n          For each letter in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, mark it ✓.\n          If the letter is in the secret word but not in the correct position, mark it -.\n          If the letter is not in the secret word, mark it x.\n\n        And if there are duplicate letters, the feedback might be tricky: \n          For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E\'s: \n            One of them might be in the correct position -> then that one is ✓, and the other might be x? \n            Or if both are in wrong positions, then both -? \n          But the rule is: the feedback only accounts for the number of times the letter appears. \n          Specifically, if the secret word has one E, and we have two E\'s in the guess, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x? \n          Or if both are in wrong positions, then one gets - and the other gets x? \n\n        According to the rules: \n          ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""\n\n        And the example: \n          Secret: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word (but not at position 1) so -, T not in word so x, O not in word so x, R in the word but not at position 4 (it\'s at position 2 in secret) so -, M not in word so x.\n\n        For duplicates: \n          Suppose secret: STEEL, guess: SLEEP -> \n            S: in secret at position 1? but in guess at position 1: ✓\n            L: not in secret -> x\n            E: in secret at positions 2 and 3? In guess at position 2: E is at position 2 in secret? ✓. Then the second E in guess at position 3: but the secret has two E\'s? The first E in the guess already matched the first E in the secret? Then the second E in the guess: \n                There is still one E left in the secret (at position 3) so if the guess has E at position 3, that would be ✓? \n            But wait, the secret has two E\'s: positions 2 and 3. \n            So for the guess SLEEP: \n                S: ✓ (position 1)\n                L: x (not in secret)\n                E: at position 2: matches secret position 2 -> ✓\n                E: at position 3: matches secret position 3 -> ✓\n                P: not in secret -> x\n\n          But if the secret has only one E? \n          Secret: STEAM, guess: SLEEP -> \n            S: ✓ (position 1)\n            L: x\n            E: at position 2: secret has E at position 3? So not at position 2 -> but E is in the secret? So we mark the first E in the guess that is not matched? \n            How it works: \n              We match the exact positions first: \n                Position 1: S matches -> ✓\n                Then for the E at position 2: the secret has an E at position 3, which hasn\'t been matched? So we mark it as - (because E is present but not at position 2)\n                Then for the E at position 3: now the secret has an E at position 3, but we already used the E for the minus? \n                Actually, the rule is: each letter in the secret can only be matched once. \n                So we first check for exact matches, then for the remaining letters, we check for presence.\n\n              Steps:\n                1. Check for exact matches: \n                    position 1: S matches -> ✓ (and we mark the S in secret as used)\n                    position 2: L -> not in secret? Actually, we haven\'t checked yet. \n                    position 3: E -> secret has E at position 3? So ✓? But wait, we haven\'t used the E at position 3? \n                2. Actually, we do exact matches first: \n                    position 1: S -> ✓ (secret position 1: S)\n                    position 3: E -> ✓ (secret position 3: E) -> now the secret\'s E at position 3 is used.\n                3. Then for the remaining letters in the guess that are not matched exactly:\n                    position 2: L -> not in secret? x\n                    position 4: E -> now the secret has an E at position 3 but it\'s already matched? And there is no other E? So E at position 4: not in secret? x? \n                    But wait, the secret has only one E? So the E at position 4 in the guess is not in the secret? -> x\n                    position 5: P -> x\n\n                So feedback: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(x) P(x)\n\n          Therefore, in our case, we know the secret word has at least one E (from the first guess) and it is not at position 5. \n          So if we put an E at the end in our second guess, then:\n            If the secret word has only one E (which is not at the end), then the E at the end in our guess will be marked as x? \n            But that would be confusing because we know there is an E? \n          Actually, no: the feedback for the E at the end would be x if the secret word has no E at the end and the one E in the secret is already matched by another E in our guess? \n          Or if we don\'t have another E in the guess, then the E at the end would be marked as -? \n\n          Let me clarify: \n            Secret: has one E at position 2 (for example, ""LEMON"" but we know our secret doesn\'t have A, R, I, S, so let\'s say ""TEPID"" but TEPID has E at position 2).\n            Guess: we make a word with E at the end, say ""GUESS"" but we cannot use S. Let\'s say ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but we are going to use a word without R,A,I,S.\n\n          Example: secret = TEPID (but note: TEPID has I? which is eliminated -> so not allowed). \n\n          Let me choose a valid secret: since we don\'t know, let\'s assume the secret has one E at position 2.\n\n          We guess: ""MELON"" (which has E at position 2) -> then we would get:\n            M: not in secret? x\n            E: at position 2: in secret at position 2? ✓\n            L: ... \n\n          But if we guess a word that has E at the end and no other E, and the secret has one E at position 2, then:\n            Guess: ""BLUNT"" doesn\'t have E. \n            Guess: ""CUPEL"" (C,U,P,E,L) -> E at position 4? \n            Secret: say ""HOTEL"" but we don\'t know. Actually, we know the secret has E? and not at the end? So if secret is ""HOTEL"", then E is at the end? -> but that contradicts our first feedback? \n            Because first guess ""raise"" had E at the end and got \'-\', meaning the secret has E but not at the end. So secret cannot be ""HOTEL"".\n\n          So let secret be ""BREAD"" but we know R and A are eliminated -> so not. \n\n          Actually, we have eliminated R, A, I, S. So the secret must be composed of letters from the remaining 22 letters? and including E.\n\n          We\'ll avoid the complication and not put E at the end because we know it\'s not at the end. We can put E in positions 1-4 and avoid the end.\n\n   So back to choosing a word.\n\n   I think ""EPOCH"" is a good candidate: \n        E at position 1, and P, O, C, H are new letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""EBONY"" (E, B, O, N, Y)\n\n   Also, ""MELON"": M, E, L, O, N -> E at position 2.\n\n   We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words (without R,A,I,S) are: E, T, O, N, L, C, etc.\n\n   ""EPOCH"" has E, P, O, C, H -> not the most common? T and N are more common than P and H.\n\n   How about ""ETHOS"": \n        E at 1, then T, H, O, S -> but S is eliminated? We cannot use S. \n\n   ""ELECT"": has E twice and we avoid duplicates? But it\'s okay. But it has L, E, C, T. \n        But we have E at 1 and 3? and we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s two. \n        Also, we avoid R,A,I,S? Yes.\n\n   But let\'s consider: we want to maximize information. Using two E\'s might not be optimal because we already know E is in the word. We want to test other letters.\n\n   So I think ""EBONY"" or ""MELON"" or ""EPOCH"" are good.\n\n   Another: ""OUNCE"" -> but E at the end? We want to avoid E at the end.\n\n   How about ""OUNCE"" is not good because of E at the end.\n\n   ""CONE"" is 4 letters. \n\n   ""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s acceptable (position 4 is not the end? the end is position 5). \n        So E at position 4: that\'s okay.\n\n   ""NOTED"": uses N, O, T, E, D -> all common letters.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid R,A,I,S? Yes, ""NOTED"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n   So ""NOTED"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n   We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D.\n\n   Both are valid.\n\n   Let\'s choose ""TONED"": \n        T, O, N, E, D -> E is at position 4.\n\n   Why not ""NOTED""? \n\n   Actually, both are similar. I\'ll go with ""TONED"".\n\n   But note: we are not sure if T, O, N, D are in the word. We are testing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position to cover more ground.\n\n   Since we know E is not at the end, we can try to put E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. We already tried E at position 5 (in the first guess) and it was present but wrong position.\n\n   In ""TONED"", E is at position 4 -> which is acceptable.\n\n   So let\'s guess ""TONED"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we wouldn\'t test position 1? \n        We are testing E at position 4. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position 4. \n        If we get a \'-\', then E is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 3? \n        If we get an \'x\'? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word? \n        But note: if the secret word has only one E and we put E at position 4, and the E is at position 1, then we would get a \'-\' for the E? \n        Because the E is present but not at position 4.\n\n   So it\'s safe.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TONED"".\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tested? The first guess had E at position 5. Now we test E at position 4? \n\n   But we might also consider testing E at position 1? \n\n   Since we have many possibilities, and we want to cover more common letters, I think ""TONED"" is a good choice.\n\n   Let me check: \n        T, O, N, E, D -> all new letters, and E at position 4.\n\n   So we\'ll guess ""toned"".\n\n   But note: the word must be valid. ""toned"" is a valid word.\n\n   Therefore, next guess: toned.\n\n   We\'ll output: <guess>toned</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid R, A, I, S entirely.\n- Include E in a position other than 5th (positions 1–4).\n- Test new common letters (T, O, N, D) to gather more information.\n- ""TONED"" is chosen because:\n  - Contains E in position 4 (testing a new position).\n  - Uses high-frequency letters T, O, N, D.\n  - Avoids eliminated letters and minimizes duplication.\n\n<guess>toned</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: toned -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""toned""\n  T: - (in word, but not at position 1)\n  O: ✓ (in word and at position 2)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: ✓ (in word and at position 4)\n  D: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word contains: E, O, and T (but T is not at position 1).\n2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, N, D.\n3. E is at position 4 (because in ""toned"", E is at position 4 and got a check).\n4. O is at position 2 (because in ""toned"", O is at position 2 and got a check).\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent with E being at position 4.\n\nNow, the secret word has the following known:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 4: E\n\nAnd we know T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""toned"" feedback: T at position 1 got \'-\', meaning T is present but not at 1).\n\nThe word structure so far: _ O _ E _\n\nWe know the word must have a T in it, but not at position 1, so T must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated: R, A, I, S, N, D.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Has O at position 2\n- Has E at position 4\n- Includes T (but not at position 1, so at 3 or 5)\n- Avoids R, A, I, S, N, D\n- And we want to test other letters to fill in the blanks.\n\nThe unknown positions are 1, 3, and 5.\n\nPosition 1: cannot be T (because T is not at 1) and cannot be any eliminated letter. So available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPosition 3: can be T (if T is at 3) or another letter. But note: if T is at 3, then we get a check. If not, we test a new letter.\n\nPosition 5: can be T (if T is at 5) or another letter.\n\nWe want to maximize information. We can try to cover common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nLetters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon ones: L, C, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can form a word that has O at 2, E at 4, and then for positions 1, 3, and 5, use new letters.\n\nBut note: we must include T? Actually, we don\'t have to include T in this guess because we already know T is in the word, but we don\'t know its position. We can try to find the position of T by putting it in position 3 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid T in this guess and test three new letters? But that might not be efficient because we know T is in the word and we need to find where.\n\nSo let\'s try to include T in either position 3 or 5.\n\nOption 1: Put T at position 3: then the word would be _ O T E _\nOption 2: Put T at position 5: then the word would be _ O _ E T\n\nWe can choose one and then test the other positions.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s look for words that fit the pattern and include T at 3 or 5.\n\nFirst, pattern: _ O T E _\n\nPossible words: \n  COTED? Not a common word.\n  DOTED? But D is eliminated.\n  HOTEL? But H at 1, O at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> but we have eliminated D? D is eliminated, but L is not. However, we don\'t know about L. But ""HOTEL"" has no eliminated letters? \n      Eliminated: R,A,I,S,N,D -> so D is eliminated, but L is not. So ""HOTEL"" is acceptable? \n      But note: we have E at 4 and O at 2, and T at 3. \n      However, we don\'t know if T is at 3? We are assuming.\n\nBut ""HOTEL"" is a valid word.\n\nSecond pattern: _ O _ E T\n\nPossible words:\n  COMET: C O M E T -> but M is not eliminated, and T at 5. \n  COVET: C O V E T\n  ROWET? Not a word.\n  POWET? Not a word.\n  HOWET? Not a word.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R,A,I,S,N,D.\n\n""COMET"": C, O, M, E, T -> positions: C at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, T at 5. This fits the pattern and avoids eliminated letters.\n\n""COVET"": C, O, V, E, T -> also fits.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and get information.\n\nIn ""HOTEL"": we test H, O, T, E, L -> but O and E are already known. So we are testing H, T, and L.\n\nIn ""COMET"": we test C, O, M, E, T -> O and E known, so testing C, M, T.\n\nWe know T is in the word, so we are going to get information about T\'s position.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters that might be in the word.\n\nWe have two good candidates: ""HOTEL"" and ""COMET"".\n\nLet\'s see the frequency of the new letters.\n\nH, L vs C, M.\n\nWe can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think about the position of T.\n\nWe have two possibilities for T: position 3 or 5.\n\nIf we choose ""HOTEL"", we are putting T at position 3. Then:\n  If T is actually at position 3, we get a check for T and we know T is at 3, and then we have H and L to test.\n  If T is not at 3, then we get a minus for T (because T is in the word but not at 3) and then we know T must be at 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""COMET"", we are putting T at position 5. Then:\n  If T is at 5, we get a check and we know T is at 5.\n  If not, then T must be at 3.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut note: in ""HOTEL"", we are also testing L at position 5. If T is at 5, then L would be wrong? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think both are equally good. Let\'s choose ""HOTEL"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""HOTEL"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t include T? But that might not be efficient because we are not using the known information about T.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T in the position we think is most likely? But we don\'t have data.\n\nSince we have two possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily.\n\nI\'ll go with ""HOTEL"" to test T at position 3.\n\nSo the guess: ""HOTEL""\n\nBut let\'s check the pattern: \n  Position 1: H (unknown)\n  Position 2: O (known, so we expect a check)\n  Position 3: T (we are testing if T is here)\n  Position 4: E (known, so we expect a check)\n  Position 5: L (unknown)\n\nWe expect O and E to be checks, and then we get feedback on H, T, and L.\n\nIf T is at position 3, we get a check for T and then we know the word is H O T E L? \n  But then we have to check if H and L are correct? \n  Actually, if we get all checks, we win.\n\nBut if not, we get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat the known positions? But we have to have O at 2 and E at 4.\n\nI think ""HOTEL"" is a good guess.\n\nSo we\'ll go with that.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated N and D, and ""HOTEL"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nTherefore, next guess: hotel\n\nWe output: <guess>hotel</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Eliminated letters**: R, A, I, S, N, D (not in the word).\n- **Confirmed positions**: \n  - O is in position 2 (✓ from ""toned"").\n  - E is in position 4 (✓ from ""toned"").\n- **Partially known**: \n  - T is in the word but not in position 1 (- from ""toned""), so it must be in position 3 or 5.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ O _ E _`  \n- Position 1: Cannot be T or eliminated letters. Must be a new letter (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).\n- Position 3: Could be T or a new letter.\n- Position 5: Could be T (if not in position 3) or a new letter.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Test the position of T by placing it in position 3 (since position 5 is riskier if T is actually in position 3).\n- Use new high-frequency letters (H, L) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.\n- **Guess ""HOTEL""**:\n  - H at position 1 (tests a new letter).\n  - O at position 2 (known, expected ✓).\n  - T at position 3 (tests if T is here).\n  - E at position 4 (known, expected ✓).\n  - L at position 5 (tests a new letter).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down T\'s position while testing two new letters (H, L).

We have feedback from Guess 3: hotel -> H(x) O(✓) T(✓) E(✓) L(✓)
This means that:
- H is not in the word (x)
- O is in the correct position (2) (✓)
- T is in the correct position (3) (✓)
- E is in the correct position (4) (✓)
- L is in the correct position (5) (✓)

Therefore, the secret word has the following pattern: _ O T E L

Position 1 is the only unknown letter. We know it must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated, and it cannot be H (since H is x).

From previous feedback, we have eliminated:
- R, A, I, S, N, D, H (from Guess 1, 2, and 3)

We have confirmed letters: O, T, E, L (all in their positions)

So the secret word is: [letter] O T E L

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with an unknown letter (not R,A,I,S,N,D,H) and ending with ""OTEL"".

Possible words: 
- MOTEL (M at position 1)
- POTEL (not a common word)
- COTEL? Uncommon
- HOTEL was guessed and H is not the first letter because H is x and not in the word. So not HOTEL.

Other options: 
- VOTEL? Not a valid word.
- BOTEL? Not common.

Actually, common words with ""OTEL"":
- MOTEL: M at position 1.

Is MOTEL a valid word? Yes.

But are there others?
- ROTEL: but R is eliminated.
- DOTEL: D is eliminated.
- KOTEL? Uncommon.
- NOTEL? N is eliminated and not a common word.
- WOTEL? Not a word.

So the only common word fitting is MOTEL.

Therefore, we guess MOTEL.

But note: we haven't tested M yet. So we are not sure. But given the constraints, MOTEL is likely.

We have 6 tries, so if it's not MOTEL, we can guess again. But let's see if there are other possibilities.

After elimination, available letters for position 1: 
Eliminated: R,A,I,S,N,D,H. 
And we know the word already contains O,T,E,L. But they are already placed. So the first letter must be a new letter not used anywhere else? Not necessarily, because we don't have duplicate letters in this case? We don't know.

Could the first letter be O? But O is already at position 2? And we have feedback that doesn't indicate duplicate? But note: in the feedback for ""hotel"", O is at position 2 and got a check. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple O's? Actually, the feedback only marks one occurrence? But if there were two O's, it would show for each.

But let's reconsider: the secret word could have duplicate letters? For example, if the first letter were O, then the word would be O O T E L? That seems unlikely? But we cannot rule it out? However, ""OOTEL"" is not a word.

Similarly, could it be T? But T is at position 3? ""TOTEL"" is not a word.

So probably, the first letter is a consonant that hasn't been eliminated, and ""MOTEL"" is a valid word.

Therefore, our next guess is MOTEL.

But let's confirm the feedback we would expect: 
If the secret is MOTEL: M is a new letter? We haven't tested M. So:
- M: if the secret is MOTEL, then M at position 1 is correct -> ✓
- O, T, E, L: all already known to be in position? ✓

So we would get all ✓ and win.

But if it's not MOTEL, then what other words? 
Perhaps uncommon words or misspellings? But we are to assume valid English words.

After careful thought, MOTEL seems to be the only viable candidate.

Therefore, we guess MOTEL.

Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Eliminated letters**: R, A, I, S, N, D, H (not in the word).
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 2: O (✓ from ""toned"" and ""hotel"").
  - Position 3: T (✓ from ""hotel"").
  - Position 4: E (✓ from ""toned"" and ""hotel"").
  - Position 5: L (✓ from ""hotel"").

The secret word pattern is: `_ O T E L`  
- Position 1 is the only unknown and must be a letter not eliminated (e.g., B, C, F, G, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Given the pattern `_OTEL`, common English words include:
  - **MOTEL** (valid; fits all constraints).
  - Other possibilities (like ""COTEL"" or ""POTEL"") are uncommon or invalid. ""HOTEL"" was already tested and ruled out (H is eliminated).

**Strategy**: Guess ""MOTEL"" to test if M is the missing letter. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if incorrect, it reveals position 1.
