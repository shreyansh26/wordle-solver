We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'
   - It includes two vowels ('A' and 'E') and three consonants.
   - These letters are among the most common in English.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, meaning E is in the word and in the 5th position)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word has the letter E in the last position (5th letter).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 2nd).
3. The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We have used 4 letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, and also the C and A were in positions 1 and 3 respectively and are absent. However, note that A was given an 'x', meaning it's not present at all.

Therefore, the word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E

Also, R is present but not in the 2nd position. So R must be in one of the first four positions, but not the second? Actually, in ""crane"", R was in position 2, so it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should avoid the letters C, A, N because they are not in the word. We should include R and E (but E is fixed at the end).

Also, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Since E is fixed at the end, and R is present, we can build a word that uses R in a different position and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Common vowels besides A (which we ruled out) are O, I, U. Consonants: we might try S, T, L, etc.

We know the word has R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Let's think of words ending with E that have R and do not have A, C, N.

We can also consider that R is not in the second position, so we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4.

One candidate word: ""ROUSE"" - but we haven't tested O, U, S.

But note: we need to confirm if these letters are present.

Another candidate: ""RINSE"" - but N was ruled out (we have N as not present), so ""rinse"" has N. Avoid.

Another: ""RAISE"" - but A is ruled out. So avoid.

So try with different letters.

Possible strategy: Include the R in the first position? Then we can test it.

Example: ""ROUTE"" - letters: R at position 1, O, U, T, E at 5th.

But we don't know if O, U, T are present.

Alternatively, we can put R in the third position: for example, ""TRIBE"" - B is new.

But note: we have E fixed at the end so both ""route"" and ""tribe"" end with E.

We also want to cover other common letters.

Another idea: ""PRICE"" - but we ruled out C (from first feedback: C is not in word). So avoid C.

Remember: avoid C, A, N.

So, let's list some words ending with E that do not contain C, A, N, and include R.

Possible words:
- ROUZE? Not a word. 
- ROUTE: yes.
- ROLES? But doesn't end with E? Roles ends with E? R-O-L-E-S -> that would be 5 letters? R-O-L-E-S is 5 letters, but the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

So we need something ending in E.

Examples: 
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E
- TRIED: T-R-I-E-D -> ends with D? No. We need E at end? Actually ""tried"" ends with D? Wait, spelling: T-R-I-E-D, last letter D? But in our case, E must be the fifth letter.

Words ending with E: such as ""alive"", but ruled out A. 

We have ""house"", ""horse"", ""worse"", ""arise"" but ruled out A.

Let me think of words ending in E that can include R.

Common words: 
- STORE: ends with E, has R? and avoids C, A, N? S-T-O-R-E -> letters: S, T, O, R, E. Avoids A, C, N? Yes.

In the feedback, we have E confirmed at the end. So STORE ends with E.

But what about R: in STORE, R is in the 4th position? We can test if R is in the word in a different position.

However, we are not sure if S, T, O are present.

But using S, T, O is good because they are common.

Another word: ""SOARE""? Not a common word? We need valid English words.

Better word: ""ROUSE"" (meaning to wake up) -> R-O-U-S-E. Ends with E? E is the fifth letter. So R, O, U, S, E.

We haven't tested O, U, S.

Alternatively, ""WRITE"" -> W-R-I-T-E. Ends with E. Avoids C, A, N? Yes.

But R is in the second position, and in the first guess R was in the second position and marked wrong (as - meaning present but wrong position). Wait: in the first guess ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got R(-). So R cannot be in position 2? Or can it? Actually the '-' means it is present but not in position 2. So in the next guess, it might be in a different position. But we can try R in position 2 again? Actually no: the '-' indicates that the correct word has the letter R, but not in the 2nd position, so R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""WRITE"", R is in position 2, which we know is not where it belongs. So we would get a '-' again, which wouldn't tell us a new position? Actually, it's not efficient because we know R should move.

So let's avoid R in second position.

Hence, better to put R in a position we haven't tested: 1, 3, or 4.

So for R in position 1: words like ""ROUSE"", ""ROAST"" but A is ruled out? So not ""ROAST"". Then ""ROUSE"", ""ROUTE"", ""ROME"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letter word.

5 letter: ""ROBES"" but ends with S? We need ends with E. So ""ROBES"" is R-O-B-E-S? Last letter S. So not E.

So: ""ROUGE"", ""RUBLE"" but B and L? 

But we have ""ROUSE"": R-O-U-S-E -> E is at the end? Positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-U, 4-S, 5-E. That works.

Alternatively, R in third position: for example, ""IRATE"" but A is ruled out? Yes, avoid A.

Or ""CRATE"" but C ruled out.

So perhaps ""TROVE"" -> T-R-O-V-E? But R is in the second position? Positions: 1-T, 2-R, 3-O, 4-V, 5-E. So R at position 2? We don't want that because we know R is not in position 2.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, R at 1 or 3 or 4.

R at position 1: ""ROUSE"" or ""ROUTE"" or ""RIPES"" (last letter S) -> so ""RIPES"" is not ending in E? We have ""RIPED""? Not a word.

""ROLES"" -> R-O-L-E-S? Ends with S.

Perhaps ""RIDES"" -> ends with S.

I need words ending with E.

Common words:
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E -> ends with E? E at end? Yes, because R-O-U-T-E: position 5 is E.
- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E -> ends with E, and R is at position 4? Yes.

But SPIRE: that has S, P, I, R, E. We can also test S and P and I.

We are limited to 5 letters and we need to maximize information.

Considering ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E -> positions: S1, T2, O3, R4, E5. Here R is in position 4 and we avoid position 2 for R? We are not putting R in position 2 so it's okay.

Alternatively, ""ROUTE"": R1, O2, U3, T4, E5.

But O is at position 2? That might be okay since we haven't tested O.

However, in terms of letter frequency, S and T are more common.

But we need to avoid A and C and N.

Another word: ""SPORE"" -> S-P-O-R-E.

Now, comparing:

Option 1: ""ROUTE"" 
- R (already known, position 1: we can test if it's at position 1)
- O (new at pos2)
- U (new at pos3)
- T (new at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 2: ""STORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- T (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4: we test R at position 4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 3: ""SPORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- P (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. 

Also, note that we have only 6 tries, so we need to get information.

We know that E is at position 5 and R is somewhere but not at position 2.

In ""ROUTE"": we test position 1 for R and also new letters O,U,T.

In ""STORE"": we test S,T,O and R at position 4.

Both are valid.

But perhaps ""STORE"" is better because it has more frequent letters? T and S are very common.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOBER"" but ends with R? We need ends with E? So not.

Let me choose ""STORE"". Reasons:

1. It includes letters S, T, O which are common and we haven't tested.
2. It places R at position 4, which we don't know yet.
3. It has E at the end which we already know.

So if the secret word has R at position 4, we get a check mark. Otherwise, we might get a '-'.

So let's go with ""STORE"".

But there's another option: a word that doesn't have R in the second guess? Actually, no: we must include R because we know it's present? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess any word, but it's better to include known letters to get more information.

We know R is present, so we should include it to know where it is.

Similarly, E is fixed.

So yes, include R and E.

Therefore, ""STORE"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""PRICE"" but we ruled out C? So avoid.

Or ""BRINE"" but we have N ruled out? N not present, so avoid.

So ""STORE"" is good.

We can also consider ""TROPE"" but O is at position 3? And R at position 2? We cannot do R at position 2 because we know that position is incorrect for R? So avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TROPE"": T1, R2, O3, P4, E5 -> R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect? So we would get a '-' again for R? And we don't learn the position? So inefficient.

Therefore, we avoid.

So I proceed with ""STORE"".

Guess: ""store""

But wait: the word ""STORE"" is valid? Yes.

So second guess: ""store""

<guess>store</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""–"").  
- E is in the word and in position 5 (marked ""✓"").  

Therefore:  
- The secret word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E.  
- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).  
- Avoid using C, A, or N in future guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and excluding C, A, N.  
- Prioritize testing common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information gain.  
- Given the constraints, ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) is a strong choice:  
  - It ends in E (position 5), matching known feedback.  
  - Places R in position 4 (currently untested).  
  - Introduces S, T, and O—all common letters—in positions 1, 2, and 3.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).  

This guess will help clarify:  
- If S, T, or O are in the word and their positions.  
- Whether R is correctly placed at position 4.  

<guess>store</guess>",store,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, meaning E is in the word and in the 5th position)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word has the letter E in the last position (5th letter).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 2nd).
3. The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We have used 4 letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, and also the C and A were in positions 1 and 3 respectively and are absent. However, note that A was given an 'x', meaning it's not present at all.

Therefore, the word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E

Also, R is present but not in the 2nd position. So R must be in one of the first four positions, but not the second? Actually, in ""crane"", R was in position 2, so it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should avoid the letters C, A, N because they are not in the word. We should include R and E (but E is fixed at the end).

Also, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Since E is fixed at the end, and R is present, we can build a word that uses R in a different position and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Common vowels besides A (which we ruled out) are O, I, U. Consonants: we might try S, T, L, etc.

We know the word has R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Let's think of words ending with E that have R and do not have A, C, N.

We can also consider that R is not in the second position, so we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4.

One candidate word: ""ROUSE"" - but we haven't tested O, U, S.

But note: we need to confirm if these letters are present.

Another candidate: ""RINSE"" - but N was ruled out (we have N as not present), so ""rinse"" has N. Avoid.

Another: ""RAISE"" - but A is ruled out. So avoid.

So try with different letters.

Possible strategy: Include the R in the first position? Then we can test it.

Example: ""ROUTE"" - letters: R at position 1, O, U, T, E at 5th.

But we don't know if O, U, T are present.

Alternatively, we can put R in the third position: for example, ""TRIBE"" - B is new.

But note: we have E fixed at the end so both ""route"" and ""tribe"" end with E.

We also want to cover other common letters.

Another idea: ""PRICE"" - but we ruled out C (from first feedback: C is not in word). So avoid C.

Remember: avoid C, A, N.

So, let's list some words ending with E that do not contain C, A, N, and include R.

Possible words:
- ROUZE? Not a word. 
- ROUTE: yes.
- ROLES? But doesn't end with E? Roles ends with E? R-O-L-E-S -> that would be 5 letters? R-O-L-E-S is 5 letters, but the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

So we need something ending in E.

Examples: 
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E
- TRIED: T-R-I-E-D -> ends with D? No. We need E at end? Actually ""tried"" ends with D? Wait, spelling: T-R-I-E-D, last letter D? But in our case, E must be the fifth letter.

Words ending with E: such as ""alive"", but ruled out A. 

We have ""house"", ""horse"", ""worse"", ""arise"" but ruled out A.

Let me think of words ending in E that can include R.

Common words: 
- STORE: ends with E, has R? and avoids C, A, N? S-T-O-R-E -> letters: S, T, O, R, E. Avoids A, C, N? Yes.

In the feedback, we have E confirmed at the end. So STORE ends with E.

But what about R: in STORE, R is in the 4th position? We can test if R is in the word in a different position.

However, we are not sure if S, T, O are present.

But using S, T, O is good because they are common.

Another word: ""SOARE""? Not a common word? We need valid English words.

Better word: ""ROUSE"" (meaning to wake up) -> R-O-U-S-E. Ends with E? E is the fifth letter. So R, O, U, S, E.

We haven't tested O, U, S.

Alternatively, ""WRITE"" -> W-R-I-T-E. Ends with E. Avoids C, A, N? Yes.

But R is in the second position, and in the first guess R was in the second position and marked wrong (as - meaning present but wrong position). Wait: in the first guess ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got R(-). So R cannot be in position 2? Or can it? Actually the '-' means it is present but not in position 2. So in the next guess, it might be in a different position. But we can try R in position 2 again? Actually no: the '-' indicates that the correct word has the letter R, but not in the 2nd position, so R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""WRITE"", R is in position 2, which we know is not where it belongs. So we would get a '-' again, which wouldn't tell us a new position? Actually, it's not efficient because we know R should move.

So let's avoid R in second position.

Hence, better to put R in a position we haven't tested: 1, 3, or 4.

So for R in position 1: words like ""ROUSE"", ""ROAST"" but A is ruled out? So not ""ROAST"". Then ""ROUSE"", ""ROUTE"", ""ROME"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letter word.

5 letter: ""ROBES"" but ends with S? We need ends with E. So ""ROBES"" is R-O-B-E-S? Last letter S. So not E.

So: ""ROUGE"", ""RUBLE"" but B and L? 

But we have ""ROUSE"": R-O-U-S-E -> E is at the end? Positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-U, 4-S, 5-E. That works.

Alternatively, R in third position: for example, ""IRATE"" but A is ruled out? Yes, avoid A.

Or ""CRATE"" but C ruled out.

So perhaps ""TROVE"" -> T-R-O-V-E? But R is in the second position? Positions: 1-T, 2-R, 3-O, 4-V, 5-E. So R at position 2? We don't want that because we know R is not in position 2.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, R at 1 or 3 or 4.

R at position 1: ""ROUSE"" or ""ROUTE"" or ""RIPES"" (last letter S) -> so ""RIPES"" is not ending in E? We have ""RIPED""? Not a word.

""ROLES"" -> R-O-L-E-S? Ends with S.

Perhaps ""RIDES"" -> ends with S.

I need words ending with E.

Common words:
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E -> ends with E? E at end? Yes, because R-O-U-T-E: position 5 is E.
- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E -> ends with E, and R is at position 4? Yes.

But SPIRE: that has S, P, I, R, E. We can also test S and P and I.

We are limited to 5 letters and we need to maximize information.

Considering ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E -> positions: S1, T2, O3, R4, E5. Here R is in position 4 and we avoid position 2 for R? We are not putting R in position 2 so it's okay.

Alternatively, ""ROUTE"": R1, O2, U3, T4, E5.

But O is at position 2? That might be okay since we haven't tested O.

However, in terms of letter frequency, S and T are more common.

But we need to avoid A and C and N.

Another word: ""SPORE"" -> S-P-O-R-E.

Now, comparing:

Option 1: ""ROUTE"" 
- R (already known, position 1: we can test if it's at position 1)
- O (new at pos2)
- U (new at pos3)
- T (new at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 2: ""STORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- T (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4: we test R at position 4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 3: ""SPORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- P (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. 

Also, note that we have only 6 tries, so we need to get information.

We know that E is at position 5 and R is somewhere but not at position 2.

In ""ROUTE"": we test position 1 for R and also new letters O,U,T.

In ""STORE"": we test S,T,O and R at position 4.

Both are valid.

But perhaps ""STORE"" is better because it has more frequent letters? T and S are very common.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOBER"" but ends with R? We need ends with E? So not.

Let me choose ""STORE"". Reasons:

1. It includes letters S, T, O which are common and we haven't tested.
2. It places R at position 4, which we don't know yet.
3. It has E at the end which we already know.

So if the secret word has R at position 4, we get a check mark. Otherwise, we might get a '-'.

So let's go with ""STORE"".

But there's another option: a word that doesn't have R in the second guess? Actually, no: we must include R because we know it's present? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess any word, but it's better to include known letters to get more information.

We know R is present, so we should include it to know where it is.

Similarly, E is fixed.

So yes, include R and E.

Therefore, ""STORE"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""PRICE"" but we ruled out C? So avoid.

Or ""BRINE"" but we have N ruled out? N not present, so avoid.

So ""STORE"" is good.

We can also consider ""TROPE"" but O is at position 3? And R at position 2? We cannot do R at position 2 because we know that position is incorrect for R? So avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TROPE"": T1, R2, O3, P4, E5 -> R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect? So we would get a '-' again for R? And we don't learn the position? So inefficient.

Therefore, we avoid.

So I proceed with ""STORE"".

Guess: ""store""

But wait: the word ""STORE"" is valid? Yes.

So second guess: ""store""

<guess>store</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""–"").  
- E is in the word and in position 5 (marked ""✓"").  

Therefore:  
- The secret word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E.  
- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).  
- Avoid using C, A, or N in future guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and excluding C, A, N.  
- Prioritize testing common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information gain.  
- Given the constraints, ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) is a strong choice:  
  - It ends in E (position 5), matching known feedback.  
  - Places R in position 4 (currently untested).  
  - Introduces S, T, and O—all common letters—in positions 1, 2, and 3.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).  

This guess will help clarify:  
- If S, T, or O are in the word and their positions.  
- Whether R is correctly placed at position 4.",Guess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'
   - It includes two vowels ('A' and 'E') and three consonants.
   - These letters are among the most common in English.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, meaning E is in the word and in the 5th position)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word has the letter E in the last position (5th letter).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 2nd).
3. The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We have used 4 letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, and also the C and A were in positions 1 and 3 respectively and are absent. However, note that A was given an 'x', meaning it's not present at all.

Therefore, the word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E

Also, R is present but not in the 2nd position. So R must be in one of the first four positions, but not the second? Actually, in ""crane"", R was in position 2, so it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should avoid the letters C, A, N because they are not in the word. We should include R and E (but E is fixed at the end).

Also, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Since E is fixed at the end, and R is present, we can build a word that uses R in a different position and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Common vowels besides A (which we ruled out) are O, I, U. Consonants: we might try S, T, L, etc.

We know the word has R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Let's think of words ending with E that have R and do not have A, C, N.

We can also consider that R is not in the second position, so we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4.

One candidate word: ""ROUSE"" - but we haven't tested O, U, S.

But note: we need to confirm if these letters are present.

Another candidate: ""RINSE"" - but N was ruled out (we have N as not present), so ""rinse"" has N. Avoid.

Another: ""RAISE"" - but A is ruled out. So avoid.

So try with different letters.

Possible strategy: Include the R in the first position? Then we can test it.

Example: ""ROUTE"" - letters: R at position 1, O, U, T, E at 5th.

But we don't know if O, U, T are present.

Alternatively, we can put R in the third position: for example, ""TRIBE"" - B is new.

But note: we have E fixed at the end so both ""route"" and ""tribe"" end with E.

We also want to cover other common letters.

Another idea: ""PRICE"" - but we ruled out C (from first feedback: C is not in word). So avoid C.

Remember: avoid C, A, N.

So, let's list some words ending with E that do not contain C, A, N, and include R.

Possible words:
- ROUZE? Not a word. 
- ROUTE: yes.
- ROLES? But doesn't end with E? Roles ends with E? R-O-L-E-S -> that would be 5 letters? R-O-L-E-S is 5 letters, but the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

So we need something ending in E.

Examples: 
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E
- TRIED: T-R-I-E-D -> ends with D? No. We need E at end? Actually ""tried"" ends with D? Wait, spelling: T-R-I-E-D, last letter D? But in our case, E must be the fifth letter.

Words ending with E: such as ""alive"", but ruled out A. 

We have ""house"", ""horse"", ""worse"", ""arise"" but ruled out A.

Let me think of words ending in E that can include R.

Common words: 
- STORE: ends with E, has R? and avoids C, A, N? S-T-O-R-E -> letters: S, T, O, R, E. Avoids A, C, N? Yes.

In the feedback, we have E confirmed at the end. So STORE ends with E.

But what about R: in STORE, R is in the 4th position? We can test if R is in the word in a different position.

However, we are not sure if S, T, O are present.

But using S, T, O is good because they are common.

Another word: ""SOARE""? Not a common word? We need valid English words.

Better word: ""ROUSE"" (meaning to wake up) -> R-O-U-S-E. Ends with E? E is the fifth letter. So R, O, U, S, E.

We haven't tested O, U, S.

Alternatively, ""WRITE"" -> W-R-I-T-E. Ends with E. Avoids C, A, N? Yes.

But R is in the second position, and in the first guess R was in the second position and marked wrong (as - meaning present but wrong position). Wait: in the first guess ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got R(-). So R cannot be in position 2? Or can it? Actually the '-' means it is present but not in position 2. So in the next guess, it might be in a different position. But we can try R in position 2 again? Actually no: the '-' indicates that the correct word has the letter R, but not in the 2nd position, so R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""WRITE"", R is in position 2, which we know is not where it belongs. So we would get a '-' again, which wouldn't tell us a new position? Actually, it's not efficient because we know R should move.

So let's avoid R in second position.

Hence, better to put R in a position we haven't tested: 1, 3, or 4.

So for R in position 1: words like ""ROUSE"", ""ROAST"" but A is ruled out? So not ""ROAST"". Then ""ROUSE"", ""ROUTE"", ""ROME"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letter word.

5 letter: ""ROBES"" but ends with S? We need ends with E. So ""ROBES"" is R-O-B-E-S? Last letter S. So not E.

So: ""ROUGE"", ""RUBLE"" but B and L? 

But we have ""ROUSE"": R-O-U-S-E -> E is at the end? Positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-U, 4-S, 5-E. That works.

Alternatively, R in third position: for example, ""IRATE"" but A is ruled out? Yes, avoid A.

Or ""CRATE"" but C ruled out.

So perhaps ""TROVE"" -> T-R-O-V-E? But R is in the second position? Positions: 1-T, 2-R, 3-O, 4-V, 5-E. So R at position 2? We don't want that because we know R is not in position 2.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, R at 1 or 3 or 4.

R at position 1: ""ROUSE"" or ""ROUTE"" or ""RIPES"" (last letter S) -> so ""RIPES"" is not ending in E? We have ""RIPED""? Not a word.

""ROLES"" -> R-O-L-E-S? Ends with S.

Perhaps ""RIDES"" -> ends with S.

I need words ending with E.

Common words:
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E -> ends with E? E at end? Yes, because R-O-U-T-E: position 5 is E.
- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E -> ends with E, and R is at position 4? Yes.

But SPIRE: that has S, P, I, R, E. We can also test S and P and I.

We are limited to 5 letters and we need to maximize information.

Considering ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E -> positions: S1, T2, O3, R4, E5. Here R is in position 4 and we avoid position 2 for R? We are not putting R in position 2 so it's okay.

Alternatively, ""ROUTE"": R1, O2, U3, T4, E5.

But O is at position 2? That might be okay since we haven't tested O.

However, in terms of letter frequency, S and T are more common.

But we need to avoid A and C and N.

Another word: ""SPORE"" -> S-P-O-R-E.

Now, comparing:

Option 1: ""ROUTE"" 
- R (already known, position 1: we can test if it's at position 1)
- O (new at pos2)
- U (new at pos3)
- T (new at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 2: ""STORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- T (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4: we test R at position 4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 3: ""SPORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- P (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. 

Also, note that we have only 6 tries, so we need to get information.

We know that E is at position 5 and R is somewhere but not at position 2.

In ""ROUTE"": we test position 1 for R and also new letters O,U,T.

In ""STORE"": we test S,T,O and R at position 4.

Both are valid.

But perhaps ""STORE"" is better because it has more frequent letters? T and S are very common.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOBER"" but ends with R? We need ends with E? So not.

Let me choose ""STORE"". Reasons:

1. It includes letters S, T, O which are common and we haven't tested.
2. It places R at position 4, which we don't know yet.
3. It has E at the end which we already know.

So if the secret word has R at position 4, we get a check mark. Otherwise, we might get a '-'.

So let's go with ""STORE"".

But there's another option: a word that doesn't have R in the second guess? Actually, no: we must include R because we know it's present? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess any word, but it's better to include known letters to get more information.

We know R is present, so we should include it to know where it is.

Similarly, E is fixed.

So yes, include R and E.

Therefore, ""STORE"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""PRICE"" but we ruled out C? So avoid.

Or ""BRINE"" but we have N ruled out? N not present, so avoid.

So ""STORE"" is good.

We can also consider ""TROPE"" but O is at position 3? And R at position 2? We cannot do R at position 2 because we know that position is incorrect for R? So avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TROPE"": T1, R2, O3, P4, E5 -> R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect? So we would get a '-' again for R? And we don't learn the position? So inefficient.

Therefore, we avoid.

So I proceed with ""STORE"".

Guess: ""store""

But wait: the word ""STORE"" is valid? Yes.

So second guess: ""store""

Here R is in position 4 and we avoid position 2 for R? We are not putting R in position 2 so it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""ROUTE"": R1, O2, U3, T4, E5.\n\nBut O is at position 2? That might be okay since we haven\'t tested O.\n\nHowever, in terms of letter frequency, S and T are more common.\n\nBut we need to avoid A and C and N.\n\nAnother word: ""SPORE"" -> S-P-O-R-E.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\nOption 1: ""ROUTE"" \n- R (already known, position 1: we can test if it\'s at position 1)\n- O (new at pos2)\n- U (new at pos3)\n- T (new at pos4)\n- E (known at pos5)\n\nOption 2: ""STORE""\n- S (new at pos1)\n- T (new at pos2)\n- O (new at pos3)\n- R (known at pos4: we test R at position 4)\n- E (known at pos5)\n\nOption 3: ""SPORE""\n- S (new at pos1)\n- P (new at pos2)\n- O (new at pos3)\n- R (known at pos4)\n- E (known at pos5)\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. \n\nAlso, note that we have only 6 tries, so we need to get information.\n\nWe know that E is at position 5 and R is somewhere but not at position 2.\n\nIn ""ROUTE"": we test position 1 for R and also new letters O,U,T.\n\nIn ""STORE"": we test S,T,O and R at position 4.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut perhaps ""STORE"" is better because it has more frequent letters? T and S are very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SOBER"" but ends with R? We need ends with E? So not.\n\nLet me choose ""STORE"". Reasons:\n\n1. It includes letters S, T, O which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n2. It places R at position 4, which we don\'t know yet.\n3. It has E at the end which we already know.\n\nSo if the secret word has R at position 4, we get a check mark. Otherwise, we might get a \'-\'.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STORE"".\n\nBut there\'s another option: a word that doesn\'t have R in the second guess? Actually, no: we must include R because we know it\'s present? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess any word, but it\'s better to include known letters to get more information.\n\nWe know R is present, so we should include it to know where it is.\n\nSimilarly, E is fixed.\n\nSo yes, include R and E.\n\nTherefore, ""STORE"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRICE"" but we ruled out C? So avoid.\n\nOr ""BRINE"" but we have N ruled out? N not present, so avoid.\n\nSo ""STORE"" is good.\n\nWe can also consider ""TROPE"" but O is at position 3? And R at position 2? We cannot do R at position 2 because we know that position is incorrect for R? So avoid position 2 for R.\n\nIn ""TROPE"": T1, R2, O3, P4, E5 -> R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect? So we would get a \'-\' again for R? And we don\'t learn the position? So inefficient.\n\nTherefore, we avoid.\n\nSo I proceed with ""STORE"".\n\nGuess: ""store""\n\nBut wait: the word ""STORE"" is valid? Yes.\n\nSo second guess: ""store""\n\n<guess>store</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  \n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""–"").  \n- E is in the word and in position 5 (marked ""✓"").  \n\nTherefore:  \n- The secret word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E.  \n- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).  \n- Avoid using C, A, or N in future guesses.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and excluding C, A, N.  \n- Prioritize testing common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information gain.  \n- Given the constraints, ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) is a strong choice:  \n  - It ends in E (position 5), matching known feedback.  \n  - Places R in position 4 (currently untested).  \n  - Introduces S, T, and O—all common letters—in positions 1, 2, and 3.  \n  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).  \n\nThis guess will help clarify:  \n- If S, T, or O are in the word and their positions.  \n- Whether R is correctly placed at position 4.\n\n<guess>store</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Second guess: ""store""
- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 1st letter is S)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 4; since we know it's not in position 2, and now not in 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3? But position 1 is now S, so R must be in position 3)
- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so 5th letter is E)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with S and ends with E: S _ _ _ E
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 or 4. Since position 1 is taken by S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. So R must be in position 3: S _ R _ E
3. We know the word is S _ R _ E
4. We have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O are not in the word.

So the word is of the form: S X R Y E, where X and Y are letters to be guessed, and they cannot be C, A, N, T, O.

We need to find letters for positions 2 and 4.

We also know that the letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, A, N, T, O.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. So avoid these except R, E, S which are in the word.

But T and O are not in the word, so we avoid them.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the pattern S _ R _ E and uses new letters to test.

We can try to guess the word directly if we have a candidate, or we can use a guess to test possible letters.

Since we have only two positions to guess (position 2 and 4), and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that includes possible letters for these positions.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

List of eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O.

We know S, R, E are in the word and in positions 1,3,5.

So for position 2 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining letters.

Common letters that are not eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose common ones.

We can think of words that fit S _ R _ E.

Examples:
- SIREE? Not a common word.
- SIREN: but N is eliminated? N is not in the word, so SIREN has N, which is not allowed. Also, we know N is absent.
- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> but the pattern is S _ R _ E, so position 4 must be the letter before E? In SHRED, it's S-H-R-E-D, so positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-R, 4-E, 5-D. But we need the 5th to be E, so this doesn't fit. Also, E is at position 4, but we need it at 5.

We need the word to end with E, so the pattern is S X R Y E, meaning:
Position 1: S
Position 2: X (unknown)
Position 3: R
Position 4: Y (unknown)
Position 5: E

So the word is S X R Y E.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Common words:
- SIREE: not a standard word? It might be an obscure word, but we should use common words.
- SHIRE: S-H-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need position 3 to be R? Here position 3 is I and position 4 is R. So it doesn't match because we need R at position 3.

We need R at position 3.

So:
- SHREW: S-H-R-E-W -> ends with W, not E? So no.
- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> ends with D, not E? No.
- SIRES: S-I-R-E-S -> ends with S, not E? No.

We need the last letter to be E.

So:
- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E -> but this has two E's? And the pattern: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-E, 5-E. But we have E at position 4 and 5? But we know position 5 is E, so that's fine. But position 4 is E? And we have R at position 3? Yes.

But is ""SPREE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a period of activity.

But we have to check the letters: S, P, R, E, E.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback from ""crane"" only showed one E, but it could have more? The feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn't say anything about other Es? Actually, in ""crane"", we only had one E, and it was at position 5. But the word might have another E? However, in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't have another E in ""crane"", we don't know. But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E? So we don't know if there is a second E.

But in ""SPREE"", there are two Es. We don't have information about that.

But let's see if we can use it.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't fit because R is at position 4, not 3.

""SIRE"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

""SWORE"": but O is eliminated? O is not in the word, and ""SWORE"" has O? So avoid.

""SCARE"": but C and A are eliminated.

""SNARE"": S, N, A, R, E -> but N and A are eliminated.

So back to ""SPREE"": it fits the pattern: S P R E E.

But we have P as a new letter.

Another word: ""SERGE"": S-E-R-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-R, 4-G, 5-E. This fits: S E R G E.

But we have E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2? We only know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback from ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn't say anything about other positions. However, in ""crane"", we didn't have E in other positions? So we don't know.

But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? So we don't have information about E at position 2.

But in ""SERGE"", we have E at position 2 and 5.

Similarly, ""SPREE"" has E at position 4 and 5.

We need to test.

But we also have to avoid eliminated letters: in ""SERGE"", G is new, and in ""SPREE"", P is new.

But we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible.

But to be safe, we can choose a word that tests new letters and fits the pattern.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work because R is at 4.

""SUCRE""? Not common.

""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here R is at position 4, so it doesn't match.

We need R at position 3.

So possible words: 
- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E (R at 3)
- SERGE: S-E-R-G-E (R at 3)
- SHREW: but ends with W, not E? No.
- SHRUB: not ending with E.
- SOREX: has O and not ending with E? No.

""SURE"" is 4 letters.

""SIREE"": I think it's a word, but rare. Better to avoid.

""SMITE"": S-M-I-T-E -> but T is eliminated? T is not in the word, and ""SMITE"" has T? So avoid.

""SLIME"": S-L-I-M-E -> but I and M? But T is not in it? T is eliminated, but L, I, M are new. But R is at position 3? No, in ""SLIME"", position 3 is I, not R.

We need R at position 3.

So let's list words: S?R?E

Common ones: 
- SPREE
- SERGE
- SABRE: but A and B? A is eliminated, so no.
- SEWER: S-E-W-E-R -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R -> but ends with R, not E? And R is at position 5, but we need E at 5. So no.

""SCREE"": S-C-R-E-E -> but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.

""SPREE"" is S-P-R-E-E, which avoids C, A, N, T, O? P is not eliminated, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""SERGE"" avoids them.

But ""SPREE"" has two Es, and ""SERGE"" has two Es.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work.

""SIRE"" is 4 letters.

""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-U, 5-E. This fits: S P R U E.

And U is a new letter.

Similarly, ""SERGE"" is S E R G E.

""SPRUE"" is a word? Yes, meaning a shoot of a plant or something, but it might be less common. But Wordle accepts various words.

We can use it.

But let's see the frequency.

We have two main candidates: ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", and ""SPRUE"".

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test common ones.

In ""SPREE"", we test P and also see if there is a second E at position 4.

In ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.

In ""SPRUE"", we test P at position 2 and U at position 4.

Since we know the word has E at position 5, and we are guessing E at position 2 or 4, it might be efficient to test if E appears again.

But let's think about the feedback.

We can also consider that if we guess a word that has E in position 2, and if it's not in the word, we get feedback.

But we have limited guesses.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have E at position 2 or 4, but uses different letters to narrow down.

For example, we know the pattern is S _ R _ E, so we can guess a word like ""SHRED"" but it doesn't end with E? No.

Or ""SPRIG"" but doesn't end with E.

We must end with E? No, we can guess any word, not necessarily fitting the pattern, to test letters.

But it might be more efficient to guess a word that fits the pattern to hit the solution.

Since we have only two positions, we can try to solve it.

But let's see how many possibilities.

The word is S X R Y E, with X and Y being letters not in {C, A, N, T, O} and not S, R, E (but E can be repeated?).

Possible X and Y.

Common letters for X: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

For Y: similarly.

But Y could be E? Then we have S X R E E.

For example, ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"" (which is S E R G E, so X=E, Y=G).

But if X=E, that means E is at position 2.

Similarly, if Y=E, then E at position 4.

Now, from previous feedback, we have no information about E at position 2 or 4.

In ""crane"", we had no E at position 2? ""crane"" had E at position 5, but not at other positions? We didn't test position 2 for E.

Similarly in ""store"", we had E at position 5, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E at position 5? Actually, ""store"" is S-T-O-R-E, so E only at 5.

So we don't know about other positions.

To maximize information, we can guess a word that has many new letters and fits the pattern.

Let's choose ""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E.

This way, we test P and U.

If we get feedback:

- If P is correct at position 2, then X=P.
- If U is correct at position 4, then Y=U.
- If not, we get more information.

Similarly, if we guess ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.

But if we guess ""SERGE"" and the word has E at position 2, we get a ✓ for E at position 2, which is new information.

But if not, we know E is not at position 2.

Similarly for G.

But we have to consider that E might be at position 2, but we don't know.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work.

""SULRE""? Not a word.

""SKIVE"": S-K-I-V-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-K, 3-I, 4-V, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's I, not R. So no.

We must have R at position 3.

So I think ""SPRUE"" is a good choice.

Or ""SPREE"".

But ""SPREE"" has E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word doesn't have it.

Perhaps ""SPRUE"" is better because it has two new letters.

Let's look for more common words.

""SIEGE"": S-I-E-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-I, 3-E, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's E, not R. So no.

""SCREW"" not ending with E.

I think ""SPRUE"" or ""SERGE"" are reasonable.

But let's check the feedback from the second guess again.

In ""store"", we had:
- S: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- T: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but not position 4)
- E: ✓ (position 5 correct)

And from first guess, R not in position 2.

So R must be in position 3.

So the word is S _ R _ E.

Now, for the third guess, I propose ""spruce"" but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.

""SPRUE"" is S-P-R-U-E.

Yes.

Or ""SERIF"" but ends with F, not E? No.

So I'll go with ""SPRUE"".

But is ""SPRUE"" a valid Wordle word? I think so.

To be more common, ""SHARE"" but A is eliminated.

Another one: ""STIRE""? Not a word.

""SPIRE"" has R at position 4, not 3.

So ""SPRUE"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""SEDGE"": S-E-D-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-D, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's D, not R. So no.

We must have R at position 3.

So the only common words are ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", ""SPRUE"", and perhaps ""SABRE"" but A eliminated.

""SWIRL"" not ending with E.

I think ""SPRUE"" is fine.

So let's guess ""SPRUE"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S P R U E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:R, 4:U, 5:E. Yes, R at position 3.

And U at position 4.

So we are testing P and U.

If the word is ""SPREE"", we would have Y=E, but we are guessing U, so it would show U as not present or wrong position.

But we'll see.

So I'll go with ""SPRUE"".

<guess>sprue</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(–) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - C, A, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: store** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(–) E(✓)  
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  - R is in the word but not in position 4 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1).
  - T and O are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **S** (position 1) and ends with **E** (position 5): **S _ _ _ E**.
- **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback). Since position 1 is S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. Thus, the word is **S _ R _ E**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O (not in the word).
- Known letters in the word: S, R, E (with S in position 1, R in position 3, E in position 5).
- Unknown positions: 2 and 4. These must be filled with letters not eliminated (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 2 and 4 while avoiding eliminated letters.
- The guess should fit the pattern **S _ R _ E** to efficiently narrow down possibilities.
- We choose **SPRUE** (S-P-R-U-E) because:
  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), P (position 2), R (position 3), U (position 4), E (position 5).
  - It tests new common letters: **P** (position 2) and **U** (position 4).
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, T, O).
- This guess will directly reveal if P or U are in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>sprue</guess>",sprue,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Second guess: ""store""
- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 1st letter is S)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 4; since we know it's not in position 2, and now not in 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3? But position 1 is now S, so R must be in position 3)
- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so 5th letter is E)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with S and ends with E: S _ _ _ E
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 or 4. Since position 1 is taken by S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. So R must be in position 3: S _ R _ E
3. We know the word is S _ R _ E
4. We have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O are not in the word.

So the word is of the form: S X R Y E, where X and Y are letters to be guessed, and they cannot be C, A, N, T, O.

We need to find letters for positions 2 and 4.

We also know that the letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, A, N, T, O.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. So avoid these except R, E, S which are in the word.

But T and O are not in the word, so we avoid them.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the pattern S _ R _ E and uses new letters to test.

We can try to guess the word directly if we have a candidate, or we can use a guess to test possible letters.

Since we have only two positions to guess (position 2 and 4), and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that includes possible letters for these positions.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

List of eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O.

We know S, R, E are in the word and in positions 1,3,5.

So for position 2 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining letters.

Common letters that are not eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose common ones.

We can think of words that fit S _ R _ E.

Examples:
- SIREE? Not a common word.
- SIREN: but N is eliminated? N is not in the word, so SIREN has N, which is not allowed. Also, we know N is absent.
- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> but the pattern is S _ R _ E, so position 4 must be the letter before E? In SHRED, it's S-H-R-E-D, so positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-R, 4-E, 5-D. But we need the 5th to be E, so this doesn't fit. Also, E is at position 4, but we need it at 5.

We need the word to end with E, so the pattern is S X R Y E, meaning:
Position 1: S
Position 2: X (unknown)
Position 3: R
Position 4: Y (unknown)
Position 5: E

So the word is S X R Y E.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Common words:
- SIREE: not a standard word? It might be an obscure word, but we should use common words.
- SHIRE: S-H-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need position 3 to be R? Here position 3 is I and position 4 is R. So it doesn't match because we need R at position 3.

We need R at position 3.

So:
- SHREW: S-H-R-E-W -> ends with W, not E? So no.
- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> ends with D, not E? No.
- SIRES: S-I-R-E-S -> ends with S, not E? No.

We need the last letter to be E.

So:
- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E -> but this has two E's? And the pattern: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-E, 5-E. But we have E at position 4 and 5? But we know position 5 is E, so that's fine. But position 4 is E? And we have R at position 3? Yes.

But is ""SPREE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a period of activity.

But we have to check the letters: S, P, R, E, E.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback from ""crane"" only showed one E, but it could have more? The feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn't say anything about other Es? Actually, in ""crane"", we only had one E, and it was at position 5. But the word might have another E? However, in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't have another E in ""crane"", we don't know. But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E? So we don't know if there is a second E.

But in ""SPREE"", there are two Es. We don't have information about that.

But let's see if we can use it.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't fit because R is at position 4, not 3.

""SIRE"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

""SWORE"": but O is eliminated? O is not in the word, and ""SWORE"" has O? So avoid.

""SCARE"": but C and A are eliminated.

""SNARE"": S, N, A, R, E -> but N and A are eliminated.

So back to ""SPREE"": it fits the pattern: S P R E E.

But we have P as a new letter.

Another word: ""SERGE"": S-E-R-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-R, 4-G, 5-E. This fits: S E R G E.

But we have E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2? We only know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback from ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn't say anything about other positions. However, in ""crane"", we didn't have E in other positions? So we don't know.

But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? So we don't have information about E at position 2.

But in ""SERGE"", we have E at position 2 and 5.

Similarly, ""SPREE"" has E at position 4 and 5.

We need to test.

But we also have to avoid eliminated letters: in ""SERGE"", G is new, and in ""SPREE"", P is new.

But we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible.

But to be safe, we can choose a word that tests new letters and fits the pattern.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work because R is at 4.

""SUCRE""? Not common.

""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here R is at position 4, so it doesn't match.

We need R at position 3.

So possible words: 
- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E (R at 3)
- SERGE: S-E-R-G-E (R at 3)
- SHREW: but ends with W, not E? No.
- SHRUB: not ending with E.
- SOREX: has O and not ending with E? No.

""SURE"" is 4 letters.

""SIREE"": I think it's a word, but rare. Better to avoid.

""SMITE"": S-M-I-T-E -> but T is eliminated? T is not in the word, and ""SMITE"" has T? So avoid.

""SLIME"": S-L-I-M-E -> but I and M? But T is not in it? T is eliminated, but L, I, M are new. But R is at position 3? No, in ""SLIME"", position 3 is I, not R.

We need R at position 3.

So let's list words: S?R?E

Common ones: 
- SPREE
- SERGE
- SABRE: but A and B? A is eliminated, so no.
- SEWER: S-E-W-E-R -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R -> but ends with R, not E? And R is at position 5, but we need E at 5. So no.

""SCREE"": S-C-R-E-E -> but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.

""SPREE"" is S-P-R-E-E, which avoids C, A, N, T, O? P is not eliminated, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""SERGE"" avoids them.

But ""SPREE"" has two Es, and ""SERGE"" has two Es.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work.

""SIRE"" is 4 letters.

""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-U, 5-E. This fits: S P R U E.

And U is a new letter.

Similarly, ""SERGE"" is S E R G E.

""SPRUE"" is a word? Yes, meaning a shoot of a plant or something, but it might be less common. But Wordle accepts various words.

We can use it.

But let's see the frequency.

We have two main candidates: ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", and ""SPRUE"".

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test common ones.

In ""SPREE"", we test P and also see if there is a second E at position 4.

In ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.

In ""SPRUE"", we test P at position 2 and U at position 4.

Since we know the word has E at position 5, and we are guessing E at position 2 or 4, it might be efficient to test if E appears again.

But let's think about the feedback.

We can also consider that if we guess a word that has E in position 2, and if it's not in the word, we get feedback.

But we have limited guesses.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have E at position 2 or 4, but uses different letters to narrow down.

For example, we know the pattern is S _ R _ E, so we can guess a word like ""SHRED"" but it doesn't end with E? No.

Or ""SPRIG"" but doesn't end with E.

We must end with E? No, we can guess any word, not necessarily fitting the pattern, to test letters.

But it might be more efficient to guess a word that fits the pattern to hit the solution.

Since we have only two positions, we can try to solve it.

But let's see how many possibilities.

The word is S X R Y E, with X and Y being letters not in {C, A, N, T, O} and not S, R, E (but E can be repeated?).

Possible X and Y.

Common letters for X: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

For Y: similarly.

But Y could be E? Then we have S X R E E.

For example, ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"" (which is S E R G E, so X=E, Y=G).

But if X=E, that means E is at position 2.

Similarly, if Y=E, then E at position 4.

Now, from previous feedback, we have no information about E at position 2 or 4.

In ""crane"", we had no E at position 2? ""crane"" had E at position 5, but not at other positions? We didn't test position 2 for E.

Similarly in ""store"", we had E at position 5, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E at position 5? Actually, ""store"" is S-T-O-R-E, so E only at 5.

So we don't know about other positions.

To maximize information, we can guess a word that has many new letters and fits the pattern.

Let's choose ""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E.

This way, we test P and U.

If we get feedback:

- If P is correct at position 2, then X=P.
- If U is correct at position 4, then Y=U.
- If not, we get more information.

Similarly, if we guess ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.

But if we guess ""SERGE"" and the word has E at position 2, we get a ✓ for E at position 2, which is new information.

But if not, we know E is not at position 2.

Similarly for G.

But we have to consider that E might be at position 2, but we don't know.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work.

""SULRE""? Not a word.

""SKIVE"": S-K-I-V-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-K, 3-I, 4-V, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's I, not R. So no.

We must have R at position 3.

So I think ""SPRUE"" is a good choice.

Or ""SPREE"".

But ""SPREE"" has E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word doesn't have it.

Perhaps ""SPRUE"" is better because it has two new letters.

Let's look for more common words.

""SIEGE"": S-I-E-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-I, 3-E, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's E, not R. So no.

""SCREW"" not ending with E.

I think ""SPRUE"" or ""SERGE"" are reasonable.

But let's check the feedback from the second guess again.

In ""store"", we had:
- S: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- T: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but not position 4)
- E: ✓ (position 5 correct)

And from first guess, R not in position 2.

So R must be in position 3.

So the word is S _ R _ E.

Now, for the third guess, I propose ""spruce"" but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.

""SPRUE"" is S-P-R-U-E.

Yes.

Or ""SERIF"" but ends with F, not E? No.

So I'll go with ""SPRUE"".

But is ""SPRUE"" a valid Wordle word? I think so.

To be more common, ""SHARE"" but A is eliminated.

Another one: ""STIRE""? Not a word.

""SPIRE"" has R at position 4, not 3.

So ""SPRUE"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""SEDGE"": S-E-D-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-D, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's D, not R. So no.

We must have R at position 3.

So the only common words are ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", ""SPRUE"", and perhaps ""SABRE"" but A eliminated.

""SWIRL"" not ending with E.

I think ""SPRUE"" is fine.

So let's guess ""SPRUE"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S P R U E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:R, 4:U, 5:E. Yes, R at position 3.

And U at position 4.

So we are testing P and U.

If the word is ""SPREE"", we would have Y=E, but we are guessing U, so it would show U as not present or wrong position.

But we'll see.

So I'll go with ""SPRUE"".

<guess>sprue</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(–) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - C, A, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: store** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(–) E(✓)  
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  - R is in the word but not in position 4 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1).
  - T and O are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **S** (position 1) and ends with **E** (position 5): **S _ _ _ E**.
- **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback). Since position 1 is S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. Thus, the word is **S _ R _ E**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O (not in the word).
- Known letters in the word: S, R, E (with S in position 1, R in position 3, E in position 5).
- Unknown positions: 2 and 4. These must be filled with letters not eliminated (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 2 and 4 while avoiding eliminated letters.
- The guess should fit the pattern **S _ R _ E** to efficiently narrow down possibilities.
- We choose **SPRUE** (S-P-R-U-E) because:
  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), P (position 2), R (position 3), U (position 4), E (position 5).
  - It tests new common letters: **P** (position 2) and **U** (position 4).
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, T, O).
- This guess will directly reveal if P or U are in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to the solution.",Guess 3: sprue -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) R(✓) U(x) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'
   - It includes two vowels ('A' and 'E') and three consonants.
   - These letters are among the most common in English.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, meaning E is in the word and in the 5th position)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word has the letter E in the last position (5th letter).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 2nd).
3. The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We have used 4 letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, and also the C and A were in positions 1 and 3 respectively and are absent. However, note that A was given an 'x', meaning it's not present at all.

Therefore, the word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E

Also, R is present but not in the 2nd position. So R must be in one of the first four positions, but not the second? Actually, in ""crane"", R was in position 2, so it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should avoid the letters C, A, N because they are not in the word. We should include R and E (but E is fixed at the end).

Also, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Since E is fixed at the end, and R is present, we can build a word that uses R in a different position and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Common vowels besides A (which we ruled out) are O, I, U. Consonants: we might try S, T, L, etc.

We know the word has R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Let's think of words ending with E that have R and do not have A, C, N.

We can also consider that R is not in the second position, so we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4.

One candidate word: ""ROUSE"" - but we haven't tested O, U, S.

But note: we need to confirm if these letters are present.

Another candidate: ""RINSE"" - but N was ruled out (we have N as not present), so ""rinse"" has N. Avoid.

Another: ""RAISE"" - but A is ruled out. So avoid.

So try with different letters.

Possible strategy: Include the R in the first position? Then we can test it.

Example: ""ROUTE"" - letters: R at position 1, O, U, T, E at 5th.

But we don't know if O, U, T are present.

Alternatively, we can put R in the third position: for example, ""TRIBE"" - B is new.

But note: we have E fixed at the end so both ""route"" and ""tribe"" end with E.

We also want to cover other common letters.

Another idea: ""PRICE"" - but we ruled out C (from first feedback: C is not in word). So avoid C.

Remember: avoid C, A, N.

So, let's list some words ending with E that do not contain C, A, N, and include R.

Possible words:
- ROUZE? Not a word. 
- ROUTE: yes.
- ROLES? But doesn't end with E? Roles ends with E? R-O-L-E-S -> that would be 5 letters? R-O-L-E-S is 5 letters, but the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

So we need something ending in E.

Examples: 
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E
- TRIED: T-R-I-E-D -> ends with D? No. We need E at end? Actually ""tried"" ends with D? Wait, spelling: T-R-I-E-D, last letter D? But in our case, E must be the fifth letter.

Words ending with E: such as ""alive"", but ruled out A. 

We have ""house"", ""horse"", ""worse"", ""arise"" but ruled out A.

Let me think of words ending in E that can include R.

Common words: 
- STORE: ends with E, has R? and avoids C, A, N? S-T-O-R-E -> letters: S, T, O, R, E. Avoids A, C, N? Yes.

In the feedback, we have E confirmed at the end. So STORE ends with E.

But what about R: in STORE, R is in the 4th position? We can test if R is in the word in a different position.

However, we are not sure if S, T, O are present.

But using S, T, O is good because they are common.

Another word: ""SOARE""? Not a common word? We need valid English words.

Better word: ""ROUSE"" (meaning to wake up) -> R-O-U-S-E. Ends with E? E is the fifth letter. So R, O, U, S, E.

We haven't tested O, U, S.

Alternatively, ""WRITE"" -> W-R-I-T-E. Ends with E. Avoids C, A, N? Yes.

But R is in the second position, and in the first guess R was in the second position and marked wrong (as - meaning present but wrong position). Wait: in the first guess ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got R(-). So R cannot be in position 2? Or can it? Actually the '-' means it is present but not in position 2. So in the next guess, it might be in a different position. But we can try R in position 2 again? Actually no: the '-' indicates that the correct word has the letter R, but not in the 2nd position, so R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""WRITE"", R is in position 2, which we know is not where it belongs. So we would get a '-' again, which wouldn't tell us a new position? Actually, it's not efficient because we know R should move.

So let's avoid R in second position.

Hence, better to put R in a position we haven't tested: 1, 3, or 4.

So for R in position 1: words like ""ROUSE"", ""ROAST"" but A is ruled out? So not ""ROAST"". Then ""ROUSE"", ""ROUTE"", ""ROME"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letter word.

5 letter: ""ROBES"" but ends with S? We need ends with E. So ""ROBES"" is R-O-B-E-S? Last letter S. So not E.

So: ""ROUGE"", ""RUBLE"" but B and L? 

But we have ""ROUSE"": R-O-U-S-E -> E is at the end? Positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-U, 4-S, 5-E. That works.

Alternatively, R in third position: for example, ""IRATE"" but A is ruled out? Yes, avoid A.

Or ""CRATE"" but C ruled out.

So perhaps ""TROVE"" -> T-R-O-V-E? But R is in the second position? Positions: 1-T, 2-R, 3-O, 4-V, 5-E. So R at position 2? We don't want that because we know R is not in position 2.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, R at 1 or 3 or 4.

R at position 1: ""ROUSE"" or ""ROUTE"" or ""RIPES"" (last letter S) -> so ""RIPES"" is not ending in E? We have ""RIPED""? Not a word.

""ROLES"" -> R-O-L-E-S? Ends with S.

Perhaps ""RIDES"" -> ends with S.

I need words ending with E.

Common words:
- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E -> ends with E? E at end? Yes, because R-O-U-T-E: position 5 is E.
- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E -> ends with E, and R is at position 4? Yes.

But SPIRE: that has S, P, I, R, E. We can also test S and P and I.

We are limited to 5 letters and we need to maximize information.

Considering ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E -> positions: S1, T2, O3, R4, E5. Here R is in position 4 and we avoid position 2 for R? We are not putting R in position 2 so it's okay.

Alternatively, ""ROUTE"": R1, O2, U3, T4, E5.

But O is at position 2? That might be okay since we haven't tested O.

However, in terms of letter frequency, S and T are more common.

But we need to avoid A and C and N.

Another word: ""SPORE"" -> S-P-O-R-E.

Now, comparing:

Option 1: ""ROUTE"" 
- R (already known, position 1: we can test if it's at position 1)
- O (new at pos2)
- U (new at pos3)
- T (new at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 2: ""STORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- T (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4: we test R at position 4)
- E (known at pos5)

Option 3: ""SPORE""
- S (new at pos1)
- P (new at pos2)
- O (new at pos3)
- R (known at pos4)
- E (known at pos5)

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. 

Also, note that we have only 6 tries, so we need to get information.

We know that E is at position 5 and R is somewhere but not at position 2.

In ""ROUTE"": we test position 1 for R and also new letters O,U,T.

In ""STORE"": we test S,T,O and R at position 4.

Both are valid.

But perhaps ""STORE"" is better because it has more frequent letters? T and S are very common.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOBER"" but ends with R? We need ends with E? So not.

Let me choose ""STORE"". Reasons:

1. It includes letters S, T, O which are common and we haven't tested.
2. It places R at position 4, which we don't know yet.
3. It has E at the end which we already know.

So if the secret word has R at position 4, we get a check mark. Otherwise, we might get a '-'.

So let's go with ""STORE"".

But there's another option: a word that doesn't have R in the second guess? Actually, no: we must include R because we know it's present? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess any word, but it's better to include known letters to get more information.

We know R is present, so we should include it to know where it is.

Similarly, E is fixed.

So yes, include R and E.

Therefore, ""STORE"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""PRICE"" but we ruled out C? So avoid.

Or ""BRINE"" but we have N ruled out? N not present, so avoid.

So ""STORE"" is good.

We can also consider ""TROPE"" but O is at position 3? And R at position 2? We cannot do R at position 2 because we know that position is incorrect for R? So avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TROPE"": T1, R2, O3, P4, E5 -> R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect? So we would get a '-' again for R? And we don't learn the position? So inefficient.

Therefore, we avoid.

So I proceed with ""STORE"".

Guess: ""store""

But wait: the word ""STORE"" is valid? Yes.

So second guess: ""store""

<guess>store</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""–"").  
- E is in the word and in position 5 (marked ""✓"").  

Therefore:  
- The secret word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E.  
- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).  
- Avoid using C, A, or N in future guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and excluding C, A, N.  
- Prioritize testing common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information gain.  
- Given the constraints, ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) is a strong choice:  
  - It ends in E (position 5), matching known feedback.  
  - Places R in position 4 (currently untested).  
  - Introduces S, T, and O—all common letters—in positions 1, 2, and 3.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).  

This guess will help clarify:  
- If S, T, or O are in the word and their positions.  
- Whether R is correctly placed at position 4.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Second guess: ""store""
- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 1st letter is S)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 4; since we know it's not in position 2, and now not in 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3? But position 1 is now S, so R must be in position 3)
- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so 5th letter is E)

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with S and ends with E: S _ _ _ E
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 or 4. Since position 1 is taken by S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. So R must be in position 3: S _ R _ E
3. We know the word is S _ R _ E
4. We have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O are not in the word.

So the word is of the form: S X R Y E, where X and Y are letters to be guessed, and they cannot be C, A, N, T, O.

We need to find letters for positions 2 and 4.

We also know that the letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, A, N, T, O.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. So avoid these except R, E, S which are in the word.

But T and O are not in the word, so we avoid them.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the pattern S _ R _ E and uses new letters to test.

We can try to guess the word directly if we have a candidate, or we can use a guess to test possible letters.

Since we have only two positions to guess (position 2 and 4), and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that includes possible letters for these positions.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

List of eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O.

We know S, R, E are in the word and in positions 1,3,5.

So for position 2 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining letters.

Common letters that are not eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose common ones.

We can think of words that fit S _ R _ E.

Examples:
- SIREE? Not a common word.
- SIREN: but N is eliminated? N is not in the word, so SIREN has N, which is not allowed. Also, we know N is absent.
- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> but the pattern is S _ R _ E, so position 4 must be the letter before E? In SHRED, it's S-H-R-E-D, so positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-R, 4-E, 5-D. But we need the 5th to be E, so this doesn't fit. Also, E is at position 4, but we need it at 5.

We need the word to end with E, so the pattern is S X R Y E, meaning:
Position 1: S
Position 2: X (unknown)
Position 3: R
Position 4: Y (unknown)
Position 5: E

So the word is S X R Y E.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Common words:
- SIREE: not a standard word? It might be an obscure word, but we should use common words.
- SHIRE: S-H-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need position 3 to be R? Here position 3 is I and position 4 is R. So it doesn't match because we need R at position 3.

We need R at position 3.

So:
- SHREW: S-H-R-E-W -> ends with W, not E? So no.
- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> ends with D, not E? No.
- SIRES: S-I-R-E-S -> ends with S, not E? No.

We need the last letter to be E.

So:
- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E -> but this has two E's? And the pattern: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-E, 5-E. But we have E at position 4 and 5? But we know position 5 is E, so that's fine. But position 4 is E? And we have R at position 3? Yes.

But is ""SPREE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a period of activity.

But we have to check the letters: S, P, R, E, E.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback from ""crane"" only showed one E, but it could have more? The feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn't say anything about other Es? Actually, in ""crane"", we only had one E, and it was at position 5. But the word might have another E? However, in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't have another E in ""crane"", we don't know. But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E? So we don't know if there is a second E.

But in ""SPREE"", there are two Es. We don't have information about that.

But let's see if we can use it.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't fit because R is at position 4, not 3.

""SIRE"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

""SWORE"": but O is eliminated? O is not in the word, and ""SWORE"" has O? So avoid.

""SCARE"": but C and A are eliminated.

""SNARE"": S, N, A, R, E -> but N and A are eliminated.

So back to ""SPREE"": it fits the pattern: S P R E E.

But we have P as a new letter.

Another word: ""SERGE"": S-E-R-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-R, 4-G, 5-E. This fits: S E R G E.

But we have E at position 2? We don't know if E is at position 2? We only know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback from ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn't say anything about other positions. However, in ""crane"", we didn't have E in other positions? So we don't know.

But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? So we don't have information about E at position 2.

But in ""SERGE"", we have E at position 2 and 5.

Similarly, ""SPREE"" has E at position 4 and 5.

We need to test.

But we also have to avoid eliminated letters: in ""SERGE"", G is new, and in ""SPREE"", P is new.

But we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible.

But to be safe, we can choose a word that tests new letters and fits the pattern.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work because R is at 4.

""SUCRE""? Not common.

""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here R is at position 4, so it doesn't match.

We need R at position 3.

So possible words: 
- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E (R at 3)
- SERGE: S-E-R-G-E (R at 3)
- SHREW: but ends with W, not E? No.
- SHRUB: not ending with E.
- SOREX: has O and not ending with E? No.

""SURE"" is 4 letters.

""SIREE"": I think it's a word, but rare. Better to avoid.

""SMITE"": S-M-I-T-E -> but T is eliminated? T is not in the word, and ""SMITE"" has T? So avoid.

""SLIME"": S-L-I-M-E -> but I and M? But T is not in it? T is eliminated, but L, I, M are new. But R is at position 3? No, in ""SLIME"", position 3 is I, not R.

We need R at position 3.

So let's list words: S?R?E

Common ones: 
- SPREE
- SERGE
- SABRE: but A and B? A is eliminated, so no.
- SEWER: S-E-W-E-R -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R -> but ends with R, not E? And R is at position 5, but we need E at 5. So no.

""SCREE"": S-C-R-E-E -> but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.

""SPREE"" is S-P-R-E-E, which avoids C, A, N, T, O? P is not eliminated, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""SERGE"" avoids them.

But ""SPREE"" has two Es, and ""SERGE"" has two Es.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work.

""SIRE"" is 4 letters.

""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-U, 5-E. This fits: S P R U E.

And U is a new letter.

Similarly, ""SERGE"" is S E R G E.

""SPRUE"" is a word? Yes, meaning a shoot of a plant or something, but it might be less common. But Wordle accepts various words.

We can use it.

But let's see the frequency.

We have two main candidates: ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", and ""SPRUE"".

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test common ones.

In ""SPREE"", we test P and also see if there is a second E at position 4.

In ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.

In ""SPRUE"", we test P at position 2 and U at position 4.

Since we know the word has E at position 5, and we are guessing E at position 2 or 4, it might be efficient to test if E appears again.

But let's think about the feedback.

We can also consider that if we guess a word that has E in position 2, and if it's not in the word, we get feedback.

But we have limited guesses.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have E at position 2 or 4, but uses different letters to narrow down.

For example, we know the pattern is S _ R _ E, so we can guess a word like ""SHRED"" but it doesn't end with E? No.

Or ""SPRIG"" but doesn't end with E.

We must end with E? No, we can guess any word, not necessarily fitting the pattern, to test letters.

But it might be more efficient to guess a word that fits the pattern to hit the solution.

Since we have only two positions, we can try to solve it.

But let's see how many possibilities.

The word is S X R Y E, with X and Y being letters not in {C, A, N, T, O} and not S, R, E (but E can be repeated?).

Possible X and Y.

Common letters for X: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

For Y: similarly.

But Y could be E? Then we have S X R E E.

For example, ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"" (which is S E R G E, so X=E, Y=G).

But if X=E, that means E is at position 2.

Similarly, if Y=E, then E at position 4.

Now, from previous feedback, we have no information about E at position 2 or 4.

In ""crane"", we had no E at position 2? ""crane"" had E at position 5, but not at other positions? We didn't test position 2 for E.

Similarly in ""store"", we had E at position 5, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E at position 5? Actually, ""store"" is S-T-O-R-E, so E only at 5.

So we don't know about other positions.

To maximize information, we can guess a word that has many new letters and fits the pattern.

Let's choose ""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E.

This way, we test P and U.

If we get feedback:

- If P is correct at position 2, then X=P.
- If U is correct at position 4, then Y=U.
- If not, we get more information.

Similarly, if we guess ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.

But if we guess ""SERGE"" and the word has E at position 2, we get a ✓ for E at position 2, which is new information.

But if not, we know E is not at position 2.

Similarly for G.

But we have to consider that E might be at position 2, but we don't know.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn't work.

""SULRE""? Not a word.

""SKIVE"": S-K-I-V-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-K, 3-I, 4-V, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's I, not R. So no.

We must have R at position 3.

So I think ""SPRUE"" is a good choice.

Or ""SPREE"".

But ""SPREE"" has E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word doesn't have it.

Perhaps ""SPRUE"" is better because it has two new letters.

Let's look for more common words.

""SIEGE"": S-I-E-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-I, 3-E, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's E, not R. So no.

""SCREW"" not ending with E.

I think ""SPRUE"" or ""SERGE"" are reasonable.

But let's check the feedback from the second guess again.

In ""store"", we had:
- S: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- T: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but not position 4)
- E: ✓ (position 5 correct)

And from first guess, R not in position 2.

So R must be in position 3.

So the word is S _ R _ E.

Now, for the third guess, I propose ""spruce"" but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.

""SPRUE"" is S-P-R-U-E.

Yes.

Or ""SERIF"" but ends with F, not E? No.

So I'll go with ""SPRUE"".

But is ""SPRUE"" a valid Wordle word? I think so.

To be more common, ""SHARE"" but A is eliminated.

Another one: ""STIRE""? Not a word.

""SPIRE"" has R at position 4, not 3.

So ""SPRUE"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""SEDGE"": S-E-D-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-D, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it's D, not R. So no.

We must have R at position 3.

So the only common words are ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", ""SPRUE"", and perhaps ""SABRE"" but A eliminated.

""SWIRL"" not ending with E.

I think ""SPRUE"" is fine.

So let's guess ""SPRUE"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S P R U E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:R, 4:U, 5:E. Yes, R at position 3.

And U at position 4.

So we are testing P and U.

If the word is ""SPREE"", we would have Y=E, but we are guessing U, so it would show U as not present or wrong position.

But we'll see.

So I'll go with ""SPRUE"".

<guess>sprue</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(–) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - C, A, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: store** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(–) E(✓)  
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  - R is in the word but not in position 4 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1).
  - T and O are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **S** (position 1) and ends with **E** (position 5): **S _ _ _ E**.
- **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback). Since position 1 is S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. Thus, the word is **S _ R _ E**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O (not in the word).
- Known letters in the word: S, R, E (with S in position 1, R in position 3, E in position 5).
- Unknown positions: 2 and 4. These must be filled with letters not eliminated (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 2 and 4 while avoiding eliminated letters.
- The guess should fit the pattern **S _ R _ E** to efficiently narrow down possibilities.
- We choose **SPRUE** (S-P-R-U-E) because:
  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), P (position 2), R (position 3), U (position 4), E (position 5).
  - It tests new common letters: **P** (position 2) and **U** (position 4).
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, T, O).
- This guess will directly reveal if P or U are in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to the solution.

The secret word has the letter E in the last position (5th letter).\n2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 2nd).\n3. The letters C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nWe have used 4 letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, and also the C and A were in positions 1 and 3 respectively and are absent. However, note that A was given an \'x\', meaning it\'s not present at all.\n\nTherefore, the word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAlso, R is present but not in the 2nd position. So R must be in one of the first four positions, but not the second? Actually, in ""crane"", R was in position 2, so it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess. We should avoid the letters C, A, N because they are not in the word. We should include R and E (but E is fixed at the end).\n\nAlso, we should try to include other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet. Since E is fixed at the end, and R is present, we can build a word that uses R in a different position and includes other vowels or common consonants.\n\nCommon vowels besides A (which we ruled out) are O, I, U. Consonants: we might try S, T, L, etc.\n\nWe know the word has R and E, and excludes C, A, N.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that have R and do not have A, C, N.\n\nWe can also consider that R is not in the second position, so we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nOne candidate word: ""ROUSE"" - but we haven\'t tested O, U, S.\n\nBut note: we need to confirm if these letters are present.\n\nAnother candidate: ""RINSE"" - but N was ruled out (we have N as not present), so ""rinse"" has N. Avoid.\n\nAnother: ""RAISE"" - but A is ruled out. So avoid.\n\nSo try with different letters.\n\nPossible strategy: Include the R in the first position? Then we can test it.\n\nExample: ""ROUTE"" - letters: R at position 1, O, U, T, E at 5th.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O, U, T are present.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R in the third position: for example, ""TRIBE"" - B is new.\n\nBut note: we have E fixed at the end so both ""route"" and ""tribe"" end with E.\n\nWe also want to cover other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""PRICE"" - but we ruled out C (from first feedback: C is not in word). So avoid C.\n\nRemember: avoid C, A, N.\n\nSo, let\'s list some words ending with E that do not contain C, A, N, and include R.\n\nPossible words:\n- ROUZE? Not a word. \n- ROUTE: yes.\n- ROLES? But doesn\'t end with E? Roles ends with E? R-O-L-E-S -> that would be 5 letters? R-O-L-E-S is 5 letters, but the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.\n\nSo we need something ending in E.\n\nExamples: \n- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E\n- TRIED: T-R-I-E-D -> ends with D? No. We need E at end? Actually ""tried"" ends with D? Wait, spelling: T-R-I-E-D, last letter D? But in our case, E must be the fifth letter.\n\nWords ending with E: such as ""alive"", but ruled out A. \n\nWe have ""house"", ""horse"", ""worse"", ""arise"" but ruled out A.\n\nLet me think of words ending in E that can include R.\n\nCommon words: \n- STORE: ends with E, has R? and avoids C, A, N? S-T-O-R-E -> letters: S, T, O, R, E. Avoids A, C, N? Yes.\n\nIn the feedback, we have E confirmed at the end. So STORE ends with E.\n\nBut what about R: in STORE, R is in the 4th position? We can test if R is in the word in a different position.\n\nHowever, we are not sure if S, T, O are present.\n\nBut using S, T, O is good because they are common.\n\nAnother word: ""SOARE""? Not a common word? We need valid English words.\n\nBetter word: ""ROUSE"" (meaning to wake up) -> R-O-U-S-E. Ends with E? E is the fifth letter. So R, O, U, S, E.\n\nWe haven\'t tested O, U, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""WRITE"" -> W-R-I-T-E. Ends with E. Avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n\nBut R is in the second position, and in the first guess R was in the second position and marked wrong (as - meaning present but wrong position). Wait: in the first guess ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got R(-). So R cannot be in position 2? Or can it? Actually the \'-\' means it is present but not in position 2. So in the next guess, it might be in a different position. But we can try R in position 2 again? Actually no: the \'-\' indicates that the correct word has the letter R, but not in the 2nd position, so R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nTherefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a \'-\' again? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nIn ""WRITE"", R is in position 2, which we know is not where it belongs. So we would get a \'-\' again, which wouldn\'t tell us a new position? Actually, it\'s not efficient because we know R should move.\n\nSo let\'s avoid R in second position.\n\nHence, better to put R in a position we haven\'t tested: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSo for R in position 1: words like ""ROUSE"", ""ROAST"" but A is ruled out? So not ""ROAST"". Then ""ROUSE"", ""ROUTE"", ""ROME"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letter word.\n\n5 letter: ""ROBES"" but ends with S? We need ends with E. So ""ROBES"" is R-O-B-E-S? Last letter S. So not E.\n\nSo: ""ROUGE"", ""RUBLE"" but B and L? \n\nBut we have ""ROUSE"": R-O-U-S-E -> E is at the end? Positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-U, 4-S, 5-E. That works.\n\nAlternatively, R in third position: for example, ""IRATE"" but A is ruled out? Yes, avoid A.\n\nOr ""CRATE"" but C ruled out.\n\nSo perhaps ""TROVE"" -> T-R-O-V-E? But R is in the second position? Positions: 1-T, 2-R, 3-O, 4-V, 5-E. So R at position 2? We don\'t want that because we know R is not in position 2.\n\nSo we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, R at 1 or 3 or 4.\n\nR at position 1: ""ROUSE"" or ""ROUTE"" or ""RIPES"" (last letter S) -> so ""RIPES"" is not ending in E? We have ""RIPED""? Not a word.\n\n""ROLES"" -> R-O-L-E-S? Ends with S.\n\nPerhaps ""RIDES"" -> ends with S.\n\nI need words ending with E.\n\nCommon words:\n- ROUTE: R-O-U-T-E -> ends with E? E at end? Yes, because R-O-U-T-E: position 5 is E.\n- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E -> ends with E, and R is at position 4? Yes.\n\nBut SPIRE: that has S, P, I, R, E. We can also test S and P and I.\n\nWe are limited to 5 letters and we need to maximize information.\n\nConsidering ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E -> positions: S1, T2, O3, R4, E5. Here R is in position 4 and we avoid position 2 for R? We are not putting R in position 2 so it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""ROUTE"": R1, O2, U3, T4, E5.\n\nBut O is at position 2? That might be okay since we haven\'t tested O.\n\nHowever, in terms of letter frequency, S and T are more common.\n\nBut we need to avoid A and C and N.\n\nAnother word: ""SPORE"" -> S-P-O-R-E.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\nOption 1: ""ROUTE"" \n- R (already known, position 1: we can test if it\'s at position 1)\n- O (new at pos2)\n- U (new at pos3)\n- T (new at pos4)\n- E (known at pos5)\n\nOption 2: ""STORE""\n- S (new at pos1)\n- T (new at pos2)\n- O (new at pos3)\n- R (known at pos4: we test R at position 4)\n- E (known at pos5)\n\nOption 3: ""SPORE""\n- S (new at pos1)\n- P (new at pos2)\n- O (new at pos3)\n- R (known at pos4)\n- E (known at pos5)\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. \n\nAlso, note that we have only 6 tries, so we need to get information.\n\nWe know that E is at position 5 and R is somewhere but not at position 2.\n\nIn ""ROUTE"": we test position 1 for R and also new letters O,U,T.\n\nIn ""STORE"": we test S,T,O and R at position 4.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut perhaps ""STORE"" is better because it has more frequent letters? T and S are very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SOBER"" but ends with R? We need ends with E? So not.\n\nLet me choose ""STORE"". Reasons:\n\n1. It includes letters S, T, O which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n2. It places R at position 4, which we don\'t know yet.\n3. It has E at the end which we already know.\n\nSo if the secret word has R at position 4, we get a check mark. Otherwise, we might get a \'-\'.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STORE"".\n\nBut there\'s another option: a word that doesn\'t have R in the second guess? Actually, no: we must include R because we know it\'s present? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess any word, but it\'s better to include known letters to get more information.\n\nWe know R is present, so we should include it to know where it is.\n\nSimilarly, E is fixed.\n\nSo yes, include R and E.\n\nTherefore, ""STORE"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRICE"" but we ruled out C? So avoid.\n\nOr ""BRINE"" but we have N ruled out? N not present, so avoid.\n\nSo ""STORE"" is good.\n\nWe can also consider ""TROPE"" but O is at position 3? And R at position 2? We cannot do R at position 2 because we know that position is incorrect for R? So avoid position 2 for R.\n\nIn ""TROPE"": T1, R2, O3, P4, E5 -> R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect? So we would get a \'-\' again for R? And we don\'t learn the position? So inefficient.\n\nTherefore, we avoid.\n\nSo I proceed with ""STORE"".\n\nGuess: ""store""\n\nBut wait: the word ""STORE"" is valid? Yes.\n\nSo second guess: ""store""\n\n<guess>store</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  \n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""–"").  \n- E is in the word and in position 5 (marked ""✓"").  \n\nTherefore:  \n- The secret word must end with E: _ _ _ _ E.  \n- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).  \n- Avoid using C, A, or N in future guesses.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and excluding C, A, N.  \n- Prioritize testing common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information gain.  \n- Given the constraints, ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) is a strong choice:  \n  - It ends in E (position 5), matching known feedback.  \n  - Places R in position 4 (currently untested).  \n  - Introduces S, T, and O—all common letters—in positions 1, 2, and 3.  \n  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).  \n\nThis guess will help clarify:  \n- If S, T, or O are in the word and their positions.  \n- Whether R is correctly placed at position 4.\n\n<guess>store</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 5th letter is E)\n\nSecond guess: ""store""\n- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so the 1st letter is S)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 4; since we know it\'s not in position 2, and now not in 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3? But position 1 is now S, so R must be in position 3)\n- E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, so 5th letter is E)\n\nImportant deductions:\n1. The secret word starts with S and ends with E: S _ _ _ E\n2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 or 4. Since position 1 is taken by S, the only remaining position for R is position 3. So R must be in position 3: S _ R _ E\n3. We know the word is S _ R _ E\n4. We have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O are not in the word.\n\nSo the word is of the form: S X R Y E, where X and Y are letters to be guessed, and they cannot be C, A, N, T, O.\n\nWe need to find letters for positions 2 and 4.\n\nWe also know that the letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, A, N, T, O.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. So avoid these except R, E, S which are in the word.\n\nBut T and O are not in the word, so we avoid them.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that fits the pattern S _ R _ E and uses new letters to test.\n\nWe can try to guess the word directly if we have a candidate, or we can use a guess to test possible letters.\n\nSince we have only two positions to guess (position 2 and 4), and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that includes possible letters for these positions.\n\nBut we also need to avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nList of eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O.\n\nWe know S, R, E are in the word and in positions 1,3,5.\n\nSo for position 2 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining letters.\n\nCommon letters that are not eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should choose common ones.\n\nWe can think of words that fit S _ R _ E.\n\nExamples:\n- SIREE? Not a common word.\n- SIREN: but N is eliminated? N is not in the word, so SIREN has N, which is not allowed. Also, we know N is absent.\n- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> but the pattern is S _ R _ E, so position 4 must be the letter before E? In SHRED, it\'s S-H-R-E-D, so positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-R, 4-E, 5-D. But we need the 5th to be E, so this doesn\'t fit. Also, E is at position 4, but we need it at 5.\n\nWe need the word to end with E, so the pattern is S X R Y E, meaning:\nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: X (unknown)\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: Y (unknown)\nPosition 5: E\n\nSo the word is S X R Y E.\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern?\n\nCommon words:\n- SIREE: not a standard word? It might be an obscure word, but we should use common words.\n- SHIRE: S-H-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need position 3 to be R? Here position 3 is I and position 4 is R. So it doesn\'t match because we need R at position 3.\n\nWe need R at position 3.\n\nSo:\n- SHREW: S-H-R-E-W -> ends with W, not E? So no.\n- SHRED: S-H-R-E-D -> ends with D, not E? No.\n- SIRES: S-I-R-E-S -> ends with S, not E? No.\n\nWe need the last letter to be E.\n\nSo:\n- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E -> but this has two E\'s? And the pattern: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-E, 5-E. But we have E at position 4 and 5? But we know position 5 is E, so that\'s fine. But position 4 is E? And we have R at position 3? Yes.\n\nBut is ""SPREE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a period of activity.\n\nBut we have to check the letters: S, P, R, E, E.\n\nWe know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? The feedback from ""crane"" only showed one E, but it could have more? The feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn\'t say anything about other Es? Actually, in ""crane"", we only had one E, and it was at position 5. But the word might have another E? However, in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t have another E in ""crane"", we don\'t know. But in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E? So we don\'t know if there is a second E.\n\nBut in ""SPREE"", there are two Es. We don\'t have information about that.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can use it.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRE"" doesn\'t fit because R is at position 4, not 3.\n\n""SIRE"" is 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n""SWORE"": but O is eliminated? O is not in the word, and ""SWORE"" has O? So avoid.\n\n""SCARE"": but C and A are eliminated.\n\n""SNARE"": S, N, A, R, E -> but N and A are eliminated.\n\nSo back to ""SPREE"": it fits the pattern: S P R E E.\n\nBut we have P as a new letter.\n\nAnother word: ""SERGE"": S-E-R-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-R, 4-G, 5-E. This fits: S E R G E.\n\nBut we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if E is at position 2? We only know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback from ""crane"" had E at position 5 correct, but it didn\'t say anything about other positions. However, in ""crane"", we didn\'t have E in other positions? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""store"", we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E? So we don\'t have information about E at position 2.\n\nBut in ""SERGE"", we have E at position 2 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPREE"" has E at position 4 and 5.\n\nWe need to test.\n\nBut we also have to avoid eliminated letters: in ""SERGE"", G is new, and in ""SPREE"", P is new.\n\nBut we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible.\n\nBut to be safe, we can choose a word that tests new letters and fits the pattern.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn\'t work because R is at 4.\n\n""SUCRE""? Not common.\n\n""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-I, 4-R, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here R is at position 4, so it doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need R at position 3.\n\nSo possible words: \n- SPREE: S-P-R-E-E (R at 3)\n- SERGE: S-E-R-G-E (R at 3)\n- SHREW: but ends with W, not E? No.\n- SHRUB: not ending with E.\n- SOREX: has O and not ending with E? No.\n\n""SURE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""SIREE"": I think it\'s a word, but rare. Better to avoid.\n\n""SMITE"": S-M-I-T-E -> but T is eliminated? T is not in the word, and ""SMITE"" has T? So avoid.\n\n""SLIME"": S-L-I-M-E -> but I and M? But T is not in it? T is eliminated, but L, I, M are new. But R is at position 3? No, in ""SLIME"", position 3 is I, not R.\n\nWe need R at position 3.\n\nSo let\'s list words: S?R?E\n\nCommon ones: \n- SPREE\n- SERGE\n- SABRE: but A and B? A is eliminated, so no.\n- SEWER: S-E-W-E-R -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R -> but ends with R, not E? And R is at position 5, but we need E at 5. So no.\n\n""SCREE"": S-C-R-E-E -> but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.\n\n""SPREE"" is S-P-R-E-E, which avoids C, A, N, T, O? P is not eliminated, so it\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""SERGE"" avoids them.\n\nBut ""SPREE"" has two Es, and ""SERGE"" has two Es.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRE"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""SIRE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-R, 4-U, 5-E. This fits: S P R U E.\n\nAnd U is a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""SERGE"" is S E R G E.\n\n""SPRUE"" is a word? Yes, meaning a shoot of a plant or something, but it might be less common. But Wordle accepts various words.\n\nWe can use it.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe have two main candidates: ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", and ""SPRUE"".\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to test common ones.\n\nIn ""SPREE"", we test P and also see if there is a second E at position 4.\n\nIn ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.\n\nIn ""SPRUE"", we test P at position 2 and U at position 4.\n\nSince we know the word has E at position 5, and we are guessing E at position 2 or 4, it might be efficient to test if E appears again.\n\nBut let\'s think about the feedback.\n\nWe can also consider that if we guess a word that has E in position 2, and if it\'s not in the word, we get feedback.\n\nBut we have limited guesses.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that doesn\'t necessarily have E at position 2 or 4, but uses different letters to narrow down.\n\nFor example, we know the pattern is S _ R _ E, so we can guess a word like ""SHRED"" but it doesn\'t end with E? No.\n\nOr ""SPRIG"" but doesn\'t end with E.\n\nWe must end with E? No, we can guess any word, not necessarily fitting the pattern, to test letters.\n\nBut it might be more efficient to guess a word that fits the pattern to hit the solution.\n\nSince we have only two positions, we can try to solve it.\n\nBut let\'s see how many possibilities.\n\nThe word is S X R Y E, with X and Y being letters not in {C, A, N, T, O} and not S, R, E (but E can be repeated?).\n\nPossible X and Y.\n\nCommon letters for X: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nFor Y: similarly.\n\nBut Y could be E? Then we have S X R E E.\n\nFor example, ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"" (which is S E R G E, so X=E, Y=G).\n\nBut if X=E, that means E is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if Y=E, then E at position 4.\n\nNow, from previous feedback, we have no information about E at position 2 or 4.\n\nIn ""crane"", we had no E at position 2? ""crane"" had E at position 5, but not at other positions? We didn\'t test position 2 for E.\n\nSimilarly in ""store"", we had E at position 5, and no other E? ""store"" has only one E at position 5? Actually, ""store"" is S-T-O-R-E, so E only at 5.\n\nSo we don\'t know about other positions.\n\nTo maximize information, we can guess a word that has many new letters and fits the pattern.\n\nLet\'s choose ""SPRUE"": S-P-R-U-E.\n\nThis way, we test P and U.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n\n- If P is correct at position 2, then X=P.\n- If U is correct at position 4, then Y=U.\n- If not, we get more information.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""SERGE"", we test E at position 2 and G at position 4.\n\nBut if we guess ""SERGE"" and the word has E at position 2, we get a ✓ for E at position 2, which is new information.\n\nBut if not, we know E is not at position 2.\n\nSimilarly for G.\n\nBut we have to consider that E might be at position 2, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHIRE"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""SULRE""? Not a word.\n\n""SKIVE"": S-K-I-V-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-K, 3-I, 4-V, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it\'s I, not R. So no.\n\nWe must have R at position 3.\n\nSo I think ""SPRUE"" is a good choice.\n\nOr ""SPREE"".\n\nBut ""SPREE"" has E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word doesn\'t have it.\n\nPerhaps ""SPRUE"" is better because it has two new letters.\n\nLet\'s look for more common words.\n\n""SIEGE"": S-I-E-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-I, 3-E, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it\'s E, not R. So no.\n\n""SCREW"" not ending with E.\n\nI think ""SPRUE"" or ""SERGE"" are reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback from the second guess again.\n\nIn ""store"", we had:\n- S: ✓ (position 1 correct)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word but not position 4)\n- E: ✓ (position 5 correct)\n\nAnd from first guess, R not in position 2.\n\nSo R must be in position 3.\n\nSo the word is S _ R _ E.\n\nNow, for the third guess, I propose ""spruce"" but C is eliminated? C not in word, so avoid.\n\n""SPRUE"" is S-P-R-U-E.\n\nYes.\n\nOr ""SERIF"" but ends with F, not E? No.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SPRUE"".\n\nBut is ""SPRUE"" a valid Wordle word? I think so.\n\nTo be more common, ""SHARE"" but A is eliminated.\n\nAnother one: ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n""SPIRE"" has R at position 4, not 3.\n\nSo ""SPRUE"" is acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""SEDGE"": S-E-D-G-E -> positions: 1-S, 2-E, 3-D, 4-G, 5-E. But we need R at position 3? Here it\'s D, not R. So no.\n\nWe must have R at position 3.\n\nSo the only common words are ""SPREE"", ""SERGE"", ""SPRUE"", and perhaps ""SABRE"" but A eliminated.\n\n""SWIRL"" not ending with E.\n\nI think ""SPRUE"" is fine.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SPRUE"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: S P R U E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:R, 4:U, 5:E. Yes, R at position 3.\n\nAnd U at position 4.\n\nSo we are testing P and U.\n\nIf the word is ""SPREE"", we would have Y=E, but we are guessing U, so it would show U as not present or wrong position.\n\nBut we\'ll see.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SPRUE"".\n\n<guess>sprue</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(–) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  \n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - C, A, N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: store** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(–) E(✓)  \n  - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n  - R is in the word but not in position 4 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1).\n  - T and O are not in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **S** (position 1) and ends with **E** (position 5): **S _ _ _ E**.\n- **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback).

We have feedback from three guesses:

First guess ""crane"":
- C: x → not in word
- R: - → in word, but not position 2
- A: x → not in word
- N: x → not in word
- E: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 5)

Second guess ""store"":
- S: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 1)
- T: x → not in word
- O: x → not in word
- R: - → in word but not position 4
- E: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 5)

Third guess ""sprue"":
- S: ✓ → already known position 1 correct
- P: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 2)
- R: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 3)
- U: x → not in word
- E: ✓ → correct position 5

Therefore, combining insights:
- Secret word is S P R ? E (positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=R, 4=?, 5=E)
- We know positions 1,2,3,5: S, P, R, E respectively.
- Only position 4 is unknown.
- U is not in the word (eliminated).
- Other eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O (from previous feedback).

Since the word must be a valid English word, form: SPR?E

Possible letters for position 4 must be a letter that, when placed, forms a valid word, and cannot be any eliminated letter (C, A, N, T, O, U) or the letters already used (S,P,R,E) unless duplicated, but E is already at end and S,P,R are used.

Could the secret word have duplicate letters? For example, another P or R? Possible, but we need to check if position 4 can be a duplicate.

Based on feedback:
- In ""sprue"", U was guessed at position 4 and marked x, so U is not in the word and not correct for position 4.

Now, what letters can be in position 4?

List common words starting with ""SPR"" and ending with ""E"":

- SPREE: but SPREE has E at position 4? So SPR_E → S,P,R,E,E? That would be SPR?E with ? being E? But in the word SPREE, positions: S1, P2, R3, E4, E5.

We have position 4 ? and position 5 E.

If ?=E, then SPREE is a word.

Another possibility: SPRIG? But ends with G, not E? No.

SPRAY? Not E.

SPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E → but T is eliminated? And also, I is new? And position 4 would be I? But the ending is T-E? Positions: S1,P2,R3,I4,T5? But we need E at position 5? SPRITE ends with E? Actually, SPRITE is S-P-R-I-T-E → 6 letters? No, SPRITE is 6 letters? S-P-R-I-T-E, that's 6 characters? Let's count: S,P,R,I,T,E — 6. So not 5-letter word.

5-letter words: 

- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E → but R is at position 4, not position 3? In SPIRE, positions: S1, P2, I3, R4, E5. But we need R at position 3? This doesn't match our pattern.

We need S,P,R at positions 1,2,3, then a letter, then E.

So:

- SPREE: SPR E E? Word: S-P-R-E-E → positions: S1, P2, R3, E4, E5. So the fourth position is E.

- Other words? SPRUE: but U we guessed and it's wrong? SPRUE was our last guess, and U is not present.

- SPARE: A eliminated? And not pattern? SPARE is S-P-A-R-E → R is at position 4? Not position 3.

- SPIKE: I at position 3? R not there? No.

Common words fitting SPR_E (with R at position 3):

- SPREE
- SPRITE is 6 letters? So invalid. 5-letter words: SPREE is one.

SPRIG, SPRAT: not end with E? SPRAT ends with T.

SPRANG? Not E.

SPRUNG: not E.

Perhaps ""SPREE"" is the common one.

Also, ""SERGE"" was mentioned earlier, but SERGE is S-E-R-G-E → positions: E at 2? Not P at 2? We have P at position 2 confirmed? In ""sprue"", P is at position 2 and got a ✓, so position 2 is P?

So SERGE doesn't fit because position 2 is E, but we have P at position 2.

Similarly, ""SPRUE"" doesn't work because U not in word.

Therefore, the only common word left is ""SPREE"".

Is there any other word?

SPRED? Not common.

SPREW? Not common.

SPRÉE? That's SPREE.

Sometimes ""SPREE"" is spelled with one E? No, it's S-P-R-E-E.

5 letters: S,P,R,E,E — so positions: S1,P2,R3,E4,E5.

Perfect fit, and E at position 4 is new? We don't know about E at position 4 yet.

But E is known to be in the word (position 5), but we didn't know if it appears twice.

Now, in our pattern, position 4 is filled by E? Then SPREE.

Since U is not present, and we guessed SPRUE with U at 4 wrong, but SPREE has E at 4.

And SPREE is a valid word.

Therefore, the secret word should be ""SPREE"".

But let's confirm eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O, U are out, and SPREE contains S,P,R,E,E — no problem.

Also, in feedback history, no word had E at position 4? We didn't test it.

Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at 5, but not at other positions? So E at 4 was not tested.

Similarly, in ""store"" and ""sprue"", we didn't have E at position 4? ""sprue"" had U at position 4.

So it matches.

Could there be other words? For example, with Y? ""SPRY"" is 4 letters.

Or ""SPRING"" not 5.

So I think ""SPREE"" is the solution.

Therefore, we can guess ""SPREE"".

As this is our fourth guess.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Pattern from feedback**:  
   - Guess 1 (""crane""):  
     - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
     - E is in position 5 (correct).  
     - C, A, N are eliminated (not in the word).  
   - Guess 2 (""store""):  
     - S is in position 1 (correct).  
     - E is in position 5 (correct).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
     - T and O are eliminated.  
     - Since R is in the word and cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and position 1 is S, R must be in position 3.  
     - Thus, the word is **S _ R _ E**.  
   - Guess 3 (""sprue""):  
     - S, P, R, E are correct in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.  
     - U is not in the word.  
     - This confirms the pattern: **S P R _ E**, with position 4 unknown.  

2. **Eliminated letters**:  
   - Not in the word: C, A, N, T, O, U (from feedback).  
   - Known letters in word: S (pos1), P (pos2), R (pos3), E (pos5).  

3. **Position 4 possibilities**:  
   - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""SPR"" and ending with ""E"".  
   - Common options for position 4 must avoid eliminated letters.  
   - The word ""SPREE"" (S–P–R–E–E) fits:  
     - Positions: S(1), P(2), R(3), E(4), E(5) – consistent with feedback.  
     - E at position 4 is plausible (previous guesses only tested E in position 5).  
   - Other words like ""SPIRE"" or ""SHIRE"" don’t match the pattern (R must be in position 3).  
   - ""SPRUE"" was tested and U is eliminated.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Given the pattern and eliminations, ""SPREE"" is the only common, valid word.  
   - This guess may solve the puzzle.  

<guess>spree</guess>",spree,"We have feedback from three guesses:

First guess ""crane"":
- C: x → not in word
- R: - → in word, but not position 2
- A: x → not in word
- N: x → not in word
- E: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 5)

Second guess ""store"":
- S: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 1)
- T: x → not in word
- O: x → not in word
- R: - → in word but not position 4
- E: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 5)

Third guess ""sprue"":
- S: ✓ → already known position 1 correct
- P: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 2)
- R: ✓ → in word and correct position (position 3)
- U: x → not in word
- E: ✓ → correct position 5

Therefore, combining insights:
- Secret word is S P R ? E (positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=R, 4=?, 5=E)
- We know positions 1,2,3,5: S, P, R, E respectively.
- Only position 4 is unknown.
- U is not in the word (eliminated).
- Other eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O (from previous feedback).

Since the word must be a valid English word, form: SPR?E

Possible letters for position 4 must be a letter that, when placed, forms a valid word, and cannot be any eliminated letter (C, A, N, T, O, U) or the letters already used (S,P,R,E) unless duplicated, but E is already at end and S,P,R are used.

Could the secret word have duplicate letters? For example, another P or R? Possible, but we need to check if position 4 can be a duplicate.

Based on feedback:
- In ""sprue"", U was guessed at position 4 and marked x, so U is not in the word and not correct for position 4.

Now, what letters can be in position 4?

List common words starting with ""SPR"" and ending with ""E"":

- SPREE: but SPREE has E at position 4? So SPR_E → S,P,R,E,E? That would be SPR?E with ? being E? But in the word SPREE, positions: S1, P2, R3, E4, E5.

We have position 4 ? and position 5 E.

If ?=E, then SPREE is a word.

Another possibility: SPRIG? But ends with G, not E? No.

SPRAY? Not E.

SPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E → but T is eliminated? And also, I is new? And position 4 would be I? But the ending is T-E? Positions: S1,P2,R3,I4,T5? But we need E at position 5? SPRITE ends with E? Actually, SPRITE is S-P-R-I-T-E → 6 letters? No, SPRITE is 6 letters? S-P-R-I-T-E, that's 6 characters? Let's count: S,P,R,I,T,E — 6. So not 5-letter word.

5-letter words: 

- SPIRE: S-P-I-R-E → but R is at position 4, not position 3? In SPIRE, positions: S1, P2, I3, R4, E5. But we need R at position 3? This doesn't match our pattern.

We need S,P,R at positions 1,2,3, then a letter, then E.

So:

- SPREE: SPR E E? Word: S-P-R-E-E → positions: S1, P2, R3, E4, E5. So the fourth position is E.

- Other words? SPRUE: but U we guessed and it's wrong? SPRUE was our last guess, and U is not present.

- SPARE: A eliminated? And not pattern? SPARE is S-P-A-R-E → R is at position 4? Not position 3.

- SPIKE: I at position 3? R not there? No.

Common words fitting SPR_E (with R at position 3):

- SPREE
- SPRITE is 6 letters? So invalid. 5-letter words: SPREE is one.

SPRIG, SPRAT: not end with E? SPRAT ends with T.

SPRANG? Not E.

SPRUNG: not E.

Perhaps ""SPREE"" is the common one.

Also, ""SERGE"" was mentioned earlier, but SERGE is S-E-R-G-E → positions: E at 2? Not P at 2? We have P at position 2 confirmed? In ""sprue"", P is at position 2 and got a ✓, so position 2 is P?

So SERGE doesn't fit because position 2 is E, but we have P at position 2.

Similarly, ""SPRUE"" doesn't work because U not in word.

Therefore, the only common word left is ""SPREE"".

Is there any other word?

SPRED? Not common.

SPREW? Not common.

SPRÉE? That's SPREE.

Sometimes ""SPREE"" is spelled with one E? No, it's S-P-R-E-E.

5 letters: S,P,R,E,E — so positions: S1,P2,R3,E4,E5.

Perfect fit, and E at position 4 is new? We don't know about E at position 4 yet.

But E is known to be in the word (position 5), but we didn't know if it appears twice.

Now, in our pattern, position 4 is filled by E? Then SPREE.

Since U is not present, and we guessed SPRUE with U at 4 wrong, but SPREE has E at 4.

And SPREE is a valid word.

Therefore, the secret word should be ""SPREE"".

But let's confirm eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, O, U are out, and SPREE contains S,P,R,E,E — no problem.

Also, in feedback history, no word had E at position 4? We didn't test it.

Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at 5, but not at other positions? So E at 4 was not tested.

Similarly, in ""store"" and ""sprue"", we didn't have E at position 4? ""sprue"" had U at position 4.

So it matches.

Could there be other words? For example, with Y? ""SPRY"" is 4 letters.

Or ""SPRING"" not 5.

So I think ""SPREE"" is the solution.

Therefore, we can guess ""SPREE"".

As this is our fourth guess.

Response: <guess>spree</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Pattern from feedback**:  
   - Guess 1 (""crane""):  
     - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
     - E is in position 5 (correct).  
     - C, A, N are eliminated (not in the word).  
   - Guess 2 (""store""):  
     - S is in position 1 (correct).  
     - E is in position 5 (correct).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
     - T and O are eliminated.  
     - Since R is in the word and cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and position 1 is S, R must be in position 3.  
     - Thus, the word is **S _ R _ E**.  
   - Guess 3 (""sprue""):  
     - S, P, R, E are correct in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.  
     - U is not in the word.  
     - This confirms the pattern: **S P R _ E**, with position 4 unknown.  

2. **Eliminated letters**:  
   - Not in the word: C, A, N, T, O, U (from feedback).  
   - Known letters in word: S (pos1), P (pos2), R (pos3), E (pos5).  

3. **Position 4 possibilities**:  
   - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""SPR"" and ending with ""E"".  
   - Common options for position 4 must avoid eliminated letters.  
   - The word ""SPREE"" (S–P–R–E–E) fits:  
     - Positions: S(1), P(2), R(3), E(4), E(5) – consistent with feedback.  
     - E at position 4 is plausible (previous guesses only tested E in position 5).  
   - Other words like ""SPIRE"" or ""SHIRE"" don’t match the pattern (R must be in position 3).  
   - ""SPRUE"" was tested and U is eliminated.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Given the pattern and eliminations, ""SPREE"" is the only common, valid word.  
   - This guess may solve the puzzle.",Guess 4: spree -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
