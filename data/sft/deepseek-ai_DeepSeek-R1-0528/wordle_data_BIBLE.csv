We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) — C is not in the secret word.
R(x) — R is not in the secret word.
A(x) — A is not in the secret word.
N(x) — N is not in the secret word.
E(✓) — E is in the word and in the correct position. Since E is correct and in position, we know that the secret word ends with E? 
Looking at the positions: 
""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E.
E is at position 5 and it's correct. So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Since E is in the word and correctly placed, and the other four letters are absent, we must choose a new word that:
- Ends with E (so fifth letter is E).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N.
- Is a 5-letter English word.

Now, for our next guess, we should try to uncover more letters. We want to use common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Common consonants that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: O, U, I (since A is out and E is fixed at the end).

We can try to include some of these.

A good strategy is to try a word that has other common letters and ends with E.

Possibilities: 
- Words like ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is already ruled out, so we cannot use A.
We must avoid A.

Similarly, we can't use C, R, A, N.

Let me think of words ending with E that don't have A, C, R, N.

Some options:
- ""STOVE"": S, T, O, V, E
- ""SKATE"": but A is ruled out -> invalid because A is not allowed.
- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E
- ""SHIRE"": but R is ruled out -> we cannot use R.
- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but N is ruled out.

We have to avoid C, R, A, N.

So, let's list some words ending with E without these letters.

Consider: 
- ""BELIE"": B, E, L, I, E -> but it has two E's? But the word is BELIE (meaning to give a false impression) and has E at end and also at position 2? We don't know about duplicate letters yet. However, the feedback for E in the first guess was for position 5, so it doesn't tell us if there are other E's. But let's avoid double E for now to get more information? Alternatively, we can use it to check for another E.

But note: We only know one E is at the end. There might be another E? We don't know.

However, to maximize information, it might be better to use all new letters, but we have to use E at the end.

We can use letters that we haven't tested: for example, we haven't tried S, T, O, L, I, etc.

So, one good candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E.
But let me see if there are better ones.

Another candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses common letters.

""STOLE"": positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E.

This word doesn't contain A, C, R, N.

Similarly, ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is less common.

""PHONE"": has N which is ruled out.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q might be too rare, and we have U and I.

But let's stick with more common letters.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses S, T, O, L — all common letters.

We want to test several new letters at once.

So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

But note: the fifth letter must be E, and E is already known to be in the word and correctly placed. So we set the fifth letter as E.

Therefore, guess: STOLE.

But we write the entire word: STOLE.

After this guess, we'll get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at 5 (which we already know so it will be ✓).

But we are guessing to see if S, T, O, L are in the word and where.

So let's go with ""STOLE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5 (e.g., ____E).
- Letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (since position 5 is E and confirmed).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on testing other common letters like S, T, O, L, I, or P to gather new information.

A suitable guess is ""stole"". It:
- Ends with E.
- Uses new letters (S, T, O, L) that haven't been tested yet.
- Contains high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O) to maximize feedback.

We want to use common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nCommon consonants that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nCommon vowels left: O, U, I (since A is out and E is fixed at the end).\n\nWe can try to include some of these.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has other common letters and ends with E.\n\nPossibilities: \n- Words like ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is already ruled out, so we cannot use A.\nWe must avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, we can\'t use C, R, A, N.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that don\'t have A, C, R, N.\n\nSome options:\n- ""STOVE"": S, T, O, V, E\n- ""SKATE"": but A is ruled out -> invalid because A is not allowed.\n- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E\n- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E\n- ""SHIRE"": but R is ruled out -> we cannot use R.\n- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but N is ruled out.\n\nWe have to avoid C, R, A, N.\n\nSo, let\'s list some words ending with E without these letters.\n\nConsider: \n- ""BELIE"": B, E, L, I, E -> but it has two E\'s? But the word is BELIE (meaning to give a false impression) and has E at end and also at position 2? We don\'t know about duplicate letters yet. However, the feedback for E in the first guess was for position 5, so it doesn\'t tell us if there are other E\'s. But let\'s avoid double E for now to get more information? Alternatively, we can use it to check for another E.\n\nBut note: We only know one E is at the end. There might be another E? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, it might be better to use all new letters, but we have to use E at the end.\n\nWe can use letters that we haven\'t tested: for example, we haven\'t tried S, T, O, L, I, etc.\n\nSo, one good candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E.\nBut let me see if there are better ones.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses common letters.\n\n""STOLE"": positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E.\n\nThis word doesn\'t contain A, C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is less common.\n\n""PHONE"": has N which is ruled out.\n\n""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q might be too rare, and we have U and I.\n\nBut let\'s stick with more common letters.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses S, T, O, L — all common letters.\n\nWe want to test several new letters at once.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\nBut note: the fifth letter must be E, and E is already known to be in the word and correctly placed. So we set the fifth letter as E.\n\nTherefore, guess: STOLE.\n\nBut we write the entire word: STOLE.\n\nAfter this guess, we\'ll get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at 5 (which we already know so it will be ✓).\n\nBut we are guessing to see if S, T, O, L are in the word and where.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5 (e.g., ____E).\n- Letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (since position 5 is E and confirmed).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Focus on testing other common letters like S, T, O, L, I, or P to gather new information.\n\nA suitable guess is ""stole"". It:\n- Ends with E.\n- Uses new letters (S, T, O, L) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- Contains high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O) to maximize feedback.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have two feedbacks:

From Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
So: 
  - E is in the word and at position 5 (so the word ends with E).
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2: ""stole""
Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)
Breakdown:
- S(x) -> S not in the word
- T(x) -> T not in the word
- O(x) -> O not in the word
- L(✓) -> L is in the word and in the correct position. Since ""stole"" has L at position 4, this means the secret word has L as the fourth letter.
- E(✓) -> already known, at position 5.

So, current knowledge:
- The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ L E
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O
- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with ""LE"" (positions 4 and 5: L and E).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, T, O.
- We are uncertain about the first three positions.

Given the absent letters, we eliminate many common letters. We must use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word with pattern _ _ _ L E.

We must choose a word that uses some of these remaining letters and is a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ""LE"": 
- Examples: table, maple, apple, but they contain A and T which are out.
- Other words: style (but S and T are out), while (W, H, I, L, E but letters must be in pattern).

Pattern: three letters then L and E, so the word must be [letter1][letter2][letter3]LE.

We must avoid S, T, O, C, R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with LE and avoid the forbidden letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""FILE"": F, I, L, E -> so pattern: F I L E? But wait, the pattern must be _ _ _ L E, meaning the fourth is L and fifth is E. So ""FILE"" would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:L, but then the fourth would be E? That doesn't match because we need position 4 to be L and 5 to be E.

In ""FILE"":
Position 1: F
Position 2: I
Position 3: L -> but we need L at position 4? No, because pattern is _ _ _ L E, so L must be at index 4 (the fourth letter). In ""FILE"", L is at position 3? Actually, ""FILE"" is F-I-L-E, so:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L -> should be the fourth? No, it's the third.
We need the word to have L at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

So the word must be four letters before E? No: the word is five letters: position 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 must be L, and position 5 must be E. So the last two letters are fixed as L and E.

Therefore, the word is [1] [2] [3] L E.

So the first three letters can be any combination of allowed letters.

Now, in ""FILE"": it's only four letters? No, FILE is 4 letters? Wait, FILE is 4 letters: F-I-L-E. We need a 5-letter word.

So we need 5-letter words ending in LE? But note: ending in LE meaning positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the word must be ...LE at the end.

For example: 
- APPLE: A-P-P-L-E -> positions 4:L, 5:E -> but A and P? But A is absent.
- MAPLE: M-A-P-L-E -> A is absent.
- TABLE: T-A-B-L-E -> T and A absent.
- NOBLE: N-O-B-L-E -> N and O absent (N from guess1, O from guess2).
- MOTILE: M-O-T-I-L-E -> M, O, T, I, L, E -> O and T absent.
- So we need a word without the absent letters.

List of 5-letter words ending with LE that don't contain C,R,A,N,S,T,O:
Some options:

- ""ANOLE"": But A is absent -> invalid
- ""ARGLE"": A and R absent -> invalid
- ""BAILE"": A absent -> invalid
- ""BIBLE"": B,I,B,L,E -> contains B and I? Check letters: B, I, B, L, E. Letters: B, I, E, L (and E we know). But we need pattern: B at 1, I at 2, B at 3? That's ""BIBLE"". But note: B appears twice? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But also, we haven't tested B or I yet. However, A is not in it? But A is absent? A is not used in BIBLE, and C,R,A,N,S,T,O are absent? 
  - B: not tested
  - I: not tested
  - B: again (duplicate)
  - L: known
  - E: known

But let's check if ""BIBLE"" is allowed: Yes, it's a word. But having B twice? It might be okay, but we'll get feedback per letter.

Alternatively:
- ""BOULE"": contains O -> invalid
- ""CABLE"": C -> invalid
- ""DIVLE"": not a word
- ""EAGLE"": A -> invalid
- ""FABLE"": A -> invalid
- ""GAVLE"": not common, and might contain A? G,A,V,L,E -> A absent -> invalid
- ""HOVEL"": H,O,V,E,L -> O absent -> invalid
- ""IDYLE"": no, usually spelled ""idyll"" but not 5 letters? Or ""idylle""? Not standard. Let's stick to common words.

Better words:
- ""MILLE"": but not English? Not typically.
We need common English words.

Another possibility: ""BILLE"" not common, or ""GUILE"" has U and I but let's check:
- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> pattern: G U I L E -> position 4:L, 5:E. Now, check absent letters: no C,R,A,N,S,T,O -> so G,U,I are allowed? Yes.

But ""GUILE"" is a word (meaning slyness).

Similarly, ""QUILE"" not a word.

Another word: ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> W, H, I are not in absent list. Pattern: W at1, H at2, I at3, L at4, E at5.

So ""WHILE"" would work.

Similarly, ""PHYLE"": P,H,Y,L,E -> Y might be less common, but valid.

But ""PHYLE"" might not be well-known.

Common words: 
- ""TITLE"": but T absent -> invalid
- ""SPILE"": S absent -> invalid
- ""SMILE"": S absent -> invalid

""WHILE"" seems good.

What about ""ANKLE"": A and K? A is absent -> invalid

""APPLE"", ""BIBLE"", ""EVOKE"" doesn't end with LE.

""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> pattern: E at1, X at2, I at3, L at4, E at5? But wait, E is at position 1 and 5? We know E is at position 5, but we don't know if it exists elsewhere. So ""EXILE"" would be a candidate? Pattern: E X I L E -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E.

Now, we know E is at position 5, but in our first guess we had E only at position 5 and no other E? But feedback only said E was correct at the fifth position. There might be another E? So it's possible.

""EXILE"" contains E at position 1? We don't know if that E is in the secret word or not. So let's consider ""EXILE"".

Letters: E, X, I, L, E -> but L is fixed at 4, E at 5. So first three: E,X,I? Then we get E at position 1.

However, we don't have any feedback about E at other positions. In the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 and it was correct. If there were an E at position 1, would it show as correct? Probably? But we didn't guess E at position 1 then. So it might be.

But note: ""EXILE"" is valid.

Similarly, ""AXILE"": but A is absent -> invalid.

Another word: ""OILED""? But wait, ""OILED"" ends with D, not LE? We need L at 4 and E at 5? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D, positions: L at position 3, not 4 -> doesn't fit.

We must have exactly L at position 4 and E at position 5.

So, we are looking for words with fourth letter L and fifth letter E.

Let me think:

Possible words: (avoiding C,R,A,N,S,T,O)

Common ones:
- ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> letters W,H,I
- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> G,U,I
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> B,E,L (but E is at position 1 and 5? But we know E at 5, and L at 4. But we have L at 3 as well? Duplicate L? But we don't know if the word has one L or multiple. Also, ""BELLE"" has E at position 1: E in secret? We don't know.

But let's look for words that don't use absent letters.

Also, we have not tested B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Ideal guess: a word that uses three new distinct letters from the remaining set for positions 1,2,3.

Option: ""WHILE"": 
Letters: W, H, I, L, E -> L and E are known, so new: W, H, I.

Similarly, ""GUILE"": G, U, I -> new: G,U,I.

But ""GUILE"" might be less common than ""WHILE"".

Another: ""PHILE"": not standard? Usually ""phile"" as suffix, but standalone? Not common.

""AXILE"": invalid due to A.

""IDYLE"": not common.

""EXILE"": E, X, I -> good? But E at position 1: if we get feedback for E at position 1, we might learn about another E? Or it might be a duplicate? But we already have E at 5.

But note: E is already known to be present at position 5. If there is another E, it might be correct or incorrect position? 

However, in ""exile"", if the secret word has E only at position 5, then the E at position 1 would be absent or wrong? Actually, E is present so it might be '-' if there's only one E? But we don't know. Could be ✓ if the secret word has E at position 1.

But to avoid complexity of duplicates, perhaps choose a word without any more E's? 

For instance, ""WHILE"" has no E except position 5? Position 1:W,2:H,3:I → no E at other positions.

Similarly, ""GUILE"" has G,U,I → no E elsewhere.

But ""GUILE"" uses U which is a vowel, less frequent than consonants? Still, we need to cover.

Another word? ""MAPLE"" has A absent → invalid.

""KNEEL"": K,N,E,E,L → N is absent? Guess1 said N is absent → so ""KNEEL"" has N at position 2? And E at position 3 and4? Doesn't fit pattern. Pattern we need: positions 4:L and 5:E, so ""KNEEL"" ends with E at4 and L at5? No, it ends with L? Positions:1:K,2:N,3:E,4:E,5:L → not LE pattern.

Pattern must be: [1] [2] [3] L E.

So we need word ending with LE.

Other possibilities:
- ""QUILE"": not standard word.
- ""VILE"": 4 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""EMULE"": E,M,U,L,E → fits pattern: E at1, M at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. Absent letters? E allowed? But we know E at5 is correct. But E at1? Possible. Letters: E,M,U → E is known in the word but maybe at different position? M and U allowed.

But then we would be guessing E at position1? But we haven't tested it.

""EMULE"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to emulate.

Similarly, ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → pattern: B E L L E → so positions:1:B,2:E,3:L,4:L,5:E → but position3 is L? But we need position4 to be L, and position3 is also L? So position4 is the first L? Not necessarily. We don't know. But position4 is L and we have L at position3? So duplicate L possible. But also E at position2.

Not ideal as it uses E and L in different positions.

To maximize new letters: choose a word that doesn't reuse known letters except at their fixed positions.

We know L and E must be at positions 4 and 5. We shouldn't put L elsewhere to avoid confusion? We don't have to avoid using L or E elsewhere? But it might give us extra information? Or might complicate? 

But avoiding duplication might be better for initial guesses? We don't know much.

So better to avoid using L or E in positions 1-3? So we test three entirely new letters.

Therefore, for positions 1,2,3: use three distinct new letters (from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Options:

""WHILE"": W,H,I for positions1,2,3 → no L or E in 1-3.

""GUILE"": G,U,I → same.

""KINKLE"": not a word? Or kinkle? Not common.

""MILLE"": not English word in common use.

""PIXLE"": not a word.

""VIXLE"": no.

So common words: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", also ""EXILE""? But ""EXILE"" has E at position1? That reuses E. Similarly, ""BELLE"" reuses E and L.

Another word: ""DIMLE""? Not word.

""WIMLE"": no.

Or ""BILE""? 4 letters? No.

Possible: ""WEDLE""? Not word.

""FILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

Wait, 5-letter words: ""HOULE""? meaning? Not common.

""FROLE""? no.

Perhaps ""WHILE"" or ""GUILE"" is best.

Let's also consider: ""BLUME""? Ends with E? BLUME: B-L-U-M-E? Pattern: B at1,L at2,U at3,M at4,E at5? But we need L at position4? Not position2. So invalid pattern.

The pattern must have L at position4: so the word must have the fourth character as L.

So only words with structure ***L E.

Looking at words:

- ""IDLE""? 4 letters? IDLE is 4 letters? I-D-L-E.

5-letter words: we have:
- ""IDLER"": but ends with R not.
- ""IDELE"" no.

Common words: while, guile, exile, phone (but O and N absent), style (S and T absent) → excluded.

Another: ""TUILE"" → T absent? T is absent, so invalid.

So about-ficial.com lists possible 5-letter words ending in LE: 

For example: 
- ""AMBLE"" → A absent → invalid
- ""AMPLE"" → A absent
- ""APPLE"" → A absent
- ""BUGLE"" → U,G,B → no absent letters. Pattern: B U G L E → positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E → good.
Letters: B,U,G → all not tested and not absent.

""BUGLE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""DIC LE"" not word? DICOLE? No.

""FUGLE"": not common? or meaning? Fugle is a verb? Rare.

""BUGLE"" is common.

Similarly, ""THELE"" not common.

Or ""SHALE"" → ends with LE? S H A L E → but A is absent? Yes.

""DEALE"": no? Or made word? Not common.

So ""BUGLE"" seems good.

Also, ""CABLE""→C absent.

So options: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", ""BUGLE"", ""EXILE"".

Let's list them:

1. ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E → new: W,H,I
2. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E → new: G,U,I
3. ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E → new: B,U,G
4. ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E → new: X,I (but E reused at position1)

Which one to pick?
We want to test consonants and vowels? Since we have only one vowel found? E, but E is fixed. We need to test if there are other vowels? The word might have another vowel? But we don't know.

To maximize coverage: choose a word with more common letters.

Among the remaining letters: B, U, G, etc., U is a vowel? But not tested.

Similarly, I is a vowel.

In English, vowels are important.

Perhaps choose a word that has both consonants and vowel.

Also, we have 6 tries, so we have room.

But let's pick ""BUGLE"": it tests B, U, G → U is vowel? Yes.

Similarly, ""GUILE"" tests G,U,I → two vowels? U and I.

But ""BUGLE"" has U and no I? 

""BUGLE"" → consonants B,G and vowel U.

""WHILE"" has W,H (consonants) and I (vowel).

All fine.

I think ""BUGLE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants.

But let's see frequency: B and U are relatively common.

Since we know almost nothing about the first three positions, any is fine.

We can go with ""BUGLE"":

But let's format correctly.

Before, we must output.

Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - Indicates E is in the secret word and at position 5, so the secret word ends with E.  
  - Letters C, R, A, and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: stole → Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - Confirms L is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4. E is also correctly placed at position 5.  
  - S, T, and O are absent.  
  - The secret word now has the pattern: _ _ _ L E (positions 1-3 unknown, position 4 is L, position 5 is E).  

Key deductions:  
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O.  
- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5).  
- The secret word is a 5-letter English word ending in ""LE"".  
- The next guess must:  
  - Be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""LE"".  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O).  
  - Test new letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) to gain maximum feedback.  
- Option: ""BUGLE"" fits the pattern:  
  - Positions: 1 = B, 2 = U, 3 = G, 4 = L, 5 = E.  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - Uses new letters B, U, G which are common and not yet tested.  

Goal: Test B, U, G to determine if they are in the secret word and their positions.  

<guess>bugle</guess>",bugle,"We have two feedbacks:

From Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
So: 
  - E is in the word and at position 5 (so the word ends with E).
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2: ""stole""
Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)
Breakdown:
- S(x) -> S not in the word
- T(x) -> T not in the word
- O(x) -> O not in the word
- L(✓) -> L is in the word and in the correct position. Since ""stole"" has L at position 4, this means the secret word has L as the fourth letter.
- E(✓) -> already known, at position 5.

So, current knowledge:
- The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ L E
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O
- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with ""LE"" (positions 4 and 5: L and E).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, T, O.
- We are uncertain about the first three positions.

Given the absent letters, we eliminate many common letters. We must use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word with pattern _ _ _ L E.

We must choose a word that uses some of these remaining letters and is a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ""LE"": 
- Examples: table, maple, apple, but they contain A and T which are out.
- Other words: style (but S and T are out), while (W, H, I, L, E but letters must be in pattern).

Pattern: three letters then L and E, so the word must be [letter1][letter2][letter3]LE.

We must avoid S, T, O, C, R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with LE and avoid the forbidden letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""FILE"": F, I, L, E -> so pattern: F I L E? But wait, the pattern must be _ _ _ L E, meaning the fourth is L and fifth is E. So ""FILE"" would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:L, but then the fourth would be E? That doesn't match because we need position 4 to be L and 5 to be E.

In ""FILE"":
Position 1: F
Position 2: I
Position 3: L -> but we need L at position 4? No, because pattern is _ _ _ L E, so L must be at index 4 (the fourth letter). In ""FILE"", L is at position 3? Actually, ""FILE"" is F-I-L-E, so:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L -> should be the fourth? No, it's the third.
We need the word to have L at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

So the word must be four letters before E? No: the word is five letters: position 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 must be L, and position 5 must be E. So the last two letters are fixed as L and E.

Therefore, the word is [1] [2] [3] L E.

So the first three letters can be any combination of allowed letters.

Now, in ""FILE"": it's only four letters? No, FILE is 4 letters? Wait, FILE is 4 letters: F-I-L-E. We need a 5-letter word.

So we need 5-letter words ending in LE? But note: ending in LE meaning positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the word must be ...LE at the end.

For example: 
- APPLE: A-P-P-L-E -> positions 4:L, 5:E -> but A and P? But A is absent.
- MAPLE: M-A-P-L-E -> A is absent.
- TABLE: T-A-B-L-E -> T and A absent.
- NOBLE: N-O-B-L-E -> N and O absent (N from guess1, O from guess2).
- MOTILE: M-O-T-I-L-E -> M, O, T, I, L, E -> O and T absent.
- So we need a word without the absent letters.

List of 5-letter words ending with LE that don't contain C,R,A,N,S,T,O:
Some options:

- ""ANOLE"": But A is absent -> invalid
- ""ARGLE"": A and R absent -> invalid
- ""BAILE"": A absent -> invalid
- ""BIBLE"": B,I,B,L,E -> contains B and I? Check letters: B, I, B, L, E. Letters: B, I, E, L (and E we know). But we need pattern: B at 1, I at 2, B at 3? That's ""BIBLE"". But note: B appears twice? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But also, we haven't tested B or I yet. However, A is not in it? But A is absent? A is not used in BIBLE, and C,R,A,N,S,T,O are absent? 
  - B: not tested
  - I: not tested
  - B: again (duplicate)
  - L: known
  - E: known

But let's check if ""BIBLE"" is allowed: Yes, it's a word. But having B twice? It might be okay, but we'll get feedback per letter.

Alternatively:
- ""BOULE"": contains O -> invalid
- ""CABLE"": C -> invalid
- ""DIVLE"": not a word
- ""EAGLE"": A -> invalid
- ""FABLE"": A -> invalid
- ""GAVLE"": not common, and might contain A? G,A,V,L,E -> A absent -> invalid
- ""HOVEL"": H,O,V,E,L -> O absent -> invalid
- ""IDYLE"": no, usually spelled ""idyll"" but not 5 letters? Or ""idylle""? Not standard. Let's stick to common words.

Better words:
- ""MILLE"": but not English? Not typically.
We need common English words.

Another possibility: ""BILLE"" not common, or ""GUILE"" has U and I but let's check:
- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> pattern: G U I L E -> position 4:L, 5:E. Now, check absent letters: no C,R,A,N,S,T,O -> so G,U,I are allowed? Yes.

But ""GUILE"" is a word (meaning slyness).

Similarly, ""QUILE"" not a word.

Another word: ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> W, H, I are not in absent list. Pattern: W at1, H at2, I at3, L at4, E at5.

So ""WHILE"" would work.

Similarly, ""PHYLE"": P,H,Y,L,E -> Y might be less common, but valid.

But ""PHYLE"" might not be well-known.

Common words: 
- ""TITLE"": but T absent -> invalid
- ""SPILE"": S absent -> invalid
- ""SMILE"": S absent -> invalid

""WHILE"" seems good.

What about ""ANKLE"": A and K? A is absent -> invalid

""APPLE"", ""BIBLE"", ""EVOKE"" doesn't end with LE.

""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> pattern: E at1, X at2, I at3, L at4, E at5? But wait, E is at position 1 and 5? We know E is at position 5, but we don't know if it exists elsewhere. So ""EXILE"" would be a candidate? Pattern: E X I L E -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E.

Now, we know E is at position 5, but in our first guess we had E only at position 5 and no other E? But feedback only said E was correct at the fifth position. There might be another E? So it's possible.

""EXILE"" contains E at position 1? We don't know if that E is in the secret word or not. So let's consider ""EXILE"".

Letters: E, X, I, L, E -> but L is fixed at 4, E at 5. So first three: E,X,I? Then we get E at position 1.

However, we don't have any feedback about E at other positions. In the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 and it was correct. If there were an E at position 1, would it show as correct? Probably? But we didn't guess E at position 1 then. So it might be.

But note: ""EXILE"" is valid.

Similarly, ""AXILE"": but A is absent -> invalid.

Another word: ""OILED""? But wait, ""OILED"" ends with D, not LE? We need L at 4 and E at 5? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D, positions: L at position 3, not 4 -> doesn't fit.

We must have exactly L at position 4 and E at position 5.

So, we are looking for words with fourth letter L and fifth letter E.

Let me think:

Possible words: (avoiding C,R,A,N,S,T,O)

Common ones:
- ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> letters W,H,I
- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> G,U,I
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> B,E,L (but E is at position 1 and 5? But we know E at 5, and L at 4. But we have L at 3 as well? Duplicate L? But we don't know if the word has one L or multiple. Also, ""BELLE"" has E at position 1: E in secret? We don't know.

But let's look for words that don't use absent letters.

Also, we have not tested B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Ideal guess: a word that uses three new distinct letters from the remaining set for positions 1,2,3.

Option: ""WHILE"": 
Letters: W, H, I, L, E -> L and E are known, so new: W, H, I.

Similarly, ""GUILE"": G, U, I -> new: G,U,I.

But ""GUILE"" might be less common than ""WHILE"".

Another: ""PHILE"": not standard? Usually ""phile"" as suffix, but standalone? Not common.

""AXILE"": invalid due to A.

""IDYLE"": not common.

""EXILE"": E, X, I -> good? But E at position 1: if we get feedback for E at position 1, we might learn about another E? Or it might be a duplicate? But we already have E at 5.

But note: E is already known to be present at position 5. If there is another E, it might be correct or incorrect position? 

However, in ""exile"", if the secret word has E only at position 5, then the E at position 1 would be absent or wrong? Actually, E is present so it might be '-' if there's only one E? But we don't know. Could be ✓ if the secret word has E at position 1.

But to avoid complexity of duplicates, perhaps choose a word without any more E's? 

For instance, ""WHILE"" has no E except position 5? Position 1:W,2:H,3:I → no E at other positions.

Similarly, ""GUILE"" has G,U,I → no E elsewhere.

But ""GUILE"" uses U which is a vowel, less frequent than consonants? Still, we need to cover.

Another word? ""MAPLE"" has A absent → invalid.

""KNEEL"": K,N,E,E,L → N is absent? Guess1 said N is absent → so ""KNEEL"" has N at position 2? And E at position 3 and4? Doesn't fit pattern. Pattern we need: positions 4:L and 5:E, so ""KNEEL"" ends with E at4 and L at5? No, it ends with L? Positions:1:K,2:N,3:E,4:E,5:L → not LE pattern.

Pattern must be: [1] [2] [3] L E.

So we need word ending with LE.

Other possibilities:
- ""QUILE"": not standard word.
- ""VILE"": 4 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""EMULE"": E,M,U,L,E → fits pattern: E at1, M at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. Absent letters? E allowed? But we know E at5 is correct. But E at1? Possible. Letters: E,M,U → E is known in the word but maybe at different position? M and U allowed.

But then we would be guessing E at position1? But we haven't tested it.

""EMULE"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to emulate.

Similarly, ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → pattern: B E L L E → so positions:1:B,2:E,3:L,4:L,5:E → but position3 is L? But we need position4 to be L, and position3 is also L? So position4 is the first L? Not necessarily. We don't know. But position4 is L and we have L at position3? So duplicate L possible. But also E at position2.

Not ideal as it uses E and L in different positions.

To maximize new letters: choose a word that doesn't reuse known letters except at their fixed positions.

We know L and E must be at positions 4 and 5. We shouldn't put L elsewhere to avoid confusion? We don't have to avoid using L or E elsewhere? But it might give us extra information? Or might complicate? 

But avoiding duplication might be better for initial guesses? We don't know much.

So better to avoid using L or E in positions 1-3? So we test three entirely new letters.

Therefore, for positions 1,2,3: use three distinct new letters (from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Options:

""WHILE"": W,H,I for positions1,2,3 → no L or E in 1-3.

""GUILE"": G,U,I → same.

""KINKLE"": not a word? Or kinkle? Not common.

""MILLE"": not English word in common use.

""PIXLE"": not a word.

""VIXLE"": no.

So common words: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", also ""EXILE""? But ""EXILE"" has E at position1? That reuses E. Similarly, ""BELLE"" reuses E and L.

Another word: ""DIMLE""? Not word.

""WIMLE"": no.

Or ""BILE""? 4 letters? No.

Possible: ""WEDLE""? Not word.

""FILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

Wait, 5-letter words: ""HOULE""? meaning? Not common.

""FROLE""? no.

Perhaps ""WHILE"" or ""GUILE"" is best.

Let's also consider: ""BLUME""? Ends with E? BLUME: B-L-U-M-E? Pattern: B at1,L at2,U at3,M at4,E at5? But we need L at position4? Not position2. So invalid pattern.

The pattern must have L at position4: so the word must have the fourth character as L.

So only words with structure ***L E.

Looking at words:

- ""IDLE""? 4 letters? IDLE is 4 letters? I-D-L-E.

5-letter words: we have:
- ""IDLER"": but ends with R not.
- ""IDELE"" no.

Common words: while, guile, exile, phone (but O and N absent), style (S and T absent) → excluded.

Another: ""TUILE"" → T absent? T is absent, so invalid.

So about-ficial.com lists possible 5-letter words ending in LE: 

For example: 
- ""AMBLE"" → A absent → invalid
- ""AMPLE"" → A absent
- ""APPLE"" → A absent
- ""BUGLE"" → U,G,B → no absent letters. Pattern: B U G L E → positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E → good.
Letters: B,U,G → all not tested and not absent.

""BUGLE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""DIC LE"" not word? DICOLE? No.

""FUGLE"": not common? or meaning? Fugle is a verb? Rare.

""BUGLE"" is common.

Similarly, ""THELE"" not common.

Or ""SHALE"" → ends with LE? S H A L E → but A is absent? Yes.

""DEALE"": no? Or made word? Not common.

So ""BUGLE"" seems good.

Also, ""CABLE""→C absent.

So options: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", ""BUGLE"", ""EXILE"".

Let's list them:

1. ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E → new: W,H,I
2. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E → new: G,U,I
3. ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E → new: B,U,G
4. ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E → new: X,I (but E reused at position1)

Which one to pick?
We want to test consonants and vowels? Since we have only one vowel found? E, but E is fixed. We need to test if there are other vowels? The word might have another vowel? But we don't know.

To maximize coverage: choose a word with more common letters.

Among the remaining letters: B, U, G, etc., U is a vowel? But not tested.

Similarly, I is a vowel.

In English, vowels are important.

Perhaps choose a word that has both consonants and vowel.

Also, we have 6 tries, so we have room.

But let's pick ""BUGLE"": it tests B, U, G → U is vowel? Yes.

Similarly, ""GUILE"" tests G,U,I → two vowels? U and I.

But ""BUGLE"" has U and no I? 

""BUGLE"" → consonants B,G and vowel U.

""WHILE"" has W,H (consonants) and I (vowel).

All fine.

I think ""BUGLE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants.

But let's see frequency: B and U are relatively common.

Since we know almost nothing about the first three positions, any is fine.

We can go with ""BUGLE"":

<guess>bugle</guess>

But let's format correctly.

Before, we must output.Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - Indicates E is in the secret word and at position 5, so the secret word ends with E.  
  - Letters C, R, A, and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: stole → Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - Confirms L is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4. E is also correctly placed at position 5.  
  - S, T, and O are absent.  
  - The secret word now has the pattern: _ _ _ L E (positions 1-3 unknown, position 4 is L, position 5 is E).  

Key deductions:  
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O.  
- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5).  
- The secret word is a 5-letter English word ending in ""LE"".  
- The next guess must:  
  - Be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""LE"".  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O).  
  - Test new letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) to gain maximum feedback.  
- Option: ""BUGLE"" fits the pattern:  
  - Positions: 1 = B, 2 = U, 3 = G, 4 = L, 5 = E.  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - Uses new letters B, U, G which are common and not yet tested.  

Goal: Test B, U, G to determine if they are in the secret word and their positions.",Guess 3: bugle -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(x) G(x) L(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BIBLE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) — C is not in the secret word.
R(x) — R is not in the secret word.
A(x) — A is not in the secret word.
N(x) — N is not in the secret word.
E(✓) — E is in the word and in the correct position. Since E is correct and in position, we know that the secret word ends with E? 
Looking at the positions: 
""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E.
E is at position 5 and it's correct. So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Since E is in the word and correctly placed, and the other four letters are absent, we must choose a new word that:
- Ends with E (so fifth letter is E).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N.
- Is a 5-letter English word.

Now, for our next guess, we should try to uncover more letters. We want to use common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Common consonants that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: O, U, I (since A is out and E is fixed at the end).

We can try to include some of these.

A good strategy is to try a word that has other common letters and ends with E.

Possibilities: 
- Words like ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is already ruled out, so we cannot use A.
We must avoid A.

Similarly, we can't use C, R, A, N.

Let me think of words ending with E that don't have A, C, R, N.

Some options:
- ""STOVE"": S, T, O, V, E
- ""SKATE"": but A is ruled out -> invalid because A is not allowed.
- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E
- ""SHIRE"": but R is ruled out -> we cannot use R.
- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but N is ruled out.

We have to avoid C, R, A, N.

So, let's list some words ending with E without these letters.

Consider: 
- ""BELIE"": B, E, L, I, E -> but it has two E's? But the word is BELIE (meaning to give a false impression) and has E at end and also at position 2? We don't know about duplicate letters yet. However, the feedback for E in the first guess was for position 5, so it doesn't tell us if there are other E's. But let's avoid double E for now to get more information? Alternatively, we can use it to check for another E.

But note: We only know one E is at the end. There might be another E? We don't know.

However, to maximize information, it might be better to use all new letters, but we have to use E at the end.

We can use letters that we haven't tested: for example, we haven't tried S, T, O, L, I, etc.

So, one good candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E.
But let me see if there are better ones.

Another candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses common letters.

""STOLE"": positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E.

This word doesn't contain A, C, R, N.

Similarly, ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is less common.

""PHONE"": has N which is ruled out.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q might be too rare, and we have U and I.

But let's stick with more common letters.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses S, T, O, L — all common letters.

We want to test several new letters at once.

So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

But note: the fifth letter must be E, and E is already known to be in the word and correctly placed. So we set the fifth letter as E.

Therefore, guess: STOLE.

But we write the entire word: STOLE.

After this guess, we'll get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at 5 (which we already know so it will be ✓).

But we are guessing to see if S, T, O, L are in the word and where.

So let's go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5 (e.g., ____E).
- Letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (since position 5 is E and confirmed).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on testing other common letters like S, T, O, L, I, or P to gather new information.

A suitable guess is ""stole"". It:
- Ends with E.
- Uses new letters (S, T, O, L) that haven't been tested yet.
- Contains high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O) to maximize feedback.

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two feedbacks:

From Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
So: 
  - E is in the word and at position 5 (so the word ends with E).
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2: ""stole""
Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)
Breakdown:
- S(x) -> S not in the word
- T(x) -> T not in the word
- O(x) -> O not in the word
- L(✓) -> L is in the word and in the correct position. Since ""stole"" has L at position 4, this means the secret word has L as the fourth letter.
- E(✓) -> already known, at position 5.

So, current knowledge:
- The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ L E
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O
- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with ""LE"" (positions 4 and 5: L and E).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, T, O.
- We are uncertain about the first three positions.

Given the absent letters, we eliminate many common letters. We must use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word with pattern _ _ _ L E.

We must choose a word that uses some of these remaining letters and is a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ""LE"": 
- Examples: table, maple, apple, but they contain A and T which are out.
- Other words: style (but S and T are out), while (W, H, I, L, E but letters must be in pattern).

Pattern: three letters then L and E, so the word must be [letter1][letter2][letter3]LE.

We must avoid S, T, O, C, R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with LE and avoid the forbidden letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""FILE"": F, I, L, E -> so pattern: F I L E? But wait, the pattern must be _ _ _ L E, meaning the fourth is L and fifth is E. So ""FILE"" would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:L, but then the fourth would be E? That doesn't match because we need position 4 to be L and 5 to be E.

In ""FILE"":
Position 1: F
Position 2: I
Position 3: L -> but we need L at position 4? No, because pattern is _ _ _ L E, so L must be at index 4 (the fourth letter). In ""FILE"", L is at position 3? Actually, ""FILE"" is F-I-L-E, so:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L -> should be the fourth? No, it's the third.
We need the word to have L at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

So the word must be four letters before E? No: the word is five letters: position 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 must be L, and position 5 must be E. So the last two letters are fixed as L and E.

Therefore, the word is [1] [2] [3] L E.

So the first three letters can be any combination of allowed letters.

Now, in ""FILE"": it's only four letters? No, FILE is 4 letters? Wait, FILE is 4 letters: F-I-L-E. We need a 5-letter word.

So we need 5-letter words ending in LE? But note: ending in LE meaning positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the word must be ...LE at the end.

For example: 
- APPLE: A-P-P-L-E -> positions 4:L, 5:E -> but A and P? But A is absent.
- MAPLE: M-A-P-L-E -> A is absent.
- TABLE: T-A-B-L-E -> T and A absent.
- NOBLE: N-O-B-L-E -> N and O absent (N from guess1, O from guess2).
- MOTILE: M-O-T-I-L-E -> M, O, T, I, L, E -> O and T absent.
- So we need a word without the absent letters.

List of 5-letter words ending with LE that don't contain C,R,A,N,S,T,O:
Some options:

- ""ANOLE"": But A is absent -> invalid
- ""ARGLE"": A and R absent -> invalid
- ""BAILE"": A absent -> invalid
- ""BIBLE"": B,I,B,L,E -> contains B and I? Check letters: B, I, B, L, E. Letters: B, I, E, L (and E we know). But we need pattern: B at 1, I at 2, B at 3? That's ""BIBLE"". But note: B appears twice? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But also, we haven't tested B or I yet. However, A is not in it? But A is absent? A is not used in BIBLE, and C,R,A,N,S,T,O are absent? 
  - B: not tested
  - I: not tested
  - B: again (duplicate)
  - L: known
  - E: known

But let's check if ""BIBLE"" is allowed: Yes, it's a word. But having B twice? It might be okay, but we'll get feedback per letter.

Alternatively:
- ""BOULE"": contains O -> invalid
- ""CABLE"": C -> invalid
- ""DIVLE"": not a word
- ""EAGLE"": A -> invalid
- ""FABLE"": A -> invalid
- ""GAVLE"": not common, and might contain A? G,A,V,L,E -> A absent -> invalid
- ""HOVEL"": H,O,V,E,L -> O absent -> invalid
- ""IDYLE"": no, usually spelled ""idyll"" but not 5 letters? Or ""idylle""? Not standard. Let's stick to common words.

Better words:
- ""MILLE"": but not English? Not typically.
We need common English words.

Another possibility: ""BILLE"" not common, or ""GUILE"" has U and I but let's check:
- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> pattern: G U I L E -> position 4:L, 5:E. Now, check absent letters: no C,R,A,N,S,T,O -> so G,U,I are allowed? Yes.

But ""GUILE"" is a word (meaning slyness).

Similarly, ""QUILE"" not a word.

Another word: ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> W, H, I are not in absent list. Pattern: W at1, H at2, I at3, L at4, E at5.

So ""WHILE"" would work.

Similarly, ""PHYLE"": P,H,Y,L,E -> Y might be less common, but valid.

But ""PHYLE"" might not be well-known.

Common words: 
- ""TITLE"": but T absent -> invalid
- ""SPILE"": S absent -> invalid
- ""SMILE"": S absent -> invalid

""WHILE"" seems good.

What about ""ANKLE"": A and K? A is absent -> invalid

""APPLE"", ""BIBLE"", ""EVOKE"" doesn't end with LE.

""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> pattern: E at1, X at2, I at3, L at4, E at5? But wait, E is at position 1 and 5? We know E is at position 5, but we don't know if it exists elsewhere. So ""EXILE"" would be a candidate? Pattern: E X I L E -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E.

Now, we know E is at position 5, but in our first guess we had E only at position 5 and no other E? But feedback only said E was correct at the fifth position. There might be another E? So it's possible.

""EXILE"" contains E at position 1? We don't know if that E is in the secret word or not. So let's consider ""EXILE"".

Letters: E, X, I, L, E -> but L is fixed at 4, E at 5. So first three: E,X,I? Then we get E at position 1.

However, we don't have any feedback about E at other positions. In the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 and it was correct. If there were an E at position 1, would it show as correct? Probably? But we didn't guess E at position 1 then. So it might be.

But note: ""EXILE"" is valid.

Similarly, ""AXILE"": but A is absent -> invalid.

Another word: ""OILED""? But wait, ""OILED"" ends with D, not LE? We need L at 4 and E at 5? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D, positions: L at position 3, not 4 -> doesn't fit.

We must have exactly L at position 4 and E at position 5.

So, we are looking for words with fourth letter L and fifth letter E.

Let me think:

Possible words: (avoiding C,R,A,N,S,T,O)

Common ones:
- ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> letters W,H,I
- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> G,U,I
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> B,E,L (but E is at position 1 and 5? But we know E at 5, and L at 4. But we have L at 3 as well? Duplicate L? But we don't know if the word has one L or multiple. Also, ""BELLE"" has E at position 1: E in secret? We don't know.

But let's look for words that don't use absent letters.

Also, we have not tested B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Ideal guess: a word that uses three new distinct letters from the remaining set for positions 1,2,3.

Option: ""WHILE"": 
Letters: W, H, I, L, E -> L and E are known, so new: W, H, I.

Similarly, ""GUILE"": G, U, I -> new: G,U,I.

But ""GUILE"" might be less common than ""WHILE"".

Another: ""PHILE"": not standard? Usually ""phile"" as suffix, but standalone? Not common.

""AXILE"": invalid due to A.

""IDYLE"": not common.

""EXILE"": E, X, I -> good? But E at position 1: if we get feedback for E at position 1, we might learn about another E? Or it might be a duplicate? But we already have E at 5.

But note: E is already known to be present at position 5. If there is another E, it might be correct or incorrect position? 

However, in ""exile"", if the secret word has E only at position 5, then the E at position 1 would be absent or wrong? Actually, E is present so it might be '-' if there's only one E? But we don't know. Could be ✓ if the secret word has E at position 1.

But to avoid complexity of duplicates, perhaps choose a word without any more E's? 

For instance, ""WHILE"" has no E except position 5? Position 1:W,2:H,3:I → no E at other positions.

Similarly, ""GUILE"" has G,U,I → no E elsewhere.

But ""GUILE"" uses U which is a vowel, less frequent than consonants? Still, we need to cover.

Another word? ""MAPLE"" has A absent → invalid.

""KNEEL"": K,N,E,E,L → N is absent? Guess1 said N is absent → so ""KNEEL"" has N at position 2? And E at position 3 and4? Doesn't fit pattern. Pattern we need: positions 4:L and 5:E, so ""KNEEL"" ends with E at4 and L at5? No, it ends with L? Positions:1:K,2:N,3:E,4:E,5:L → not LE pattern.

Pattern must be: [1] [2] [3] L E.

So we need word ending with LE.

Other possibilities:
- ""QUILE"": not standard word.
- ""VILE"": 4 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""EMULE"": E,M,U,L,E → fits pattern: E at1, M at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. Absent letters? E allowed? But we know E at5 is correct. But E at1? Possible. Letters: E,M,U → E is known in the word but maybe at different position? M and U allowed.

But then we would be guessing E at position1? But we haven't tested it.

""EMULE"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to emulate.

Similarly, ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → pattern: B E L L E → so positions:1:B,2:E,3:L,4:L,5:E → but position3 is L? But we need position4 to be L, and position3 is also L? So position4 is the first L? Not necessarily. We don't know. But position4 is L and we have L at position3? So duplicate L possible. But also E at position2.

Not ideal as it uses E and L in different positions.

To maximize new letters: choose a word that doesn't reuse known letters except at their fixed positions.

We know L and E must be at positions 4 and 5. We shouldn't put L elsewhere to avoid confusion? We don't have to avoid using L or E elsewhere? But it might give us extra information? Or might complicate? 

But avoiding duplication might be better for initial guesses? We don't know much.

So better to avoid using L or E in positions 1-3? So we test three entirely new letters.

Therefore, for positions 1,2,3: use three distinct new letters (from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Options:

""WHILE"": W,H,I for positions1,2,3 → no L or E in 1-3.

""GUILE"": G,U,I → same.

""KINKLE"": not a word? Or kinkle? Not common.

""MILLE"": not English word in common use.

""PIXLE"": not a word.

""VIXLE"": no.

So common words: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", also ""EXILE""? But ""EXILE"" has E at position1? That reuses E. Similarly, ""BELLE"" reuses E and L.

Another word: ""DIMLE""? Not word.

""WIMLE"": no.

Or ""BILE""? 4 letters? No.

Possible: ""WEDLE""? Not word.

""FILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

Wait, 5-letter words: ""HOULE""? meaning? Not common.

""FROLE""? no.

Perhaps ""WHILE"" or ""GUILE"" is best.

Let's also consider: ""BLUME""? Ends with E? BLUME: B-L-U-M-E? Pattern: B at1,L at2,U at3,M at4,E at5? But we need L at position4? Not position2. So invalid pattern.

The pattern must have L at position4: so the word must have the fourth character as L.

So only words with structure ***L E.

Looking at words:

- ""IDLE""? 4 letters? IDLE is 4 letters? I-D-L-E.

5-letter words: we have:
- ""IDLER"": but ends with R not.
- ""IDELE"" no.

Common words: while, guile, exile, phone (but O and N absent), style (S and T absent) → excluded.

Another: ""TUILE"" → T absent? T is absent, so invalid.

So about-ficial.com lists possible 5-letter words ending in LE: 

For example: 
- ""AMBLE"" → A absent → invalid
- ""AMPLE"" → A absent
- ""APPLE"" → A absent
- ""BUGLE"" → U,G,B → no absent letters. Pattern: B U G L E → positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E → good.
Letters: B,U,G → all not tested and not absent.

""BUGLE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""DIC LE"" not word? DICOLE? No.

""FUGLE"": not common? or meaning? Fugle is a verb? Rare.

""BUGLE"" is common.

Similarly, ""THELE"" not common.

Or ""SHALE"" → ends with LE? S H A L E → but A is absent? Yes.

""DEALE"": no? Or made word? Not common.

So ""BUGLE"" seems good.

Also, ""CABLE""→C absent.

So options: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", ""BUGLE"", ""EXILE"".

Let's list them:

1. ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E → new: W,H,I
2. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E → new: G,U,I
3. ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E → new: B,U,G
4. ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E → new: X,I (but E reused at position1)

Which one to pick?
We want to test consonants and vowels? Since we have only one vowel found? E, but E is fixed. We need to test if there are other vowels? The word might have another vowel? But we don't know.

To maximize coverage: choose a word with more common letters.

Among the remaining letters: B, U, G, etc., U is a vowel? But not tested.

Similarly, I is a vowel.

In English, vowels are important.

Perhaps choose a word that has both consonants and vowel.

Also, we have 6 tries, so we have room.

But let's pick ""BUGLE"": it tests B, U, G → U is vowel? Yes.

Similarly, ""GUILE"" tests G,U,I → two vowels? U and I.

But ""BUGLE"" has U and no I? 

""BUGLE"" → consonants B,G and vowel U.

""WHILE"" has W,H (consonants) and I (vowel).

All fine.

I think ""BUGLE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants.

But let's see frequency: B and U are relatively common.

Since we know almost nothing about the first three positions, any is fine.

We can go with ""BUGLE"":

<guess>bugle</guess>

But let's format correctly.

Before, we must output.Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - Indicates E is in the secret word and at position 5, so the secret word ends with E.  
  - Letters C, R, A, and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: stole → Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - Confirms L is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4. E is also correctly placed at position 5.  
  - S, T, and O are absent.  
  - The secret word now has the pattern: _ _ _ L E (positions 1-3 unknown, position 4 is L, position 5 is E).  

Key deductions:  
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O.  
- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5).  
- The secret word is a 5-letter English word ending in ""LE"".  
- The next guess must:  
  - Be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""LE"".  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O).  
  - Test new letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) to gain maximum feedback.  
- Option: ""BUGLE"" fits the pattern:  
  - Positions: 1 = B, 2 = U, 3 = G, 4 = L, 5 = E.  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - Uses new letters B, U, G which are common and not yet tested.  

Goal: Test B, U, G to determine if they are in the secret word and their positions.

So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word ends with E.\n- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nSince E is in the word and correctly placed, and the other four letters are absent, we must choose a new word that:\n- Ends with E (so fifth letter is E).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n- Is a 5-letter English word.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we should try to uncover more letters. We want to use common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nCommon consonants that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nCommon vowels left: O, U, I (since A is out and E is fixed at the end).\n\nWe can try to include some of these.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has other common letters and ends with E.\n\nPossibilities: \n- Words like ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is already ruled out, so we cannot use A.\nWe must avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, we can\'t use C, R, A, N.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that don\'t have A, C, R, N.\n\nSome options:\n- ""STOVE"": S, T, O, V, E\n- ""SKATE"": but A is ruled out -> invalid because A is not allowed.\n- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E\n- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E\n- ""SHIRE"": but R is ruled out -> we cannot use R.\n- ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but N is ruled out.\n\nWe have to avoid C, R, A, N.\n\nSo, let\'s list some words ending with E without these letters.\n\nConsider: \n- ""BELIE"": B, E, L, I, E -> but it has two E\'s? But the word is BELIE (meaning to give a false impression) and has E at end and also at position 2? We don\'t know about duplicate letters yet. However, the feedback for E in the first guess was for position 5, so it doesn\'t tell us if there are other E\'s. But let\'s avoid double E for now to get more information? Alternatively, we can use it to check for another E.\n\nBut note: We only know one E is at the end. There might be another E? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, it might be better to use all new letters, but we have to use E at the end.\n\nWe can use letters that we haven\'t tested: for example, we haven\'t tried S, T, O, L, I, etc.\n\nSo, one good candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E.\nBut let me see if there are better ones.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses common letters.\n\n""STOLE"": positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E.\n\nThis word doesn\'t contain A, C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is less common.\n\n""PHONE"": has N which is ruled out.\n\n""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q might be too rare, and we have U and I.\n\nBut let\'s stick with more common letters.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses S, T, O, L — all common letters.\n\nWe want to test several new letters at once.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\nBut note: the fifth letter must be E, and E is already known to be in the word and correctly placed. So we set the fifth letter as E.\n\nTherefore, guess: STOLE.\n\nBut we write the entire word: STOLE.\n\nAfter this guess, we\'ll get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at 5 (which we already know so it will be ✓).\n\nBut we are guessing to see if S, T, O, L are in the word and where.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5 (e.g., ____E).\n- Letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (since position 5 is E and confirmed).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Focus on testing other common letters like S, T, O, L, I, or P to gather new information.\n\nA suitable guess is ""stole"". It:\n- Ends with E.\n- Uses new letters (S, T, O, L) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- Contains high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O) to maximize feedback.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two feedbacks:\n\nFrom Guess 1: ""crane""\n- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nSo: \n  - E is in the word and at position 5 (so the word ends with E).\n  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nFrom Guess 2: ""stole""\nFeedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)\nBreakdown:\n- S(x) -> S not in the word\n- T(x) -> T not in the word\n- O(x) -> O not in the word\n- L(✓) -> L is in the word and in the correct position.

But wait, the pattern must be _ _ _ L E, meaning the fourth is L and fifth is E. So ""FILE"" would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:L, but then the fourth would be E? That doesn\'t match because we need position 4 to be L and 5 to be E.\n\nIn ""FILE"":\nPosition 1: F\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: L -> but we need L at position 4? No, because pattern is _ _ _ L E, so L must be at index 4 (the fourth letter). In ""FILE"", L is at position 3? Actually, ""FILE"" is F-I-L-E, so:\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: L -> should be the fourth? No, it\'s the third.\nWe need the word to have L at the fourth position and E at the fifth.\n\nSo the word must be four letters before E? No: the word is five letters: position 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 must be L, and position 5 must be E. So the last two letters are fixed as L and E.\n\nTherefore, the word is [1] [2] [3] L E.\n\nSo the first three letters can be any combination of allowed letters.\n\nNow, in ""FILE"": it\'s only four letters? No, FILE is 4 letters? Wait, FILE is 4 letters: F-I-L-E. We need a 5-letter word.\n\nSo we need 5-letter words ending in LE? But note: ending in LE meaning positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the word must be ...LE at the end.\n\nFor example: \n- APPLE: A-P-P-L-E -> positions 4:L, 5:E -> but A and P? But A is absent.\n- MAPLE: M-A-P-L-E -> A is absent.\n- TABLE: T-A-B-L-E -> T and A absent.\n- NOBLE: N-O-B-L-E -> N and O absent (N from guess1, O from guess2).\n- MOTILE: M-O-T-I-L-E -> M, O, T, I, L, E -> O and T absent.\n- So we need a word without the absent letters.\n\nList of 5-letter words ending with LE that don\'t contain C,R,A,N,S,T,O:\nSome options:\n\n- ""ANOLE"": But A is absent -> invalid\n- ""ARGLE"": A and R absent -> invalid\n- ""BAILE"": A absent -> invalid\n- ""BIBLE"": B,I,B,L,E -> contains B and I? Check letters: B, I, B, L, E. Letters: B, I, E, L (and E we know). But we need pattern: B at 1, I at 2, B at 3? That\'s ""BIBLE"". But note: B appears twice? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But also, we haven\'t tested B or I yet. However, A is not in it? But A is absent? A is not used in BIBLE, and C,R,A,N,S,T,O are absent? \n  - B: not tested\n  - I: not tested\n  - B: again (duplicate)\n  - L: known\n  - E: known\n\nBut let\'s check if ""BIBLE"" is allowed: Yes, it\'s a word. But having B twice? It might be okay, but we\'ll get feedback per letter.\n\nAlternatively:\n- ""BOULE"": contains O -> invalid\n- ""CABLE"": C -> invalid\n- ""DIVLE"": not a word\n- ""EAGLE"": A -> invalid\n- ""FABLE"": A -> invalid\n- ""GAVLE"": not common, and might contain A? G,A,V,L,E -> A absent -> invalid\n- ""HOVEL"": H,O,V,E,L -> O absent -> invalid\n- ""IDYLE"": no, usually spelled ""idyll"" but not 5 letters? Or ""idylle""? Not standard. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nBetter words:\n- ""MILLE"": but not English? Not typically.\nWe need common English words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BILLE"" not common, or ""GUILE"" has U and I but let\'s check:\n- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> pattern: G U I L E -> position 4:L, 5:E. Now, check absent letters: no C,R,A,N,S,T,O -> so G,U,I are allowed? Yes.\n\nBut ""GUILE"" is a word (meaning slyness).\n\nSimilarly, ""QUILE"" not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> W, H, I are not in absent list. Pattern: W at1, H at2, I at3, L at4, E at5.\n\nSo ""WHILE"" would work.\n\nSimilarly, ""PHYLE"": P,H,Y,L,E -> Y might be less common, but valid.\n\nBut ""PHYLE"" might not be well-known.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""TITLE"": but T absent -> invalid\n- ""SPILE"": S absent -> invalid\n- ""SMILE"": S absent -> invalid\n\n""WHILE"" seems good.\n\nWhat about ""ANKLE"": A and K? A is absent -> invalid\n\n""APPLE"", ""BIBLE"", ""EVOKE"" doesn\'t end with LE.\n\n""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> pattern: E at1, X at2, I at3, L at4, E at5? But wait, E is at position 1 and 5? We know E is at position 5, but we don\'t know if it exists elsewhere. So ""EXILE"" would be a candidate? Pattern: E X I L E -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E.\n\nNow, we know E is at position 5, but in our first guess we had E only at position 5 and no other E? But feedback only said E was correct at the fifth position. There might be another E? So it\'s possible.\n\n""EXILE"" contains E at position 1? We don\'t know if that E is in the secret word or not. So let\'s consider ""EXILE"".\n\nLetters: E, X, I, L, E -> but L is fixed at 4, E at 5. So first three: E,X,I? Then we get E at position 1.\n\nHowever, we don\'t have any feedback about E at other positions. In the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 and it was correct. If there were an E at position 1, would it show as correct? Probably? But we didn\'t guess E at position 1 then. So it might be.\n\nBut note: ""EXILE"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""AXILE"": but A is absent -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""OILED""? But wait, ""OILED"" ends with D, not LE? We need L at 4 and E at 5? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D, positions: L at position 3, not 4 -> doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have exactly L at position 4 and E at position 5.\n\nSo, we are looking for words with fourth letter L and fifth letter E.\n\nLet me think:\n\nPossible words: (avoiding C,R,A,N,S,T,O)\n\nCommon ones:\n- ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> letters W,H,I\n- ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> G,U,I\n- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> B,E,L (but E is at position 1 and 5? But we know E at 5, and L at 4. But we have L at 3 as well? Duplicate L? But we don\'t know if the word has one L or multiple. Also, ""BELLE"" has E at position 1: E in secret? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that don\'t use absent letters.\n\nAlso, we have not tested B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nIdeal guess: a word that uses three new distinct letters from the remaining set for positions 1,2,3.\n\nOption: ""WHILE"": \nLetters: W, H, I, L, E -> L and E are known, so new: W, H, I.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILE"": G, U, I -> new: G,U,I.\n\nBut ""GUILE"" might be less common than ""WHILE"".\n\nAnother: ""PHILE"": not standard? Usually ""phile"" as suffix, but standalone? Not common.\n\n""AXILE"": invalid due to A.\n\n""IDYLE"": not common.\n\n""EXILE"": E, X, I -> good? But E at position 1: if we get feedback for E at position 1, we might learn about another E? Or it might be a duplicate? But we already have E at 5.\n\nBut note: E is already known to be present at position 5. If there is another E, it might be correct or incorrect position? \n\nHowever, in ""exile"", if the secret word has E only at position 5, then the E at position 1 would be absent or wrong? Actually, E is present so it might be \'-\' if there\'s only one E? But we don\'t know. Could be ✓ if the secret word has E at position 1.\n\nBut to avoid complexity of duplicates, perhaps choose a word without any more E\'s? \n\nFor instance, ""WHILE"" has no E except position 5? Position 1:W,2:H,3:I → no E at other positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILE"" has G,U,I → no E elsewhere.\n\nBut ""GUILE"" uses U which is a vowel, less frequent than consonants? Still, we need to cover.\n\nAnother word? ""MAPLE"" has A absent → invalid.\n\n""KNEEL"": K,N,E,E,L → N is absent? Guess1 said N is absent → so ""KNEEL"" has N at position 2? And E at position 3 and4? Doesn\'t fit pattern. Pattern we need: positions 4:L and 5:E, so ""KNEEL"" ends with E at4 and L at5? No, it ends with L? Positions:1:K,2:N,3:E,4:E,5:L → not LE pattern.\n\nPattern must be: [1] [2] [3] L E.\n\nSo we need word ending with LE.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""QUILE"": not standard word.\n- ""VILE"": 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""EMULE"": E,M,U,L,E → fits pattern: E at1, M at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. Absent letters? E allowed? But we know E at5 is correct. But E at1? Possible. Letters: E,M,U → E is known in the word but maybe at different position? M and U allowed.\n\nBut then we would be guessing E at position1? But we haven\'t tested it.\n\n""EMULE"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to emulate.\n\nSimilarly, ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → pattern: B E L L E → so positions:1:B,2:E,3:L,4:L,5:E → but position3 is L? But we need position4 to be L, and position3 is also L? So position4 is the first L? Not necessarily. We don\'t know. But position4 is L and we have L at position3? So duplicate L possible. But also E at position2.\n\nNot ideal as it uses E and L in different positions.\n\nTo maximize new letters: choose a word that doesn\'t reuse known letters except at their fixed positions.\n\nWe know L and E must be at positions 4 and 5. We shouldn\'t put L elsewhere to avoid confusion? We don\'t have to avoid using L or E elsewhere? But it might give us extra information? Or might complicate? \n\nBut avoiding duplication might be better for initial guesses? We don\'t know much.\n\nSo better to avoid using L or E in positions 1-3? So we test three entirely new letters.\n\nTherefore, for positions 1,2,3: use three distinct new letters (from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).\n\nOptions:\n\n""WHILE"": W,H,I for positions1,2,3 → no L or E in 1-3.\n\n""GUILE"": G,U,I → same.\n\n""KINKLE"": not a word? Or kinkle? Not common.\n\n""MILLE"": not English word in common use.\n\n""PIXLE"": not a word.\n\n""VIXLE"": no.\n\nSo common words: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", also ""EXILE""? But ""EXILE"" has E at position1? That reuses E. Similarly, ""BELLE"" reuses E and L.\n\nAnother word: ""DIMLE""? Not word.\n\n""WIMLE"": no.\n\nOr ""BILE""? 4 letters? No.\n\nPossible: ""WEDLE""? Not word.\n\n""FILE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\nWait, 5-letter words: ""HOULE""? meaning? Not common.\n\n""FROLE""? no.\n\nPerhaps ""WHILE"" or ""GUILE"" is best.\n\nLet\'s also consider: ""BLUME""? Ends with E? BLUME: B-L-U-M-E? Pattern: B at1,L at2,U at3,M at4,E at5? But we need L at position4? Not position2. So invalid pattern.\n\nThe pattern must have L at position4: so the word must have the fourth character as L.\n\nSo only words with structure ***L E.\n\nLooking at words:\n\n- ""IDLE""? 4 letters? IDLE is 4 letters? I-D-L-E.\n\n5-letter words: we have:\n- ""IDLER"": but ends with R not.\n- ""IDELE"" no.\n\nCommon words: while, guile, exile, phone (but O and N absent), style (S and T absent) → excluded.\n\nAnother: ""TUILE"" → T absent? T is absent, so invalid.\n\nSo about-ficial.com lists possible 5-letter words ending in LE: \n\nFor example: \n- ""AMBLE"" → A absent → invalid\n- ""AMPLE"" → A absent\n- ""APPLE"" → A absent\n- ""BUGLE"" → U,G,B → no absent letters. Pattern: B U G L E → positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E → good.\nLetters: B,U,G → all not tested and not absent.\n\n""BUGLE"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIC LE"" not word? DICOLE? No.\n\n""FUGLE"": not common? or meaning? Fugle is a verb? Rare.\n\n""BUGLE"" is common.\n\nSimilarly, ""THELE"" not common.\n\nOr ""SHALE"" → ends with LE? S H A L E → but A is absent? Yes.\n\n""DEALE"": no? Or made word? Not common.\n\nSo ""BUGLE"" seems good.\n\nAlso, ""CABLE""→C absent.\n\nSo options: ""WHILE"", ""GUILE"", ""BUGLE"", ""EXILE"".\n\nLet\'s list them:\n\n1. ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E → new: W,H,I\n2. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E → new: G,U,I\n3. ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E → new: B,U,G\n4. ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E → new: X,I (but E reused at position1)\n\nWhich one to pick?\nWe want to test consonants and vowels? Since we have only one vowel found? E, but E is fixed. We need to test if there are other vowels? The word might have another vowel? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize coverage: choose a word with more common letters.\n\nAmong the remaining letters: B, U, G, etc., U is a vowel? But not tested.\n\nSimilarly, I is a vowel.\n\nIn English, vowels are important.\n\nPerhaps choose a word that has both consonants and vowel.\n\nAlso, we have 6 tries, so we have room.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""BUGLE"": it tests B, U, G → U is vowel? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILE"" tests G,U,I → two vowels? U and I.\n\nBut ""BUGLE"" has U and no I? \n\n""BUGLE"" → consonants B,G and vowel U.\n\n""WHILE"" has W,H (consonants) and I (vowel).\n\nAll fine.\n\nI think ""BUGLE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants.\n\nBut let\'s see frequency: B and U are relatively common.\n\nSince we know almost nothing about the first three positions, any is fine.\n\nWe can go with ""BUGLE"":\n\n<guess>bugle</guess>\n\nBut let\'s format correctly.\n\nBefore, we must output.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  \n  - Indicates E is in the secret word and at position 5, so the secret word ends with E.  \n  - Letters C, R, A, and N are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: stole → Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  \n  - Confirms L is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4. E is also correctly placed at position 5.  \n  - S, T, and O are absent.  \n  - The secret word now has the pattern: _ _ _ L E (positions 1-3 unknown, position 4 is L, position 5 is E).  \n\nKey deductions:  \n- Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O.  \n- Known present letters: L (position 4), E (position 5).  \n- The secret word is a 5-letter English word ending in ""LE"".  \n- The next guess must:  \n  - Be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""LE"".  \n  - Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O).  \n  - Test new letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) to gain maximum feedback.  \n- Option: ""BUGLE"" fits the pattern:  \n  - Positions: 1 = B, 2 = U, 3 = G, 4 = L, 5 = E.  \n  - Avoids all absent letters.  \n  - Uses new letters B, U, G which are common and not yet tested.  \n\nGoal: Test B, U, G to determine if they are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>bugle</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: bugle -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(x) G(x) L(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - E is present and correctly placed at position 5. Absent: C, R, A, N.

2. Guess 2: ""stole"" → S(x), T(x), O(x), L(✓), E(✓)
   - L is present and correctly placed at position 4. E correct at position 5. Absent: S, T, O.

3. Guess 3: ""bugle"" → B(✓), U(x), G(x), L(✓), E(✓)
   - B is present and correctly placed at position 1. U absent. G absent. L and E correct.
   - So: B is at position 1, U and G are not in the word.

Current knowns:
- Position 1: B (since B(✓) in guess 3)
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, U, G

Pattern: B _ _ L E

We need to find the second and third letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Remaining letters (not absent and not used in known positions): 
- Alphabet without B,L,E (used) and absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G → excluded.
- Remaining: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The secret word is B _ _ L E.

We need a 5-letter English word with pattern B _ _ L E, using letters from D,F,H,I,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: we'll need two letters from that set.

Common words:
- ""BIBLE"": but I and B? Pattern: B I B L E → however, B at position 1 and 3? But we have B at position 1 (confirmed). If we use B again at position 3, it might be valid? But the feedback in guess 3 only showed B at position 1 as correct (and absent for U and G). 
  - However, ""BIBLE"" has B at position 1 and 3? Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E → letter B might appear twice? The word ""BIBLE"" is valid.

But letters: B (known), I, B (duplicate B), L, E. We already know B is present. Does the secret word have B twice? We don't know.

Similarly, ""BIDLE""? Not a word? Or ""BADDLE""? No.

Common words with B_L_E:
- ""BAYLE"": but A is absent → invalid.
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → E at position 2? But E is known only at position 5 so far. But feedback hasn't shown E elsewhere? Also, ""BELLE"" has two L's? Positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L (but L must be at position 4? No, because position 3 is L? But pattern requires L at position 4 → In ""BELLE"" it would be B E L L E → position 3:L? But we need position 4:L? → Position 4 is L? Actually: 
  - Pos1:B, pos2:E, pos3:L, pos4:L, pos5:E → so position 4 is L? Yes.

But we have E at position 2? And we know E is in the word, but at position 5? If there's E at position 2, it might be valid? But we haven't tested E at other positions.

However, ""BELLE"" uses E at position 2 → letter E which we know is in the word, but duplicated? And positions aren't tested.

But note: E is at position 5 and also at position 2? Possible.

But letters: E at pos2? E is already known at pos5, so we shouldn't exclude it? But we need to know if E is duplicated.

Similarly, in ""BIBLE"", we have I and duplicate B.

But let's consider the absent letters: ""BIBLE"" has B,I,B,L,E → absent letters: no C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G → so I is allowed.

What about ""BIKE""? Not 5 letters? 5-letter word: B I K L E? ""BIKLE"" not common. ""BIC L E"" not.

""BILE"" is 4 letters.

Standard words:
- ""BILGE"": but G was guessed in guess 3 and is absent → cannot use G.
- ""BIGLE"" not word.

Another: ""BIRLE""? Meaning? But R absent → R is absent.

""BIT L E"" not.

""BOWLE""? O and W? O absent → invalid.

""BOXLE"" not word.

Perhaps ""BUMPLE"" too long? No.

So let's list possibilities:
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → positions:1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E → but position 3 is L? And position 4 is L? This satisfies the pattern? 
  - The pattern requires position 4 to be L? In ""BELLE"" position 4 is L? Let's see: B-E-L-L-E → 
    Index1: B
    Index2: E
    Index3: L
    Index4: L
    Index5: E
  → Position 4 is L? Yes.

But we have L at position 4? And also at position 3? So L at pos3 and pos4? Possible? But we know L must be at pos4, but it might be duplicated? 

Similarly, E at position2 and position5? Yes.

But ""BELLE"" has:
- Letters: B (known), E (known to be in word at pos5, but not necessarily at pos2?), L (known at pos4, but duplicate at pos3?).

And E and L are known to be in the word? So duplicates might be possible? 

However, in ""BELLE"" we have E at position2 → not yet tested? And L at position3 → not known? 

But the problem: if E is at position2 and we know E is at position5, it could be the same E or duplicated? 

But we don't know if there are duplicates.

Options: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z → so let's try words that use two from these.

Common word: ""BIBLE"" → B,I,B,L,E → positions:1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E → letter I is allowed (not tested), and duplicate B? But that's okay.

Similarly, ""BIKAL"" not.

Or ""BIMBLE""? Not common.

Other words: ""BINDLE""? N absent? N is absent → cannot.

""BIPLE"" no.

""BITTLE"" ends with LE? B,I,T,T,L,E → T is absent? T absent → invalid.

""BIZZLE""? possible? But not common.

""BODLE"" O absent.

""BOOLE"" O absent.

""BRULE"" R absent → invalid.

So ""BIBLE"" seems a candidate? Even with duplicate B? But in guess 3, we guessed ""BUGLE"" and got B at position 1 correct. If the secret word had B at position 3 as well, it should have been indicated? But in guess 3 (""BUGLE"") we had B at pos1 and U at pos2? But we got U absent. So U not present. But for B: is only pos1 known? We didn't guess B at pos3? We don't know.

Therefore, ""BIBLE"" is possible.

Another word: ""BETLE"" not common? Or ""bettle"" → B,E,T,T,L,E? T absent → invalid.

""BEWLE"" no.

""BIDE L E"" not.

So few options: ""BIBLE"", ""BELLE"", or ""BYKLE"" not common.

""BEVLE"" no.

Perhaps ""DWEL"" but not.

Another possibility: ""BAZ L E"" no.

""BILE"" - 4 letters.

In English, ""BILE"" is 4, but what about 5-letter? Not easy.

What about ""BID E L"" not.

Perhaps ""BIB LE"" ""Bible"" is often capitalized? But in Wordle, common nouns.

But ""bible"" is accepted.

Similarly, ""belle"".

We also have ""BOL E"" no.

Or ""BYSSINE"" not 5.

So likely candidates: 
1. ""BIBLE"" → uses letters B (pos1), I (new), B (duplicate? at pos3), L (pos4), E (pos5).
2. ""BELLE"" → B (pos1), E (at pos2, whereas E is at pos5), L (at pos3 and pos4? L at pos3 new, at pos4 known), E (pos5).

But ""BELLE"": has E at position2? And L at position3? And E at position5? And L at position4? 

But in ""BELLE"": 
  Position 1: B ✓
  Position 2: E — not tested? But E is known to be in the word at pos5; if no duplicate, E at pos2 would be wrong? Or also correct? Depending on the word.

We need to guess.

We have limited options.

Let's see the feedback history: the secret word has B at position1, L at position4, E at position5.

The word has at least these three letters? And we know C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G are absent.

So for positions 2 and 3, it must be with the remaining letters: D,F,H,I,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now common words: 
- ""BIKE"" ... not 5-letter? ""Bikes"" 5? B,I,K,E,S → ends with S not LE? No.
- ""BIDET"" no.

But specifically pattern B _ _ L E:

- ""BIBLE"" → I and B? So for positions 2 and 3: I and B → B is at position1 already and also at position3? So B might be duplicated? Possible.
- ""BELLE"" → E and L? But L is at position4? And also at position3? L duplicated? Possible? And E also at position2? E duplicated?

But also, ""MAP? None.

Another word: ""BIBLE"" is one of the most common?

Or ""BEVEL"" → B,E,V,E,L → pattern: B at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5? But we need L at position4? Not pos5→ invalid pattern.

""BRINE"" no.

Perhaps ""BIRTH"" no.

I think ""BIBLE"" and ""BELLE"" are the primary candidates.

Additionally, ""BAYLE"" is invalid.

""BOW L E"" no.

""BUCKLE"" C absent and U absent? from guess3: U absent → invalid.

""BUFLE"" not word.

So between ""BIBLE"" and ""BELLE"", which to guess?

We have only 3 guesses so far, so we can afford one to test.

But let's think: in ""BIBLE"", if we guess it, and if it's the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

Similarly for ""BELLE"".

But maybe guess one that tests more new letters? But both will test the middle letters.

""BIBLE"" has I at position2? And B at position3? But B is already known? So we'd be reusing B? Which we know is present? But with ""BELLE"" reuses E and L in other positions.

In ""BIBLE"", we only test one new letter: I at position2? And position3 we use B (but B is known? We know B is at position1, so using it at position3 might be informative).

Similarly in ""BELLE"", we have E at2 and L at3 → both known letters but in different positions? So we'd get feedback on E and L at new positions? 

But we already know L is at position4? And E at position5? So using them at other positions might be redundant? 

For example, if we guess ""BELLE"":
- Position 1: B ✓
- Position 2: E? E might be elsewhere? If E is only at position5, then position2 E would be 'wrong position' or not? E exists, so it would be '-' meaning in word but wrong position? Or if there is only one E and it's at pos5, then E at pos2 would be marked as present but wrong position? Because E is at 5? But position5 is also E in the guess? So for pos5 E: it would be correct? So E at pos2: if secret has E only at pos5, then pos2 E should be marked as '-'? Because it's in the word but not at position2? 

But in secret, if it has only one E, at position5? Then:
- Guess ""BELLE"": position2: E -> marked as '-' (since E is at pos5, not2), position3: L -> L is at position4? But if no duplicate L, then L at position3 would be absent? But secret L is only at4? So position3: L -> 'x' absent? Or? If L is only at position4, then position3 L would be 'x' because it's not present? Not necessarily? L might be at position4, so if the secret has L only at position4, and we put L at position3, it would be 'x'? Because it's not in any other position? But L is present, so even if dup, but not in position3? 

Recap: Feedback rule:
- ✓: correct position
- -: in the word but wrong position
- x: not in the word

For a letter that is in the word only once:
- If you guess it in a position that isn't where it is: marked as '-'
- If you guess a duplicate? But if the secret has one, and you guess two, then if one is at correct position it gets ✓, the other gets 'x'?? No, because it's not in the word more than once? So extra gets 'x'.

Example: Secret has one E at position5.
If you guess a word with E at position2 and E at position5:
- Position2: E -> '-' because E is in the word but not here (since at position5)
- Position5: E -> ✓
But if secret has E also at position2? Then E at pos2 would be ✓.

But in secret for BELLE: if secret BIBLE, then in BELLE? But secret not BELLE.

In our case, for guess: 

Suppose secret is BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E

If we guess BELLE: B,E,L,L,E

Feedback for BELLE vs BIBLE:
- Position1: B vs B → ✓
- Position2: E vs I → E not in secret? Secret has I, no E? But E is in secret word? Secret BIBLE has no E except at pos5? Positions: pos1:B, pos2:I, pos3:B, pos4:L, pos5:E → so secret has E only at position5? And L only at position4.

Guess: BELLE: B,E,L,L,E

So:
- Position1: B compare to B → ✓
- Position2: E compare to I: E not in secret? Because secret has E only at position5, but not letter E? Letter E is in secret at position5. When comparing position2: the letter E is in the secret? Secret has E at position5. So E is in the word, but not at position2? Therefore, mark as '-'.

- Position3: L compare to:B → L here? Secret has L at position4? Not at pos3? And L is in the secret? So present but not at pos3? Mark as '-'

- Position4: L compare to:L → ✓
- Position5: E to:E → ✓

And secret BIBLE has B duplicated? But guess BELLE has L duplicated? Not matching.

But for now, we can't know.

But to progress, let's guess ""BIBLE"" since it has a new letter I.

Similarly, if we guess ""BIBLE"":
- If secret is BIBLE, all correct.
- If secret has different letters, we get feedback.

Now, are there other words? Let's try ""BIKE L"" not.

""BIPED"" ends with D.

""BIRKS"" not.

""BIMBO"" no O? Pattern? B, I, M, B, O → ends with O, not E.

But we need L E.

""BIKAL"" not.

Perhaps ""BID L E"" not.

Another word: ""BIDLE"" not common? Or ""bield"" not 5 letters.

But in English, what about ""BY? No.

Perhaps ""BILEM"" no.

I think ""BIBLE"" and ""BELLE"" are the best candidates.

But there's also ""BOWAL"" O absent.

Or ""BO X L E"" not.

Let's include a word: ""DEMI L"" no.

Perhaps ""BIN L E"" not.

Since G is absent, U absent, etc.

I just found: ""BIDET"" not.

So I'll go with ""BIBLE"" for now.

But we have other letters: like H? ""BI H L E"" not.

""BIGHT"" no LE.

""BIGOT"" no LE.

So likely, ""BIBLE"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""BOOK L E"" no.

Another: ""BRISE"" not.

But let's consider if the secret could be ""BIBLE"": pattern matches.

We can guess ""BIBLE"" now.

In the response, we must output.

Thought process summarize:

Based on feedback:
- Pattern is B _ _ L E
- Known absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G
- Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 3: D,F,H,I,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
- After considering common English words, ""BIBLE"" fits the pattern and uses letter I (new, not tested) and B at position 3 (which might be duplicated; we know B is at position 1). If ""BIBLE"" is correct, we win. If not, we gain feedback on positions 2 and 3.
- Other options like ""BELLE"" exist but reuse known letters E and L in positions that may duplicate; starting with ""BIBLE"" is reasonable.

To be precise.

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5. Absent: C, R, A, N.
- **Guess 2: stole → Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - L is correctly placed at position 4. E remains correct at position 5. Absent: S, T, O. Secret pattern: _ _ _ L E.
- **Guess 3: bugle → Feedback: B(✓) U(x) G(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - B is correctly placed at position 1. U and G are absent. Confirms L at position 4 and E at position 5. Secret pattern: B _ _ L E.

Deductions:
- Known letters:  
  - Position 1: B  
  - Position 4: L  
  - Position 5: E  
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, U, G  
- Secret word pattern: B _ _ L E  
- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the absent list: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Next steps: 
- Since the pattern is B _ _ L E, the word must be a valid English word with B at position 1, an unknown letter at positions 2 and 3, L at 4, and E at 5.  
- ""BIBLE"" (B-I-B-L-E) uses B (known) and tests I at position 2 and duplicated B at position 3. B duplication is possible and gives information if not correct.  
- Common alternatives like ""BELLE"" reuse E/L early but ""BIBLE"" tests new letters efficiently.  
- ""BIBLE"" is a valid guess: if correct win, else feedback clarifies positions 2/3.

<guess>bible</guess>",bible,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - E is present and correctly placed at position 5. Absent: C, R, A, N.

2. Guess 2: ""stole"" → S(x), T(x), O(x), L(✓), E(✓)
   - L is present and correctly placed at position 4. E correct at position 5. Absent: S, T, O.

3. Guess 3: ""bugle"" → B(✓), U(x), G(x), L(✓), E(✓)
   - B is present and correctly placed at position 1. U absent. G absent. L and E correct.
   - So: B is at position 1, U and G are not in the word.

Current knowns:
- Position 1: B (since B(✓) in guess 3)
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, U, G

Pattern: B _ _ L E

We need to find the second and third letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Remaining letters (not absent and not used in known positions): 
- Alphabet without B,L,E (used) and absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G → excluded.
- Remaining: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The secret word is B _ _ L E.

We need a 5-letter English word with pattern B _ _ L E, using letters from D,F,H,I,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: we'll need two letters from that set.

Common words:
- ""BIBLE"": but I and B? Pattern: B I B L E → however, B at position 1 and 3? But we have B at position 1 (confirmed). If we use B again at position 3, it might be valid? But the feedback in guess 3 only showed B at position 1 as correct (and absent for U and G). 
  - However, ""BIBLE"" has B at position 1 and 3? Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E → letter B might appear twice? The word ""BIBLE"" is valid.

But letters: B (known), I, B (duplicate B), L, E. We already know B is present. Does the secret word have B twice? We don't know.

Similarly, ""BIDLE""? Not a word? Or ""BADDLE""? No.

Common words with B_L_E:
- ""BAYLE"": but A is absent → invalid.
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → E at position 2? But E is known only at position 5 so far. But feedback hasn't shown E elsewhere? Also, ""BELLE"" has two L's? Positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L (but L must be at position 4? No, because position 3 is L? But pattern requires L at position 4 → In ""BELLE"" it would be B E L L E → position 3:L? But we need position 4:L? → Position 4 is L? Actually: 
  - Pos1:B, pos2:E, pos3:L, pos4:L, pos5:E → so position 4 is L? Yes.

But we have E at position 2? And we know E is in the word, but at position 5? If there's E at position 2, it might be valid? But we haven't tested E at other positions.

However, ""BELLE"" uses E at position 2 → letter E which we know is in the word, but duplicated? And positions aren't tested.

But note: E is at position 5 and also at position 2? Possible.

But letters: E at pos2? E is already known at pos5, so we shouldn't exclude it? But we need to know if E is duplicated.

Similarly, in ""BIBLE"", we have I and duplicate B.

But let's consider the absent letters: ""BIBLE"" has B,I,B,L,E → absent letters: no C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G → so I is allowed.

What about ""BIKE""? Not 5 letters? 5-letter word: B I K L E? ""BIKLE"" not common. ""BIC L E"" not.

""BILE"" is 4 letters.

Standard words:
- ""BILGE"": but G was guessed in guess 3 and is absent → cannot use G.
- ""BIGLE"" not word.

Another: ""BIRLE""? Meaning? But R absent → R is absent.

""BIT L E"" not.

""BOWLE""? O and W? O absent → invalid.

""BOXLE"" not word.

Perhaps ""BUMPLE"" too long? No.

So let's list possibilities:
- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E → positions:1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E → but position 3 is L? And position 4 is L? This satisfies the pattern? 
  - The pattern requires position 4 to be L? In ""BELLE"" position 4 is L? Let's see: B-E-L-L-E → 
    Index1: B
    Index2: E
    Index3: L
    Index4: L
    Index5: E
  → Position 4 is L? Yes.

But we have L at position 4? And also at position 3? So L at pos3 and pos4? Possible? But we know L must be at pos4, but it might be duplicated? 

Similarly, E at position2 and position5? Yes.

But ""BELLE"" has:
- Letters: B (known), E (known to be in word at pos5, but not necessarily at pos2?), L (known at pos4, but duplicate at pos3?).

And E and L are known to be in the word? So duplicates might be possible? 

However, in ""BELLE"" we have E at position2 → not yet tested? And L at position3 → not known? 

But the problem: if E is at position2 and we know E is at position5, it could be the same E or duplicated? 

But we don't know if there are duplicates.

Options: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z → so let's try words that use two from these.

Common word: ""BIBLE"" → B,I,B,L,E → positions:1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E → letter I is allowed (not tested), and duplicate B? But that's okay.

Similarly, ""BIKAL"" not.

Or ""BIMBLE""? Not common.

Other words: ""BINDLE""? N absent? N is absent → cannot.

""BIPLE"" no.

""BITTLE"" ends with LE? B,I,T,T,L,E → T is absent? T absent → invalid.

""BIZZLE""? possible? But not common.

""BODLE"" O absent.

""BOOLE"" O absent.

""BRULE"" R absent → invalid.

So ""BIBLE"" seems a candidate? Even with duplicate B? But in guess 3, we guessed ""BUGLE"" and got B at position 1 correct. If the secret word had B at position 3 as well, it should have been indicated? But in guess 3 (""BUGLE"") we had B at pos1 and U at pos2? But we got U absent. So U not present. But for B: is only pos1 known? We didn't guess B at pos3? We don't know.

Therefore, ""BIBLE"" is possible.

Another word: ""BETLE"" not common? Or ""bettle"" → B,E,T,T,L,E? T absent → invalid.

""BEWLE"" no.

""BIDE L E"" not.

So few options: ""BIBLE"", ""BELLE"", or ""BYKLE"" not common.

""BEVLE"" no.

Perhaps ""DWEL"" but not.

Another possibility: ""BAZ L E"" no.

""BILE"" - 4 letters.

In English, ""BILE"" is 4, but what about 5-letter? Not easy.

What about ""BID E L"" not.

Perhaps ""BIB LE"" ""Bible"" is often capitalized? But in Wordle, common nouns.

But ""bible"" is accepted.

Similarly, ""belle"".

We also have ""BOL E"" no.

Or ""BYSSINE"" not 5.

So likely candidates: 
1. ""BIBLE"" → uses letters B (pos1), I (new), B (duplicate? at pos3), L (pos4), E (pos5).
2. ""BELLE"" → B (pos1), E (at pos2, whereas E is at pos5), L (at pos3 and pos4? L at pos3 new, at pos4 known), E (pos5).

But ""BELLE"": has E at position2? And L at position3? And E at position5? And L at position4? 

But in ""BELLE"": 
  Position 1: B ✓
  Position 2: E — not tested? But E is known to be in the word at pos5; if no duplicate, E at pos2 would be wrong? Or also correct? Depending on the word.

We need to guess.

We have limited options.

Let's see the feedback history: the secret word has B at position1, L at position4, E at position5.

The word has at least these three letters? And we know C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G are absent.

So for positions 2 and 3, it must be with the remaining letters: D,F,H,I,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now common words: 
- ""BIKE"" ... not 5-letter? ""Bikes"" 5? B,I,K,E,S → ends with S not LE? No.
- ""BIDET"" no.

But specifically pattern B _ _ L E:

- ""BIBLE"" → I and B? So for positions 2 and 3: I and B → B is at position1 already and also at position3? So B might be duplicated? Possible.
- ""BELLE"" → E and L? But L is at position4? And also at position3? L duplicated? Possible? And E also at position2? E duplicated?

But also, ""MAP? None.

Another word: ""BIBLE"" is one of the most common?

Or ""BEVEL"" → B,E,V,E,L → pattern: B at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5? But we need L at position4? Not pos5→ invalid pattern.

""BRINE"" no.

Perhaps ""BIRTH"" no.

I think ""BIBLE"" and ""BELLE"" are the primary candidates.

Additionally, ""BAYLE"" is invalid.

""BOW L E"" no.

""BUCKLE"" C absent and U absent? from guess3: U absent → invalid.

""BUFLE"" not word.

So between ""BIBLE"" and ""BELLE"", which to guess?

We have only 3 guesses so far, so we can afford one to test.

But let's think: in ""BIBLE"", if we guess it, and if it's the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

Similarly for ""BELLE"".

But maybe guess one that tests more new letters? But both will test the middle letters.

""BIBLE"" has I at position2? And B at position3? But B is already known? So we'd be reusing B? Which we know is present? But with ""BELLE"" reuses E and L in other positions.

In ""BIBLE"", we only test one new letter: I at position2? And position3 we use B (but B is known? We know B is at position1, so using it at position3 might be informative).

Similarly in ""BELLE"", we have E at2 and L at3 → both known letters but in different positions? So we'd get feedback on E and L at new positions? 

But we already know L is at position4? And E at position5? So using them at other positions might be redundant? 

For example, if we guess ""BELLE"":
- Position 1: B ✓
- Position 2: E? E might be elsewhere? If E is only at position5, then position2 E would be 'wrong position' or not? E exists, so it would be '-' meaning in word but wrong position? Or if there is only one E and it's at pos5, then E at pos2 would be marked as present but wrong position? Because E is at 5? But position5 is also E in the guess? So for pos5 E: it would be correct? So E at pos2: if secret has E only at pos5, then pos2 E should be marked as '-'? Because it's in the word but not at position2? 

But in secret, if it has only one E, at position5? Then:
- Guess ""BELLE"": position2: E -> marked as '-' (since E is at pos5, not2), position3: L -> L is at position4? But if no duplicate L, then L at position3 would be absent? But secret L is only at4? So position3: L -> 'x' absent? Or? If L is only at position4, then position3 L would be 'x' because it's not present? Not necessarily? L might be at position4, so if the secret has L only at position4, and we put L at position3, it would be 'x'? Because it's not in any other position? But L is present, so even if dup, but not in position3? 

Recap: Feedback rule:
- ✓: correct position
- -: in the word but wrong position
- x: not in the word

For a letter that is in the word only once:
- If you guess it in a position that isn't where it is: marked as '-'
- If you guess a duplicate? But if the secret has one, and you guess two, then if one is at correct position it gets ✓, the other gets 'x'?? No, because it's not in the word more than once? So extra gets 'x'.

Example: Secret has one E at position5.
If you guess a word with E at position2 and E at position5:
- Position2: E -> '-' because E is in the word but not here (since at position5)
- Position5: E -> ✓
But if secret has E also at position2? Then E at pos2 would be ✓.

But in secret for BELLE: if secret BIBLE, then in BELLE? But secret not BELLE.

In our case, for guess: 

Suppose secret is BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E

If we guess BELLE: B,E,L,L,E

Feedback for BELLE vs BIBLE:
- Position1: B vs B → ✓
- Position2: E vs I → E not in secret? Secret has I, no E? But E is in secret word? Secret BIBLE has no E except at pos5? Positions: pos1:B, pos2:I, pos3:B, pos4:L, pos5:E → so secret has E only at position5? And L only at position4.

Guess: BELLE: B,E,L,L,E

So:
- Position1: B compare to B → ✓
- Position2: E compare to I: E not in secret? Because secret has E only at position5, but not letter E? Letter E is in secret at position5. When comparing position2: the letter E is in the secret? Secret has E at position5. So E is in the word, but not at position2? Therefore, mark as '-'.

- Position3: L compare to:B → L here? Secret has L at position4? Not at pos3? And L is in the secret? So present but not at pos3? Mark as '-'

- Position4: L compare to:L → ✓
- Position5: E to:E → ✓

And secret BIBLE has B duplicated? But guess BELLE has L duplicated? Not matching.

But for now, we can't know.

But to progress, let's guess ""BIBLE"" since it has a new letter I.

Similarly, if we guess ""BIBLE"":
- If secret is BIBLE, all correct.
- If secret has different letters, we get feedback.

Now, are there other words? Let's try ""BIKE L"" not.

""BIPED"" ends with D.

""BIRKS"" not.

""BIMBO"" no O? Pattern? B, I, M, B, O → ends with O, not E.

But we need L E.

""BIKAL"" not.

Perhaps ""BID L E"" not.

Another word: ""BIDLE"" not common? Or ""bield"" not 5 letters.

But in English, what about ""BY? No.

Perhaps ""BILEM"" no.

I think ""BIBLE"" and ""BELLE"" are the best candidates.

But there's also ""BOWAL"" O absent.

Or ""BO X L E"" not.

Let's include a word: ""DEMI L"" no.

Perhaps ""BIN L E"" not.

Since G is absent, U absent, etc.

I just found: ""BIDET"" not.

So I'll go with ""BIBLE"" for now.

But we have other letters: like H? ""BI H L E"" not.

""BIGHT"" no LE.

""BIGOT"" no LE.

So likely, ""BIBLE"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""BOOK L E"" no.

Another: ""BRISE"" not.

But let's consider if the secret could be ""BIBLE"": pattern matches.

We can guess ""BIBLE"" now.

In the response, we must output.

Thought process summarize:

Based on feedback:
- Pattern is B _ _ L E
- Known absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,U,G
- Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 3: D,F,H,I,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
- After considering common English words, ""BIBLE"" fits the pattern and uses letter I (new, not tested) and B at position 3 (which might be duplicated; we know B is at position 1). If ""BIBLE"" is correct, we win. If not, we gain feedback on positions 2 and 3.
- Other options like ""BELLE"" exist but reuse known letters E and L in positions that may duplicate; starting with ""BIBLE"" is reasonable.

To be precise.Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5. Absent: C, R, A, N.
- **Guess 2: stole → Feedback: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - L is correctly placed at position 4. E remains correct at position 5. Absent: S, T, O. Secret pattern: _ _ _ L E.
- **Guess 3: bugle → Feedback: B(✓) U(x) G(x) L(✓) E(✓)**  
  - B is correctly placed at position 1. U and G are absent. Confirms L at position 4 and E at position 5. Secret pattern: B _ _ L E.

Deductions:
- Known letters:  
  - Position 1: B  
  - Position 4: L  
  - Position 5: E  
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, U, G  
- Secret word pattern: B _ _ L E  
- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the absent list: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Next steps: 
- Since the pattern is B _ _ L E, the word must be a valid English word with B at position 1, an unknown letter at positions 2 and 3, L at 4, and E at 5.  
- ""BIBLE"" (B-I-B-L-E) uses B (known) and tests I at position 2 and duplicated B at position 3. B duplication is possible and gives information if not correct.  
- Common alternatives like ""BELLE"" reuse E/L early but ""BIBLE"" tests new letters efficiently.  
- ""BIBLE"" is a valid guess: if correct win, else feedback clarifies positions 2/3.",Guess 4: bible -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) B(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
