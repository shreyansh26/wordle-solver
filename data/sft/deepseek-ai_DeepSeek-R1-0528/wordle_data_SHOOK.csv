We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(x) -> R is not in the word
 A(x) -> A is not in the word
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we need to choose a word that does not contain any of these letters.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can use letters from the English alphabet excluding C, R, A, N, E.

 The English alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 Excluding C, R, A, N, E -> we have: B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z

 Now, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Common vowels that are left: O, I, U (but I and U are less common). Also, we have Y which can be a vowel.

 Common consonants that are left: S, T, L, P, M, D, G, B, etc.

 We should try to use as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after removing C, R, A, N, E) might be:
 S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 A good second guess should avoid the letters we know are absent (C,R,A,N,E) and should introduce new common letters.

 Let's recall that the word has 5 letters and we have to form a valid English word.

 Possible words: How about ""SPLIT""? It uses S, P, L, I, T -> all new letters. Let me check: S, P, L, I, T are not in the excluded set.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters but they are less common. Since we don't have any information about the word, we should avoid assuming duplicates for now.

 Another option: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This is a common starting word in some contexts.

 Or ""BUILD""? But B is available, and U, I, L, D. But B is not excluded so we can use it? Actually, B is in the allowed set.

 However, let me choose a word that has more common letters. Another candidate: ""TOILS"" -> but that has O and I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but U and O are vowels we haven't tested.

 Since we don't know any letters, we must use entirely new letters. We should try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

 Consider the word ""OUIJA"" but that is not five-letter? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5? Wait, Ouija is a brand name and might not be in the word list. We should stick to common words.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: we are excluding E, A, so the vowels we have are O, I, U. And consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.

 Let me search for a word that uses S, T, L, O, M or similar.

 Common words: ""MOIST"", ""GHOST"", ""PILOT"", ""BUILT"", ""STOMP"", etc.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice? Let me check: M, O, I, S, T.

 But note: We haven't tested many consonants like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So we can pick any.

 Alternatively, to maximize coverage, we should pick a word with all new letters and with common letters.

 Another candidate: ""LUMPS"" -> but L, U, M, P, S. That covers L, U, M, P, S.

 But ""MOIST"" is more standard. However, I note that we haven't used L or M or P or S or T in the first guess? Actually, ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, so no overlap.

 Since no letters are in the word, we are free.

 I will go with ""MOIST"" because it has two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T) that are very common.

 So, guess: ""MOIST""

 But let me confirm: M, O, I, S, T are not in the excluded set? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.

 Therefore, I choose ""moist"".

<guess>moist</></think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>moist</guess>

After the feedback showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that uses entirely different letters. I selected **moist** because:
- It uses common untested letters: M, O, I, S, T
- Avoids all known absent letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Tests two new vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T)
- Is a valid English word with no repeating letters

This maximizes information gain by covering frequently used letters not yet evaluated.

We are given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters.

 We are now making a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We have a second guess: ""moist"" (which was provided by the user in the response format, but note that the user's response ended with ""moist</>"", so we take that as the guess).

 However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then provides the previous feedback including the first guess and its feedback.

 The user's response for the second guess was ""moist"", but we must now provide the feedback for that guess? Actually, the problem is asking for the next guess (which would be the third guess) because it says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then lists:

 Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Guess 2: moist

 But the feedback for ""moist"" is not provided. So we are to make the third guess.

 However, looking at the user's input: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", it seems that the user intended to guess ""moist"" but then the feedback is missing. The problem says: ""Here is some previous feedback"" and then lists two guesses, but only the first has feedback.

 This is confusing. Let me re-read the user input:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Guess 2: moist""

 It does not provide feedback for ""moist"". So we cannot proceed without that feedback.

 But note: the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then gives the previous feedback including the first guess and the second guess (without feedback). This seems like an error.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to provide the feedback for that? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are to make the next guess (the third one).

 However, without feedback for the second guess, we cannot make an informed third guess.

 Let me check the example in the initial instructions: the example had feedback for each guess.

 Therefore, I think there might be a misunderstanding. The user input says ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback. But in the context, the user might be providing the second guess and then we are to generate the feedback? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are the player and we are to guess.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the second guess was ""moist"" and now we are to make the third guess, but we don't have the feedback for ""moist"". That is a problem.

 Since the problem states: ""Here is some previous feedback"", and it only provided feedback for guess 1, then we must assume that the feedback for guess 2 is not available? But that doesn't make sense.

 Another possibility: the user input is truncated. The user input says: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", and then the assistant started to write a thought process. But the assistant's response was cut off.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to provide the feedback for the second guess but it was not included. Therefore, we cannot proceed without that feedback.

 However, looking at the history:

 First guess: crane -> all letters wrong (C, R, A, N, E are absent)
 Second guess: moist (we don't know the feedback)

 But the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then lists the two guesses without feedback for the second.

 This is inconsistent. I think we must ask for clarification, but since we are to return a guess, we have to make an assumption.

 Alternatively, note that the user input for the second guess was ""moist"" and then the assistant started to write a thought process that included:

 ""After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because: ...""

 and then the assistant returned <guess>moist</guess> in the first response? But that was for the first guess? No, the first guess was ""crane"".

 Actually, the first response was:

 <guess>crane</guess>

 Then the user provided feedback for crane (all x) and then said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then listed the first guess and its feedback and then said ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback.

 So I think the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"", but we are the one who is supposed to make the guesses? 

 Clarification: In the game, the assistant is the one making the guesses. The user is providing the feedback.

 In the first round, the assistant guessed ""crane"", and the user provided feedback: all x.

 Then the user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning we (the assistant) should make the second guess.

 But then the user also says: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 2: moist""

 This is confusing because we (the assistant) haven't made the second guess yet. The user is providing the second guess? That doesn't make sense.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the entire history, including the second guess that we made? But we didn't make a second guess in the first response? We only made the first guess.

 I think there is a misunderstanding in the flow.

 Let me re-express the intended flow:

 - We (the assistant) make a guess (first guess) and return it in <guess> tags.
 - The user then provides feedback for that guess and asks for the next guess, providing the history including the first guess and its feedback.
 - Then we make the second guess, and so on.

 In the first response, we made the first guess: ""crane"".

 Then the user responded with: 
   ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

    Here is some previous feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)""

 And then the user also included ""Guess 2: moist"" but without feedback? Why?

 It seems the user is trying to provide the second guess? But we are the ones who are supposed to provide the second guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing an example of what the second guess might be? But that doesn't make sense.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to say that we have already made two guesses: the first was ""crane"" (with feedback all x) and the second was ""moist"" (with feedback not provided). But that is not the case because we only made one guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess as a hint? But the problem says we are to make the guesses.

 I think the best course is to ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part because it doesn't have feedback and we didn't make that guess. We are to make the second guess now.

 Therefore, we are at the second guess. We know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be: ""sulky"" or ""pouty"", but let's choose one that has common letters.

 Another popular choice is ""pilot"", but note we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. ""pilot"" uses P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.

 But let me check: 
   P: allowed
   I: allowed
   L: allowed
   O: allowed
   T: allowed

 ""pilot"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""moist"" is also a good choice (as the user suggested) but we are making the second guess now.

 However, the user already wrote ""Guess 2: moist"", so perhaps they expect us to use that? But we are the ones guessing.

 Since the user mentioned ""moist"", maybe they are providing feedback for the second guess? But they didn't provide the feedback symbols.

 Given the ambiguity, I will make a second guess that is a valid word without the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"" because it uses common letters and is a good test.

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we guess something else, it might be inconsistent.

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say that they have already made the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to make the third? But without feedback for ""moist"", we cannot.

 I think the safest is to assume that the user is providing the history including the second guess and its feedback is missing, so we cannot proceed.

 However, since the problem requires us to make a new guess, I will assume that the second guess has not been made and we are to make the second guess.

 Therefore, I will ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part and make the second guess.

 Let's choose ""pilot"".

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we are to be consistent, perhaps we should use ""moist"" as the second guess? But then we don't have feedback for it.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess that we are to use? But then why ask us to make a new guess?

 I think there is a mistake in the user input. I will proceed to make the second guess with a word that avoids the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"".

<guess>pilot</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I know the secret word contains none of these letters. This eliminates many common letters, so I need a new guess that avoids them entirely.

For my second guess, I'll choose **""pilot""** because:
- It uses entirely new letters (P, I, L, O, T) not tested in the first guess.
- It includes common vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T).
- ""Pilot"" is a valid English word with no repeating letters.

This guess maximizes new information by testing five untested letters at once.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

    Here is some previous feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)""

 And then the user also included ""Guess 2: moist"" but without feedback? Why?

 It seems the user is trying to provide the second guess? But we are the ones who are supposed to provide the second guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing an example of what the second guess might be? But that doesn't make sense.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to say that we have already made two guesses: the first was ""crane"" (with feedback all x) and the second was ""moist"" (with feedback not provided). But that is not the case because we only made one guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess as a hint? But the problem says we are to make the guesses.

 I think the best course is to ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part because it doesn't have feedback and we didn't make that guess. We are to make the second guess now.

 Therefore, we are at the second guess. We know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be: ""sulky"" or ""pouty"", but let's choose one that has common letters.

 Another popular choice is ""pilot"", but note we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. ""pilot"" uses P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.

 But let me check: 
   P: allowed
   I: allowed
   L: allowed
   O: allowed
   T: allowed

 ""pilot"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""moist"" is also a good choice (as the user suggested) but we are making the second guess now.

 However, the user already wrote ""Guess 2: moist"", so perhaps they expect us to use that? But we are the ones guessing.

 Since the user mentioned ""moist"", maybe they are providing feedback for the second guess? But they didn't provide the feedback symbols.

 Given the ambiguity, I will make a second guess that is a valid word without the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"" because it uses common letters and is a good test.

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we guess something else, it might be inconsistent.

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say that they have already made the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to make the third? But without feedback for ""moist"", we cannot.

 I think the safest is to assume that the user is providing the history including the second guess and its feedback is missing, so we cannot proceed.

 However, since the problem requires us to make a new guess, I will assume that the second guess has not been made and we are to make the second guess.

 Therefore, I will ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part and make the second guess.

 Let's choose ""pilot"".

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we are to be consistent, perhaps we should use ""moist"" as the second guess? But then we don't have feedback for it.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess that we are to use? But then why ask us to make a new guess?

 I think there is a mistake in the user input. I will proceed to make the second guess with a word that avoids the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"".

<guess>pilot</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I know the secret word contains none of these letters. This eliminates many common letters, so I need a new guess that avoids them entirely.

For my second guess, I'll choose **""pilot""** because:
- It uses entirely new letters (P, I, L, O, T) not tested in the first guess.
- It includes common vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T).
- ""Pilot"" is a valid English word with no repeating letters.

This guess maximizes new information by testing five untested letters at once.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist</></think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. Second guess: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

So, from the feedback of the second guess:
- M: absent (x) -> not in the word
- O: present but wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x) -> not in the word
- S: present but wrong position (-)
- T: absent (x) -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they appeared in ""moist"" (which was position 2 for O and position 4 for S? Let's note: ""moist"" is M O I S T, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
  So O is in the word but not at position 2, and S is in the word but not at position 4.

Additionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are present: O and S.

We also know that the word does not contain the letters from the absent list: so we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

The word must contain O and S, and the other three letters are from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are left with three positions to fill (since O and S are in the word but we don't know the positions).

We are to make the third guess.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains O and S (to confirm their positions)
- Includes three new letters from the remaining set to test more letters.
- The positions of O and S should not be position 2 and 4 (because they were wrongly positioned there in ""moist""). However, note: O was in position 2 and was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, S is not in position 4.

So we must place O and S in positions that are not 2 and not 4 respectively? Actually, O can be in any position except 2? And S can be in any position except 4? But note: the word might have multiple of the same letter? But in this case, only one O and one S are present because in ""moist"" there was one of each and they were marked as present. However, we don't know if there are duplicates, but since we have no information on duplicates, we assume one occurrence.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

So the letter bank is: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Options: 
We can form a word with O and S and three new letters.

Let me consider common words that contain O and S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""socks"" -> but has S twice and O? Also, S is repeated? We don't know if the word allows duplicates. Also, K is allowed, but let's see: S O C K S -> but C is forbidden? Wait C is in the forbidden list? Yes, from first guess.

So ""socks"" is invalid because C is forbidden and also it has two S and we don't know if we need two S.

Alternatively, ""shows"": S, H, O, W, S? But again two S. And H, O, W are allowed? But two S might be problematic? Also, the word has 5 letters? ""shows"" has two S's? Yes, S twice. It might be acceptable if the word has two S, but we don't know.

We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So let's look for words that have O and S exactly once and three other distinct letters.

Possible: ""songs"" -> repeated S? ""songs"" has two S? Actually, ""songs"" is S-O-N-G-S -> two S? Wait: it has two S? Yes, but also N and G: N is not allowed (from first guess? yes, absent) so forbidden.

Another idea: ""focus"" -> but F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

""post"" -> but 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

""pools"" -> repeated O? And L, S -> L is allowed? But O is repeated? We already know O is present, but we don't know if there are two O.

To avoid complications, aim for no repeated letters.

Possible words: 
""shock"" -> S, H, O, C, K -> C is forbidden? Yes.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> L, U, Y are new? But note: L is allowed? And U and Y? So ""lousy"": L O U S Y

Check for forbidden letters: L, O, U, S, Y -> none forbidden? O and S are present, L, U, Y are new? Also, O and S are not in their previous positions? O is at position 2? But in ""lousy"" O is at position 2? That would be the same position as in ""moist"" which was position 2? But feedback said O was present but not in position 2. So we cannot put O at position 2 again? So ""lousy"" positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:Y -> O at position 2 and S at position 4? Exactly the positions that were wrong in the previous guess? So these positions are invalid? We know O cannot be at position 2? And S cannot be at position 4? So this word would have O and S in the same positions? Avoid that.

How about ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> N is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

""softs"": repeated S? And F, O, T? -> T is forbidden? Yes from second guess.

""soggy"": repeated G? Also G and Y -> G is allowed? But repeated G? Avoid.

""goods"": repeated O? and D, S? -> O repeated? Not good.

Let me think of words with O and S and avoiding the forbidden positions.

How about putting S at the beginning? Then O not at position 2.

Word: ""skimp"" -> but K, I, M, P? I and M are forbidden? (from second guess)

No.

Another: ""sling"" -> S, L, I, N, G -> I and N forbidden? Yes.

No.

""slope"": S, L, O, P, E -> E is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

No.

""spoke"": S, P, O, K, E -> E forbidden? Yes.

No.

""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> I forbidden? Yes.

No.

""could"" -> C forbidden? and O, U, L, D? C forbidden? Yes.

We are having trouble.

Consider placing O and S in new positions.

Possible positions for O: not 2 (since in second guess it was at position 2 and was wrong). So O can be at 1,3,4,5? But 1: M was forbidden? So O might be at 1? 3? 4? 5?

Similarly, S cannot be at position 4 (from second guess). So S can be at positions: 1,2,3,5.

We need a word that has O and S, both not at the positions: O not at 2, S not at 4.

And letters from the allowed set (without the forbidden ones).

Let me systematically look for words that contain S and O and three other distinct letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common possibilities:
- S at 1 and O at 3: e.g., S_O_E? But E forbidden? No words with E.

S_O: _ _ _ pattern? How about ""swoop"" -> repeated O and then P? But also W and P? But repeated O: so only one O? We don't know.

Better avoid repeated letters.

Word: ""showy"": S, H, O, W, Y -> positions: S at 1, O at 3? Then H, W, Y.

We can try: ""SHOWY"": 
- S at 1, O at 3 -> S position is 1? Previously we haven't tested S at 1. O at 3 (not tested at 3 before? Only at 2). So valid? And the word has no forbidden letters? S, H, O, W, Y -> H, W, Y are new. No forbidden letters? Yes.

And O is not at 2? O is at 3? Okay.
S not at 4? Actually, position 4 is W? S is at 1? So S is not at 4? Correct.

So ""showy"" is S H O W Y -> valid word? I think ""showy"" is an adjective meaning ostentatious? But let me confirm validity.

Alternatively, safer words: 
""howfs"" -> not common? Also repeated F? Unlikely.

""lousy"" we thought but O at 2 and S at 4: not allowed.

Another: ""bousy"" -> I don't know if valid.

Let me think of standard words: 
""hongs"" -> H, O, N, G, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.

""donsy"" -> D, O, N, S, Y -> N forbidden? No.

""pouls"" -> not common? Also P, O, U, L, S? But S at the end? Positions: P(O)U(L)S? S at 5.

If we have S at 5 and O at 2? But O cannot be at 2? So O must be moved.

Word: ""pouls"" might be invalid.

""youse"" -> E forbidden? and Y, O, U, S -> E? No.

""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> positions: B (1), O (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). But O is at position 2? Which is not allowed? Because the O was at position 2 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""bosky"" has O at 2? Not allowed? Therefore, avoid.

Alternatively, ""jocks"" -> J, O, C, K, S -> C forbidden? No.

""foxes"": F, O, X, E, S -> E forbidden? No.

So after some struggle, I found ""showy""?

But also, ""dowly"" -> not common? Another: ""gowds"" -> not common? So ""showy"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""solus"" -> repeated S? and L, U? Positions: S O L U S -> repeated S? Avoid.

""sojus"" -> same.

""vocus"" -> C forbidden? No.

Therefore, I will choose ""showy"".

But let me double-check the letters: S, H, O, W, Y. 
- None are forbidden? Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. So H, W, Y are new? Yes.

The word ""showy"" is valid? Yes, meaning ostentatious.

Now, positions: 
Position 1: S -> we are testing S at position 1.
Position 2: H -> new letter
Position 3: O -> O is tested at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong. So this is a new position.
Position 4: W -> new letter
Position 5: Y -> new letter

So that's good.

If we cannot find ""showy"", another option is ""blows"": but L, O, W, S? And B? Positions: B L O W S -> O at position 3? S at position 5? Then O: not at 2? S: not at 4? But ""blows"" has B, L, O, W, S.

But note: we don't have forbidden letters? B, L, O, W, S -> O and S are present? Yes, and B, L, W are new? Valid word? Yes.

Check positions: O at 3 (not 2) and S at 5 (not 4) -> acceptable.

""blows"" is a valid word? Meaning it is the plural of blow? Or verb third person singular? But as a noun? It can be used? Should be valid.

Or ""gowns"": G, O, W, N, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.

So between ""showy"" and ""blows"", both are acceptable.

I'll choose ""blows"" because it has more common letters? I like ""blows"".

But let me make sure: we are testing B, L, W with this? Also, if O is at 3 and S at 5, we get information on those positions.

We might also consider ""fowls"": F, O, W, L, S -> same as ""blows"" but with F? Also acceptable? But to choose one.

Another: ""yowls"": similarly.

But I'll go with ""blows"".

Alternative: ""prows"": P, R, O, W, S -> R forbidden? Not allowed.

So ""blows"" is good.

Wait, note: in the first guess, we have R forbidden? But ""blows"" has R? No: B L O W S -> R is not in the word? So it's okay.

Therefore, third guess: ""blows"".

But note: we have tested O at position 1 and 2? Not? Only at 2. Now at 3? And S: we tested at position 4? Now at 5? So new positions.

So we guess ""blows"".

Alternatively, if the word has O somewhere else? This might help.

I think ""blows"" is a good choice.

<guess>blows</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
  - O is present but not in position 2.
  - S is present but not in position 4.
  - M, I, T are absent.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: O, S (must be included, but not at previous positions).
- **Remaining letter pool**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - O cannot be at position 2.
  - S cannot be at position 4.

For Guess 3, I need a word that:
1. Includes O and S exactly once (since duplicates are unconfirmed).
2. Avoids repeated letters and all absent letters.
3. Places O not at position 2 and S not at position 4.
4. Tests new high-frequency letters from the pool.

### Word Selection:
After evaluating options, **""blows""** is chosen:
- **Letters**: B, L, O, W, S.
  - O is at position 3 (not 2).
  - S is at position 5 (not 4).
  - New letters tested: B, L, W (all distinct and unexplored).
- **Validity**: ""Blows"" is a valid English word (e.g., plural of ""blow"" meaning ""sudden hits"" or ""blossoms"" in botany).
- **Information gain**: This guess tests 3 new letters and confirms positions for O and S efficiently.

<guess>blows</guess>",blows,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. Second guess: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

So, from the feedback of the second guess:
- M: absent (x) -> not in the word
- O: present but wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x) -> not in the word
- S: present but wrong position (-)
- T: absent (x) -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they appeared in ""moist"" (which was position 2 for O and position 4 for S? Let's note: ""moist"" is M O I S T, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
  So O is in the word but not at position 2, and S is in the word but not at position 4.

Additionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are present: O and S.

We also know that the word does not contain the letters from the absent list: so we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

The word must contain O and S, and the other three letters are from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are left with three positions to fill (since O and S are in the word but we don't know the positions).

We are to make the third guess.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains O and S (to confirm their positions)
- Includes three new letters from the remaining set to test more letters.
- The positions of O and S should not be position 2 and 4 (because they were wrongly positioned there in ""moist""). However, note: O was in position 2 and was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, S is not in position 4.

So we must place O and S in positions that are not 2 and not 4 respectively? Actually, O can be in any position except 2? And S can be in any position except 4? But note: the word might have multiple of the same letter? But in this case, only one O and one S are present because in ""moist"" there was one of each and they were marked as present. However, we don't know if there are duplicates, but since we have no information on duplicates, we assume one occurrence.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

So the letter bank is: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Options: 
We can form a word with O and S and three new letters.

Let me consider common words that contain O and S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""socks"" -> but has S twice and O? Also, S is repeated? We don't know if the word allows duplicates. Also, K is allowed, but let's see: S O C K S -> but C is forbidden? Wait C is in the forbidden list? Yes, from first guess.

So ""socks"" is invalid because C is forbidden and also it has two S and we don't know if we need two S.

Alternatively, ""shows"": S, H, O, W, S? But again two S. And H, O, W are allowed? But two S might be problematic? Also, the word has 5 letters? ""shows"" has two S's? Yes, S twice. It might be acceptable if the word has two S, but we don't know.

We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So let's look for words that have O and S exactly once and three other distinct letters.

Possible: ""songs"" -> repeated S? ""songs"" has two S? Actually, ""songs"" is S-O-N-G-S -> two S? Wait: it has two S? Yes, but also N and G: N is not allowed (from first guess? yes, absent) so forbidden.

Another idea: ""focus"" -> but F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

""post"" -> but 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

""pools"" -> repeated O? And L, S -> L is allowed? But O is repeated? We already know O is present, but we don't know if there are two O.

To avoid complications, aim for no repeated letters.

Possible words: 
""shock"" -> S, H, O, C, K -> C is forbidden? Yes.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> L, U, Y are new? But note: L is allowed? And U and Y? So ""lousy"": L O U S Y

Check for forbidden letters: L, O, U, S, Y -> none forbidden? O and S are present, L, U, Y are new? Also, O and S are not in their previous positions? O is at position 2? But in ""lousy"" O is at position 2? That would be the same position as in ""moist"" which was position 2? But feedback said O was present but not in position 2. So we cannot put O at position 2 again? So ""lousy"" positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:Y -> O at position 2 and S at position 4? Exactly the positions that were wrong in the previous guess? So these positions are invalid? We know O cannot be at position 2? And S cannot be at position 4? So this word would have O and S in the same positions? Avoid that.

How about ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> N is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

""softs"": repeated S? And F, O, T? -> T is forbidden? Yes from second guess.

""soggy"": repeated G? Also G and Y -> G is allowed? But repeated G? Avoid.

""goods"": repeated O? and D, S? -> O repeated? Not good.

Let me think of words with O and S and avoiding the forbidden positions.

How about putting S at the beginning? Then O not at position 2.

Word: ""skimp"" -> but K, I, M, P? I and M are forbidden? (from second guess)

No.

Another: ""sling"" -> S, L, I, N, G -> I and N forbidden? Yes.

No.

""slope"": S, L, O, P, E -> E is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

No.

""spoke"": S, P, O, K, E -> E forbidden? Yes.

No.

""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> I forbidden? Yes.

No.

""could"" -> C forbidden? and O, U, L, D? C forbidden? Yes.

We are having trouble.

Consider placing O and S in new positions.

Possible positions for O: not 2 (since in second guess it was at position 2 and was wrong). So O can be at 1,3,4,5? But 1: M was forbidden? So O might be at 1? 3? 4? 5?

So that's good.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>moist -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters.

 We are now making a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We have a second guess: ""moist"" (which was provided by the user in the response format, but note that the user's response ended with ""moist</>"", so we take that as the guess).

 However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then provides the previous feedback including the first guess and its feedback.

 The user's response for the second guess was ""moist"", but we must now provide the feedback for that guess? Actually, the problem is asking for the next guess (which would be the third guess) because it says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then lists:

 Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Guess 2: moist

 But the feedback for ""moist"" is not provided. So we are to make the third guess.

 However, looking at the user's input: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", it seems that the user intended to guess ""moist"" but then the feedback is missing. The problem says: ""Here is some previous feedback"" and then lists two guesses, but only the first has feedback.

 This is confusing. Let me re-read the user input:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Guess 2: moist""

 It does not provide feedback for ""moist"". So we cannot proceed without that feedback.

 But note: the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then gives the previous feedback including the first guess and the second guess (without feedback). This seems like an error.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to provide the feedback for that? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are to make the next guess (the third one).

 However, without feedback for the second guess, we cannot make an informed third guess.

 Let me check the example in the initial instructions: the example had feedback for each guess.

 Therefore, I think there might be a misunderstanding. The user input says ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback. But in the context, the user might be providing the second guess and then we are to generate the feedback? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are the player and we are to guess.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the second guess was ""moist"" and now we are to make the third guess, but we don't have the feedback for ""moist"". That is a problem.

 Since the problem states: ""Here is some previous feedback"", and it only provided feedback for guess 1, then we must assume that the feedback for guess 2 is not available? But that doesn't make sense.

 Another possibility: the user input is truncated. The user input says: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", and then the assistant started to write a thought process. But the assistant's response was cut off.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to provide the feedback for the second guess but it was not included. Therefore, we cannot proceed without that feedback.

 However, looking at the history:

 First guess: crane -> all letters wrong (C, R, A, N, E are absent)
 Second guess: moist (we don't know the feedback)

 But the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then lists the two guesses without feedback for the second.

 This is inconsistent. I think we must ask for clarification, but since we are to return a guess, we have to make an assumption.

 Alternatively, note that the user input for the second guess was ""moist"" and then the assistant started to write a thought process that included:

 ""After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because: ...""

 and then the assistant returned <guess>moist</guess> in the first response? But that was for the first guess? No, the first guess was ""crane"".

 Actually, the first response was:

 <guess>crane</guess>

 Then the user provided feedback for crane (all x) and then said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then listed the first guess and its feedback and then said ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback.

 So I think the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"", but we are the one who is supposed to make the guesses? 

 Clarification: In the game, the assistant is the one making the guesses. The user is providing the feedback.

 In the first round, the assistant guessed ""crane"", and the user provided feedback: all x.

 Then the user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning we (the assistant) should make the second guess.

 But then the user also says: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 2: moist""

 This is confusing because we (the assistant) haven't made the second guess yet. The user is providing the second guess? That doesn't make sense.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the entire history, including the second guess that we made? But we didn't make a second guess in the first response? We only made the first guess.

 I think there is a misunderstanding in the flow.

 Let me re-express the intended flow:

 - We (the assistant) make a guess (first guess) and return it in <guess> tags.
 - The user then provides feedback for that guess and asks for the next guess, providing the history including the first guess and its feedback.
 - Then we make the second guess, and so on.

 In the first response, we made the first guess: ""crane"".

 Then the user responded with: 
   ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

    Here is some previous feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)""

 And then the user also included ""Guess 2: moist"" but without feedback? Why?

 It seems the user is trying to provide the second guess? But we are the ones who are supposed to provide the second guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing an example of what the second guess might be? But that doesn't make sense.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to say that we have already made two guesses: the first was ""crane"" (with feedback all x) and the second was ""moist"" (with feedback not provided). But that is not the case because we only made one guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess as a hint? But the problem says we are to make the guesses.

 I think the best course is to ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part because it doesn't have feedback and we didn't make that guess. We are to make the second guess now.

 Therefore, we are at the second guess. We know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be: ""sulky"" or ""pouty"", but let's choose one that has common letters.

 Another popular choice is ""pilot"", but note we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. ""pilot"" uses P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.

 But let me check: 
   P: allowed
   I: allowed
   L: allowed
   O: allowed
   T: allowed

 ""pilot"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""moist"" is also a good choice (as the user suggested) but we are making the second guess now.

 However, the user already wrote ""Guess 2: moist"", so perhaps they expect us to use that? But we are the ones guessing.

 Since the user mentioned ""moist"", maybe they are providing feedback for the second guess? But they didn't provide the feedback symbols.

 Given the ambiguity, I will make a second guess that is a valid word without the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"" because it uses common letters and is a good test.

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we guess something else, it might be inconsistent.

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say that they have already made the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to make the third? But without feedback for ""moist"", we cannot.

 I think the safest is to assume that the user is providing the history including the second guess and its feedback is missing, so we cannot proceed.

 However, since the problem requires us to make a new guess, I will assume that the second guess has not been made and we are to make the second guess.

 Therefore, I will ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part and make the second guess.

 Let's choose ""pilot"".

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we are to be consistent, perhaps we should use ""moist"" as the second guess? But then we don't have feedback for it.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess that we are to use? But then why ask us to make a new guess?

 I think there is a mistake in the user input. I will proceed to make the second guess with a word that avoids the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"".

<guess>pilot</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I know the secret word contains none of these letters. This eliminates many common letters, so I need a new guess that avoids them entirely.

For my second guess, I'll choose **""pilot""** because:
- It uses entirely new letters (P, I, L, O, T) not tested in the first guess.
- It includes common vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T).
- ""Pilot"" is a valid English word with no repeating letters.

This guess maximizes new information by testing five untested letters at once.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist</></think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>moist -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. Second guess: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

So, from the feedback of the second guess:
- M: absent (x) -> not in the word
- O: present but wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x) -> not in the word
- S: present but wrong position (-)
- T: absent (x) -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they appeared in ""moist"" (which was position 2 for O and position 4 for S? Let's note: ""moist"" is M O I S T, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
  So O is in the word but not at position 2, and S is in the word but not at position 4.

Additionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are present: O and S.

We also know that the word does not contain the letters from the absent list: so we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

The word must contain O and S, and the other three letters are from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are left with three positions to fill (since O and S are in the word but we don't know the positions).

We are to make the third guess.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains O and S (to confirm their positions)
- Includes three new letters from the remaining set to test more letters.
- The positions of O and S should not be position 2 and 4 (because they were wrongly positioned there in ""moist""). However, note: O was in position 2 and was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, S is not in position 4.

So we must place O and S in positions that are not 2 and not 4 respectively? Actually, O can be in any position except 2? And S can be in any position except 4? But note: the word might have multiple of the same letter? But in this case, only one O and one S are present because in ""moist"" there was one of each and they were marked as present. However, we don't know if there are duplicates, but since we have no information on duplicates, we assume one occurrence.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

So the letter bank is: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Options: 
We can form a word with O and S and three new letters.

Let me consider common words that contain O and S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""socks"" -> but has S twice and O? Also, S is repeated? We don't know if the word allows duplicates. Also, K is allowed, but let's see: S O C K S -> but C is forbidden? Wait C is in the forbidden list? Yes, from first guess.

So ""socks"" is invalid because C is forbidden and also it has two S and we don't know if we need two S.

Alternatively, ""shows"": S, H, O, W, S? But again two S. And H, O, W are allowed? But two S might be problematic? Also, the word has 5 letters? ""shows"" has two S's? Yes, S twice. It might be acceptable if the word has two S, but we don't know.

We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So let's look for words that have O and S exactly once and three other distinct letters.

Possible: ""songs"" -> repeated S? ""songs"" has two S? Actually, ""songs"" is S-O-N-G-S -> two S? Wait: it has two S? Yes, but also N and G: N is not allowed (from first guess? yes, absent) so forbidden.

Another idea: ""focus"" -> but F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

""post"" -> but 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

""pools"" -> repeated O? And L, S -> L is allowed? But O is repeated? We already know O is present, but we don't know if there are two O.

To avoid complications, aim for no repeated letters.

Possible words: 
""shock"" -> S, H, O, C, K -> C is forbidden? Yes.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> L, U, Y are new? But note: L is allowed? And U and Y? So ""lousy"": L O U S Y

Check for forbidden letters: L, O, U, S, Y -> none forbidden? O and S are present, L, U, Y are new? Also, O and S are not in their previous positions? O is at position 2? But in ""lousy"" O is at position 2? That would be the same position as in ""moist"" which was position 2? But feedback said O was present but not in position 2. So we cannot put O at position 2 again? So ""lousy"" positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:Y -> O at position 2 and S at position 4? Exactly the positions that were wrong in the previous guess? So these positions are invalid? We know O cannot be at position 2? And S cannot be at position 4? So this word would have O and S in the same positions? Avoid that.

How about ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> N is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

""softs"": repeated S? And F, O, T? -> T is forbidden? Yes from second guess.

""soggy"": repeated G? Also G and Y -> G is allowed? But repeated G? Avoid.

""goods"": repeated O? and D, S? -> O repeated? Not good.

Let me think of words with O and S and avoiding the forbidden positions.

How about putting S at the beginning? Then O not at position 2.

Word: ""skimp"" -> but K, I, M, P? I and M are forbidden? (from second guess)

No.

Another: ""sling"" -> S, L, I, N, G -> I and N forbidden? Yes.

No.

""slope"": S, L, O, P, E -> E is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

No.

""spoke"": S, P, O, K, E -> E forbidden? Yes.

No.

""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> I forbidden? Yes.

No.

""could"" -> C forbidden? and O, U, L, D? C forbidden? Yes.

We are having trouble.

Consider placing O and S in new positions.

Possible positions for O: not 2 (since in second guess it was at position 2 and was wrong). So O can be at 1,3,4,5? But 1: M was forbidden? So O might be at 1? 3? 4? 5?

Similarly, S cannot be at position 4 (from second guess). So S can be at positions: 1,2,3,5.

We need a word that has O and S, both not at the positions: O not at 2, S not at 4.

And letters from the allowed set (without the forbidden ones).

Let me systematically look for words that contain S and O and three other distinct letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common possibilities:
- S at 1 and O at 3: e.g., S_O_E? But E forbidden? No words with E.

S_O: _ _ _ pattern? How about ""swoop"" -> repeated O and then P? But also W and P? But repeated O: so only one O? We don't know.

Better avoid repeated letters.

Word: ""showy"": S, H, O, W, Y -> positions: S at 1, O at 3? Then H, W, Y.

We can try: ""SHOWY"": 
- S at 1, O at 3 -> S position is 1? Previously we haven't tested S at 1. O at 3 (not tested at 3 before? Only at 2). So valid? And the word has no forbidden letters? S, H, O, W, Y -> H, W, Y are new. No forbidden letters? Yes.

And O is not at 2? O is at 3? Okay.
S not at 4? Actually, position 4 is W? S is at 1? So S is not at 4? Correct.

So ""showy"" is S H O W Y -> valid word? I think ""showy"" is an adjective meaning ostentatious? But let me confirm validity.

Alternatively, safer words: 
""howfs"" -> not common? Also repeated F? Unlikely.

""lousy"" we thought but O at 2 and S at 4: not allowed.

Another: ""bousy"" -> I don't know if valid.

Let me think of standard words: 
""hongs"" -> H, O, N, G, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.

""donsy"" -> D, O, N, S, Y -> N forbidden? No.

""pouls"" -> not common? Also P, O, U, L, S? But S at the end? Positions: P(O)U(L)S? S at 5.

If we have S at 5 and O at 2? But O cannot be at 2? So O must be moved.

Word: ""pouls"" might be invalid.

""youse"" -> E forbidden? and Y, O, U, S -> E? No.

""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> positions: B (1), O (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). But O is at position 2? Which is not allowed? Because the O was at position 2 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""bosky"" has O at 2? Not allowed? Therefore, avoid.

Alternatively, ""jocks"" -> J, O, C, K, S -> C forbidden? No.

""foxes"": F, O, X, E, S -> E forbidden? No.

So after some struggle, I found ""showy""?

But also, ""dowly"" -> not common? Another: ""gowds"" -> not common? So ""showy"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""solus"" -> repeated S? and L, U? Positions: S O L U S -> repeated S? Avoid.

""sojus"" -> same.

""vocus"" -> C forbidden? No.

Therefore, I will choose ""showy"".

But let me double-check the letters: S, H, O, W, Y. 
- None are forbidden? Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. So H, W, Y are new? Yes.

The word ""showy"" is valid? Yes, meaning ostentatious.

Now, positions: 
Position 1: S -> we are testing S at position 1.
Position 2: H -> new letter
Position 3: O -> O is tested at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong. So this is a new position.
Position 4: W -> new letter
Position 5: Y -> new letter

So that's good.

If we cannot find ""showy"", another option is ""blows"": but L, O, W, S? And B? Positions: B L O W S -> O at position 3? S at position 5? Then O: not at 2? S: not at 4? But ""blows"" has B, L, O, W, S.

But note: we don't have forbidden letters? B, L, O, W, S -> O and S are present? Yes, and B, L, W are new? Valid word? Yes.

Check positions: O at 3 (not 2) and S at 5 (not 4) -> acceptable.

""blows"" is a valid word? Meaning it is the plural of blow? Or verb third person singular? But as a noun? It can be used? Should be valid.

Or ""gowns"": G, O, W, N, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.

So between ""showy"" and ""blows"", both are acceptable.

I'll choose ""blows"" because it has more common letters? I like ""blows"".

But let me make sure: we are testing B, L, W with this? Also, if O is at 3 and S at 5, we get information on those positions.

We might also consider ""fowls"": F, O, W, L, S -> same as ""blows"" but with F? Also acceptable? But to choose one.

Another: ""yowls"": similarly.

But I'll go with ""blows"".

Alternative: ""prows"": P, R, O, W, S -> R forbidden? Not allowed.

So ""blows"" is good.

Wait, note: in the first guess, we have R forbidden? But ""blows"" has R? No: B L O W S -> R is not in the word? So it's okay.

Therefore, third guess: ""blows"".

But note: we have tested O at position 1 and 2? Not? Only at 2. Now at 3? And S: we tested at position 4? Now at 5? So new positions.

So we guess ""blows"".

Alternatively, if the word has O somewhere else? This might help.

I think ""blows"" is a good choice.

<guess>blows</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
  - O is present but not in position 2.
  - S is present but not in position 4.
  - M, I, T are absent.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: O, S (must be included, but not at previous positions).
- **Remaining letter pool**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - O cannot be at position 2.
  - S cannot be at position 4.

For Guess 3, I need a word that:
1. Includes O and S exactly once (since duplicates are unconfirmed).
2. Avoids repeated letters and all absent letters.
3. Places O not at position 2 and S not at position 4.
4. Tests new high-frequency letters from the pool.

### Word Selection:
After evaluating options, **""blows""** is chosen:
- **Letters**: B, L, O, W, S.
  - O is at position 3 (not 2).
  - S is at position 5 (not 4).
  - New letters tested: B, L, W (all distinct and unexplored).
- **Validity**: ""Blows"" is a valid English word (e.g., plural of ""blow"" meaning ""sudden hits"" or ""blossoms"" in botany).
- **Information gain**: This guess tests 3 new letters and confirms positions for O and S efficiently.

So we can pick any.\n\n Alternatively, to maximize coverage, we should pick a word with all new letters and with common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""LUMPS"" -> but L, U, M, P, S. That covers L, U, M, P, S.\n\n But ""MOIST"" is more standard. However, I note that we haven\'t used L or M or P or S or T in the first guess? Actually, ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, so no overlap.\n\n Since no letters are in the word, we are free.\n\n I will go with ""MOIST"" because it has two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T) that are very common.\n\n So, guess: ""MOIST""\n\n But let me confirm: M, O, I, S, T are not in the excluded set? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""moist"".\n\n<guess>moist</>Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely.

We must choose a 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n We have a second guess: ""moist"" (which was provided by the user in the response format, but note that the user\'s response ended with ""moist</>"", so we take that as the guess).\n\n However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then provides the previous feedback including the first guess and its feedback.\n\n The user\'s response for the second guess was ""moist"", but we must now provide the feedback for that guess? Actually, the problem is asking for the next guess (which would be the third guess) because it says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then lists:\n\n Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n Guess 2: moist\n\n But the feedback for ""moist"" is not provided. So we are to make the third guess.\n\n However, looking at the user\'s input: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", it seems that the user intended to guess ""moist"" but then the feedback is missing. The problem says: ""Here is some previous feedback"" and then lists two guesses, but only the first has feedback.\n\n This is confusing. Let me re-read the user input:\n\n ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous feedback: \n Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n Guess 2: moist""\n\n It does not provide feedback for ""moist"". So we cannot proceed without that feedback.\n\n But note: the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then gives the previous feedback including the first guess and the second guess (without feedback). This seems like an error.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to provide the feedback for that? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are to make the next guess (the third one).\n\n However, without feedback for the second guess, we cannot make an informed third guess.\n\n Let me check the example in the initial instructions: the example had feedback for each guess.\n\n Therefore, I think there might be a misunderstanding. The user input says ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback. But in the context, the user might be providing the second guess and then we are to generate the feedback? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are the player and we are to guess.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the second guess was ""moist"" and now we are to make the third guess, but we don\'t have the feedback for ""moist"". That is a problem.\n\n Since the problem states: ""Here is some previous feedback"", and it only provided feedback for guess 1, then we must assume that the feedback for guess 2 is not available? But that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another possibility: the user input is truncated. The user input says: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", and then the assistant started to write a thought process. But the assistant\'s response was cut off.\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to provide the feedback for the second guess but it was not included. Therefore, we cannot proceed without that feedback.\n\n However, looking at the history:\n\n First guess: crane -> all letters wrong (C, R, A, N, E are absent)\n Second guess: moist (we don\'t know the feedback)\n\n But the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then lists the two guesses without feedback for the second.\n\n This is inconsistent. I think we must ask for clarification, but since we are to return a guess, we have to make an assumption.\n\n Alternatively, note that the user input for the second guess was ""moist"" and then the assistant started to write a thought process that included:\n\n ""After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because: ...""\n\n and then the assistant returned <guess>moist</guess> in the first response? But that was for the first guess? No, the first guess was ""crane"".\n\n Actually, the first response was:\n\n <guess>crane</guess>\n\n Then the user provided feedback for crane (all x) and then said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then listed the first guess and its feedback and then said ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback.\n\n So I think the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"", but we are the one who is supposed to make the guesses? \n\n Clarification: In the game, the assistant is the one making the guesses. The user is providing the feedback.\n\n In the first round, the assistant guessed ""crane"", and the user provided feedback: all x.\n\n Then the user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning we (the assistant) should make the second guess.\n\n But then the user also says: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 2: moist""\n\n This is confusing because we (the assistant) haven\'t made the second guess yet. The user is providing the second guess? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing the entire history, including the second guess that we made? But we didn\'t make a second guess in the first response? We only made the first guess.\n\n I think there is a misunderstanding in the flow.\n\n Let me re-express the intended flow:\n\n - We (the assistant) make a guess (first guess) and return it in <guess> tags.\n - The user then provides feedback for that guess and asks for the next guess, providing the history including the first guess and its feedback.\n - Then we make the second guess, and so on.\n\n In the first response, we made the first guess: ""crane"".\n\n Then the user responded with: \n   ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n    Here is some previous feedback: \n    Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)""\n\n And then the user also included ""Guess 2: moist"" but without feedback? Why?\n\n It seems the user is trying to provide the second guess? But we are the ones who are supposed to provide the second guess.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing an example of what the second guess might be? But that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to say that we have already made two guesses: the first was ""crane"" (with feedback all x) and the second was ""moist"" (with feedback not provided). But that is not the case because we only made one guess.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess as a hint? But the problem says we are to make the guesses.\n\n I think the best course is to ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part because it doesn\'t have feedback and we didn\'t make that guess. We are to make the second guess now.\n\n Therefore, we are at the second guess. We know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We need to choose a word that avoids these letters.\n\n Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\n A good second guess might be: ""sulky"" or ""pouty"", but let\'s choose one that has common letters.\n\n Another popular choice is ""pilot"", but note we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. ""pilot"" uses P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.\n\n But let me check: \n   P: allowed\n   I: allowed\n   L: allowed\n   O: allowed\n   T: allowed\n\n ""pilot"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""moist"" is also a good choice (as the user suggested) but we are making the second guess now.\n\n However, the user already wrote ""Guess 2: moist"", so perhaps they expect us to use that? But we are the ones guessing.\n\n Since the user mentioned ""moist"", maybe they are providing feedback for the second guess? But they didn\'t provide the feedback symbols.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will make a second guess that is a valid word without the forbidden letters.\n\n I choose ""pilot"" because it uses common letters and is a good test.\n\n But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we guess something else, it might be inconsistent.\n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to say that they have already made the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to make the third? But without feedback for ""moist"", we cannot.\n\n I think the safest is to assume that the user is providing the history including the second guess and its feedback is missing, so we cannot proceed.\n\n However, since the problem requires us to make a new guess, I will assume that the second guess has not been made and we are to make the second guess.\n\n Therefore, I will ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part and make the second guess.\n\n Let\'s choose ""pilot"".\n\n But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we are to be consistent, perhaps we should use ""moist"" as the second guess? But then we don\'t have feedback for it.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess that we are to use? But then why ask us to make a new guess?\n\n I think there is a mistake in the user input. I will proceed to make the second guess with a word that avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n I choose ""pilot"".\n\n<guess>pilot</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I know the secret word contains none of these letters. This eliminates many common letters, so I need a new guess that avoids them entirely.\n\nFor my second guess, I\'ll choose **""pilot""** because:\n- It uses entirely new letters (P, I, L, O, T) not tested in the first guess.\n- It includes common vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T).\n- ""Pilot"" is a valid English word with no repeating letters.\n\nThis guess maximizes new information by testing five untested letters at once.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist</></think>\nBased on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.

Let\'s note: ""moist"" is M O I S T, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).\n  So O is in the word but not at position 2, and S is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nAdditionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nLetters that are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nLetters that are present: O and S.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain the letters from the absent list: so we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nThe word must contain O and S, and the other three letters are from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe are left with three positions to fill (since O and S are in the word but we don\'t know the positions).\n\nWe are to make the third guess.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Contains O and S (to confirm their positions)\n- Includes three new letters from the remaining set to test more letters.\n- The positions of O and S should not be position 2 and 4 (because they were wrongly positioned there in ""moist""). However, note: O was in position 2 and was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback says it\'s in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, S is not in position 4.\n\nSo we must place O and S in positions that are not 2 and not 4 respectively? Actually, O can be in any position except 2? And S can be in any position except 4? But note: the word might have multiple of the same letter? But in this case, only one O and one S are present because in ""moist"" there was one of each and they were marked as present. However, we don\'t know if there are duplicates, but since we have no information on duplicates, we assume one occurrence.\n\nWe must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nSo the letter bank is: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nOptions: \nWe can form a word with O and S and three new letters.\n\nLet me consider common words that contain O and S and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nExamples: \n- ""socks"" -> but has S twice and O? Also, S is repeated? We don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. Also, K is allowed, but let\'s see: S O C K S -> but C is forbidden? Wait C is in the forbidden list? Yes, from first guess.\n\nSo ""socks"" is invalid because C is forbidden and also it has two S and we don\'t know if we need two S.\n\nAlternatively, ""shows"": S, H, O, W, S? But again two S. And H, O, W are allowed? But two S might be problematic? Also, the word has 5 letters? ""shows"" has two S\'s? Yes, S twice. It might be acceptable if the word has two S, but we don\'t know.\n\nWe want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information.\n\nSo let\'s look for words that have O and S exactly once and three other distinct letters.\n\nPossible: ""songs"" -> repeated S? ""songs"" has two S? Actually, ""songs"" is S-O-N-G-S -> two S? Wait: it has two S? Yes, but also N and G: N is not allowed (from first guess? yes, absent) so forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""focus"" -> but F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.\n\n""post"" -> but 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n""pools"" -> repeated O? And L, S -> L is allowed? But O is repeated? We already know O is present, but we don\'t know if there are two O.\n\nTo avoid complications, aim for no repeated letters.\n\nPossible words: \n""shock"" -> S, H, O, C, K -> C is forbidden? Yes.\n\n""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> L, U, Y are new? But note: L is allowed? And U and Y? So ""lousy"": L O U S Y\n\nCheck for forbidden letters: L, O, U, S, Y -> none forbidden? O and S are present, L, U, Y are new? Also, O and S are not in their previous positions? O is at position 2? But in ""lousy"" O is at position 2? That would be the same position as in ""moist"" which was position 2? But feedback said O was present but not in position 2. So we cannot put O at position 2 again? So ""lousy"" positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:Y -> O at position 2 and S at position 4? Exactly the positions that were wrong in the previous guess? So these positions are invalid? We know O cannot be at position 2? And S cannot be at position 4? So this word would have O and S in the same positions? Avoid that.\n\nHow about ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> N is forbidden? Yes from first guess.\n\n""softs"": repeated S? And F, O, T? -> T is forbidden? Yes from second guess.\n\n""soggy"": repeated G? Also G and Y -> G is allowed? But repeated G? Avoid.\n\n""goods"": repeated O? and D, S? -> O repeated? Not good.\n\nLet me think of words with O and S and avoiding the forbidden positions.\n\nHow about putting S at the beginning? Then O not at position 2.\n\nWord: ""skimp"" -> but K, I, M, P? I and M are forbidden? (from second guess)\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: ""sling"" -> S, L, I, N, G -> I and N forbidden? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""slope"": S, L, O, P, E -> E is forbidden? Yes from first guess.\n\nNo.\n\n""spoke"": S, P, O, K, E -> E forbidden? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> I forbidden? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""could"" -> C forbidden? and O, U, L, D? C forbidden? Yes.\n\nWe are having trouble.\n\nConsider placing O and S in new positions.\n\nPossible positions for O: not 2 (since in second guess it was at position 2 and was wrong). So O can be at 1,3,4,5? But 1: M was forbidden? So O might be at 1? 3? 4? 5?\n\nSimilarly, S cannot be at position 4 (from second guess). So S can be at positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe need a word that has O and S, both not at the positions: O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nAnd letters from the allowed set (without the forbidden ones).\n\nLet me systematically look for words that contain S and O and three other distinct letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- S at 1 and O at 3: e.g., S_O_E? But E forbidden? No words with E.\n\nS_O: _ _ _ pattern? How about ""swoop"" -> repeated O and then P? But also W and P? But repeated O: so only one O? We don\'t know.\n\nBetter avoid repeated letters.\n\nWord: ""showy"": S, H, O, W, Y -> positions: S at 1, O at 3? Then H, W, Y.\n\nWe can try: ""SHOWY"": \n- S at 1, O at 3 -> S position is 1? Previously we haven\'t tested S at 1. O at 3 (not tested at 3 before? Only at 2). So valid? And the word has no forbidden letters? S, H, O, W, Y -> H, W, Y are new. No forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nAnd O is not at 2? O is at 3? Okay.\nS not at 4? Actually, position 4 is W? S is at 1? So S is not at 4? Correct.\n\nSo ""showy"" is S H O W Y -> valid word? I think ""showy"" is an adjective meaning ostentatious? But let me confirm validity.\n\nAlternatively, safer words: \n""howfs"" -> not common? Also repeated F? Unlikely.\n\n""lousy"" we thought but O at 2 and S at 4: not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""bousy"" -> I don\'t know if valid.\n\nLet me think of standard words: \n""hongs"" -> H, O, N, G, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.\n\n""donsy"" -> D, O, N, S, Y -> N forbidden? No.\n\n""pouls"" -> not common? Also P, O, U, L, S? But S at the end? Positions: P(O)U(L)S? S at 5.\n\nIf we have S at 5 and O at 2? But O cannot be at 2? So O must be moved.\n\nWord: ""pouls"" might be invalid.\n\n""youse"" -> E forbidden? and Y, O, U, S -> E? No.\n\n""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> positions: B (1), O (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). But O is at position 2? Which is not allowed? Because the O was at position 2 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""bosky"" has O at 2? Not allowed? Therefore, avoid.\n\nAlternatively, ""jocks"" -> J, O, C, K, S -> C forbidden? No.\n\n""foxes"": F, O, X, E, S -> E forbidden? No.\n\nSo after some struggle, I found ""showy""?\n\nBut also, ""dowly"" -> not common? Another: ""gowds"" -> not common? So ""showy"" might be acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""solus"" -> repeated S? and L, U? Positions: S O L U S -> repeated S? Avoid.\n\n""sojus"" -> same.\n\n""vocus"" -> C forbidden? No.\n\nTherefore, I will choose ""showy"".\n\nBut let me double-check the letters: S, H, O, W, Y. \n- None are forbidden? Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. So H, W, Y are new? Yes.\n\nThe word ""showy"" is valid? Yes, meaning ostentatious.\n\nNow, positions: \nPosition 1: S -> we are testing S at position 1.\nPosition 2: H -> new letter\nPosition 3: O -> O is tested at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong. So this is a new position.\nPosition 4: W -> new letter\nPosition 5: Y -> new letter\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nIf we cannot find ""showy"", another option is ""blows"": but L, O, W, S? And B? Positions: B L O W S -> O at position 3? S at position 5? Then O: not at 2? S: not at 4? But ""blows"" has B, L, O, W, S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have forbidden letters? B, L, O, W, S -> O and S are present? Yes, and B, L, W are new? Valid word? Yes.\n\nCheck positions: O at 3 (not 2) and S at 5 (not 4) -> acceptable.\n\n""blows"" is a valid word? Meaning it is the plural of blow? Or verb third person singular? But as a noun? It can be used? Should be valid.\n\nOr ""gowns"": G, O, W, N, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo between ""showy"" and ""blows"", both are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll choose ""blows"" because it has more common letters? I like ""blows"".\n\nBut let me make sure: we are testing B, L, W with this? Also, if O is at 3 and S at 5, we get information on those positions.\n\nWe might also consider ""fowls"": F, O, W, L, S -> same as ""blows"" but with F? Also acceptable? But to choose one.\n\nAnother: ""yowls"": similarly.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""blows"".\n\nAlternative: ""prows"": P, R, O, W, S -> R forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo ""blows"" is good.\n\nWait, note: in the first guess, we have R forbidden? But ""blows"" has R? No: B L O W S -> R is not in the word? So it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""blows"".\n\nBut note: we have tested O at position 1 and 2? Not? Only at 2. Now at 3? And S: we tested at position 4? Now at 5? So new positions.\n\nSo we guess ""blows"".\n\nAlternatively, if the word has O somewhere else? This might help.\n\nI think ""blows"" is a good choice.\n\n<guess>blows</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2: moist** → M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x).

We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  => Absent: C, R, A, N, E
Guess 2: moist -> M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)  => Absent: M, I, T; Present: O and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
Guess 3: blows -> B(x) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(-)  => Absent: B, L, W; Correct: O in position 3; Present: S (but not in position 5)

Now, from the feedback:

- The secret word has the letter 'O' in the third position (position 3 is fixed as 'O').
- The letter 'S' is present but not in position 5 (from ""blows"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist""). So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 3 is taken by O).

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. S is present but cannot be in 4 or 5. So S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, B, L, W.

So the absent letters are: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W.

Therefore, the remaining letters (from the alphabet) that are possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we also have S and O (O is fixed at position 3, and S is present and must be in position 1 or 2).

So the word has:
- Position 3: O
- S in position 1 or 2
- The other three positions (the remaining two of 1,2 and 4,5) must be filled with three distinct letters from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) and also not including any absent letters.

We have two cases:

Case 1: S at position 1
Then the word is: S _ O _ _
We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.

Case 2: S at position 2
Then the word is: _ S O _ _
We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.

We also note that in the third guess, we had S at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. Similarly, in the second guess, S was at position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), so S is not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at 1 or 2.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

We have a fixed O at position 3, so we can build around that.

We also know that we have not tested: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's try to form a word that has S at position 1 and then two new letters in the other positions? But we have to fill three positions (if S is at 1, then positions 2,4,5) with three new letters.

Similarly for S at 2.

But we don't know which case, so we might want to test both possibilities? Or choose a word that will help us determine the position of S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 or 2 and then new letters.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list possible words:

First, if S is at 1: word pattern: S _ O _ _

Possible words: 
- S H O P ? -> P is allowed? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:P, 5:? -> but we need a fifth letter? ""shop"" is 4 letters? So 5-letter words: ""shops"" -> but S repeated? Not good because we don't know if S is repeated? We have only one S so far? But we don't know. We have only been told one S? Actually, we don't know if there are two S. But to be safe, avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So avoid words with repeated letters.

Possible 5-letter words starting with S and having O at position 3: 
- S C O R E -> but C, R, E are absent? Not allowed.
- S H O O T -> repeated O? and T absent? Not allowed.
- S P O O K -> repeated O? and K? But O repeated? Avoid.
- S N O O P -> repeated O? and N absent? Not allowed.

We need words without repeated letters and without absent letters.

So: S _ O _ _ with the middle and last two from D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

For example: 
- S H O P ? -> not 5 letters? 
- ""shoed"": S H O E D -> E absent? Not allowed.
- ""shone"": S H O N E -> N and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""shout"": S H O U T -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""shoyu"": S H O Y U -> H, Y, U? But ""shoyu"" is a word? (a type of sauce) -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:Y, 5:U. 
  Letters: S, H, O, Y, U -> H, Y, U are new? And no absent letters? 
  But we have H? We haven't tested H? Yes. 
  So ""shoyu"" is a valid word? I think so.

But let me check: shoyu is a Japanese soy sauce? Accepted in English? Yes.

So that's one possibility.

Another: ""spode"": S P O D E -> E absent? Not allowed.

""spoke"": S P O K E -> E absent? Not allowed.

""spoof"": S P O O F -> repeated O? Avoid.

""stood"": S T O O D -> T absent? and repeated O? Not allowed.

So ""shoyu"" is a candidate? But note: we are not sure if S is at position 1? We are just forming a word for case 1.

But we are to make a guess that might help us determine the position of S? Or we can choose a word that has S at position 1 and then we test it.

Similarly, for case 2: S at position 2: _ S O _ _

Possible words: 
- A S O K ? -> A absent? Not allowed.
- U S O U ? -> repeated U? Avoid.
- P S Y O P -> but O is at position 4? We need O at 3? So pattern: _ S O _ _ -> so position 3 is O? So the word must have O at 3? So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

For example: 
- ""psori"" -> not a word? 
- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""isole"" -> I and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""above"": A, B, O, V, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.
- ""adobe"": A, D, O, B, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.
- ""dsobo"" -> not a word.

Another: ""joked"": J, O, K, E, D -> but O is at position 2? We need O at 3? So not.

We need position 2 to be S and 3 to be O.

So: 
- ""asoka"" -> A absent? Not allowed.
- ""usurp"": U, S, U, R, P -> repeated U? and R absent? Not allowed.
- ""psion"": P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.
- ""ksour"": K, S, O, U, R -> R absent? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word for case 2.

Another: ""gsols"" -> not a word? 

""dso"" words? 

""dsomo"" -> not a word.

""psora"" -> P, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.

So case 2 is difficult? Maybe S is at position 1? 

Therefore, we might assume S is at position 1? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 to test that case? And use new letters.

So I propose ""shoyu"": S at 1, O at 3, and H, Y, U as new letters.

But note: in ""shoyu"", S is at 1? We haven't tested S at 1? So we can test it.

If we get feedback that S is correct at position 1, then we know. If not, then S must be at position 2? But if S is at 1 and we get it as present but wrong position? That would be impossible? Because if S is at 1 and we put it at 1, it should be correct? Or if the word has S at 1, then it should be marked correct? 

But if the word has S at 1, then our guess ""shoyu"" would have S at 1 and if it is correct, we get S(✓). If the word does not have S at 1, then S might be at 2? But we have S in the word? So if we get S as present but not at 1? Then it must be at 2? Because we know S is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are available? 

But note: if we guess ""shoyu"", and the word has S at 2, then the S in position 1 would be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we put S at 1 and it is not in the word at 1, but the word has S at 2, then the feedback for S at 1 would be absent? But that would be a problem because we know S is in the word? 

Actually, the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is marked as present (-), and if it is in the correct position, it is marked as correct (✓). If the letter is not in the word, it is absent (x).

But if we put S at position 1 and the word has S at position 2, then the feedback for S at position 1 would be absent? Because it is not in the correct position and the occurrence of S at position 1 is not in the word? But the word has S at position 2? So the feedback should mark the S at position 1 as absent? And then separately, we don't have S at position 2 in our guess? So we wouldn't know? 

This is confusing.

Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For ""shoyu"", we have S at position 1. If the secret word has S at position 2, then the S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? But the secret word has an S at position 2? So the feedback for the S at position 1 would be absent (x) because it's not in the word? But that would be incorrect because the letter S is in the word? 

No: the feedback for a letter in the guess: if the letter is in the secret word but not at that position, it is marked as present (-). But if the secret word has only one S and it is at position 2, then when we put S at position 1, that S is not in the secret word at all? Because the S in the secret word is at position 2? So it would be marked as absent? But that would be inconsistent because we know S is in the word? 

Actually, no: the feedback is per letter in the guess. The S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has S at position 2? So it is absent? But then how do we know there is an S? We wouldn't? 

But we already know from previous feedback that S is in the word? So if we get S absent in this guess, it would contradict? 

This is a problem.

To avoid this, we should not put S in a position that we know might be wrong? But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn't find one? 

Another idea: choose a word that has S at position 1 and also includes letters that might help us if S is not at 1? But it's tricky.

We can choose a word that does not have S at position 1 or 2? But we know S must be at 1 or 2? So if we put S at a different position, it would be wrong? And we would get absent? But that doesn't help.

So we have to put S at either 1 or 2.

Given the difficulty, let's try to find a word for case 2 (S at position 2).

Possible words: 
- ""psora"" -> invalid because of R and A.
- ""ksora"" -> K, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.
- ""gsols"" -> not a word? 
- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""isold"" -> I, S, O, L, D -> I and L absent? Not allowed.
- ""psion"" -> P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.

What about ""dsobo""? Not a word.

""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> B absent? Not allowed.

""cosy"" -> too short.

""dusky"": D, U, S, K, Y -> but S is at position 3? We need S at position 2? ""dusky"" is D U S K Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> so S at 3? But position 3 is fixed as O? So not.

We need position 3 to be O? So the word must have O at 3.

So for case 2: position 2 is S, position 3 is O.

So the word is: ? S O ? ?

With the first and last two letters from the pool.

Let me try: 
- ""psoda"" -> P, S, O, D, A -> A absent? Not allowed.
- ""usoop"" -> not a word.
- ""gsodh"" -> not a word.
- ""jsodh"" -> not a word.

""psoas"": P, S, O, A, S -> A absent? and repeated S? Not allowed.

""kshat"" -> K, S, H, A, T -> A and T absent? Not allowed.

It's very hard. Maybe there are no common words with S at 2 and O at 3 and using only the allowed letters.

Therefore, it is more likely that S is at position 1.

So I will go with ""shoyu"" for the fourth guess.

But let me confirm the letters: S, H, O, Y, U.

- S: at position 1 -> we are testing if S is at 1.
- H: at position 2 -> new letter.
- O: at position 3 -> we know it's correct? So it should be marked as correct? But we are guessing it? It will be correct.
- Y: at position 4 -> new letter.
- U: at position 5 -> new letter.

If the secret word has S at position 1, then we will get S(✓), O(✓), and then we get information about H, Y, U.

If the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 1 in our guess will be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we get S absent, then we know S is not at 1, so it must be at 2? And then we also get that H, Y, U are not in the word? Or present? 

But it will be messy? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn't find one? 

Another word for case 2: ""psued"" -> P, S, U, E, D -> E absent? Not allowed.

""usher"": U, S, H, E, R -> E and R absent? Not allowed.

""ashen"": A, S, H, E, N -> A, E, N absent? Not allowed.

So I think ""shoyu"" is the best bet.

But note: we have not used many common letters? We have D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z left? But we are using H, Y, U.

H, Y, U are not the most common? But we have to use some.

Another word for case 1: ""shoed"" -> not allowed because of E.

""shoad"" -> not a word? 

""shogi"": S, H, O, G, I -> I absent? Not allowed.

""shoyu"" seems acceptable.

So I choose ""shoyu"".

But let me check if there's a word with S at 1 and more common letters? Like ""showy"" but we used W? W is absent? From guess 3: W is absent? Yes, from ""blows"" feedback: W(x).

So W is absent? So we cannot use W.

Similarly, in ""shoyu"", we are not using W.

So ""shoyu"" is S H O Y U.

Yes.

So fourth guess: ""shoyu""

<guess>shoyu</guess> 

But note: ""shoyu"" is 5 letters? S-H-O-Y-U -> 5 letters.

So we'll go with that.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x).  
  → **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: moist**  
  Feedback: M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x).  
  → **Absent letters**: M, I, T (added to the list).  
  → **Present letters**: O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.

- **Guess 3: blows**  
  Feedback: B(x), L(x), O(✓), W(x), S(-).  
  → **Absent letters**: B, L, W (added to the list).  
  → **Correct position**: O is in position 3 (✓).  
  → **Present letter**: S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 5).

### Current Knowledge
- **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W (11 letters).  
- **Present letters (must be in the word)**: O, S.  
- **Correct position**: O is fixed at **position 3**.  
- **Constraints for S**:  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2).  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3).  
  - Since position 3 is occupied by O, S must be in **position 1 or 2**.  
- **Remaining letter pool**: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (13 letters).  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 3 is fixed as **O**.  
  - Positions 1 and 2: One must be S, the other is a new letter.  
  - Positions 4 and 5: Two new letters from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Test the position of S (position 1 vs. 2) while maximizing new letter coverage.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Assume S is in position 1 (since position 2 is harder to validate with common words).  
  - Use a word starting with S, with O in position 3, and new letters in positions 2, 4, and 5.  
  - Avoid repeated letters and absent letters.  
- **Chosen word**: **""SHOYU""** (a valid English word for a type of soy sauce).  
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is here).  
  - O in position 3 (known correct).  
  - New letters: H (position 2), Y (position 4), U (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests S at position 1: If correct, we lock S. If absent, S must be in position 2.  
  - Tests 3 new high-frequency letters (H, Y, U).  
  - Complies with all constraints (no absent letters, O at position 3, S not in positions 4/5).  

<guess>shoyu</guess>",shoyu,"We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  => Absent: C, R, A, N, E
Guess 2: moist -> M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)  => Absent: M, I, T; Present: O and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
Guess 3: blows -> B(x) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(-)  => Absent: B, L, W; Correct: O in position 3; Present: S (but not in position 5)

Now, from the feedback:

- The secret word has the letter 'O' in the third position (position 3 is fixed as 'O').
- The letter 'S' is present but not in position 5 (from ""blows"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist""). So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 3 is taken by O).

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. S is present but cannot be in 4 or 5. So S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, B, L, W.

So the absent letters are: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W.

Therefore, the remaining letters (from the alphabet) that are possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we also have S and O (O is fixed at position 3, and S is present and must be in position 1 or 2).

So the word has:
- Position 3: O
- S in position 1 or 2
- The other three positions (the remaining two of 1,2 and 4,5) must be filled with three distinct letters from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) and also not including any absent letters.

We have two cases:

Case 1: S at position 1
Then the word is: S _ O _ _
We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.

Case 2: S at position 2
Then the word is: _ S O _ _
We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.

We also note that in the third guess, we had S at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. Similarly, in the second guess, S was at position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), so S is not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at 1 or 2.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

We have a fixed O at position 3, so we can build around that.

We also know that we have not tested: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's try to form a word that has S at position 1 and then two new letters in the other positions? But we have to fill three positions (if S is at 1, then positions 2,4,5) with three new letters.

Similarly for S at 2.

But we don't know which case, so we might want to test both possibilities? Or choose a word that will help us determine the position of S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 or 2 and then new letters.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list possible words:

First, if S is at 1: word pattern: S _ O _ _

Possible words: 
- S H O P ? -> P is allowed? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:P, 5:? -> but we need a fifth letter? ""shop"" is 4 letters? So 5-letter words: ""shops"" -> but S repeated? Not good because we don't know if S is repeated? We have only one S so far? But we don't know. We have only been told one S? Actually, we don't know if there are two S. But to be safe, avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So avoid words with repeated letters.

Possible 5-letter words starting with S and having O at position 3: 
- S C O R E -> but C, R, E are absent? Not allowed.
- S H O O T -> repeated O? and T absent? Not allowed.
- S P O O K -> repeated O? and K? But O repeated? Avoid.
- S N O O P -> repeated O? and N absent? Not allowed.

We need words without repeated letters and without absent letters.

So: S _ O _ _ with the middle and last two from D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

For example: 
- S H O P ? -> not 5 letters? 
- ""shoed"": S H O E D -> E absent? Not allowed.
- ""shone"": S H O N E -> N and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""shout"": S H O U T -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""shoyu"": S H O Y U -> H, Y, U? But ""shoyu"" is a word? (a type of sauce) -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:Y, 5:U. 
  Letters: S, H, O, Y, U -> H, Y, U are new? And no absent letters? 
  But we have H? We haven't tested H? Yes. 
  So ""shoyu"" is a valid word? I think so.

But let me check: shoyu is a Japanese soy sauce? Accepted in English? Yes.

So that's one possibility.

Another: ""spode"": S P O D E -> E absent? Not allowed.

""spoke"": S P O K E -> E absent? Not allowed.

""spoof"": S P O O F -> repeated O? Avoid.

""stood"": S T O O D -> T absent? and repeated O? Not allowed.

So ""shoyu"" is a candidate? But note: we are not sure if S is at position 1? We are just forming a word for case 1.

But we are to make a guess that might help us determine the position of S? Or we can choose a word that has S at position 1 and then we test it.

Similarly, for case 2: S at position 2: _ S O _ _

Possible words: 
- A S O K ? -> A absent? Not allowed.
- U S O U ? -> repeated U? Avoid.
- P S Y O P -> but O is at position 4? We need O at 3? So pattern: _ S O _ _ -> so position 3 is O? So the word must have O at 3? So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

For example: 
- ""psori"" -> not a word? 
- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""isole"" -> I and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""above"": A, B, O, V, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.
- ""adobe"": A, D, O, B, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.
- ""dsobo"" -> not a word.

Another: ""joked"": J, O, K, E, D -> but O is at position 2? We need O at 3? So not.

We need position 2 to be S and 3 to be O.

So: 
- ""asoka"" -> A absent? Not allowed.
- ""usurp"": U, S, U, R, P -> repeated U? and R absent? Not allowed.
- ""psion"": P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.
- ""ksour"": K, S, O, U, R -> R absent? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word for case 2.

Another: ""gsols"" -> not a word? 

""dso"" words? 

""dsomo"" -> not a word.

""psora"" -> P, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.

So case 2 is difficult? Maybe S is at position 1? 

Therefore, we might assume S is at position 1? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 to test that case? And use new letters.

So I propose ""shoyu"": S at 1, O at 3, and H, Y, U as new letters.

But note: in ""shoyu"", S is at 1? We haven't tested S at 1? So we can test it.

If we get feedback that S is correct at position 1, then we know. If not, then S must be at position 2? But if S is at 1 and we get it as present but wrong position? That would be impossible? Because if S is at 1 and we put it at 1, it should be correct? Or if the word has S at 1, then it should be marked correct? 

But if the word has S at 1, then our guess ""shoyu"" would have S at 1 and if it is correct, we get S(✓). If the word does not have S at 1, then S might be at 2? But we have S in the word? So if we get S as present but not at 1? Then it must be at 2? Because we know S is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are available? 

But note: if we guess ""shoyu"", and the word has S at 2, then the S in position 1 would be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we put S at 1 and it is not in the word at 1, but the word has S at 2, then the feedback for S at 1 would be absent? But that would be a problem because we know S is in the word? 

Actually, the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is marked as present (-), and if it is in the correct position, it is marked as correct (✓). If the letter is not in the word, it is absent (x).

But if we put S at position 1 and the word has S at position 2, then the feedback for S at position 1 would be absent? Because it is not in the correct position and the occurrence of S at position 1 is not in the word? But the word has S at position 2? So the feedback should mark the S at position 1 as absent? And then separately, we don't have S at position 2 in our guess? So we wouldn't know? 

This is confusing.

Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For ""shoyu"", we have S at position 1. If the secret word has S at position 2, then the S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? But the secret word has an S at position 2? So the feedback for the S at position 1 would be absent (x) because it's not in the word? But that would be incorrect because the letter S is in the word? 

No: the feedback for a letter in the guess: if the letter is in the secret word but not at that position, it is marked as present (-). But if the secret word has only one S and it is at position 2, then when we put S at position 1, that S is not in the secret word at all? Because the S in the secret word is at position 2? So it would be marked as absent? But that would be inconsistent because we know S is in the word? 

Actually, no: the feedback is per letter in the guess. The S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has S at position 2? So it is absent? But then how do we know there is an S? We wouldn't? 

But we already know from previous feedback that S is in the word? So if we get S absent in this guess, it would contradict? 

This is a problem.

To avoid this, we should not put S in a position that we know might be wrong? But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn't find one? 

Another idea: choose a word that has S at position 1 and also includes letters that might help us if S is not at 1? But it's tricky.

We can choose a word that does not have S at position 1 or 2? But we know S must be at 1 or 2? So if we put S at a different position, it would be wrong? And we would get absent? But that doesn't help.

So we have to put S at either 1 or 2.

Given the difficulty, let's try to find a word for case 2 (S at position 2).

Possible words: 
- ""psora"" -> invalid because of R and A.
- ""ksora"" -> K, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.
- ""gsols"" -> not a word? 
- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""isold"" -> I, S, O, L, D -> I and L absent? Not allowed.
- ""psion"" -> P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.

What about ""dsobo""? Not a word.

""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> B absent? Not allowed.

""cosy"" -> too short.

""dusky"": D, U, S, K, Y -> but S is at position 3? We need S at position 2? ""dusky"" is D U S K Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> so S at 3? But position 3 is fixed as O? So not.

We need position 3 to be O? So the word must have O at 3.

So for case 2: position 2 is S, position 3 is O.

So the word is: ? S O ? ?

With the first and last two letters from the pool.

Let me try: 
- ""psoda"" -> P, S, O, D, A -> A absent? Not allowed.
- ""usoop"" -> not a word.
- ""gsodh"" -> not a word.
- ""jsodh"" -> not a word.

""psoas"": P, S, O, A, S -> A absent? and repeated S? Not allowed.

""kshat"" -> K, S, H, A, T -> A and T absent? Not allowed.

It's very hard. Maybe there are no common words with S at 2 and O at 3 and using only the allowed letters.

Therefore, it is more likely that S is at position 1.

So I will go with ""shoyu"" for the fourth guess.

But let me confirm the letters: S, H, O, Y, U.

- S: at position 1 -> we are testing if S is at 1.
- H: at position 2 -> new letter.
- O: at position 3 -> we know it's correct? So it should be marked as correct? But we are guessing it? It will be correct.
- Y: at position 4 -> new letter.
- U: at position 5 -> new letter.

If the secret word has S at position 1, then we will get S(✓), O(✓), and then we get information about H, Y, U.

If the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 1 in our guess will be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we get S absent, then we know S is not at 1, so it must be at 2? And then we also get that H, Y, U are not in the word? Or present? 

But it will be messy? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn't find one? 

Another word for case 2: ""psued"" -> P, S, U, E, D -> E absent? Not allowed.

""usher"": U, S, H, E, R -> E and R absent? Not allowed.

""ashen"": A, S, H, E, N -> A, E, N absent? Not allowed.

So I think ""shoyu"" is the best bet.

But note: we have not used many common letters? We have D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z left? But we are using H, Y, U.

H, Y, U are not the most common? But we have to use some.

Another word for case 1: ""shoed"" -> not allowed because of E.

""shoad"" -> not a word? 

""shogi"": S, H, O, G, I -> I absent? Not allowed.

""shoyu"" seems acceptable.

So I choose ""shoyu"".

But let me check if there's a word with S at 1 and more common letters? Like ""showy"" but we used W? W is absent? From guess 3: W is absent? Yes, from ""blows"" feedback: W(x).

So W is absent? So we cannot use W.

Similarly, in ""shoyu"", we are not using W.

So ""shoyu"" is S H O Y U.

Yes.

So fourth guess: ""shoyu""

<guess>shoyu</guess> 

But note: ""shoyu"" is 5 letters? S-H-O-Y-U -> 5 letters.

So we'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x).  
  → **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: moist**  
  Feedback: M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x).  
  → **Absent letters**: M, I, T (added to the list).  
  → **Present letters**: O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.

- **Guess 3: blows**  
  Feedback: B(x), L(x), O(✓), W(x), S(-).  
  → **Absent letters**: B, L, W (added to the list).  
  → **Correct position**: O is in position 3 (✓).  
  → **Present letter**: S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 5).

### Current Knowledge
- **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W (11 letters).  
- **Present letters (must be in the word)**: O, S.  
- **Correct position**: O is fixed at **position 3**.  
- **Constraints for S**:  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2).  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3).  
  - Since position 3 is occupied by O, S must be in **position 1 or 2**.  
- **Remaining letter pool**: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (13 letters).  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 3 is fixed as **O**.  
  - Positions 1 and 2: One must be S, the other is a new letter.  
  - Positions 4 and 5: Two new letters from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Test the position of S (position 1 vs. 2) while maximizing new letter coverage.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Assume S is in position 1 (since position 2 is harder to validate with common words).  
  - Use a word starting with S, with O in position 3, and new letters in positions 2, 4, and 5.  
  - Avoid repeated letters and absent letters.  
- **Chosen word**: **""SHOYU""** (a valid English word for a type of soy sauce).  
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is here).  
  - O in position 3 (known correct).  
  - New letters: H (position 2), Y (position 4), U (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests S at position 1: If correct, we lock S. If absent, S must be in position 2.  
  - Tests 3 new high-frequency letters (H, Y, U).  
  - Complies with all constraints (no absent letters, O at position 3, S not in positions 4/5).",Guess 5: shoyu -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) Y(x) U(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,SHOOK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>moist -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters.

 We are now making a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We have a second guess: ""moist"" (which was provided by the user in the response format, but note that the user's response ended with ""moist</>"", so we take that as the guess).

 However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then provides the previous feedback including the first guess and its feedback.

 The user's response for the second guess was ""moist"", but we must now provide the feedback for that guess? Actually, the problem is asking for the next guess (which would be the third guess) because it says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then lists:

 Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Guess 2: moist

 But the feedback for ""moist"" is not provided. So we are to make the third guess.

 However, looking at the user's input: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", it seems that the user intended to guess ""moist"" but then the feedback is missing. The problem says: ""Here is some previous feedback"" and then lists two guesses, but only the first has feedback.

 This is confusing. Let me re-read the user input:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Guess 2: moist""

 It does not provide feedback for ""moist"". So we cannot proceed without that feedback.

 But note: the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then gives the previous feedback including the first guess and the second guess (without feedback). This seems like an error.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to provide the feedback for that? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are to make the next guess (the third one).

 However, without feedback for the second guess, we cannot make an informed third guess.

 Let me check the example in the initial instructions: the example had feedback for each guess.

 Therefore, I think there might be a misunderstanding. The user input says ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback. But in the context, the user might be providing the second guess and then we are to generate the feedback? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are the player and we are to guess.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the second guess was ""moist"" and now we are to make the third guess, but we don't have the feedback for ""moist"". That is a problem.

 Since the problem states: ""Here is some previous feedback"", and it only provided feedback for guess 1, then we must assume that the feedback for guess 2 is not available? But that doesn't make sense.

 Another possibility: the user input is truncated. The user input says: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", and then the assistant started to write a thought process. But the assistant's response was cut off.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to provide the feedback for the second guess but it was not included. Therefore, we cannot proceed without that feedback.

 However, looking at the history:

 First guess: crane -> all letters wrong (C, R, A, N, E are absent)
 Second guess: moist (we don't know the feedback)

 But the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then lists the two guesses without feedback for the second.

 This is inconsistent. I think we must ask for clarification, but since we are to return a guess, we have to make an assumption.

 Alternatively, note that the user input for the second guess was ""moist"" and then the assistant started to write a thought process that included:

 ""After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because: ...""

 and then the assistant returned <guess>moist</guess> in the first response? But that was for the first guess? No, the first guess was ""crane"".

 Actually, the first response was:

 <guess>crane</guess>

 Then the user provided feedback for crane (all x) and then said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then listed the first guess and its feedback and then said ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback.

 So I think the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"", but we are the one who is supposed to make the guesses? 

 Clarification: In the game, the assistant is the one making the guesses. The user is providing the feedback.

 In the first round, the assistant guessed ""crane"", and the user provided feedback: all x.

 Then the user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning we (the assistant) should make the second guess.

 But then the user also says: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 2: moist""

 This is confusing because we (the assistant) haven't made the second guess yet. The user is providing the second guess? That doesn't make sense.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the entire history, including the second guess that we made? But we didn't make a second guess in the first response? We only made the first guess.

 I think there is a misunderstanding in the flow.

 Let me re-express the intended flow:

 - We (the assistant) make a guess (first guess) and return it in <guess> tags.
 - The user then provides feedback for that guess and asks for the next guess, providing the history including the first guess and its feedback.
 - Then we make the second guess, and so on.

 In the first response, we made the first guess: ""crane"".

 Then the user responded with: 
   ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

    Here is some previous feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)""

 And then the user also included ""Guess 2: moist"" but without feedback? Why?

 It seems the user is trying to provide the second guess? But we are the ones who are supposed to provide the second guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing an example of what the second guess might be? But that doesn't make sense.

 Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to say that we have already made two guesses: the first was ""crane"" (with feedback all x) and the second was ""moist"" (with feedback not provided). But that is not the case because we only made one guess.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess as a hint? But the problem says we are to make the guesses.

 I think the best course is to ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part because it doesn't have feedback and we didn't make that guess. We are to make the second guess now.

 Therefore, we are at the second guess. We know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be: ""sulky"" or ""pouty"", but let's choose one that has common letters.

 Another popular choice is ""pilot"", but note we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. ""pilot"" uses P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.

 But let me check: 
   P: allowed
   I: allowed
   L: allowed
   O: allowed
   T: allowed

 ""pilot"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""moist"" is also a good choice (as the user suggested) but we are making the second guess now.

 However, the user already wrote ""Guess 2: moist"", so perhaps they expect us to use that? But we are the ones guessing.

 Since the user mentioned ""moist"", maybe they are providing feedback for the second guess? But they didn't provide the feedback symbols.

 Given the ambiguity, I will make a second guess that is a valid word without the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"" because it uses common letters and is a good test.

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we guess something else, it might be inconsistent.

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say that they have already made the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to make the third? But without feedback for ""moist"", we cannot.

 I think the safest is to assume that the user is providing the history including the second guess and its feedback is missing, so we cannot proceed.

 However, since the problem requires us to make a new guess, I will assume that the second guess has not been made and we are to make the second guess.

 Therefore, I will ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part and make the second guess.

 Let's choose ""pilot"".

 But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we are to be consistent, perhaps we should use ""moist"" as the second guess? But then we don't have feedback for it.

 Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess that we are to use? But then why ask us to make a new guess?

 I think there is a mistake in the user input. I will proceed to make the second guess with a word that avoids the forbidden letters.

 I choose ""pilot"".

<guess>pilot</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I know the secret word contains none of these letters. This eliminates many common letters, so I need a new guess that avoids them entirely.

For my second guess, I'll choose **""pilot""** because:
- It uses entirely new letters (P, I, L, O, T) not tested in the first guess.
- It includes common vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T).
- ""Pilot"" is a valid English word with no repeating letters.

This guess maximizes new information by testing five untested letters at once.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist</></think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>moist -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. First guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. Second guess: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

So, from the feedback of the second guess:
- M: absent (x) -> not in the word
- O: present but wrong position (-)
- I: absent (x) -> not in the word
- S: present but wrong position (-)
- T: absent (x) -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they appeared in ""moist"" (which was position 2 for O and position 4 for S? Let's note: ""moist"" is M O I S T, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
  So O is in the word but not at position 2, and S is in the word but not at position 4.

Additionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Letters that are present: O and S.

We also know that the word does not contain the letters from the absent list: so we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

The word must contain O and S, and the other three letters are from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are left with three positions to fill (since O and S are in the word but we don't know the positions).

We are to make the third guess.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains O and S (to confirm their positions)
- Includes three new letters from the remaining set to test more letters.
- The positions of O and S should not be position 2 and 4 (because they were wrongly positioned there in ""moist""). However, note: O was in position 2 and was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback says it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, S is not in position 4.

So we must place O and S in positions that are not 2 and not 4 respectively? Actually, O can be in any position except 2? And S can be in any position except 4? But note: the word might have multiple of the same letter? But in this case, only one O and one S are present because in ""moist"" there was one of each and they were marked as present. However, we don't know if there are duplicates, but since we have no information on duplicates, we assume one occurrence.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

So the letter bank is: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Options: 
We can form a word with O and S and three new letters.

Let me consider common words that contain O and S and avoid the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""socks"" -> but has S twice and O? Also, S is repeated? We don't know if the word allows duplicates. Also, K is allowed, but let's see: S O C K S -> but C is forbidden? Wait C is in the forbidden list? Yes, from first guess.

So ""socks"" is invalid because C is forbidden and also it has two S and we don't know if we need two S.

Alternatively, ""shows"": S, H, O, W, S? But again two S. And H, O, W are allowed? But two S might be problematic? Also, the word has 5 letters? ""shows"" has two S's? Yes, S twice. It might be acceptable if the word has two S, but we don't know.

We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So let's look for words that have O and S exactly once and three other distinct letters.

Possible: ""songs"" -> repeated S? ""songs"" has two S? Actually, ""songs"" is S-O-N-G-S -> two S? Wait: it has two S? Yes, but also N and G: N is not allowed (from first guess? yes, absent) so forbidden.

Another idea: ""focus"" -> but F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

""post"" -> but 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

""pools"" -> repeated O? And L, S -> L is allowed? But O is repeated? We already know O is present, but we don't know if there are two O.

To avoid complications, aim for no repeated letters.

Possible words: 
""shock"" -> S, H, O, C, K -> C is forbidden? Yes.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> L, U, Y are new? But note: L is allowed? And U and Y? So ""lousy"": L O U S Y

Check for forbidden letters: L, O, U, S, Y -> none forbidden? O and S are present, L, U, Y are new? Also, O and S are not in their previous positions? O is at position 2? But in ""lousy"" O is at position 2? That would be the same position as in ""moist"" which was position 2? But feedback said O was present but not in position 2. So we cannot put O at position 2 again? So ""lousy"" positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:Y -> O at position 2 and S at position 4? Exactly the positions that were wrong in the previous guess? So these positions are invalid? We know O cannot be at position 2? And S cannot be at position 4? So this word would have O and S in the same positions? Avoid that.

How about ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> N is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

""softs"": repeated S? And F, O, T? -> T is forbidden? Yes from second guess.

""soggy"": repeated G? Also G and Y -> G is allowed? But repeated G? Avoid.

""goods"": repeated O? and D, S? -> O repeated? Not good.

Let me think of words with O and S and avoiding the forbidden positions.

How about putting S at the beginning? Then O not at position 2.

Word: ""skimp"" -> but K, I, M, P? I and M are forbidden? (from second guess)

No.

Another: ""sling"" -> S, L, I, N, G -> I and N forbidden? Yes.

No.

""slope"": S, L, O, P, E -> E is forbidden? Yes from first guess.

No.

""spoke"": S, P, O, K, E -> E forbidden? Yes.

No.

""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> I forbidden? Yes.

No.

""could"" -> C forbidden? and O, U, L, D? C forbidden? Yes.

We are having trouble.

Consider placing O and S in new positions.

Possible positions for O: not 2 (since in second guess it was at position 2 and was wrong). So O can be at 1,3,4,5? But 1: M was forbidden? So O might be at 1? 3? 4? 5?

Similarly, S cannot be at position 4 (from second guess). So S can be at positions: 1,2,3,5.

We need a word that has O and S, both not at the positions: O not at 2, S not at 4.

And letters from the allowed set (without the forbidden ones).

Let me systematically look for words that contain S and O and three other distinct letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common possibilities:
- S at 1 and O at 3: e.g., S_O_E? But E forbidden? No words with E.

S_O: _ _ _ pattern? How about ""swoop"" -> repeated O and then P? But also W and P? But repeated O: so only one O? We don't know.

Better avoid repeated letters.

Word: ""showy"": S, H, O, W, Y -> positions: S at 1, O at 3? Then H, W, Y.

We can try: ""SHOWY"": 
- S at 1, O at 3 -> S position is 1? Previously we haven't tested S at 1. O at 3 (not tested at 3 before? Only at 2). So valid? And the word has no forbidden letters? S, H, O, W, Y -> H, W, Y are new. No forbidden letters? Yes.

And O is not at 2? O is at 3? Okay.
S not at 4? Actually, position 4 is W? S is at 1? So S is not at 4? Correct.

So ""showy"" is S H O W Y -> valid word? I think ""showy"" is an adjective meaning ostentatious? But let me confirm validity.

Alternatively, safer words: 
""howfs"" -> not common? Also repeated F? Unlikely.

""lousy"" we thought but O at 2 and S at 4: not allowed.

Another: ""bousy"" -> I don't know if valid.

Let me think of standard words: 
""hongs"" -> H, O, N, G, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.

""donsy"" -> D, O, N, S, Y -> N forbidden? No.

""pouls"" -> not common? Also P, O, U, L, S? But S at the end? Positions: P(O)U(L)S? S at 5.

If we have S at 5 and O at 2? But O cannot be at 2? So O must be moved.

Word: ""pouls"" might be invalid.

""youse"" -> E forbidden? and Y, O, U, S -> E? No.

""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> positions: B (1), O (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). But O is at position 2? Which is not allowed? Because the O was at position 2 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""bosky"" has O at 2? Not allowed? Therefore, avoid.

Alternatively, ""jocks"" -> J, O, C, K, S -> C forbidden? No.

""foxes"": F, O, X, E, S -> E forbidden? No.

So after some struggle, I found ""showy""?

But also, ""dowly"" -> not common? Another: ""gowds"" -> not common? So ""showy"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""solus"" -> repeated S? and L, U? Positions: S O L U S -> repeated S? Avoid.

""sojus"" -> same.

""vocus"" -> C forbidden? No.

Therefore, I will choose ""showy"".

But let me double-check the letters: S, H, O, W, Y. 
- None are forbidden? Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. So H, W, Y are new? Yes.

The word ""showy"" is valid? Yes, meaning ostentatious.

Now, positions: 
Position 1: S -> we are testing S at position 1.
Position 2: H -> new letter
Position 3: O -> O is tested at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong. So this is a new position.
Position 4: W -> new letter
Position 5: Y -> new letter

So that's good.

If we cannot find ""showy"", another option is ""blows"": but L, O, W, S? And B? Positions: B L O W S -> O at position 3? S at position 5? Then O: not at 2? S: not at 4? But ""blows"" has B, L, O, W, S.

But note: we don't have forbidden letters? B, L, O, W, S -> O and S are present? Yes, and B, L, W are new? Valid word? Yes.

Check positions: O at 3 (not 2) and S at 5 (not 4) -> acceptable.

""blows"" is a valid word? Meaning it is the plural of blow? Or verb third person singular? But as a noun? It can be used? Should be valid.

Or ""gowns"": G, O, W, N, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.

So between ""showy"" and ""blows"", both are acceptable.

I'll choose ""blows"" because it has more common letters? I like ""blows"".

But let me make sure: we are testing B, L, W with this? Also, if O is at 3 and S at 5, we get information on those positions.

We might also consider ""fowls"": F, O, W, L, S -> same as ""blows"" but with F? Also acceptable? But to choose one.

Another: ""yowls"": similarly.

But I'll go with ""blows"".

Alternative: ""prows"": P, R, O, W, S -> R forbidden? Not allowed.

So ""blows"" is good.

Wait, note: in the first guess, we have R forbidden? But ""blows"" has R? No: B L O W S -> R is not in the word? So it's okay.

Therefore, third guess: ""blows"".

But note: we have tested O at position 1 and 2? Not? Only at 2. Now at 3? And S: we tested at position 4? Now at 5? So new positions.

So we guess ""blows"".

Alternatively, if the word has O somewhere else? This might help.

I think ""blows"" is a good choice.

<guess>blows</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
  - O is present but not in position 2.
  - S is present but not in position 4.
  - M, I, T are absent.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: O, S (must be included, but not at previous positions).
- **Remaining letter pool**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - O cannot be at position 2.
  - S cannot be at position 4.

For Guess 3, I need a word that:
1. Includes O and S exactly once (since duplicates are unconfirmed).
2. Avoids repeated letters and all absent letters.
3. Places O not at position 2 and S not at position 4.
4. Tests new high-frequency letters from the pool.

### Word Selection:
After evaluating options, **""blows""** is chosen:
- **Letters**: B, L, O, W, S.
  - O is at position 3 (not 2).
  - S is at position 5 (not 4).
  - New letters tested: B, L, W (all distinct and unexplored).
- **Validity**: ""Blows"" is a valid English word (e.g., plural of ""blow"" meaning ""sudden hits"" or ""blossoms"" in botany).
- **Information gain**: This guess tests 3 new letters and confirms positions for O and S efficiently.

<guess>blows</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist</></think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>moist -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)
Guess 4: blows -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  => Absent: C, R, A, N, E
Guess 2: moist -> M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)  => Absent: M, I, T; Present: O and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
Guess 3: blows -> B(x) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(-)  => Absent: B, L, W; Correct: O in position 3; Present: S (but not in position 5)

Now, from the feedback:

- The secret word has the letter 'O' in the third position (position 3 is fixed as 'O').
- The letter 'S' is present but not in position 5 (from ""blows"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist""). So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 3 is taken by O).

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. S is present but cannot be in 4 or 5. So S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, B, L, W.

So the absent letters are: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W.

Therefore, the remaining letters (from the alphabet) that are possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we also have S and O (O is fixed at position 3, and S is present and must be in position 1 or 2).

So the word has:
- Position 3: O
- S in position 1 or 2
- The other three positions (the remaining two of 1,2 and 4,5) must be filled with three distinct letters from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) and also not including any absent letters.

We have two cases:

Case 1: S at position 1
Then the word is: S _ O _ _
We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.

Case 2: S at position 2
Then the word is: _ S O _ _
We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.

We also note that in the third guess, we had S at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. Similarly, in the second guess, S was at position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), so S is not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at 1 or 2.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

We have a fixed O at position 3, so we can build around that.

We also know that we have not tested: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's try to form a word that has S at position 1 and then two new letters in the other positions? But we have to fill three positions (if S is at 1, then positions 2,4,5) with three new letters.

Similarly for S at 2.

But we don't know which case, so we might want to test both possibilities? Or choose a word that will help us determine the position of S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 or 2 and then new letters.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list possible words:

First, if S is at 1: word pattern: S _ O _ _

Possible words: 
- S H O P ? -> P is allowed? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:P, 5:? -> but we need a fifth letter? ""shop"" is 4 letters? So 5-letter words: ""shops"" -> but S repeated? Not good because we don't know if S is repeated? We have only one S so far? But we don't know. We have only been told one S? Actually, we don't know if there are two S. But to be safe, avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

So avoid words with repeated letters.

Possible 5-letter words starting with S and having O at position 3: 
- S C O R E -> but C, R, E are absent? Not allowed.
- S H O O T -> repeated O? and T absent? Not allowed.
- S P O O K -> repeated O? and K? But O repeated? Avoid.
- S N O O P -> repeated O? and N absent? Not allowed.

We need words without repeated letters and without absent letters.

So: S _ O _ _ with the middle and last two from D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

For example: 
- S H O P ? -> not 5 letters? 
- ""shoed"": S H O E D -> E absent? Not allowed.
- ""shone"": S H O N E -> N and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""shout"": S H O U T -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""shoyu"": S H O Y U -> H, Y, U? But ""shoyu"" is a word? (a type of sauce) -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:Y, 5:U. 
  Letters: S, H, O, Y, U -> H, Y, U are new? And no absent letters? 
  But we have H? We haven't tested H? Yes. 
  So ""shoyu"" is a valid word? I think so.

But let me check: shoyu is a Japanese soy sauce? Accepted in English? Yes.

So that's one possibility.

Another: ""spode"": S P O D E -> E absent? Not allowed.

""spoke"": S P O K E -> E absent? Not allowed.

""spoof"": S P O O F -> repeated O? Avoid.

""stood"": S T O O D -> T absent? and repeated O? Not allowed.

So ""shoyu"" is a candidate? But note: we are not sure if S is at position 1? We are just forming a word for case 1.

But we are to make a guess that might help us determine the position of S? Or we can choose a word that has S at position 1 and then we test it.

Similarly, for case 2: S at position 2: _ S O _ _

Possible words: 
- A S O K ? -> A absent? Not allowed.
- U S O U ? -> repeated U? Avoid.
- P S Y O P -> but O is at position 4? We need O at 3? So pattern: _ S O _ _ -> so position 3 is O? So the word must have O at 3? So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

For example: 
- ""psori"" -> not a word? 
- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""isole"" -> I and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""above"": A, B, O, V, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.
- ""adobe"": A, D, O, B, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.
- ""dsobo"" -> not a word.

Another: ""joked"": J, O, K, E, D -> but O is at position 2? We need O at 3? So not.

We need position 2 to be S and 3 to be O.

So: 
- ""asoka"" -> A absent? Not allowed.
- ""usurp"": U, S, U, R, P -> repeated U? and R absent? Not allowed.
- ""psion"": P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.
- ""ksour"": K, S, O, U, R -> R absent? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word for case 2.

Another: ""gsols"" -> not a word? 

""dso"" words? 

""dsomo"" -> not a word.

""psora"" -> P, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.

So case 2 is difficult? Maybe S is at position 1? 

Therefore, we might assume S is at position 1? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 to test that case? And use new letters.

So I propose ""shoyu"": S at 1, O at 3, and H, Y, U as new letters.

But note: in ""shoyu"", S is at 1? We haven't tested S at 1? So we can test it.

If we get feedback that S is correct at position 1, then we know. If not, then S must be at position 2? But if S is at 1 and we get it as present but wrong position? That would be impossible? Because if S is at 1 and we put it at 1, it should be correct? Or if the word has S at 1, then it should be marked correct? 

But if the word has S at 1, then our guess ""shoyu"" would have S at 1 and if it is correct, we get S(✓). If the word does not have S at 1, then S might be at 2? But we have S in the word? So if we get S as present but not at 1? Then it must be at 2? Because we know S is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are available? 

But note: if we guess ""shoyu"", and the word has S at 2, then the S in position 1 would be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we put S at 1 and it is not in the word at 1, but the word has S at 2, then the feedback for S at 1 would be absent? But that would be a problem because we know S is in the word? 

Actually, the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is marked as present (-), and if it is in the correct position, it is marked as correct (✓). If the letter is not in the word, it is absent (x).

But if we put S at position 1 and the word has S at position 2, then the feedback for S at position 1 would be absent? Because it is not in the correct position and the occurrence of S at position 1 is not in the word? But the word has S at position 2? So the feedback should mark the S at position 1 as absent? And then separately, we don't have S at position 2 in our guess? So we wouldn't know? 

This is confusing.

Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For ""shoyu"", we have S at position 1. If the secret word has S at position 2, then the S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? But the secret word has an S at position 2? So the feedback for the S at position 1 would be absent (x) because it's not in the word? But that would be incorrect because the letter S is in the word? 

No: the feedback for a letter in the guess: if the letter is in the secret word but not at that position, it is marked as present (-). But if the secret word has only one S and it is at position 2, then when we put S at position 1, that S is not in the secret word at all? Because the S in the secret word is at position 2? So it would be marked as absent? But that would be inconsistent because we know S is in the word? 

Actually, no: the feedback is per letter in the guess. The S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has S at position 2? So it is absent? But then how do we know there is an S? We wouldn't? 

But we already know from previous feedback that S is in the word? So if we get S absent in this guess, it would contradict? 

This is a problem.

To avoid this, we should not put S in a position that we know might be wrong? But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn't find one? 

Another idea: choose a word that has S at position 1 and also includes letters that might help us if S is not at 1? But it's tricky.

We can choose a word that does not have S at position 1 or 2? But we know S must be at 1 or 2? So if we put S at a different position, it would be wrong? And we would get absent? But that doesn't help.

So we have to put S at either 1 or 2.

Given the difficulty, let's try to find a word for case 2 (S at position 2).

Possible words: 
- ""psora"" -> invalid because of R and A.
- ""ksora"" -> K, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.
- ""gsols"" -> not a word? 
- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""isold"" -> I, S, O, L, D -> I and L absent? Not allowed.
- ""psion"" -> P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.

What about ""dsobo""? Not a word.

""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> B absent? Not allowed.

""cosy"" -> too short.

""dusky"": D, U, S, K, Y -> but S is at position 3? We need S at position 2? ""dusky"" is D U S K Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> so S at 3? But position 3 is fixed as O? So not.

We need position 3 to be O? So the word must have O at 3.

So for case 2: position 2 is S, position 3 is O.

So the word is: ? S O ? ?

With the first and last two letters from the pool.

Let me try: 
- ""psoda"" -> P, S, O, D, A -> A absent? Not allowed.
- ""usoop"" -> not a word.
- ""gsodh"" -> not a word.
- ""jsodh"" -> not a word.

""psoas"": P, S, O, A, S -> A absent? and repeated S? Not allowed.

""kshat"" -> K, S, H, A, T -> A and T absent? Not allowed.

It's very hard. Maybe there are no common words with S at 2 and O at 3 and using only the allowed letters.

Therefore, it is more likely that S is at position 1.

So I will go with ""shoyu"" for the fourth guess.

But let me confirm the letters: S, H, O, Y, U.

- S: at position 1 -> we are testing if S is at 1.
- H: at position 2 -> new letter.
- O: at position 3 -> we know it's correct? So it should be marked as correct? But we are guessing it? It will be correct.
- Y: at position 4 -> new letter.
- U: at position 5 -> new letter.

If the secret word has S at position 1, then we will get S(✓), O(✓), and then we get information about H, Y, U.

If the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 1 in our guess will be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we get S absent, then we know S is not at 1, so it must be at 2? And then we also get that H, Y, U are not in the word? Or present? 

But it will be messy? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn't find one? 

Another word for case 2: ""psued"" -> P, S, U, E, D -> E absent? Not allowed.

""usher"": U, S, H, E, R -> E and R absent? Not allowed.

""ashen"": A, S, H, E, N -> A, E, N absent? Not allowed.

So I think ""shoyu"" is the best bet.

But note: we have not used many common letters? We have D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z left? But we are using H, Y, U.

H, Y, U are not the most common? But we have to use some.

Another word for case 1: ""shoed"" -> not allowed because of E.

""shoad"" -> not a word? 

""shogi"": S, H, O, G, I -> I absent? Not allowed.

""shoyu"" seems acceptable.

So I choose ""shoyu"".

But let me check if there's a word with S at 1 and more common letters? Like ""showy"" but we used W? W is absent? From guess 3: W is absent? Yes, from ""blows"" feedback: W(x).

So W is absent? So we cannot use W.

Similarly, in ""shoyu"", we are not using W.

So ""shoyu"" is S H O Y U.

Yes.

So fourth guess: ""shoyu""

<guess>shoyu</guess> 

But note: ""shoyu"" is 5 letters? S-H-O-Y-U -> 5 letters.

So we'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x).  
  → **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: moist**  
  Feedback: M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x).  
  → **Absent letters**: M, I, T (added to the list).  
  → **Present letters**: O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.

- **Guess 3: blows**  
  Feedback: B(x), L(x), O(✓), W(x), S(-).  
  → **Absent letters**: B, L, W (added to the list).  
  → **Correct position**: O is in position 3 (✓).  
  → **Present letter**: S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 5).

### Current Knowledge
- **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W (11 letters).  
- **Present letters (must be in the word)**: O, S.  
- **Correct position**: O is fixed at **position 3**.  
- **Constraints for S**:  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2).  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3).  
  - Since position 3 is occupied by O, S must be in **position 1 or 2**.  
- **Remaining letter pool**: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (13 letters).  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 3 is fixed as **O**.  
  - Positions 1 and 2: One must be S, the other is a new letter.  
  - Positions 4 and 5: Two new letters from the remaining pool.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Test the position of S (position 1 vs. 2) while maximizing new letter coverage.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Assume S is in position 1 (since position 2 is harder to validate with common words).  
  - Use a word starting with S, with O in position 3, and new letters in positions 2, 4, and 5.  
  - Avoid repeated letters and absent letters.  
- **Chosen word**: **""SHOYU""** (a valid English word for a type of soy sauce).  
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is here).  
  - O in position 3 (known correct).  
  - New letters: H (position 2), Y (position 4), U (position 5).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests S at position 1: If correct, we lock S. If absent, S must be in position 2.  
  - Tests 3 new high-frequency letters (H, Y, U).  
  - Complies with all constraints (no absent letters, O at position 3, S not in positions 4/5).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist</></think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:
- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- All letters are new and untested
- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters

This guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.

We can use letters from the English alphabet excluding C, R, A, N, E.\n\n The English alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n Excluding C, R, A, N, E -> we have: B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z\n\n Now, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.\n\n Common vowels that are left: O, I, U (but I and U are less common). Also, we have Y which can be a vowel.\n\n Common consonants that are left: S, T, L, P, M, D, G, B, etc.\n\n We should try to use as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after removing C, R, A, N, E) might be:\n S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n A good second guess should avoid the letters we know are absent (C,R,A,N,E) and should introduce new common letters.\n\n Let\'s recall that the word has 5 letters and we have to form a valid English word.\n\n Possible words: How about ""SPLIT""? It uses S, P, L, I, T -> all new letters. Let me check: S, P, L, I, T are not in the excluded set.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters but they are less common. Since we don\'t have any information about the word, we should avoid assuming duplicates for now.\n\n Another option: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This is a common starting word in some contexts.\n\n Or ""BUILD""? But B is available, and U, I, L, D. But B is not excluded so we can use it? Actually, B is in the allowed set.\n\n However, let me choose a word that has more common letters. Another candidate: ""TOILS"" -> but that has O and I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but U and O are vowels we haven\'t tested.\n\n Since we don\'t know any letters, we must use entirely new letters. We should try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.\n\n Consider the word ""OUIJA"" but that is not five-letter? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5? Wait, Ouija is a brand name and might not be in the word list. We should stick to common words.\n\n Another idea: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S.\n\n But note: we are excluding E, A, so the vowels we have are O, I, U. And consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.\n\n Let me search for a word that uses S, T, L, O, M or similar.\n\n Common words: ""MOIST"", ""GHOST"", ""PILOT"", ""BUILT"", ""STOMP"", etc.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice? Let me check: M, O, I, S, T.\n\n But note: We haven\'t tested many consonants like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So we can pick any.\n\n Alternatively, to maximize coverage, we should pick a word with all new letters and with common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""LUMPS"" -> but L, U, M, P, S. That covers L, U, M, P, S.\n\n But ""MOIST"" is more standard. However, I note that we haven\'t used L or M or P or S or T in the first guess? Actually, ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, so no overlap.\n\n Since no letters are in the word, we are free.\n\n I will go with ""MOIST"" because it has two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T) that are very common.\n\n So, guess: ""MOIST""\n\n But let me confirm: M, O, I, S, T are not in the excluded set?

Actually, the problem is asking for the next guess (which would be the third guess) because it says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then lists:\n\n Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n Guess 2: moist\n\n But the feedback for ""moist"" is not provided. So we are to make the third guess.\n\n However, looking at the user\'s input: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", it seems that the user intended to guess ""moist"" but then the feedback is missing. The problem says: ""Here is some previous feedback"" and then lists two guesses, but only the first has feedback.\n\n This is confusing. Let me re-read the user input:\n\n ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous feedback: \n Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n Guess 2: moist""\n\n It does not provide feedback for ""moist"". So we cannot proceed without that feedback.\n\n But note: the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and then gives the previous feedback including the first guess and the second guess (without feedback). This seems like an error.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to provide the feedback for that? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are to make the next guess (the third one).\n\n However, without feedback for the second guess, we cannot make an informed third guess.\n\n Let me check the example in the initial instructions: the example had feedback for each guess.\n\n Therefore, I think there might be a misunderstanding. The user input says ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback. But in the context, the user might be providing the second guess and then we are to generate the feedback? But the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", meaning we are the player and we are to guess.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the second guess was ""moist"" and now we are to make the third guess, but we don\'t have the feedback for ""moist"". That is a problem.\n\n Since the problem states: ""Here is some previous feedback"", and it only provided feedback for guess 1, then we must assume that the feedback for guess 2 is not available? But that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another possibility: the user input is truncated. The user input says: ""Guess 2: moist</>"", and then the assistant started to write a thought process. But the assistant\'s response was cut off.\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to provide the feedback for the second guess but it was not included. Therefore, we cannot proceed without that feedback.\n\n However, looking at the history:\n\n First guess: crane -> all letters wrong (C, R, A, N, E are absent)\n Second guess: moist (we don\'t know the feedback)\n\n But the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then lists the two guesses without feedback for the second.\n\n This is inconsistent. I think we must ask for clarification, but since we are to return a guess, we have to make an assumption.\n\n Alternatively, note that the user input for the second guess was ""moist"" and then the assistant started to write a thought process that included:\n\n ""After considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because: ...""\n\n and then the assistant returned <guess>moist</guess> in the first response? But that was for the first guess? No, the first guess was ""crane"".\n\n Actually, the first response was:\n\n <guess>crane</guess>\n\n Then the user provided feedback for crane (all x) and then said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then listed the first guess and its feedback and then said ""Guess 2: moist"" without feedback.\n\n So I think the user is providing the second guess as ""moist"", but we are the one who is supposed to make the guesses? \n\n Clarification: In the game, the assistant is the one making the guesses. The user is providing the feedback.\n\n In the first round, the assistant guessed ""crane"", and the user provided feedback: all x.\n\n Then the user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning we (the assistant) should make the second guess.\n\n But then the user also says: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 2: moist""\n\n This is confusing because we (the assistant) haven\'t made the second guess yet. The user is providing the second guess? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing the entire history, including the second guess that we made? But we didn\'t make a second guess in the first response? We only made the first guess.\n\n I think there is a misunderstanding in the flow.\n\n Let me re-express the intended flow:\n\n - We (the assistant) make a guess (first guess) and return it in <guess> tags.\n - The user then provides feedback for that guess and asks for the next guess, providing the history including the first guess and its feedback.\n - Then we make the second guess, and so on.\n\n In the first response, we made the first guess: ""crane"".\n\n Then the user responded with: \n   ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n    Here is some previous feedback: \n    Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)""\n\n And then the user also included ""Guess 2: moist"" but without feedback? Why?\n\n It seems the user is trying to provide the second guess? But we are the ones who are supposed to provide the second guess.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing an example of what the second guess might be? But that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the user intended to say that we have already made two guesses: the first was ""crane"" (with feedback all x) and the second was ""moist"" (with feedback not provided). But that is not the case because we only made one guess.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess as a hint? But the problem says we are to make the guesses.\n\n I think the best course is to ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part because it doesn\'t have feedback and we didn\'t make that guess. We are to make the second guess now.\n\n Therefore, we are at the second guess. We know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We need to choose a word that avoids these letters.\n\n Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\n A good second guess might be: ""sulky"" or ""pouty"", but let\'s choose one that has common letters.\n\n Another popular choice is ""pilot"", but note we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. ""pilot"" uses P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.\n\n But let me check: \n   P: allowed\n   I: allowed\n   L: allowed\n   O: allowed\n   T: allowed\n\n ""pilot"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""moist"" is also a good choice (as the user suggested) but we are making the second guess now.\n\n However, the user already wrote ""Guess 2: moist"", so perhaps they expect us to use that? But we are the ones guessing.\n\n Since the user mentioned ""moist"", maybe they are providing feedback for the second guess? But they didn\'t provide the feedback symbols.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will make a second guess that is a valid word without the forbidden letters.\n\n I choose ""pilot"" because it uses common letters and is a good test.\n\n But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we guess something else, it might be inconsistent.\n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to say that they have already made the second guess as ""moist"" and now we are to make the third? But without feedback for ""moist"", we cannot.\n\n I think the safest is to assume that the user is providing the history including the second guess and its feedback is missing, so we cannot proceed.\n\n However, since the problem requires us to make a new guess, I will assume that the second guess has not been made and we are to make the second guess.\n\n Therefore, I will ignore the ""Guess 2: moist"" part and make the second guess.\n\n Let\'s choose ""pilot"".\n\n But note: the user input says ""Guess 2: moist"", so if we are to be consistent, perhaps we should use ""moist"" as the second guess? But then we don\'t have feedback for it.\n\n Alternatively, the user might be providing the second guess that we are to use? But then why ask us to make a new guess?\n\n I think there is a mistake in the user input. I will proceed to make the second guess with a word that avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n I choose ""pilot"".\n\n<guess>pilot</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I know the secret word contains none of these letters. This eliminates many common letters, so I need a new guess that avoids them entirely.\n\nFor my second guess, I\'ll choose **""pilot""** because:\n- It uses entirely new letters (P, I, L, O, T) not tested in the first guess.\n- It includes common vowels (I, O) and consonants (P, L, T).\n- ""Pilot"" is a valid English word with no repeating letters.\n\nThis guess maximizes new information by testing five untested letters at once.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist</></think>\nBased on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.

Let\'s note: ""moist"" is M O I S T, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).\n  So O is in the word but not at position 2, and S is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nAdditionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nLetters that are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nLetters that are present: O and S.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain the letters from the absent list: so we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nThe word must contain O and S, and the other three letters are from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe are left with three positions to fill (since O and S are in the word but we don\'t know the positions).\n\nWe are to make the third guess.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Contains O and S (to confirm their positions)\n- Includes three new letters from the remaining set to test more letters.\n- The positions of O and S should not be position 2 and 4 (because they were wrongly positioned there in ""moist""). However, note: O was in position 2 and was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback says it\'s in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, S is not in position 4.\n\nSo we must place O and S in positions that are not 2 and not 4 respectively? Actually, O can be in any position except 2? And S can be in any position except 4? But note: the word might have multiple of the same letter? But in this case, only one O and one S are present because in ""moist"" there was one of each and they were marked as present. However, we don\'t know if there are duplicates, but since we have no information on duplicates, we assume one occurrence.\n\nWe must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.\n\nSo the letter bank is: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nOptions: \nWe can form a word with O and S and three new letters.\n\nLet me consider common words that contain O and S and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nExamples: \n- ""socks"" -> but has S twice and O? Also, S is repeated? We don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. Also, K is allowed, but let\'s see: S O C K S -> but C is forbidden? Wait C is in the forbidden list? Yes, from first guess.\n\nSo ""socks"" is invalid because C is forbidden and also it has two S and we don\'t know if we need two S.\n\nAlternatively, ""shows"": S, H, O, W, S? But again two S. And H, O, W are allowed? But two S might be problematic? Also, the word has 5 letters? ""shows"" has two S\'s? Yes, S twice. It might be acceptable if the word has two S, but we don\'t know.\n\nWe want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information.\n\nSo let\'s look for words that have O and S exactly once and three other distinct letters.\n\nPossible: ""songs"" -> repeated S? ""songs"" has two S? Actually, ""songs"" is S-O-N-G-S -> two S? Wait: it has two S? Yes, but also N and G: N is not allowed (from first guess? yes, absent) so forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""focus"" -> but F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.\n\n""post"" -> but 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n""pools"" -> repeated O? And L, S -> L is allowed? But O is repeated? We already know O is present, but we don\'t know if there are two O.\n\nTo avoid complications, aim for no repeated letters.\n\nPossible words: \n""shock"" -> S, H, O, C, K -> C is forbidden? Yes.\n\n""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> L, U, Y are new? But note: L is allowed? And U and Y? So ""lousy"": L O U S Y\n\nCheck for forbidden letters: L, O, U, S, Y -> none forbidden? O and S are present, L, U, Y are new? Also, O and S are not in their previous positions? O is at position 2? But in ""lousy"" O is at position 2? That would be the same position as in ""moist"" which was position 2? But feedback said O was present but not in position 2. So we cannot put O at position 2 again? So ""lousy"" positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:Y -> O at position 2 and S at position 4? Exactly the positions that were wrong in the previous guess? So these positions are invalid? We know O cannot be at position 2? And S cannot be at position 4? So this word would have O and S in the same positions? Avoid that.\n\nHow about ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> N is forbidden? Yes from first guess.\n\n""softs"": repeated S? And F, O, T? -> T is forbidden? Yes from second guess.\n\n""soggy"": repeated G? Also G and Y -> G is allowed? But repeated G? Avoid.\n\n""goods"": repeated O? and D, S? -> O repeated? Not good.\n\nLet me think of words with O and S and avoiding the forbidden positions.\n\nHow about putting S at the beginning? Then O not at position 2.\n\nWord: ""skimp"" -> but K, I, M, P? I and M are forbidden? (from second guess)\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: ""sling"" -> S, L, I, N, G -> I and N forbidden? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""slope"": S, L, O, P, E -> E is forbidden? Yes from first guess.\n\nNo.\n\n""spoke"": S, P, O, K, E -> E forbidden? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> I forbidden? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""could"" -> C forbidden? and O, U, L, D? C forbidden? Yes.\n\nWe are having trouble.\n\nConsider placing O and S in new positions.\n\nPossible positions for O: not 2 (since in second guess it was at position 2 and was wrong). So O can be at 1,3,4,5? But 1: M was forbidden? So O might be at 1? 3? 4? 5?\n\nSimilarly, S cannot be at position 4 (from second guess). So S can be at positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe need a word that has O and S, both not at the positions: O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nAnd letters from the allowed set (without the forbidden ones).\n\nLet me systematically look for words that contain S and O and three other distinct letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- S at 1 and O at 3: e.g., S_O_E? But E forbidden? No words with E.\n\nS_O: _ _ _ pattern? How about ""swoop"" -> repeated O and then P? But also W and P? But repeated O: so only one O? We don\'t know.\n\nBetter avoid repeated letters.\n\nWord: ""showy"": S, H, O, W, Y -> positions: S at 1, O at 3? Then H, W, Y.\n\nWe can try: ""SHOWY"": \n- S at 1, O at 3 -> S position is 1? Previously we haven\'t tested S at 1. O at 3 (not tested at 3 before? Only at 2). So valid? And the word has no forbidden letters? S, H, O, W, Y -> H, W, Y are new. No forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nAnd O is not at 2? O is at 3? Okay.\nS not at 4? Actually, position 4 is W? S is at 1? So S is not at 4? Correct.\n\nSo ""showy"" is S H O W Y -> valid word? I think ""showy"" is an adjective meaning ostentatious? But let me confirm validity.\n\nAlternatively, safer words: \n""howfs"" -> not common? Also repeated F? Unlikely.\n\n""lousy"" we thought but O at 2 and S at 4: not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""bousy"" -> I don\'t know if valid.\n\nLet me think of standard words: \n""hongs"" -> H, O, N, G, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.\n\n""donsy"" -> D, O, N, S, Y -> N forbidden? No.\n\n""pouls"" -> not common? Also P, O, U, L, S? But S at the end? Positions: P(O)U(L)S? S at 5.\n\nIf we have S at 5 and O at 2? But O cannot be at 2? So O must be moved.\n\nWord: ""pouls"" might be invalid.\n\n""youse"" -> E forbidden? and Y, O, U, S -> E? No.\n\n""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> positions: B (1), O (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). But O is at position 2? Which is not allowed? Because the O was at position 2 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""bosky"" has O at 2? Not allowed? Therefore, avoid.\n\nAlternatively, ""jocks"" -> J, O, C, K, S -> C forbidden? No.\n\n""foxes"": F, O, X, E, S -> E forbidden? No.\n\nSo after some struggle, I found ""showy""?\n\nBut also, ""dowly"" -> not common? Another: ""gowds"" -> not common? So ""showy"" might be acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""solus"" -> repeated S? and L, U? Positions: S O L U S -> repeated S? Avoid.\n\n""sojus"" -> same.\n\n""vocus"" -> C forbidden? No.\n\nTherefore, I will choose ""showy"".\n\nBut let me double-check the letters: S, H, O, W, Y. \n- None are forbidden? Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. So H, W, Y are new? Yes.\n\nThe word ""showy"" is valid? Yes, meaning ostentatious.\n\nNow, positions: \nPosition 1: S -> we are testing S at position 1.\nPosition 2: H -> new letter\nPosition 3: O -> O is tested at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong. So this is a new position.\nPosition 4: W -> new letter\nPosition 5: Y -> new letter\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nIf we cannot find ""showy"", another option is ""blows"": but L, O, W, S? And B? Positions: B L O W S -> O at position 3? S at position 5? Then O: not at 2? S: not at 4? But ""blows"" has B, L, O, W, S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have forbidden letters? B, L, O, W, S -> O and S are present? Yes, and B, L, W are new? Valid word? Yes.\n\nCheck positions: O at 3 (not 2) and S at 5 (not 4) -> acceptable.\n\n""blows"" is a valid word? Meaning it is the plural of blow? Or verb third person singular? But as a noun? It can be used? Should be valid.\n\nOr ""gowns"": G, O, W, N, S -> N forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo between ""showy"" and ""blows"", both are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll choose ""blows"" because it has more common letters? I like ""blows"".\n\nBut let me make sure: we are testing B, L, W with this? Also, if O is at 3 and S at 5, we get information on those positions.\n\nWe might also consider ""fowls"": F, O, W, L, S -> same as ""blows"" but with F? Also acceptable? But to choose one.\n\nAnother: ""yowls"": similarly.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""blows"".\n\nAlternative: ""prows"": P, R, O, W, S -> R forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo ""blows"" is good.\n\nWait, note: in the first guess, we have R forbidden? But ""blows"" has R? No: B L O W S -> R is not in the word? So it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""blows"".\n\nBut note: we have tested O at position 1 and 2? Not? Only at 2. Now at 3? And S: we tested at position 4? Now at 5? So new positions.\n\nSo we guess ""blows"".\n\nAlternatively, if the word has O somewhere else? This might help.\n\nI think ""blows"" is a good choice.\n\n<guess>blows</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2: moist** → M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:\n  - O is present but not in position 2.\n  - S is present but not in position 4.\n  - M, I, T are absent.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (cannot be in the word).\n- **Present letters**: O, S (must be included, but not at previous positions).\n- **Remaining letter pool**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Position constraints**: \n  - O cannot be at position 2.\n  - S cannot be at position 4.\n\nFor Guess 3, I need a word that:\n1. Includes O and S exactly once (since duplicates are unconfirmed).\n2. Avoids repeated letters and all absent letters.\n3. Places O not at position 2 and S not at position 4.\n4. Tests new high-frequency letters from the pool.\n\n### Word Selection:\nAfter evaluating options, **""blows""** is chosen:\n- **Letters**: B, L, O, W, S.\n  - O is at position 3 (not 2).\n  - S is at position 5 (not 4).\n  - New letters tested: B, L, W (all distinct and unexplored).\n- **Validity**: ""Blows"" is a valid English word (e.g., plural of ""blow"" meaning ""sudden hits"" or ""blossoms"" in botany).\n- **Information gain**: This guess tests 3 new letters and confirms positions for O and S efficiently.\n\n<guess>blows</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist</></think>\nBased on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, my next guess must avoid these letters entirely. I need a new word using common letters from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nAfter considering several options, I choose ""MOIST"" because:\n- It contains common consonants (M, S, T) and vowels (O, I)\n- All letters are new and untested\n- It follows the pattern of avoiding known absent letters\n- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word with no repeated letters\n\nThis guess will help test multiple high-frequency letters simultaneously, providing valuable new information regardless of the feedback.\n\n<guess>moist -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 3: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 4: blows -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  => Absent: C, R, A, N, E\nGuess 2: moist -> M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)  => Absent: M, I, T; Present: O and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)\nGuess 3: blows -> B(x) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(-)  => Absent: B, L, W; Correct: O in position 3; Present: S (but not in position 5)\n\nNow, from the feedback:\n\n- The secret word has the letter \'O\' in the third position (position 3 is fixed as \'O\').\n- The letter \'S\' is present but not in position 5 (from ""blows"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist""). So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 3 is taken by O).\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. S is present but cannot be in 4 or 5. So S must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nAdditionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, B, L, W.\n\nSo the absent letters are: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, W.\n\nTherefore, the remaining letters (from the alphabet) that are possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we also have S and O (O is fixed at position 3, and S is present and must be in position 1 or 2).\n\nSo the word has:\n- Position 3: O\n- S in position 1 or 2\n- The other three positions (the remaining two of 1,2 and 4,5) must be filled with three distinct letters from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) and also not including any absent letters.\n\nWe have two cases:\n\nCase 1: S at position 1\nThen the word is: S _ O _ _\nWe need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.\n\nCase 2: S at position 2\nThen the word is: _ S O _ _\nWe need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with three distinct letters from the pool.\n\nWe also note that in the third guess, we had S at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. Similarly, in the second guess, S was at position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position (S(-)), so S is not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at 1 or 2.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.\n\nWe have a fixed O at position 3, so we can build around that.\n\nWe also know that we have not tested: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that has S at position 1 and then two new letters in the other positions? But we have to fill three positions (if S is at 1, then positions 2,4,5) with three new letters.\n\nSimilarly for S at 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know which case, so we might want to test both possibilities? Or choose a word that will help us determine the position of S.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 or 2 and then new letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nFirst, if S is at 1: word pattern: S _ O _ _\n\nPossible words: \n- S H O P ? -> P is allowed? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:P, 5:? -> but we need a fifth letter? ""shop"" is 4 letters? So 5-letter words: ""shops"" -> but S repeated? Not good because we don\'t know if S is repeated? We have only one S so far? But we don\'t know. We have only been told one S? Actually, we don\'t know if there are two S. But to be safe, avoid repeated letters to maximize information.\n\nSo avoid words with repeated letters.\n\nPossible 5-letter words starting with S and having O at position 3: \n- S C O R E -> but C, R, E are absent? Not allowed.\n- S H O O T -> repeated O? and T absent? Not allowed.\n- S P O O K -> repeated O? and K? But O repeated? Avoid.\n- S N O O P -> repeated O? and N absent? Not allowed.\n\nWe need words without repeated letters and without absent letters.\n\nSo: S _ O _ _ with the middle and last two from D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor example: \n- S H O P ? -> not 5 letters? \n- ""shoed"": S H O E D -> E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""shone"": S H O N E -> N and E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""shout"": S H O U T -> T absent? Not allowed.\n- ""shoyu"": S H O Y U -> H, Y, U? But ""shoyu"" is a word? (a type of sauce) -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:Y, 5:U. \n  Letters: S, H, O, Y, U -> H, Y, U are new? And no absent letters? \n  But we have H? We haven\'t tested H? Yes. \n  So ""shoyu"" is a valid word? I think so.\n\nBut let me check: shoyu is a Japanese soy sauce? Accepted in English? Yes.\n\nSo that\'s one possibility.\n\nAnother: ""spode"": S P O D E -> E absent? Not allowed.\n\n""spoke"": S P O K E -> E absent? Not allowed.\n\n""spoof"": S P O O F -> repeated O? Avoid.\n\n""stood"": S T O O D -> T absent? and repeated O? Not allowed.\n\nSo ""shoyu"" is a candidate? But note: we are not sure if S is at position 1? We are just forming a word for case 1.\n\nBut we are to make a guess that might help us determine the position of S? Or we can choose a word that has S at position 1 and then we test it.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: S at position 2: _ S O _ _\n\nPossible words: \n- A S O K ? -> A absent? Not allowed.\n- U S O U ? -> repeated U? Avoid.\n- P S Y O P -> but O is at position 4? We need O at 3? So pattern: _ S O _ _ -> so position 3 is O? So the word must have O at 3? So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, position 4: ?, position 5: ?\n\nFor example: \n- ""psori"" -> not a word? \n- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""isole"" -> I and E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""above"": A, B, O, V, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""adobe"": A, D, O, B, E -> A, B, E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""dsobo"" -> not a word.\n\nAnother: ""joked"": J, O, K, E, D -> but O is at position 2? We need O at 3? So not.\n\nWe need position 2 to be S and 3 to be O.\n\nSo: \n- ""asoka"" -> A absent? Not allowed.\n- ""usurp"": U, S, U, R, P -> repeated U? and R absent? Not allowed.\n- ""psion"": P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.\n- ""ksour"": K, S, O, U, R -> R absent? Not allowed.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word for case 2.\n\nAnother: ""gsols"" -> not a word? \n\n""dso"" words? \n\n""dsomo"" -> not a word.\n\n""psora"" -> P, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.\n\nSo case 2 is difficult? Maybe S is at position 1? \n\nTherefore, we might assume S is at position 1? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 1 to test that case? And use new letters.\n\nSo I propose ""shoyu"": S at 1, O at 3, and H, Y, U as new letters.\n\nBut note: in ""shoyu"", S is at 1? We haven\'t tested S at 1? So we can test it.\n\nIf we get feedback that S is correct at position 1, then we know. If not, then S must be at position 2? But if S is at 1 and we get it as present but wrong position? That would be impossible? Because if S is at 1 and we put it at 1, it should be correct? Or if the word has S at 1, then it should be marked correct? \n\nBut if the word has S at 1, then our guess ""shoyu"" would have S at 1 and if it is correct, we get S(✓). If the word does not have S at 1, then S might be at 2? But we have S in the word? So if we get S as present but not at 1? Then it must be at 2? Because we know S is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are available? \n\nBut note: if we guess ""shoyu"", and the word has S at 2, then the S in position 1 would be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we put S at 1 and it is not in the word at 1, but the word has S at 2, then the feedback for S at 1 would be absent? But that would be a problem because we know S is in the word? \n\nActually, the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is marked as present (-), and if it is in the correct position, it is marked as correct (✓). If the letter is not in the word, it is absent (x).\n\nBut if we put S at position 1 and the word has S at position 2, then the feedback for S at position 1 would be absent? Because it is not in the correct position and the occurrence of S at position 1 is not in the word? But the word has S at position 2? So the feedback should mark the S at position 1 as absent? And then separately, we don\'t have S at position 2 in our guess? So we wouldn\'t know? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nActually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For ""shoyu"", we have S at position 1. If the secret word has S at position 2, then the S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? But the secret word has an S at position 2? So the feedback for the S at position 1 would be absent (x) because it\'s not in the word? But that would be incorrect because the letter S is in the word? \n\nNo: the feedback for a letter in the guess: if the letter is in the secret word but not at that position, it is marked as present (-). But if the secret word has only one S and it is at position 2, then when we put S at position 1, that S is not in the secret word at all? Because the S in the secret word is at position 2? So it would be marked as absent? But that would be inconsistent because we know S is in the word? \n\nActually, no: the feedback is per letter in the guess. The S at position 1 in the guess is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has S at position 2? So it is absent? But then how do we know there is an S? We wouldn\'t? \n\nBut we already know from previous feedback that S is in the word? So if we get S absent in this guess, it would contradict? \n\nThis is a problem.\n\nTo avoid this, we should not put S in a position that we know might be wrong? But we have to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn\'t find one? \n\nAnother idea: choose a word that has S at position 1 and also includes letters that might help us if S is not at 1? But it\'s tricky.\n\nWe can choose a word that does not have S at position 1 or 2? But we know S must be at 1 or 2? So if we put S at a different position, it would be wrong? And we would get absent? But that doesn\'t help.\n\nSo we have to put S at either 1 or 2.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s try to find a word for case 2 (S at position 2).\n\nPossible words: \n- ""psora"" -> invalid because of R and A.\n- ""ksora"" -> K, S, O, R, A -> R and A absent? Not allowed.\n- ""gsols"" -> not a word? \n- ""usole"" -> U, S, O, L, E -> L and E absent? Not allowed.\n- ""isold"" -> I, S, O, L, D -> I and L absent? Not allowed.\n- ""psion"" -> P, S, I, O, N -> I and N absent? Not allowed.\n\nWhat about ""dsobo""? Not a word.\n\n""bosky"" -> B, O, S, K, Y -> B absent? Not allowed.\n\n""cosy"" -> too short.\n\n""dusky"": D, U, S, K, Y -> but S is at position 3? We need S at position 2? ""dusky"" is D U S K Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> so S at 3? But position 3 is fixed as O? So not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O? So the word must have O at 3.\n\nSo for case 2: position 2 is S, position 3 is O.\n\nSo the word is: ? S O ? ?\n\nWith the first and last two letters from the pool.\n\nLet me try: \n- ""psoda"" -> P, S, O, D, A -> A absent? Not allowed.\n- ""usoop"" -> not a word.\n- ""gsodh"" -> not a word.\n- ""jsodh"" -> not a word.\n\n""psoas"": P, S, O, A, S -> A absent? and repeated S? Not allowed.\n\n""kshat"" -> K, S, H, A, T -> A and T absent? Not allowed.\n\nIt\'s very hard. Maybe there are no common words with S at 2 and O at 3 and using only the allowed letters.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that S is at position 1.\n\nSo I will go with ""shoyu"" for the fourth guess.\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: S, H, O, Y, U.\n\n- S: at position 1 -> we are testing if S is at 1.\n- H: at position 2 -> new letter.\n- O: at position 3 -> we know it\'s correct? So it should be marked as correct? But we are guessing it? It will be correct.\n- Y: at position 4 -> new letter.\n- U: at position 5 -> new letter.\n\nIf the secret word has S at position 1, then we will get S(✓), O(✓), and then we get information about H, Y, U.\n\nIf the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 1 in our guess will be absent? But we know S is in the word? So if we get S absent, then we know S is not at 1, so it must be at 2? And then we also get that H, Y, U are not in the word? Or present? \n\nBut it will be messy? But we have to try.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 2? But we couldn\'t find one? \n\nAnother word for case 2: ""psued"" -> P, S, U, E, D -> E absent? Not allowed.\n\n""usher"": U, S, H, E, R -> E and R absent? Not allowed.\n\n""ashen"": A, S, H, E, N -> A, E, N absent? Not allowed.\n\nSo I think ""shoyu"" is the best bet.\n\nBut note: we have not used many common letters? We have D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z left? But we are using H, Y, U.\n\nH, Y, U are not the most common? But we have to use some.\n\nAnother word for case 1: ""shoed"" -> not allowed because of E.\n\n""shoad"" -> not a word? \n\n""shogi"": S, H, O, G, I -> I absent? Not allowed.\n\n""shoyu"" seems acceptable.\n\nSo I choose ""shoyu"".\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word with S at 1 and more common letters? Like ""showy"" but we used W? W is absent? From guess 3: W is absent? Yes, from ""blows"" feedback: W(x).\n\nSo W is absent?

We are given the feedback for the fifth guess ""shoyu"": S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) Y(x) U(x)

This means:
- S is correct and in the right position (position 1)
- H is correct and in the right position (position 2)
- O is correct and in the right position (position 3) [which we already knew]
- Y is absent (x) -> not in the word
- U is absent (x) -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with ""SHO"" (positions 1,2,3: S, H, O)
- The remaining positions are 4 and 5, which must be filled with two letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters so far: from previous guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, B, L, W, Y, U (and now Y and U are added)

So absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, U, W, Y.

Remaining possible letters: D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""SHO"" and ends with two letters from the remaining pool.

The word is: S H O _ _

We need to choose two letters for positions 4 and 5 from D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible, but we only have two positions left, so we can test two new letters.

Common words that start with ""SHO"":
- ""SHOWY"" -> but Y is absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOWN"" -> N absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOAL"" -> A and L absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHORE"" -> R and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHORT"" -> R and T absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOUT"" -> U and T absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOOK"" -> K? But O repeated? ""SHOOK"" has two O's? S-H-O-O-K -> so position 4 is O? But we don't have O in position 4? We only have one O? But we don't know if there is a second O? However, in our feedback, we have only one O marked as correct? But we haven't tested a second O.

But note: in the word ""SHOOK"", there are two O's. We don't know if the secret word has two O's? But we have no evidence of a second O? So it might be possible? But we have to avoid absent letters? K is allowed? But O is already present? We don't know if it appears twice.

But to be safe, we can try to avoid repeating letters? But we have only two positions, so we can use two new letters.

Possible words:
- ""SHOP"" -> 4 letters? Not 5.
- ""SHOPS"" -> S repeated? And P? But S is already at position 1? So if we put S at position 5? But we know S is only at position 1? We don't know if there is a second S? But in previous feedback, we only have one S? So it might be possible? But ""SHOPS"" has two S's? S at 1 and S at 5? But we have S at 1 correct? So if we put S at 5, it might be present or absent? But we are trying to solve, so we can consider.

But let's list 5-letter words starting with ""SHO"" using the allowed letters.

Options:
- ""SHOED"" -> E and D? E absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOER"" -> E and R? Absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOGS"" -> G and S? S repeated? And G? ""SHOGS"": S H O G S -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:G, 5:S. So S repeated? And G is new? But we have to avoid absent letters? G is allowed? But S repeated? We don't know if the word has two S's? So it might be possible? But we are at the fifth guess? We have only one guess left? We have 6 tries? This is guess 5? So we have one more after this? But we want to solve.

But we can try to guess the word directly if possible.

Another word: ""SHOGI"" -> G and I? I absent? Not allowed.

""SHOTT"" -> T repeated? T absent? Not allowed.

""SHOWD"" -> W and D? W absent? Not allowed.

""SHOPE"" -> P and E? E absent? Not allowed.

""SHOJO"" -> J and O? O repeated? ""SHOJO"": S H O J O -> O at position 3 and 5? So two O's? And J? J is allowed? But O repeated? We don't know if there is a second O.

But let's see the feedback: in guess 2, we had O at position 2 and it was present? But now we have O at position 3 correct? So if there is a second O, it would have been revealed? But in guess 2, we had only one O? And it was marked as present? But not at position 2? Then in guess 3, we had O at position 3 and it was correct? So if there were a second O, it might have been marked in some guess? But in guess 3, we had only one O? And it was correct? So we don't have information about a second O? It might be present or not.

Similarly, for S: we have S at position 1 correct? But we don't know if there is a second S.

To maximize the chance, we should avoid repeating letters if possible? But we have limited options.

Another word: ""SHOOT"" -> O repeated and T absent? Not allowed.

""SHORN"" -> R and N absent? Not allowed.

""SHIVA"" -> I and A absent? Not allowed.

""SHIVE"" -> I and E absent? Not allowed.

""SHOOT"" not allowed.

""SHOED"" not allowed.

What about ""SHADY""? But A absent? Not allowed.

We need to use the remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""SHOGS"" -> S repeated? But let's see: if we allow it, then G and S? But S at position 5? We don't know if it's present? But we have S at 1? So if the word has only one S, then S at 5 would be absent? But we are testing.

But ""SHOGS"" is a word? Meaning: a plural of shog? Not common.

""SHOTT"" not allowed.

""SHOPP"" -> not a word? 

""SHOP"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""SHOJI"" -> J and I? I absent? Not allowed.

""SHOLA"" -> O? But position 3 is O? ""SHOLA"": S H O L A -> L and A absent? Not allowed.

""SHORL"" -> R and L absent? Not allowed.

""SHOTT"" not allowed.

""SHOW"" is 3 letters.

Perhaps ""SHOOT"" is not allowed.

What about ""SHOOK""? K is allowed? But O repeated? ""SHOOK"": S H O O K -> positions 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:O, 5:K. But we have O at position 3? So position 4 is a second O? And K at 5.

K is allowed? And O is not in the absent list? But we don't know if there is a second O.

But ""SHOOK"" is a valid word? Yes, past tense of shake.

Similarly, ""SHOAL"" not allowed.

Another: ""SHOTE"" -> T and E absent? Not allowed.

""SHOTT"" not allowed.

""SHOOT"" not allowed because of T.

But T is absent? Yes.

Perhaps we can use ""SHOWF"" -> not a word.

I think ""SHOGS"" or ""SHOOK"" are possibilities? But let's see if there is a word without repeating letters.

What about ""SHOP"" with a different ending? But 5 letters.

""SHOP"" is 4, so we need 5.

""SHOPT"" -> T absent? Not allowed.

""SHOPS"" -> S repeated? And P? ""SHOPS"": S H O P S -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:P, 5:S. So S repeated? P is allowed? 

""SHOPS"" is a valid word? Yes, plural of shop.

So we have two options: ""SHOOK"" and ""SHOPS"".

Both have repeated letters: ""SHOOK"" has two O's, ""SHOPS"" has two S's.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, is there a word with two distinct new letters?

For example, ""SHOGY"" -> G and Y? But Y is absent? Not allowed.

""SHOOT"" not allowed.

""SHOOT"" is out.

""SHOJO"" -> J and O? O repeated? And J? ""SHOJO"": S H O J O -> two O's? J is allowed? But O repeated.

But ""SHOJO"" is a word? In anime context? But might be accepted.

But still repeated O.

""SHIVS"" -> I and V? I absent? And S repeated? Not allowed.

""SHOOT"" not allowed.

Another: ""SHOOT"" is the only common one? But T absent.

Perhaps ""SHOOT"" is not possible.

What about ""SHODE"" -> D and E? E absent? Not allowed.

""SHOOT"" not allowed.

I think we have to go with either ""SHOOK"" or ""SHOPS"".

Let's see the remaining letters: we have D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

In ""SHOOK"", we use K? And O (repeated).

In ""SHOPS"", we use P? And S (repeated).

We can also consider ""SHOGS"" with G and S repeated.

But ""SHOGS"" is less common.

Another possibility: ""SHOVE"" -> V and E? E absent? Not allowed.

""SHOWN"" not allowed.

""SHOWY"" not allowed.

""SHOOT"" not allowed.

""SHOAL"" not allowed.

Perhaps ""SHOTT"" is not a word? 

I think ""SHOOK"" is the most common word among the options.

But let's check if there is a word like ""SHOOT"" but with allowed letters? No.

Another: ""SHOR"" not 5.

""SHORN"" not allowed.

""SHOTT"" is a word? I think not commonly used.

Perhaps we missed ""SHOED"" but E absent.

So I think we have to choose between ""SHOOK"" and ""SHOPS"".

Since we have S at position 1, and if we use ""SHOPS"", we are testing if there is a second S at position 5? And P at position 4.

Similarly, ""SHOOK"" tests if there is a second O at position 4 and K at 5.

We have no information about duplicates, so both are possible.

But to make a guess, I'll choose ""SHOOK"" because it is a very common word.

So sixth guess: ""SHOOK""

But we have one more guess after this? Guess 5 was ""shoyu"", so this is guess 6? The user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after guess 5 feedback, so this is guess 6.

We have 6 tries, so this is the last guess? Or we have one more? The game has 6 tries, so guess 6 is the last.

But we are not sure if ""SHOOK"" is correct? But we have to guess.

Perhaps there is a word without duplicates? Let's try to find.

What about ""SHOP"" with a letter? But 5 letters.

""SHOP"" is 4.

""SHIP"" not.

Another: ""SHOOT"" not.

""SHOTT"" not.

""SHOOT"" is the only common one? But T absent.

Perhaps ""SHOG"" not 5.

I think we have to go with ""SHOOK"".

But let's see the feedback: in guess 5, we have Y and U absent, so they are not in the word.

So the word is ""SHO"" + two letters from D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Now, what words are there?
- ""SHOD"" not 5.
- ""SHOG"" not 5.
- ""SHOP"" not 5.
- ""SHOT"" not 5 and T absent.
- ""SHOW"" not 5 and W absent.

5-letter words:
- ""SHOAL"" not allowed.
- ""SHOAT"" -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOCK"" -> C absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHONE"" -> N and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOOK"" -> possible? S H O O K -> with K allowed? But O repeated.
- ""SHOOS"" -> S repeated? And O repeated? ""SHOOS"": S H O O S -> two O's and two S's? Not good.
- ""SHOOT"" -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOPS"" -> S repeated? P allowed? ""SHOPS"": S H O P S -> two S's.
- ""SHORE"" not allowed.
- ""SHORN"" not allowed.
- ""SHORT"" not allowed.
- ""SHOTE"" not allowed.
- ""SHOTT"" not allowed.
- ""SHOUT"" not allowed.
- ""SHOVE"" not allowed.
- ""SHOWN"" not allowed.
- ""SHOWY"" not allowed.

""SHOGS"": S H O G S -> two S's? G allowed? ""SHOGS"" is a word? Yes, but rare.

""SHOJO"": S H O J O -> two O's? J allowed? Also rare.

""SHIVS"": not allowed.

""SHIRS"": I and R absent? Not allowed.

So the only common word is ""SHOOK"".

Therefore, I will guess ""SHOOK"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x).  
  → **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: moist**  
  Feedback: M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x).  
  → **Absent letters**: M, I, T (added to the list).  
  → **Present letters**: O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.

- **Guess 3: blows**  
  Feedback: B(x), L(x), O(✓), W(x), S(-).  
  → **Absent letters**: B, L, W (added to the list).  
  → **Correct position**: O is in position 3 (✓).  
  → **Present letter**: S is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 4: shoyu**  
  Feedback: S(✓), H(✓), O(✓), Y(x), U(x).  
  → **Correct positions**: S (position 1), H (position 2), O (position 3).  
  → **Absent letters**: Y, U (added to the list).  

### Current Knowledge
- **Absent letters (13 total)**: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, U, W, Y.  
- **Correctly placed letters**:  
  - Position 1: **S**  
  - Position 2: **H**  
  - Position 3: **O**  
- **Remaining positions**: 4 and 5.  
- **Remaining letter pool**: D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The secret word starts with **SHO** and ends with two letters from the remaining pool.  
  - No repeated letters (since duplicates haven't been indicated in feedback).  

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess)
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing plausible combinations for positions 4 and 5 using the remaining letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - The only common English word fitting the pattern **SHO__** with letters from the remaining pool is **""SHOOK""** (past tense of ""shake"").  
  - ""SHOOK"" uses **K** (a high-frequency letter) and tests for a potential second **O** (though no duplicates have been confirmed, it's a valid possibility).  
  - Alternatives like ""SHOPS"" (S repeated) or ""SHOGS"" (S repeated, rare word) are less optimal due to redundancy or obscurity.  
- **Why ""SHOOK""?**  
  - Complies with all constraints: Starts with **SHO**, uses allowed letters (K is untested), and is a valid solution.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on K and the second O will resolve the word with the last guess (though this is the final attempt).  

<guess>shook</guess>",shook,"We are given the feedback for the fifth guess ""shoyu"": S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) Y(x) U(x)

This means:
- S is correct and in the right position (position 1)
- H is correct and in the right position (position 2)
- O is correct and in the right position (position 3) [which we already knew]
- Y is absent (x) -> not in the word
- U is absent (x) -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with ""SHO"" (positions 1,2,3: S, H, O)
- The remaining positions are 4 and 5, which must be filled with two letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters so far: from previous guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, B, L, W, Y, U (and now Y and U are added)

So absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, U, W, Y.

Remaining possible letters: D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""SHO"" and ends with two letters from the remaining pool.

The word is: S H O _ _

We need to choose two letters for positions 4 and 5 from D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible, but we only have two positions left, so we can test two new letters.

I think ""SHOOK"" is the most common word among the options.

But let's check if there is a word like ""SHOOT"" but with allowed letters? No.

Another: ""SHOR"" not 5.

""SHORN"" not allowed.

""SHOTT"" is a word? I think not commonly used.

Perhaps we missed ""SHOED"" but E absent.

So I think we have to choose between ""SHOOK"" and ""SHOPS"".

Since we have S at position 1, and if we use ""SHOPS"", we are testing if there is a second S at position 5? And P at position 4.

Similarly, ""SHOOK"" tests if there is a second O at position 4 and K at 5.

We have no information about duplicates, so both are possible.

But to make a guess, I'll choose ""SHOOK"" because it is a very common word.

So sixth guess: ""SHOOK""

But we have one more guess after this? Guess 5 was ""shoyu"", so this is guess 6? The user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after guess 5 feedback, so this is guess 6.

We have 6 tries, so this is the last guess? Or we have one more? The game has 6 tries, so guess 6 is the last.

But we are not sure if ""SHOOK"" is correct? But we have to guess.

Perhaps there is a word without duplicates? Let's try to find.

What about ""SHOP"" with a letter? But 5 letters.

""SHOP"" is 4.

""SHIP"" not.

Another: ""SHOOT"" not.

""SHOTT"" not.

""SHOOT"" is the only common one? But T absent.

Perhaps ""SHOG"" not 5.

I think we have to go with ""SHOOK"".

But let's see the feedback: in guess 5, we have Y and U absent, so they are not in the word.

So the word is ""SHO"" + two letters from D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Now, what words are there?
- ""SHOD"" not 5.
- ""SHOG"" not 5.
- ""SHOP"" not 5.
- ""SHOT"" not 5 and T absent.
- ""SHOW"" not 5 and W absent.

5-letter words:
- ""SHOAL"" not allowed.
- ""SHOAT"" -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOCK"" -> C absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHONE"" -> N and E absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOOK"" -> possible? S H O O K -> with K allowed? But O repeated.
- ""SHOOS"" -> S repeated? And O repeated? ""SHOOS"": S H O O S -> two O's and two S's? Not good.
- ""SHOOT"" -> T absent? Not allowed.
- ""SHOPS"" -> S repeated? P allowed? ""SHOPS"": S H O P S -> two S's.
- ""SHORE"" not allowed.
- ""SHORN"" not allowed.
- ""SHORT"" not allowed.
- ""SHOTE"" not allowed.
- ""SHOTT"" not allowed.
- ""SHOUT"" not allowed.
- ""SHOVE"" not allowed.
- ""SHOWN"" not allowed.
- ""SHOWY"" not allowed.

""SHOGS"": S H O G S -> two S's? G allowed? ""SHOGS"" is a word? Yes, but rare.

""SHOJO"": S H O J O -> two O's? J allowed? Also rare.

""SHIVS"": not allowed.

""SHIRS"": I and R absent? Not allowed.

So the only common word is ""SHOOK"".

Therefore, I will guess ""SHOOK"".

<guess>shook</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x).  
  → **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: moist**  
  Feedback: M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x).  
  → **Absent letters**: M, I, T (added to the list).  
  → **Present letters**: O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, respectively.

- **Guess 3: blows**  
  Feedback: B(x), L(x), O(✓), W(x), S(-).  
  → **Absent letters**: B, L, W (added to the list).  
  → **Correct position**: O is in position 3 (✓).  
  → **Present letter**: S is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 4: shoyu**  
  Feedback: S(✓), H(✓), O(✓), Y(x), U(x).  
  → **Correct positions**: S (position 1), H (position 2), O (position 3).  
  → **Absent letters**: Y, U (added to the list).  

### Current Knowledge
- **Absent letters (13 total)**: A, B, C, E, I, L, M, N, R, T, U, W, Y.  
- **Correctly placed letters**:  
  - Position 1: **S**  
  - Position 2: **H**  
  - Position 3: **O**  
- **Remaining positions**: 4 and 5.  
- **Remaining letter pool**: D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The secret word starts with **SHO** and ends with two letters from the remaining pool.  
  - No repeated letters (since duplicates haven't been indicated in feedback).  

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess)
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing plausible combinations for positions 4 and 5 using the remaining letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - The only common English word fitting the pattern **SHO__** with letters from the remaining pool is **""SHOOK""** (past tense of ""shake"").  
  - ""SHOOK"" uses **K** (a high-frequency letter) and tests for a potential second **O** (though no duplicates have been confirmed, it's a valid possibility).  
  - Alternatives like ""SHOPS"" (S repeated) or ""SHOGS"" (S repeated, rare word) are less optimal due to redundancy or obscurity.  
- **Why ""SHOOK""?**  
  - Complies with all constraints: Starts with **SHO**, uses allowed letters (K is untested), and is a valid solution.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on K and the second O will resolve the word with the last guess (though this is the final attempt).",Guess 6: shook -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) O(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
