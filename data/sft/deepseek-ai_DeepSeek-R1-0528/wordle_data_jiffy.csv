We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". Let me choose one that covers a good set of letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This tells us that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these excluded letters.

Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.

Vowels left: O, U, I (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y, but we avoid Y for now if possible)
Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good second guess might be ""TOILS"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's avoid the letters we know are not in the word.

We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

Let me think of a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

One common starting word that avoids these is ""SLOTH"", but let's check the letters: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded list.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S. Also avoids the excluded letters.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We have 5 new letters.

Another popular choice is ""BUMPY"", but that has Y and might be less common. Also, we have U and Y.

I think ""SLOTH"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a vowel O.

Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word: M, O, I, S, T. All new letters.

But we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters.

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E.

""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> none of these are excluded.

Similarly, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N because it was in the first guess and marked as not in the word. So ""POUND"" is invalid because of N.

Similarly, we must avoid E, A, R, C.

So ""MOIST"" is safe: M, O, I, S, T.

Another option: ""GHOUL"" but that has 5 letters? G, H, O, U, L -> that's 5. But it's less common.

I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it covers two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

We could also consider ""DUMPY"" but that has D, U, M, P, Y. Also valid, but I think ""MOIST"" is more standard.

Let me go with ""MOIST"".

So the second guess is ""moist"".

But note: the feedback format requires the word in uppercase? The example was in uppercase, but the user input was in lowercase. However, the rules don't specify case. Since the first guess was in lowercase, I'll use lowercase for consistency.

Actually, the example in the rules: ""BRAVE"" is uppercase, but the user said ""crane"" in lowercase. I think we can use lowercase.

To be safe, I'll use lowercase as the user did.

So, guess: moist

But let me confirm: the secret word is 5 letters and we are avoiding C,R,A,N,E. ""moist"" is 5 letters and uses M,O,I,S,T.

Yes.

Alternatively, we could use ""PULPS"" but that has repeated P? No, it's P,U,L,P,S — repeated P, which is not ideal because we get less information.

So ""moist"" is better.

Another word: ""LUCKY"" but C is excluded, so invalid.

""THYME"" but E is excluded.

So ""moist"" seems good.

I'll go with ""moist"".
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know that the letters C, R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

Aim for a word with high-frequency consonants (like S, T, L, M) and vowels (like O, I, U) to maximize information gain. The word ""moist"" fits well:
- Uses M, O, I, S, T — all new letters not in the excluded set (C, R, A, N, E).
- Covers common letters: S and T are among the most frequent consonants, and O and I are common vowels.
- No repeated letters, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help narrow down possibilities significantly based on the feedback.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x': so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"" tells us:
- M, O, S, T are not in the word (all 'x')
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as '-')

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Additionally, we know that the letter I is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed ""moist"" and I was in the second position, but it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter I, but not at position 2 (index 1, if we start counting from 0).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word), but not in the second position.

We also want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know I must be included, so we'll use I in a position that is not position 1 (since in ""moist"" it was at index 1 and was wrong).

We can use I at positions: 0, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters, including I (not at position 1), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Let's think of common words that fit.

We can try words like ""GUILD"", but let's check:
- G, U, I, L, D. 
- Excluded letters? We have G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T are excluded, so G,U,I,L,D are all allowed).
- But we must place I not at position 1. In ""GUILD"", I is at position 2 (if we index 0: G=0, U=1, I=2, L=3, D=4). That's fine because in ""moist"" I was at position 1, and now it's at position 2, which is different.

Another word: ""BUILT"" — B, U, I, L, T. But T is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback, T is not in the word). So invalid.

""GUILT"" — G, U, I, L, T. T is excluded, so no.

""FLUID"" — F, L, U, I, D. Letters: F, L, U, I, D. None excluded? F is not excluded, L is not, U, I, D. T is excluded but not here. So F,L,U,I,D are all available. And I is at position 3 (if F=0, L=1, U=2, I=3, D=4). That's a different position from 1, so it's okay.

But is ""fluid"" a common word? Yes.

Another option: ""BUILD"" — B, U, I, L, D. All letters available. I at position 2.

""JUICE"" — but E is excluded, so no.

""QUICK"" — Q, U, I, C, K. C is excluded (from first guess), so invalid.

""LIVID"" — L, I, V, I, D. Has two I's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters, but it might not be efficient. Also, V and D are available. But let's see: L, I, V, I, D. I is at positions 1 and 3. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, in the feedback for ""moist"", we only had one I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is more than one I. So it's possible. But to avoid complexity, maybe we should avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Similarly, ""PIXIE"" — P, I, X, I, E. E is excluded, so no.

""WIDTH"" — W, I, D, T, H. T is excluded, so no.

""BIGLY"" — B, I, G, L, Y. All letters available. I at position 1. But in ""moist"", I was at position 1 and was wrong, so we cannot put I at position 1 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback said it was in the word but wrong position, meaning that position 1 is not correct for I, but I is in the word. However, if we put I at position 1 again, and if the secret word has only one I, then we might get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't learn about other positions. It's better to try I in a different position to find the correct one.

So, ideally, we should try I in a position that we haven't tried before. We tried position 1 (index1) and it was wrong, so we can try position 0, 2, 3, or 4.

In ""BIGLY"", I is at position 1 (index1) again? Let's index: B=0, I=1, G=2, L=3, Y=4. So I is at index1, which we already know is wrong. So if we use ""BIGLY"", and I is at index1, we know it will be marked as wrong position again (if the word has only one I) and we don't learn the correct position. So it's inefficient.

Therefore, we should avoid putting I at index1.

So words like ""BUILD"" (I at index2) or ""FLUID"" (I at index3) are better.

Another word: ""GUPPY"" — but no I, so we must include I.

We must include I.

""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y. No I.

So we need a word with I.

Let me list possible words: 
- With I at index0: ""ITCHY"" but T and C are excluded? C is excluded, T is excluded. ""ILLUS"" not a word. ""INPUT"" but N and T excluded. Hard to find.

With I at index0: 
- ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded and repeated O? Also O excluded.
- ""IMAGE"" but M, A, E excluded.
- ""IDLER"" but D, L, E, R — E and R excluded.

So index0 might be difficult.

With I at index2: 
- ""BUILD"" as before: B, U, I, L, D. All allowed.
- ""GUILD"" same.
- ""JUICE"" E excluded.
- ""QUIET"" E and T excluded.
- ""VALID"" but V, A, L, I, D — A excluded.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" seem good.

With I at index3:
- ""FLUID"" as before: F, L, U, I, D.
- ""BLIMP"" but M and P? M is excluded. ""BLIMP"" has M, which is excluded.
- ""CLASP"" C and S excluded.
- ""DRUID"" D, R, U, I, D — R excluded, and D repeated? D is not excluded but R is.

""DRUID"" has R, which is excluded.

""FLUID"" is good.

With I at index4:
- ""MULTI"" but M and T excluded.
- ""AUDIO"" A and O excluded.
- ""TULIP"" T excluded.
- ""FOLIC"" O and L? O excluded, and C excluded? F,O,L,I,C — O and C excluded.

Hard to find.

So the best options are ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"".

Now, among these, which one uses more common letters and covers more new letters?

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D
""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D

They all have U, I, L, D and one of B, G, F.

We haven't tried B, G, F, U, L, D yet.

We want to maximize the number of new letters to test.

All of these use 4 new letters (since I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position).

But we also need to consider the frequency.

Common letters in English: among the available, B, D, G, L, U are relatively common.

F is less common than B or G? Actually, in word games, B, D, L are more common than F.

But let's pick one.

We can also consider if there are words that use more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""DULIA"" — but A excluded? A is excluded. Not valid.

""PULPY"" — P, U, L, P, Y. No I.

We must include I.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are both valid and common.

I think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.

But let's see the position of I: in ""BUILD"", I is at index2. We haven't tried that position for I.

Similarly, in ""FLUID"", I is at index3.

We don't know which position is correct, so either is fine.

But note that in ""BUILD"", we have U at index1 and L at index3, which we haven't tested.

Similarly for the others.

To break the tie, we can consider that we have not used B, G, F, etc.

Another idea: we can try a word that uses more vowels? We have U, which is a vowel, and I is a vowel. But we don't have many vowels left: only I, U, and sometimes Y.

We have Y available.

So words with Y might be good.

For example, ""BUILT"" but T excluded.

""GUILT"" T excluded.

""LUCKY"" C excluded.

""WIMPY"" W, I, M, P, Y — M is excluded.

""JUICY"" J, U, I, C, Y — C excluded.

""PITHY"" P, I, T, H, Y — T excluded.

So hard to include Y with I without using excluded letters.

Therefore, ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"" are our best bets.

I'll go with ""BUILD"" because it's a very common word.

So guess: build

But let me confirm the letters: B, U, I, L, D. None are in the excluded list (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T). And I is at position 2 (index2), which is different from the previous position (index1).

So we can use that.

We might also consider ""GUIDE"", but E is excluded, so no.

So ""build"" it is.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning they are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S, T are marked as 'x' (not in the word), and I is marked as '-' (in the word but wrong position).

### Key Insights:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T (cannot appear in the secret word).
- **Included letter**: I is confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was at index 1 in ""moist"" and received '-').
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Objective for the next guess**: 
  - Must include I (as it is in the word) but not in position 1 (index 1).
  - Avoid all excluded letters to test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D, L) and vowels (e.g., U).
  - Prioritize a word with no repeated letters to maximize information gain.

### Thought Process:
- I must be placed in a new position (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4) to identify its correct location.
- Common words like ""BUILD"" (B, U, I, L, D) fit the criteria:
  - Uses new letters: B, U, L, D (all untested and relatively common).
  - Includes I at position 2 (index 2), which is different from the previous guess (index 1).
  - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.
- Alternatives like ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) or ""FLUID"" (F, L, U, I, D) were considered, but ""BUILD"" uses B (a high-frequency consonant) and is a common word, making it a strong choice for information gathering.
- This guess will help narrow down the position of I and test four new letters (B, U, L, D).

<guess>build</guess>",build,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x': so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"" tells us:
- M, O, S, T are not in the word (all 'x')
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as '-')

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Additionally, we know that the letter I is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed ""moist"" and I was in the second position, but it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter I, but not at position 2 (index 1, if we start counting from 0).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word), but not in the second position.

We also want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know I must be included, so we'll use I in a position that is not position 1 (since in ""moist"" it was at index 1 and was wrong).

We can use I at positions: 0, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters, including I (not at position 1), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Let's think of common words that fit.

We can try words like ""GUILD"", but let's check:
- G, U, I, L, D. 
- Excluded letters? We have G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T are excluded, so G,U,I,L,D are all allowed).
- But we must place I not at position 1. In ""GUILD"", I is at position 2 (if we index 0: G=0, U=1, I=2, L=3, D=4). That's fine because in ""moist"" I was at position 1, and now it's at position 2, which is different.

Another word: ""BUILT"" — B, U, I, L, T. But T is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback, T is not in the word). So invalid.

""GUILT"" — G, U, I, L, T. T is excluded, so no.

""FLUID"" — F, L, U, I, D. Letters: F, L, U, I, D. None excluded? F is not excluded, L is not, U, I, D. T is excluded but not here. So F,L,U,I,D are all available. And I is at position 3 (if F=0, L=1, U=2, I=3, D=4). That's a different position from 1, so it's okay.

But is ""fluid"" a common word? Yes.

Another option: ""BUILD"" — B, U, I, L, D. All letters available. I at position 2.

""JUICE"" — but E is excluded, so no.

""QUICK"" — Q, U, I, C, K. C is excluded (from first guess), so invalid.

""LIVID"" — L, I, V, I, D. Has two I's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters, but it might not be efficient. Also, V and D are available. But let's see: L, I, V, I, D. I is at positions 1 and 3. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, in the feedback for ""moist"", we only had one I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is more than one I. So it's possible. But to avoid complexity, maybe we should avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Similarly, ""PIXIE"" — P, I, X, I, E. E is excluded, so no.

""WIDTH"" — W, I, D, T, H. T is excluded, so no.

""BIGLY"" — B, I, G, L, Y. All letters available. I at position 1. But in ""moist"", I was at position 1 and was wrong, so we cannot put I at position 1 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback said it was in the word but wrong position, meaning that position 1 is not correct for I, but I is in the word. However, if we put I at position 1 again, and if the secret word has only one I, then we might get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't learn about other positions. It's better to try I in a different position to find the correct one.

So, ideally, we should try I in a position that we haven't tried before. We tried position 1 (index1) and it was wrong, so we can try position 0, 2, 3, or 4.

In ""BIGLY"", I is at position 1 (index1) again? Let's index: B=0, I=1, G=2, L=3, Y=4. So I is at index1, which we already know is wrong. So if we use ""BIGLY"", and I is at index1, we know it will be marked as wrong position again (if the word has only one I) and we don't learn the correct position. So it's inefficient.

Therefore, we should avoid putting I at index1.

So words like ""BUILD"" (I at index2) or ""FLUID"" (I at index3) are better.

Another word: ""GUPPY"" — but no I, so we must include I.

We must include I.

""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y. No I.

So we need a word with I.

Let me list possible words: 
- With I at index0: ""ITCHY"" but T and C are excluded? C is excluded, T is excluded. ""ILLUS"" not a word. ""INPUT"" but N and T excluded. Hard to find.

With I at index0: 
- ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded and repeated O? Also O excluded.
- ""IMAGE"" but M, A, E excluded.
- ""IDLER"" but D, L, E, R — E and R excluded.

So index0 might be difficult.

With I at index2: 
- ""BUILD"" as before: B, U, I, L, D. All allowed.
- ""GUILD"" same.
- ""JUICE"" E excluded.
- ""QUIET"" E and T excluded.
- ""VALID"" but V, A, L, I, D — A excluded.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" seem good.

With I at index3:
- ""FLUID"" as before: F, L, U, I, D.
- ""BLIMP"" but M and P? M is excluded. ""BLIMP"" has M, which is excluded.
- ""CLASP"" C and S excluded.
- ""DRUID"" D, R, U, I, D — R excluded, and D repeated? D is not excluded but R is.

""DRUID"" has R, which is excluded.

""FLUID"" is good.

With I at index4:
- ""MULTI"" but M and T excluded.
- ""AUDIO"" A and O excluded.
- ""TULIP"" T excluded.
- ""FOLIC"" O and L? O excluded, and C excluded? F,O,L,I,C — O and C excluded.

Hard to find.

So the best options are ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"".

Now, among these, which one uses more common letters and covers more new letters?

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D
""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D

They all have U, I, L, D and one of B, G, F.

We haven't tried B, G, F, U, L, D yet.

We want to maximize the number of new letters to test.

All of these use 4 new letters (since I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position).

But we also need to consider the frequency.

Common letters in English: among the available, B, D, G, L, U are relatively common.

F is less common than B or G? Actually, in word games, B, D, L are more common than F.

But let's pick one.

We can also consider if there are words that use more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""DULIA"" — but A excluded? A is excluded. Not valid.

""PULPY"" — P, U, L, P, Y. No I.

We must include I.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are both valid and common.

I think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.

But let's see the position of I: in ""BUILD"", I is at index2. We haven't tried that position for I.

Similarly, in ""FLUID"", I is at index3.

We don't know which position is correct, so either is fine.

But note that in ""BUILD"", we have U at index1 and L at index3, which we haven't tested.

Similarly for the others.

To break the tie, we can consider that we have not used B, G, F, etc.

Another idea: we can try a word that uses more vowels? We have U, which is a vowel, and I is a vowel. But we don't have many vowels left: only I, U, and sometimes Y.

We have Y available.

So words with Y might be good.

For example, ""BUILT"" but T excluded.

""GUILT"" T excluded.

""LUCKY"" C excluded.

""WIMPY"" W, I, M, P, Y — M is excluded.

""JUICY"" J, U, I, C, Y — C excluded.

""PITHY"" P, I, T, H, Y — T excluded.

So hard to include Y with I without using excluded letters.

Therefore, ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"" are our best bets.

I'll go with ""BUILD"" because it's a very common word.

So guess: build

But let me confirm the letters: B, U, I, L, D. None are in the excluded list (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T). And I is at position 2 (index2), which is different from the previous position (index1).

So we can use that.

We might also consider ""GUIDE"", but E is excluded, so no.

So ""build"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning they are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S, T are marked as 'x' (not in the word), and I is marked as '-' (in the word but wrong position).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". Let me choose one that covers a good set of letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This tells us that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these excluded letters.

Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.

Vowels left: O, U, I (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y, but we avoid Y for now if possible)
Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good second guess might be ""TOILS"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's avoid the letters we know are not in the word.

We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

Let me think of a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

One common starting word that avoids these is ""SLOTH"", but let's check the letters: S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the excluded list.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S. Also avoids the excluded letters.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We have 5 new letters.

Another popular choice is ""BUMPY"", but that has Y and might be less common. Also, we have U and Y.

I think ""SLOTH"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a vowel O.

Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word: M, O, I, S, T. All new letters.

But we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters.

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E.

""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> none of these are excluded.

Similarly, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N because it was in the first guess and marked as not in the word. So ""POUND"" is invalid because of N.

Similarly, we must avoid E, A, R, C.

So ""MOIST"" is safe: M, O, I, S, T.

Another option: ""GHOUL"" but that has 5 letters? G, H, O, U, L -> that's 5. But it's less common.

I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it covers two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

We could also consider ""DUMPY"" but that has D, U, M, P, Y. Also valid, but I think ""MOIST"" is more standard.

Let me go with ""MOIST"".

So the second guess is ""moist"".

But note: the feedback format requires the word in uppercase? The example was in uppercase, but the user input was in lowercase. However, the rules don't specify case. Since the first guess was in lowercase, I'll use lowercase for consistency.

Actually, the example in the rules: ""BRAVE"" is uppercase, but the user said ""crane"" in lowercase. I think we can use lowercase.

To be safe, I'll use lowercase as the user did.

So, guess: moist

But let me confirm: the secret word is 5 letters and we are avoiding C,R,A,N,E. ""moist"" is 5 letters and uses M,O,I,S,T.

Yes.

Alternatively, we could use ""PULPS"" but that has repeated P? No, it's P,U,L,P,S — repeated P, which is not ideal because we get less information.

So ""moist"" is better.

Another word: ""LUCKY"" but C is excluded, so invalid.

""THYME"" but E is excluded.

So ""moist"" seems good.

I'll go with ""moist"".After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know that the letters C, R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word. For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

Aim for a word with high-frequency consonants (like S, T, L, M) and vowels (like O, I, U) to maximize information gain. The word ""moist"" fits well:
- Uses M, O, I, S, T — all new letters not in the excluded set (C, R, A, N, E).
- Covers common letters: S and T are among the most frequent consonants, and O and I are common vowels.
- No repeated letters, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help narrow down possibilities significantly based on the feedback.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x': so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"" tells us:
- M, O, S, T are not in the word (all 'x')
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as '-')

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Additionally, we know that the letter I is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed ""moist"" and I was in the second position, but it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter I, but not at position 2 (index 1, if we start counting from 0).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word), but not in the second position.

We also want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know I must be included, so we'll use I in a position that is not position 1 (since in ""moist"" it was at index 1 and was wrong).

We can use I at positions: 0, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters, including I (not at position 1), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Let's think of common words that fit.

We can try words like ""GUILD"", but let's check:
- G, U, I, L, D. 
- Excluded letters? We have G, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T are excluded, so G,U,I,L,D are all allowed).
- But we must place I not at position 1. In ""GUILD"", I is at position 2 (if we index 0: G=0, U=1, I=2, L=3, D=4). That's fine because in ""moist"" I was at position 1, and now it's at position 2, which is different.

Another word: ""BUILT"" — B, U, I, L, T. But T is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback, T is not in the word). So invalid.

""GUILT"" — G, U, I, L, T. T is excluded, so no.

""FLUID"" — F, L, U, I, D. Letters: F, L, U, I, D. None excluded? F is not excluded, L is not, U, I, D. T is excluded but not here. So F,L,U,I,D are all available. And I is at position 3 (if F=0, L=1, U=2, I=3, D=4). That's a different position from 1, so it's okay.

But is ""fluid"" a common word? Yes.

Another option: ""BUILD"" — B, U, I, L, D. All letters available. I at position 2.

""JUICE"" — but E is excluded, so no.

""QUICK"" — Q, U, I, C, K. C is excluded (from first guess), so invalid.

""LIVID"" — L, I, V, I, D. Has two I's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are allowed to guess words with repeated letters, but it might not be efficient. Also, V and D are available. But let's see: L, I, V, I, D. I is at positions 1 and 3. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, in the feedback for ""moist"", we only had one I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is more than one I. So it's possible. But to avoid complexity, maybe we should avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Similarly, ""PIXIE"" — P, I, X, I, E. E is excluded, so no.

""WIDTH"" — W, I, D, T, H. T is excluded, so no.

""BIGLY"" — B, I, G, L, Y. All letters available. I at position 1. But in ""moist"", I was at position 1 and was wrong, so we cannot put I at position 1 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback said it was in the word but wrong position, meaning that position 1 is not correct for I, but I is in the word. However, if we put I at position 1 again, and if the secret word has only one I, then we might get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't learn about other positions. It's better to try I in a different position to find the correct one.

So, ideally, we should try I in a position that we haven't tried before. We tried position 1 (index1) and it was wrong, so we can try position 0, 2, 3, or 4.

In ""BIGLY"", I is at position 1 (index1) again? Let's index: B=0, I=1, G=2, L=3, Y=4. So I is at index1, which we already know is wrong. So if we use ""BIGLY"", and I is at index1, we know it will be marked as wrong position again (if the word has only one I) and we don't learn the correct position. So it's inefficient.

Therefore, we should avoid putting I at index1.

So words like ""BUILD"" (I at index2) or ""FLUID"" (I at index3) are better.

Another word: ""GUPPY"" — but no I, so we must include I.

We must include I.

""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y. No I.

So we need a word with I.

Let me list possible words: 
- With I at index0: ""ITCHY"" but T and C are excluded? C is excluded, T is excluded. ""ILLUS"" not a word. ""INPUT"" but N and T excluded. Hard to find.

With I at index0: 
- ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded and repeated O? Also O excluded.
- ""IMAGE"" but M, A, E excluded.
- ""IDLER"" but D, L, E, R — E and R excluded.

So index0 might be difficult.

With I at index2: 
- ""BUILD"" as before: B, U, I, L, D. All allowed.
- ""GUILD"" same.
- ""JUICE"" E excluded.
- ""QUIET"" E and T excluded.
- ""VALID"" but V, A, L, I, D — A excluded.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" seem good.

With I at index3:
- ""FLUID"" as before: F, L, U, I, D.
- ""BLIMP"" but M and P? M is excluded. ""BLIMP"" has M, which is excluded.
- ""CLASP"" C and S excluded.
- ""DRUID"" D, R, U, I, D — R excluded, and D repeated? D is not excluded but R is.

""DRUID"" has R, which is excluded.

""FLUID"" is good.

With I at index4:
- ""MULTI"" but M and T excluded.
- ""AUDIO"" A and O excluded.
- ""TULIP"" T excluded.
- ""FOLIC"" O and L? O excluded, and C excluded? F,O,L,I,C — O and C excluded.

Hard to find.

So the best options are ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"".

Now, among these, which one uses more common letters and covers more new letters?

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D
""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D

They all have U, I, L, D and one of B, G, F.

We haven't tried B, G, F, U, L, D yet.

We want to maximize the number of new letters to test.

All of these use 4 new letters (since I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position).

But we also need to consider the frequency.

Common letters in English: among the available, B, D, G, L, U are relatively common.

F is less common than B or G? Actually, in word games, B, D, L are more common than F.

But let's pick one.

We can also consider if there are words that use more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""DULIA"" — but A excluded? A is excluded. Not valid.

""PULPY"" — P, U, L, P, Y. No I.

We must include I.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are both valid and common.

I think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.

But let's see the position of I: in ""BUILD"", I is at index2. We haven't tried that position for I.

Similarly, in ""FLUID"", I is at index3.

We don't know which position is correct, so either is fine.

But note that in ""BUILD"", we have U at index1 and L at index3, which we haven't tested.

Similarly for the others.

To break the tie, we can consider that we have not used B, G, F, etc.

Another idea: we can try a word that uses more vowels? We have U, which is a vowel, and I is a vowel. But we don't have many vowels left: only I, U, and sometimes Y.

We have Y available.

So words with Y might be good.

For example, ""BUILT"" but T excluded.

""GUILT"" T excluded.

""LUCKY"" C excluded.

""WIMPY"" W, I, M, P, Y — M is excluded.

""JUICY"" J, U, I, C, Y — C excluded.

""PITHY"" P, I, T, H, Y — T excluded.

So hard to include Y with I without using excluded letters.

Therefore, ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"" are our best bets.

I'll go with ""BUILD"" because it's a very common word.

So guess: build

But let me confirm the letters: B, U, I, L, D. None are in the excluded list (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T). And I is at position 2 (index2), which is different from the previous position (index1).

So we can use that.

We might also consider ""GUIDE"", but E is excluded, so no.

So ""build"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning they are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S, T are marked as 'x' (not in the word), and I is marked as '-' (in the word but wrong position).

### Key Insights:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T (cannot appear in the secret word).
- **Included letter**: I is confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was at index 1 in ""moist"" and received '-').
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Objective for the next guess**: 
  - Must include I (as it is in the word) but not in position 1 (index 1).
  - Avoid all excluded letters to test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D, L) and vowels (e.g., U).
  - Prioritize a word with no repeated letters to maximize information gain.

### Thought Process:
- I must be placed in a new position (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4) to identify its correct location.
- Common words like ""BUILD"" (B, U, I, L, D) fit the criteria:
  - Uses new letters: B, U, L, D (all untested and relatively common).
  - Includes I at position 2 (index 2), which is different from the previous guess (index 1).
  - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.
- Alternatives like ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) or ""FLUID"" (F, L, U, I, D) were considered, but ""BUILD"" uses B (a high-frequency consonant) and is a common word, making it a strong choice for information gathering.
- This guess will help narrow down the position of I and test four new letters (B, U, L, D).

F,O,L,I,C — O and C excluded.\n\nHard to find.\n\nSo the best options are ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"".\n\nNow, among these, which one uses more common letters and covers more new letters?\n\n""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D\n""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D\n""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D\n\nThey all have U, I, L, D and one of B, G, F.\n\nWe haven\'t tried B, G, F, U, L, D yet.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters to test.\n\nAll of these use 4 new letters (since I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position).\n\nBut we also need to consider the frequency.\n\nCommon letters in English: among the available, B, D, G, L, U are relatively common.\n\nF is less common than B or G? Actually, in word games, B, D, L are more common than F.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nWe can also consider if there are words that use more high-frequency letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DULIA"" — but A excluded? A is excluded. Not valid.\n\n""PULPY"" — P, U, L, P, Y. No I.\n\nWe must include I.\n\n""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are both valid and common.\n\nI think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.\n\nBut let\'s see the position of I: in ""BUILD"", I is at index2. We haven\'t tried that position for I.\n\nSimilarly, in ""FLUID"", I is at index3.\n\nWe don\'t know which position is correct, so either is fine.\n\nBut note that in ""BUILD"", we have U at index1 and L at index3, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nTo break the tie, we can consider that we have not used B, G, F, etc.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that uses more vowels? We have U, which is a vowel, and I is a vowel. But we don\'t have many vowels left: only I, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe have Y available.\n\nSo words with Y might be good.\n\nFor example, ""BUILT"" but T excluded.\n\n""GUILT"" T excluded.\n\n""LUCKY"" C excluded.\n\n""WIMPY"" W, I, M, P, Y — M is excluded.\n\n""JUICY"" J, U, I, C, Y — C excluded.\n\n""PITHY"" P, I, T, H, Y — T excluded.\n\nSo hard to include Y with I without using excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""FLUID"" are our best bets.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BUILD"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo guess: build\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: B, U, I, L, D. None are in the excluded list (A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T). And I is at position 2 (index2), which is different from the previous position (index1).\n\nSo we can use that.\n\nWe might also consider ""GUIDE"", but E is excluded, so no.\n\nSo ""build"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as \'x\', meaning they are not in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S, T are marked as \'x\' (not in the word), and I is marked as \'-\' (in the word but wrong position).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T (cannot appear in the secret word).\n- **Included letter**: I is confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was at index 1 in ""moist"" and received \'-\').\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Objective for the next guess**: \n  - Must include I (as it is in the word) but not in position 1 (index 1).\n  - Avoid all excluded letters to test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D, L) and vowels (e.g., U).\n  - Prioritize a word with no repeated letters to maximize information gain.\n\n### Thought Process:\n- I must be placed in a new position (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4) to identify its correct location.\n- Common words like ""BUILD"" (B, U, I, L, D) fit the criteria:\n  - Uses new letters: B, U, L, D (all untested and relatively common).\n  - Includes I at position 2 (index 2), which is different from the previous guess (index 1).\n  - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.\n- Alternatives like ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) or ""FLUID"" (F, L, U, I, D) were considered, but ""BUILD"" uses B (a high-frequency consonant) and is a common word, making it a strong choice for information gathering.\n- This guess will help narrow down the position of I and test four new letters (B, U, L, D).\n\n<guess>build</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So the secret word has none of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: moist -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x) → M, O, S, T are not in the word. I is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).

Guess 3: build -> B(x), U(x), I(-), L(x), D(x) → B, U, L, D are not in the word. I is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).

So, from all the feedback:

- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D. That's 13 letters.

- We know that I is in the word, but it's not at position 1 (from ""moist"") and not at position 2 (from ""build""). So I must be at position 0, 3, or 4.

- We have to find a 5-letter word that includes I (at position 0, 3, or 4) and uses only the remaining available letters.

Available letters: We have 26 letters. Excluded: A, B, C, D, E, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U. So the available letters are: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But I is already known to be in the word, so we need to use I and four other letters from the available set, but note that I can be used only once? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates. However, to keep it simple, we can assume no duplicates for now.

We must include I, and we have to place it at position 0, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a word with the available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to think of words that have I in one of the allowed positions.

Let's try position 0 (first letter):

- Words starting with I: We need 4 more letters from the available set.

  - ""IGLOO"" → but G and L: L is excluded, and O excluded. Not possible.
  - ""ITCHY"" → I, T, C, H, Y → T and C are excluded.
  - ""INPUT"" → I, N, P, U, T → N, U, T excluded.
  - ""INKED"" → I, N, K, E, D → N, E, D excluded.

  It's hard. Let's think of words with I at the start and only available letters.

  Possible: ""IFFY"" → only 4 letters? Not 5.

  ""IGAPO"" → not common.

  ""IZZAT"" → not common.

  Maybe: ""IVORY"" → I, V, O, R, Y → O and R excluded.

  ""IVIED"" → I, V, I, E, D → E and D excluded, and repeated I.

  Not easy.

Position 3 (fourth letter):

- Words with I at index 3: ? ? ? I ?

  For example, ""FJORD"" but O and R excluded.

  ""SWING"" → S, W, I, N, G → S and N excluded.

  ""BLIMP"" → B, L, I, M, P → B, L, M excluded.

  ""CROWD"" → C, R, O, W, D → all excluded except W? But C, R, O, D excluded.

  With available letters: let's try to form one.

  Suppose: _ _ _ I _

  We need to fill the blanks with F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I is at 3, so we can use other letters).

  Examples: ""PIXIE"" → P, I, X, I, E → but E excluded, and I at index 1 and 3? Not at index 3 only.

  ""PIXIE"" has I at index 1 and 3? Positions: P(0), I(1), X(2), I(3), E(4). So I is at 1 and 3. But we are placing I at 3, but it also has I at 1? We don't want to use I at position 1 again because we know it's not the correct position for I (from previous feedback). Also, E is excluded.

  ""JUMPS"" → J, U, M, P, S → U, M, S excluded.

  ""QUIPS"" → Q, U, I, P, S → U and S excluded.

  ""QUIP"" is 4 letters.

  ""QUICK"" → Q, U, I, C, K → U and C excluded.

  ""WHIPS"" → W, H, I, P, S → S excluded.

  ""WHIFF"" → W, H, I, F, F → F is available, but repeated F? And we can try: W, H, I, F, F. But repeated letters might not be ideal, but allowed.

  But let's see: W, H, I, F, F. I is at position 2? If we have WHIFF: W(0), H(1), I(2), F(3), F(4). But we want I at position 3? Here I is at index 2, which we already know is wrong (from ""build"" feedback, I at index2 was wrong). So we shouldn't put I at index2 again.

  We need I at index3.

  So for position 3: _ _ _ I _ 

  Example: ""CIVIC"" → C, I, V, I, C → C excluded and I at multiple positions.

  ""VIGIL"" → V, I, G, I, L → I at index1 and 3? And L excluded.

  ""FJORD"" not possible.

  How about ""PYXIS"" → P, Y, X, I, S → S excluded.

  ""TAXIS"" → T, A, X, I, S → T, A, S excluded.

  ""HEXAD"" → H, E, X, A, D → E, A, D excluded.

  This is difficult.

Position 4 (last letter):

- Words ending with I: ? ? ? ? I

  Examples: ""TAXI"" → 4 letters? ""TAXIS"" is 5 but ends with S.

  ""RADII"" → R, A, D, I, I → R, A, D excluded, and repeated I.

  ""AALII"" → A, A, L, I, I → A and L excluded.

  ""GASSY"" → not ending with I.

  With available letters: _ _ _ _ I

  We need a word that ends with I and uses F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z for the first four letters.

  Common words: ""SAFARI"" → S, A, F, A, R, I? 6 letters. No.

  ""SUSHI"" → S, U, S, H, I → S and U excluded.

  ""PIZZA"" → ends with A, not I.

  ""KIOSK"" → ends with K.

  ""QURSH"" → not ending with I.

  ""YOGI"" → 4 letters.

  ""ENVOI"" → E, N, V, O, I → E, N, O excluded.

  ""BANNS"" → not I.

  It seems rare for English words to end with I, except for some plurals or specific words.

  ""TAXI"" is 4, ""TAXIS"" is 5 but ends with S.

  ""ALIBI"" → A, L, I, B, I → A, L, B excluded, and repeated I.

  ""OMLAH"" → not.

  Perhaps ""KANZI"" → K, A, N, Z, I → A and N excluded.

  This is challenging.

Given the difficulty, let's list all possible words that can be formed with the available letters and include I.

Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And I must be in the word, at position 0, 3, or 4.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Let me think of common words:

- ""PIQUE"" → P, I, Q, U, E → U and E excluded.

- ""QUIZ"" → 4 letters.

- ""JAZZY"" → no I.

- ""FUZZY"" → no I.

- ""JIFFY"" → J, I, F, F, Y → has I at index1. But we know index1 is wrong for I, so if we use it, we'll get '-' again for I at index1, which we already know. But we can use it to test other letters? However, we have limited guesses.

But let's see: ""jiffy"" has I at index1, which is not allowed? We can use it, but we know that position is wrong, so it won't help us find the correct position of I. But it might help test other letters.

But we have to include I, and we know it's in the word, so we can try to put it in a new position to find where it belongs.

But we have only positions 0, 3, 4 left to try.

So we should try one of these.

Another idea: ""WIFEY"" → W, I, F, E, Y → E is excluded. Not valid.

""PICKY"" → P, I, C, K, Y → C excluded.

""VINYL"" → V, I, N, Y, L → N and L excluded.

""WINZY"" -> W, I, N, Z, Y -> N excluded.

""FIXED"" -> F, I, X, E, D -> E and D excluded.

""JIVED"" -> J, I, V, E, D -> E and D excluded.

""KIBBE"" -> K, I, B, B, E -> B and E excluded.

""PZAZZ"" -> no I.

Perhaps we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don't have any indication.

Another word: ""HIJAB"" -> H, I, J, A, B -> A and B excluded.

""FIQUE"" -> F, I, Q, U, E -> U and E excluded.

""BIFFY"" -> B, I, F, F, Y -> B excluded.

We are missing some letters. Let's list available again: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What about ""WHIZZ"" -> W, H, I, Z, Z -> has I at index2. But we know from ""build"" that index2 is wrong for I. So if we use ""WHIZZ"", I is at index2, which is not correct, so we'll get '-' for I, and we don't learn new position.

But we can test W, H, Z.

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6).

We need to find the word.

Perhaps ""PIXIE"" but E excluded.

""PIXY"" -> 4 letters.

""PIXIE"" is 5 but has E.

""JINKS"" -> J, I, N, K, S -> N and S excluded.

""KICKS"" -> K, I, C, K, S -> C and S excluded.

""PICKS"" -> P, I, C, K, S -> C and S excluded.

""FIFTH"" -> F, I, F, T, H -> T excluded.

""GIGHE"" -> not common.

""ZIPPY"" -> Z, I, P, P, Y -> has I at index1, which is wrong.

But let's consider using it to test other letters.

However, we know I is in the word, so we must include it, but we can put it in a position we haven't tried, like index0 or index3 or index4.

Let's try to find words with I at index0:

- ""IGAPO"" -> not common.
- ""IKONS"" -> I, K, O, N, S -> O, N, S excluded.
- ""ILEAC"" -> I, L, E, A, C -> L, E, A, C excluded.
- ""ILEUM"" -> I, L, E, U, M -> L, E, U, M excluded.
- ""IMAGE"" -> I, M, A, G, E -> M, A, E excluded.
- ""INBYE"" -> I, N, B, Y, E -> N, B, E excluded.
- ""INFIX"" -> I, N, F, I, X -> N excluded, and repeated I.
- ""INKER"" -> I, N, K, E, R -> N, E, R excluded.
- ""INLAY"" -> I, N, L, A, Y -> N, L, A excluded.
- ""IVIED"" -> I, V, I, E, D -> E, D excluded, repeated I.
- ""IZARD"" -> I, Z, A, R, D -> A, R, D excluded.

Not working.

Index3:

- ""ABACI"" -> A, B, A, C, I -> A, B, C excluded.
- ""BENNI"" -> B, E, N, N, I -> B, E, N excluded.
- ""BOSKI"" -> B, O, S, K, I -> B, O, S excluded.
- ""CASKI"" -> C, A, S, K, I -> C, A, S excluded.
- ""DESHI"" -> D, E, S, H, I -> D, E, S excluded.
- ""DZHAL"" -> not common.
- ""FUSTI"" -> F, U, S, T, I -> U, S, T excluded.
- ""GASPI"" -> G, A, S, P, I -> A, S excluded.
- ""HIOIS"" -> not common.
- ""JUPON"" -> J, U, P, O, N -> U, O, N excluded.
- ""KAPUT"" -> K, A, P, U, T -> A, U, T excluded.
- ""KIVAS"" -> K, I, V, A, S -> I at index1, not 3. And A, S excluded.
- ""LEVIN"" -> L, E, V, I, N -> L, E, N excluded.
- ""LIPID"" -> L, I, P, I, D -> L, D excluded, and I at index1 and 3.
- ""MILPA"" -> M, I, L, P, A -> M, L, A excluded.
- ""NIXIE"" -> N, I, X, I, E -> N, E excluded.
- ""PARKI"" -> P, A, R, K, I -> A, R excluded.
- ""PINKO"" -> P, I, N, K, O -> I at index1, not 3. N, O excluded.
- ""PZAZZ"" -> no I.
- ""QUASI"" -> Q, U, A, S, I -> U, A, S excluded.
- ""QUENA"" -> Q, U, E, N, A -> U, E, N, A excluded.
- ""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U -> U excluded, and I at index2.
- ""RAUPO"" -> R, A, U, P, O -> all excluded.
- ""REIKI"" -> R, E, I, K, I -> R, E excluded.
- ""ROTTE"" -> not.
- ""SABZI"" -> S, A, B, Z, I -> S, A, B excluded.
- ""TACKI"" -> T, A, C, K, I -> T, A, C excluded.
- ""TAKKY"" -> not.
- ""TOPHI"" -> T, O, P, H, I -> T, O excluded.
- ""TUTTI"" -> T, U, T, T, I -> T, U excluded.
- ""VODOU"" -> not.
- ""YOGIC"" -> Y, O, G, I, C -> O, C excluded.
- ""YOGIS"" -> Y, O, G, I, S -> O, S excluded.
- ""ZAPPY"" -> no I.
- ""ZAXES"" -> no I.
- ""ZILCH"" -> Z, I, L, C, H -> L, C excluded.
- ""ZINCY"" -> Z, I, N, C, Y -> N, C excluded.
- ""ZIPPO"" -> Z, I, P, P, O -> O excluded.
- ""ZLOTY"" -> no I.
- ""ZOWIE"" -> Z, O, W, I, E -> O, E excluded.

This is taking too long. Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: ""PIING"" -> not a word.

""QOPH"" -> 4 letters.

""QOPHS"" -> Q, O, P, H, S -> O, S excluded.

""JACKY"" -> J, A, C, K, Y -> A, C excluded.

Perhaps ""WIGHT"" -> W, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.

""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.

""LIGHT"" -> L excluded.

""RIGHT"" -> R excluded.

""NIGHT"" -> N excluded.

""SIGHT"" -> S excluded.

"" might"" -> M excluded.

"" tight"" -> T excluded.

""WIGHT"" -> T excluded.

""FICHU"" -> F, I, C, H, U -> C, U excluded.

""FICHU"" is a word, but C and U are excluded.

""GIPSY"" -> G, I, P, S, Y -> S excluded.

""HIPPY"" -> H, I, P, P, Y -> has I at index1, which is wrong.

But let's consider using ""HIPPY"" to test H, P, Y. But I at index1 will give '-' and we know that.

We have to include I, so we have to use it.

Perhaps we can try a word with I at index4.

For example, ""ENVOI"" is a word, but E and O excluded.

""IMP"" -> 3 letters.

""KUDZU"" -> no I.

""YOGIN"" -> Y, O, G, I, N -> O, N excluded.

""YOGEE"" -> Y, O, G, E, E -> O, E excluded.

""YOGH"" -> 4 letters.

""YOGHS"" -> Y, O, G, H, S -> O, S excluded.

""YACKS"" -> Y, A, C, K, S -> A, C, S excluded.

""YAPOK"" -> Y, A, P, O, K -> A, O excluded.

""YIKES"" -> Y, I, K, E, S -> I at index1, and E, S excluded.

""YIPES"" -> Y, I, P, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YOWIE"" -> Y, O, W, I, E -> O, E excluded.

""ZAPPY"" -> Z, A, P, P, Y -> A excluded.

""ZEBRA"" -> Z, E, B, R, A -> E, B, R, A excluded.

""ZILAS"" -> not common.

""ZINCS"" -> Z, I, N, C, S -> N, C, S excluded.

""ZINGS"" -> Z, I, N, G, S -> N, S excluded.

""ZINKY"" -> Z, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.

""ZLOTE"" -> Z, L, O, T, E -> L, O, T, E excluded.

""ZOMBI"" -> Z, O, M, B, I -> O, M, B excluded.

""ZONED"" -> Z, O, N, E, D -> O, N, E, D excluded.

""ZOOID"" -> Z, O, O, I, D -> O, D excluded.

""ZOOMS"" -> Z, O, O, M, S -> O, M, S excluded.

""ZOWIE"" -> already considered.

Perhaps ""EXIST"" but E and S and T excluded.

I am considering that we might have missed a letter or something.

Another thought: in the feedback for ""moist"", I is '-', and for ""build"", I is '-', so I is in the word but not at position 1 or 2.

But in ""build"", I is at index2, which is the third position if counting from 1, but in programming, index starts at 0.

In ""moist"": m o i s t -> positions: 0:m, 1:o, 2:i, 3:s, 4:t. Feedback for I (at index2) is '-', so wrong position.

In ""build"": b u i l d -> positions: 0:b, 1:u, 2:i, 3:l, 4:d. Feedback for I (at index2) is '-', same position as in ""moist""? No, in ""moist"" I is at index2, and in ""build"" I is also at index2? That can't be right.

Let's double-check the feedback.

Guess 2: moist -> M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)

In ""moist"", the letters are: position 0: M, 1: O, 2: I, 3: S, 4: T.

Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x), so I is at position 2 (index2) and it is '-', meaning it's in the word but not at that position.

Guess 3: build -> B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)

In ""build"": position 0: B, 1: U, 2: I, 3: L, 4: D.

Feedback: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x), so I is at index2 again, and it's '-', which is consistent, but it doesn't give us new information about the position of I, because we already know index2 is wrong.

Oh no! In both guesses, I was at the same position (index2). That was a mistake in our previous guess. We should have put I in a different position.

In guess 3, we used ""build"" with I at index2, which is the same as in ""moist"", so we already knew it was wrong, so we wasted that position for I.

We should have put I at a new position.

For the next guess, we must put I at either index0, index3, or index4.

But from the available letters, it's hard to find a word.

Perhaps the word has I at index3 or index4, and we need to try.

Let's try ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E and L excluded.

""PIXIE"" -> P, I, X, I, E -> E excluded.

""JEWIE"" -> not a word.

""HEWGH"" -> no I.

""KIWI"" -> 4 letters.

""KIWIS"" -> K, I, W, I, S -> S excluded, and I at index1 and 4.

Index1 is wrong, index4 is new.

But S excluded.

""KIWIS"" has S, which is excluded.

""KIVAS"" -> K, I, V, A, S -> A and S excluded.

""VIFDA"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""FJORD"" is not possible.

Another idea: ""GYPSY"" -> G, Y, P, S, Y -> S excluded, and no I.

We must include I.

Perhaps ""PHIZ"" -> 4 letters.

""PHIZZ"" -> not common.

I think we need to consider that the secret word might have 'Y' as a vowel.

Let's try ""PYGMY"" -> P, Y, G, M, Y -> M excluded, no I.

""LYMPH"" -> L excluded.

""NYMPH"" -> N excluded.

""WYNDS"" -> W, Y, N, D, S -> N, D, S excluded.

""XYSTI"" -> X, Y, S, T, I -> S, T excluded.

""XYSTS"" -> no I.

""CRWTH"" -> C, R, W, T, H -> all excluded.

Perhaps ""QWERTY"" is 6 letters.

I am considering that we might have a mistake in the available letters.

List of all excluded letters from feedback:

From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E

From guess 2: M, O, S, T (and I is in, but positions wrong)

From guess 3: B, U, L, D (and I is in, but position wrong)

So excluded: A, B, C, D, E, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U

Available: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

And I is in the word.

Now, common words that use these letters and include I:

- ""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.
- ""WIGHT"" -> W, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.
- ""PIGHT"" -> not a word.
- ""SIGHT"" -> S excluded.

- ""HIGHT"" -> H, I, G, H, T -> T excluded, and repeated H.
- ""KIGHT"" -> not a word.
- "" might"" -> M excluded.
- ""night"" -> N excluded.
- ""right"" -> R excluded.
- ""tight"" -> T excluded.
- ""light"" -> L excluded.
- ""fight"" -> T excluded.

""JINGO"" -> J, I, N, G, O -> N, O excluded.

""KING"" -> 4 letters.

""JIVY"" -> 4 letters.

""JIVEY"" -> not common.

""HIVED"" -> H, I, V, E, D -> E, D excluded.

""GIVED"" -> G, I, V, E, D -> E, D excluded.

""FIVER"" -> F, I, V, E, R -> E, R excluded.

""FIVES"" -> F, I, V, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""VIVID"" -> V, I, V, I, D -> D excluded, and repeated V and I.

""MINIM"" -> M excluded.

""PIKUL"" -> P, I, K, U, L -> U, L excluded.

""PIKAS"" -> P, I, K, A, S -> A, S excluded.

""KIPPS"" -> K, I, P, P, S -> S excluded.

""PIPIT"" -> P, I, P, I, T -> T excluded, repeated.

""TIPIS"" -> T, I, P, I, S -> T, S excluded.

""TIPSY"" -> T, I, P, S, Y -> T, S excluded.

""WIPER"" -> W, I, P, E, R -> E, R excluded.

""WIPES"" -> W, I, P, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YIPES"" -> Y, I, P, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YIKES"" -> Y, I, K, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YIKES"" has I at index1, which is wrong.

Perhaps ""QUIP"" -> 4 letters.

""EQUIP"" -> E, Q, U, I, P -> E, U excluded.

""QUIPS"" -> Q, U, I, P, S -> U, S excluded.

""QUICK"" -> Q, U, I, C, K -> U, C excluded.

""JACKY"" -> J, A, C, K, Y -> A, C excluded.

I think we need to consider ""JIFFY"" or ""ZIPPY"" even though I is at index1.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y

Letters: J, I, F, Y. F is repeated, but it's allowed.

Available letters: J, I, F, Y are all available, and F is repeated.

But I is at index1, which we know is wrong, so it will be '-' for I, but we can test J, F, Y.

Similarly, ""ZIPPY"" -> Z, I, P, P, Y -> I at index1.

Or ""PIPPY"" -> P, I, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

But let's choose ""JIFFY"" as a guess.

Or ""KIFFY"" not a word.

""FJORD"" not.

Another word: ""WHIFF"" -> W, H, I, F, F -> I at index2, which we know is wrong (from previous feedback, index2 is wrong for I).

In ""moist"" and ""build"", I was at index2 and wrong, so if we put I at index2 again, it will be '-' again.

So for ""WHIFF"": positions 0:W, 1:H, 2:I, 3:F, 4:F. I at index2, so it will be '-', and we test W, H, F.

But F is repeated.

We have to make a guess.

Perhaps ""GHYLL"" -> not common.

I recall that ""GYPSY"" is a word, but no I and S excluded.

"" Cysts"" -> C and S excluded.

""SYLPH"" -> S excluded.

""TRYPS"" -> T, R, Y, P, S -> T, R, S excluded.

We are running out of options.

Let's try ""Pique"" but not.

Another idea: ""Yince"" not a word.

""YIKEs"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""WIZEN"" -> W, I, Z, E, N -> E, N excluded.

""WIZENED"" too long.

""WIZ"" 3 letters.

""WIZED"" -> W, I, Z, E, D -> E, D excluded.

""JAZZ"" 4 letters.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A excluded.

""HAJJI"" -> H, A, J, J, I -> A excluded, and J repeated.

""HAJ"" 3 letters.

"" FAKIR"" -> F, A, K, I, R -> A, R excluded.

""Fakir"" is a word, but A and R excluded.

""KAFIR"" -> K, A, F, I, R -> A, R excluded.

""KAFIR"" same.

""VIRUS"" -> V, I, R, U, S -> R, U, S excluded.

""VIRAL"" -> V, I, R, A, L -> R, A, L excluded.

""VIRGA"" -> V, I, R, G, A -> R, A excluded.

""VIRID"" -> V, I, R, I, D -> R, D excluded.

""VISOR"" -> V, I, S, O, R -> S, O, R excluded.

""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> S, T, A excluded.

""VITAE"" -> V, I, T, A, E -> T, A, E excluded.

""VITTA"" -> V, I, T, T, A -> T, A excluded.

""VIVID"" -> V, I, V, I, D -> D excluded.

""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> E, N excluded.

""VIZIR"" -> V, I, Z, I, R -> R excluded.

""VIZOR"" -> V, I, Z, O, R -> O, R excluded.

""VODKA"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> O, D, A excluded.

""VOLAR"" -> V, O, L, A, R -> O, L, A, R excluded.

""VOLED"" -> V, O, L, E, D -> O, L, E, D excluded.

""VOLKS"" -> not.

""VOLVE"" -> V, O, L, V, E -> O, L, E excluded.

""VOTED"" -> V, O, T, E, D -> O, T, E, D excluded.

""VOTES"" -> V, O, T, E, S -> O, T, E, S excluded.

""VOWED"" -> V, O, W, E, D -> O, E, D excluded.

""VOWER"" -> V, O, W, E, R -> O, E, R excluded.

""VOWEL"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> O, E, L excluded.

""Voxel"" -> V, O, X, E, L -> O, E, L excluded.

""VUGGY"" -> V, U, G, G, Y -> U excluded.

""VUGHS"" -> V, U, G, H, S -> U, S excluded.

""VULGO"" -> V, U, L, G, O -> U, L, O excluded.

""VYING"" -> V, Y, I, N, G -> N excluded, and I at index2, which is wrong.

""VYING"" has I at index2, which we know is wrong.

But let's see: V, Y, I, N, G -> N excluded, so not valid.

I think we have to try ""JIFFY"" or something similar.

Let's go with ""JIFFY"" as a guess.

So guess: jiffy

But I is at index1, which is wrong, but we test J, F, Y.

Or ""ZIPPY"" to test Z, P, Y.

But ""ZIPPY"" has I at index1.

Perhaps ""PIKed"" not.

Another word: ""Qajaq"" -> not common.

I recall that in Wordle, there is a word ""FAQIR"", but F, A, Q, I, R -> A and R excluded.

""FAQIR"" is not valid.

Perhaps the secret word is ""WICCA"", but W, I, C, C, A -> C and A excluded.

Or ""DIDIE"" not.

We might have to accept that we put I in a wrong position again, but we have to.

Let's choose ""WHIFF"" with I at index2, but we know it's wrong, but we test W, H, F.

But F is repeated.

""WHIFF"" -> W, H, I, F, F

Feedback will be: W(?) H(?) I(-) F(?) F(?) 

But since I is at index2, it will be '-', and we know that.

But we can learn about W, H, F.

If F is in the word, it might be 'x' or '-'.

But it's better than nothing.

Perhaps ""FJORD"" is not possible.

Another idea: ""PHIZ"" is 4 letters, ""PHIZZ"" is not common.

I think we should try ""JIFFY"".

So I'll go with ""jiffy"".

<guess>jiffy</guess>

But let's hope it's valid.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S, T are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This means I is in the secret word, but not at position 2 (index 1).
- **Guess 3: ""build""** → B, U, L, D are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). Since I was guessed at position 2 (index",jiffy,"We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So the secret word has none of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: moist -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x) → M, O, S, T are not in the word. I is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).

Guess 3: build -> B(x), U(x), I(-), L(x), D(x) → B, U, L, D are not in the word. I is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).

So, from all the feedback:

- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D. That's 13 letters.

- We know that I is in the word, but it's not at position 1 (from ""moist"") and not at position 2 (from ""build""). So I must be at position 0, 3, or 4.

- We have to find a 5-letter word that includes I (at position 0, 3, or 4) and uses only the remaining available letters.

Available letters: We have 26 letters. Excluded: A, B, C, D, E, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U. So the available letters are: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But I is already known to be in the word, so we need to use I and four other letters from the available set, but note that I can be used only once? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates. However, to keep it simple, we can assume no duplicates for now.

We must include I, and we have to place it at position 0, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a word with the available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to think of words that have I in one of the allowed positions.

Let's try position 0 (first letter):

- Words starting with I: We need 4 more letters from the available set.

  - ""IGLOO"" → but G and L: L is excluded, and O excluded. Not possible.
  - ""ITCHY"" → I, T, C, H, Y → T and C are excluded.
  - ""INPUT"" → I, N, P, U, T → N, U, T excluded.
  - ""INKED"" → I, N, K, E, D → N, E, D excluded.

  It's hard. Let's think of words with I at the start and only available letters.

  Possible: ""IFFY"" → only 4 letters? Not 5.

  ""IGAPO"" → not common.

  ""IZZAT"" → not common.

  Maybe: ""IVORY"" → I, V, O, R, Y → O and R excluded.

  ""IVIED"" → I, V, I, E, D → E and D excluded, and repeated I.

  Not easy.

Position 3 (fourth letter):

- Words with I at index 3: ? ? ? I ?

  For example, ""FJORD"" but O and R excluded.

  ""SWING"" → S, W, I, N, G → S and N excluded.

  ""BLIMP"" → B, L, I, M, P → B, L, M excluded.

  ""CROWD"" → C, R, O, W, D → all excluded except W? But C, R, O, D excluded.

  With available letters: let's try to form one.

  Suppose: _ _ _ I _

  We need to fill the blanks with F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I is at 3, so we can use other letters).

  Examples: ""PIXIE"" → P, I, X, I, E → but E excluded, and I at index 1 and 3? Not at index 3 only.

  ""PIXIE"" has I at index 1 and 3? Positions: P(0), I(1), X(2), I(3), E(4). So I is at 1 and 3. But we are placing I at 3, but it also has I at 1? We don't want to use I at position 1 again because we know it's not the correct position for I (from previous feedback). Also, E is excluded.

  ""JUMPS"" → J, U, M, P, S → U, M, S excluded.

  ""QUIPS"" → Q, U, I, P, S → U and S excluded.

  ""QUIP"" is 4 letters.

  ""QUICK"" → Q, U, I, C, K → U and C excluded.

  ""WHIPS"" → W, H, I, P, S → S excluded.

  ""WHIFF"" → W, H, I, F, F → F is available, but repeated F? And we can try: W, H, I, F, F. But repeated letters might not be ideal, but allowed.

  But let's see: W, H, I, F, F. I is at position 2? If we have WHIFF: W(0), H(1), I(2), F(3), F(4). But we want I at position 3? Here I is at index 2, which we already know is wrong (from ""build"" feedback, I at index2 was wrong). So we shouldn't put I at index2 again.

  We need I at index3.

  So for position 3: _ _ _ I _ 

  Example: ""CIVIC"" → C, I, V, I, C → C excluded and I at multiple positions.

  ""VIGIL"" → V, I, G, I, L → I at index1 and 3? And L excluded.

  ""FJORD"" not possible.

  How about ""PYXIS"" → P, Y, X, I, S → S excluded.

  ""TAXIS"" → T, A, X, I, S → T, A, S excluded.

  ""HEXAD"" → H, E, X, A, D → E, A, D excluded.

  This is difficult.

Position 4 (last letter):

- Words ending with I: ? ? ? ? I

  Examples: ""TAXI"" → 4 letters? ""TAXIS"" is 5 but ends with S.

  ""RADII"" → R, A, D, I, I → R, A, D excluded, and repeated I.

  ""AALII"" → A, A, L, I, I → A and L excluded.

  ""GASSY"" → not ending with I.

  With available letters: _ _ _ _ I

  We need a word that ends with I and uses F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z for the first four letters.

  Common words: ""SAFARI"" → S, A, F, A, R, I? 6 letters. No.

  ""SUSHI"" → S, U, S, H, I → S and U excluded.

  ""PIZZA"" → ends with A, not I.

  ""KIOSK"" → ends with K.

  ""QURSH"" → not ending with I.

  ""YOGI"" → 4 letters.

  ""ENVOI"" → E, N, V, O, I → E, N, O excluded.

  ""BANNS"" → not I.

  It seems rare for English words to end with I, except for some plurals or specific words.

  ""TAXI"" is 4, ""TAXIS"" is 5 but ends with S.

  ""ALIBI"" → A, L, I, B, I → A, L, B excluded, and repeated I.

  ""OMLAH"" → not.

  Perhaps ""KANZI"" → K, A, N, Z, I → A and N excluded.

  This is challenging.

Given the difficulty, let's list all possible words that can be formed with the available letters and include I.

Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And I must be in the word, at position 0, 3, or 4.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Let me think of common words:

- ""PIQUE"" → P, I, Q, U, E → U and E excluded.

- ""QUIZ"" → 4 letters.

- ""JAZZY"" → no I.

- ""FUZZY"" → no I.

- ""JIFFY"" → J, I, F, F, Y → has I at index1. But we know index1 is wrong for I, so if we use it, we'll get '-' again for I at index1, which we already know. But we can use it to test other letters? However, we have limited guesses.

But let's see: ""jiffy"" has I at index1, which is not allowed? We can use it, but we know that position is wrong, so it won't help us find the correct position of I. But it might help test other letters.

But we have to include I, and we know it's in the word, so we can try to put it in a new position to find where it belongs.

But we have only positions 0, 3, 4 left to try.

So we should try one of these.

Another idea: ""WIFEY"" → W, I, F, E, Y → E is excluded. Not valid.

""PICKY"" → P, I, C, K, Y → C excluded.

""VINYL"" → V, I, N, Y, L → N and L excluded.

""WINZY"" -> W, I, N, Z, Y -> N excluded.

""FIXED"" -> F, I, X, E, D -> E and D excluded.

""JIVED"" -> J, I, V, E, D -> E and D excluded.

""KIBBE"" -> K, I, B, B, E -> B and E excluded.

""PZAZZ"" -> no I.

Perhaps we need to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don't have any indication.

Another word: ""HIJAB"" -> H, I, J, A, B -> A and B excluded.

""FIQUE"" -> F, I, Q, U, E -> U and E excluded.

""BIFFY"" -> B, I, F, F, Y -> B excluded.

We are missing some letters. Let's list available again: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What about ""WHIZZ"" -> W, H, I, Z, Z -> has I at index2. But we know from ""build"" that index2 is wrong for I. So if we use ""WHIZZ"", I is at index2, which is not correct, so we'll get '-' for I, and we don't learn new position.

But we can test W, H, Z.

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6).

We need to find the word.

Perhaps ""PIXIE"" but E excluded.

""PIXY"" -> 4 letters.

""PIXIE"" is 5 but has E.

""JINKS"" -> J, I, N, K, S -> N and S excluded.

""KICKS"" -> K, I, C, K, S -> C and S excluded.

""PICKS"" -> P, I, C, K, S -> C and S excluded.

""FIFTH"" -> F, I, F, T, H -> T excluded.

""GIGHE"" -> not common.

""ZIPPY"" -> Z, I, P, P, Y -> has I at index1, which is wrong.

But let's consider using it to test other letters.

However, we know I is in the word, so we must include it, but we can put it in a position we haven't tried, like index0 or index3 or index4.

Let's try to find words with I at index0:

- ""IGAPO"" -> not common.
- ""IKONS"" -> I, K, O, N, S -> O, N, S excluded.
- ""ILEAC"" -> I, L, E, A, C -> L, E, A, C excluded.
- ""ILEUM"" -> I, L, E, U, M -> L, E, U, M excluded.
- ""IMAGE"" -> I, M, A, G, E -> M, A, E excluded.
- ""INBYE"" -> I, N, B, Y, E -> N, B, E excluded.
- ""INFIX"" -> I, N, F, I, X -> N excluded, and repeated I.
- ""INKER"" -> I, N, K, E, R -> N, E, R excluded.
- ""INLAY"" -> I, N, L, A, Y -> N, L, A excluded.
- ""IVIED"" -> I, V, I, E, D -> E, D excluded, repeated I.
- ""IZARD"" -> I, Z, A, R, D -> A, R, D excluded.

Not working.

Index3:

- ""ABACI"" -> A, B, A, C, I -> A, B, C excluded.
- ""BENNI"" -> B, E, N, N, I -> B, E, N excluded.
- ""BOSKI"" -> B, O, S, K, I -> B, O, S excluded.
- ""CASKI"" -> C, A, S, K, I -> C, A, S excluded.
- ""DESHI"" -> D, E, S, H, I -> D, E, S excluded.
- ""DZHAL"" -> not common.
- ""FUSTI"" -> F, U, S, T, I -> U, S, T excluded.
- ""GASPI"" -> G, A, S, P, I -> A, S excluded.
- ""HIOIS"" -> not common.
- ""JUPON"" -> J, U, P, O, N -> U, O, N excluded.
- ""KAPUT"" -> K, A, P, U, T -> A, U, T excluded.
- ""KIVAS"" -> K, I, V, A, S -> I at index1, not 3. And A, S excluded.
- ""LEVIN"" -> L, E, V, I, N -> L, E, N excluded.
- ""LIPID"" -> L, I, P, I, D -> L, D excluded, and I at index1 and 3.
- ""MILPA"" -> M, I, L, P, A -> M, L, A excluded.
- ""NIXIE"" -> N, I, X, I, E -> N, E excluded.
- ""PARKI"" -> P, A, R, K, I -> A, R excluded.
- ""PINKO"" -> P, I, N, K, O -> I at index1, not 3. N, O excluded.
- ""PZAZZ"" -> no I.
- ""QUASI"" -> Q, U, A, S, I -> U, A, S excluded.
- ""QUENA"" -> Q, U, E, N, A -> U, E, N, A excluded.
- ""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U -> U excluded, and I at index2.
- ""RAUPO"" -> R, A, U, P, O -> all excluded.
- ""REIKI"" -> R, E, I, K, I -> R, E excluded.
- ""ROTTE"" -> not.
- ""SABZI"" -> S, A, B, Z, I -> S, A, B excluded.
- ""TACKI"" -> T, A, C, K, I -> T, A, C excluded.
- ""TAKKY"" -> not.
- ""TOPHI"" -> T, O, P, H, I -> T, O excluded.
- ""TUTTI"" -> T, U, T, T, I -> T, U excluded.
- ""VODOU"" -> not.
- ""YOGIC"" -> Y, O, G, I, C -> O, C excluded.
- ""YOGIS"" -> Y, O, G, I, S -> O, S excluded.
- ""ZAPPY"" -> no I.
- ""ZAXES"" -> no I.
- ""ZILCH"" -> Z, I, L, C, H -> L, C excluded.
- ""ZINCY"" -> Z, I, N, C, Y -> N, C excluded.
- ""ZIPPO"" -> Z, I, P, P, O -> O excluded.
- ""ZLOTY"" -> no I.
- ""ZOWIE"" -> Z, O, W, I, E -> O, E excluded.

This is taking too long. Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: ""PIING"" -> not a word.

""QOPH"" -> 4 letters.

""QOPHS"" -> Q, O, P, H, S -> O, S excluded.

""JACKY"" -> J, A, C, K, Y -> A, C excluded.

Perhaps ""WIGHT"" -> W, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.

""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.

""LIGHT"" -> L excluded.

""RIGHT"" -> R excluded.

""NIGHT"" -> N excluded.

""SIGHT"" -> S excluded.

"" might"" -> M excluded.

"" tight"" -> T excluded.

""WIGHT"" -> T excluded.

""FICHU"" -> F, I, C, H, U -> C, U excluded.

""FICHU"" is a word, but C and U are excluded.

""GIPSY"" -> G, I, P, S, Y -> S excluded.

""HIPPY"" -> H, I, P, P, Y -> has I at index1, which is wrong.

But let's consider using ""HIPPY"" to test H, P, Y. But I at index1 will give '-' and we know that.

We have to include I, so we have to use it.

Perhaps we can try a word with I at index4.

For example, ""ENVOI"" is a word, but E and O excluded.

""IMP"" -> 3 letters.

""KUDZU"" -> no I.

""YOGIN"" -> Y, O, G, I, N -> O, N excluded.

""YOGEE"" -> Y, O, G, E, E -> O, E excluded.

""YOGH"" -> 4 letters.

""YOGHS"" -> Y, O, G, H, S -> O, S excluded.

""YACKS"" -> Y, A, C, K, S -> A, C, S excluded.

""YAPOK"" -> Y, A, P, O, K -> A, O excluded.

""YIKES"" -> Y, I, K, E, S -> I at index1, and E, S excluded.

""YIPES"" -> Y, I, P, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YOWIE"" -> Y, O, W, I, E -> O, E excluded.

""ZAPPY"" -> Z, A, P, P, Y -> A excluded.

""ZEBRA"" -> Z, E, B, R, A -> E, B, R, A excluded.

""ZILAS"" -> not common.

""ZINCS"" -> Z, I, N, C, S -> N, C, S excluded.

""ZINGS"" -> Z, I, N, G, S -> N, S excluded.

""ZINKY"" -> Z, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.

""ZLOTE"" -> Z, L, O, T, E -> L, O, T, E excluded.

""ZOMBI"" -> Z, O, M, B, I -> O, M, B excluded.

""ZONED"" -> Z, O, N, E, D -> O, N, E, D excluded.

""ZOOID"" -> Z, O, O, I, D -> O, D excluded.

""ZOOMS"" -> Z, O, O, M, S -> O, M, S excluded.

""ZOWIE"" -> already considered.

Perhaps ""EXIST"" but E and S and T excluded.

I am considering that we might have missed a letter or something.

Another thought: in the feedback for ""moist"", I is '-', and for ""build"", I is '-', so I is in the word but not at position 1 or 2.

But in ""build"", I is at index2, which is the third position if counting from 1, but in programming, index starts at 0.

In ""moist"": m o i s t -> positions: 0:m, 1:o, 2:i, 3:s, 4:t. Feedback for I (at index2) is '-', so wrong position.

In ""build"": b u i l d -> positions: 0:b, 1:u, 2:i, 3:l, 4:d. Feedback for I (at index2) is '-', same position as in ""moist""? No, in ""moist"" I is at index2, and in ""build"" I is also at index2? That can't be right.

Let's double-check the feedback.

Guess 2: moist -> M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)

In ""moist"", the letters are: position 0: M, 1: O, 2: I, 3: S, 4: T.

Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x), so I is at position 2 (index2) and it is '-', meaning it's in the word but not at that position.

Guess 3: build -> B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)

In ""build"": position 0: B, 1: U, 2: I, 3: L, 4: D.

Feedback: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x), so I is at index2 again, and it's '-', which is consistent, but it doesn't give us new information about the position of I, because we already know index2 is wrong.

Oh no! In both guesses, I was at the same position (index2). That was a mistake in our previous guess. We should have put I in a different position.

In guess 3, we used ""build"" with I at index2, which is the same as in ""moist"", so we already knew it was wrong, so we wasted that position for I.

We should have put I at a new position.

For the next guess, we must put I at either index0, index3, or index4.

But from the available letters, it's hard to find a word.

Perhaps the word has I at index3 or index4, and we need to try.

Let's try ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E and L excluded.

""PIXIE"" -> P, I, X, I, E -> E excluded.

""JEWIE"" -> not a word.

""HEWGH"" -> no I.

""KIWI"" -> 4 letters.

""KIWIS"" -> K, I, W, I, S -> S excluded, and I at index1 and 4.

Index1 is wrong, index4 is new.

But S excluded.

""KIWIS"" has S, which is excluded.

""KIVAS"" -> K, I, V, A, S -> A and S excluded.

""VIFDA"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""FJORD"" is not possible.

Another idea: ""GYPSY"" -> G, Y, P, S, Y -> S excluded, and no I.

We must include I.

Perhaps ""PHIZ"" -> 4 letters.

""PHIZZ"" -> not common.

I think we need to consider that the secret word might have 'Y' as a vowel.

Let's try ""PYGMY"" -> P, Y, G, M, Y -> M excluded, no I.

""LYMPH"" -> L excluded.

""NYMPH"" -> N excluded.

""WYNDS"" -> W, Y, N, D, S -> N, D, S excluded.

""XYSTI"" -> X, Y, S, T, I -> S, T excluded.

""XYSTS"" -> no I.

""CRWTH"" -> C, R, W, T, H -> all excluded.

Perhaps ""QWERTY"" is 6 letters.

I am considering that we might have a mistake in the available letters.

List of all excluded letters from feedback:

From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E

From guess 2: M, O, S, T (and I is in, but positions wrong)

From guess 3: B, U, L, D (and I is in, but position wrong)

So excluded: A, B, C, D, E, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U

Available: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

And I is in the word.

Now, common words that use these letters and include I:

- ""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.
- ""WIGHT"" -> W, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.
- ""PIGHT"" -> not a word.
- ""SIGHT"" -> S excluded.
- ""HIGH"" -> 4 letters.
- ""HIGHT"" -> H, I, G, H, T -> T excluded, and repeated H.
- ""KIGHT"" -> not a word.
- "" might"" -> M excluded.
- ""night"" -> N excluded.
- ""right"" -> R excluded.
- ""tight"" -> T excluded.
- ""light"" -> L excluded.
- ""fight"" -> T excluded.

""JINGO"" -> J, I, N, G, O -> N, O excluded.

""KING"" -> 4 letters.

""PINGO"" -> P, I, N, G, O -> N, O excluded.

""WING"" -> 4 letters.

""ZING"" -> 4 letters.

""ZINGY"" -> Z, I, N, G, Y -> N excluded.

""VIGOR"" -> V, I, G, O, R -> O, R excluded.

""VIGOUR"" -> 6 letters.

""JIVY"" -> 4 letters.

""JIVEY"" -> not common.

""HIVED"" -> H, I, V, E, D -> E, D excluded.

""GIVED"" -> G, I, V, E, D -> E, D excluded.

""FIVER"" -> F, I, V, E, R -> E, R excluded.

""FIVES"" -> F, I, V, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""VIVID"" -> V, I, V, I, D -> D excluded, and repeated V and I.

""MINIM"" -> M excluded.

""PIKUL"" -> P, I, K, U, L -> U, L excluded.

""PIKAS"" -> P, I, K, A, S -> A, S excluded.

""KIPPS"" -> K, I, P, P, S -> S excluded.

""PIPIT"" -> P, I, P, I, T -> T excluded, repeated.

""TIPIS"" -> T, I, P, I, S -> T, S excluded.

""TIPSY"" -> T, I, P, S, Y -> T, S excluded.

""WIPER"" -> W, I, P, E, R -> E, R excluded.

""WIPES"" -> W, I, P, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YIPES"" -> Y, I, P, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YIKES"" -> Y, I, K, E, S -> E, S excluded.

""YIKES"" has I at index1, which is wrong.

Perhaps ""QUIP"" -> 4 letters.

""EQUIP"" -> E, Q, U, I, P -> E, U excluded.

""QUIPS"" -> Q, U, I, P, S -> U, S excluded.

""QUICK"" -> Q, U, I, C, K -> U, C excluded.

""JACKY"" -> J, A, C, K, Y -> A, C excluded.

I think we need to consider ""JIFFY"" or ""ZIPPY"" even though I is at index1.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y

Letters: J, I, F, Y. F is repeated, but it's allowed.

Available letters: J, I, F, Y are all available, and F is repeated.

But I is at index1, which we know is wrong, so it will be '-' for I, but we can test J, F, Y.

Similarly, ""ZIPPY"" -> Z, I, P, P, Y -> I at index1.

Or ""PIPPY"" -> P, I, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

But let's choose ""JIFFY"" as a guess.

Or ""KIFFY"" not a word.

""FJORD"" not.

Another word: ""WHIFF"" -> W, H, I, F, F -> I at index2, which we know is wrong (from previous feedback, index2 is wrong for I).

In ""moist"" and ""build"", I was at index2 and wrong, so if we put I at index2 again, it will be '-' again.

So for ""WHIFF"": positions 0:W, 1:H, 2:I, 3:F, 4:F. I at index2, so it will be '-', and we test W, H, F.

But F is repeated.

We have to make a guess.

Perhaps ""GHYLL"" -> not common.

I recall that ""GYPSY"" is a word, but no I and S excluded.

"" Cysts"" -> C and S excluded.

""SYLPH"" -> S excluded.

""TRYPS"" -> T, R, Y, P, S -> T, R, S excluded.

We are running out of options.

Let's try ""Pique"" but not.

Another idea: ""Yince"" not a word.

""YIKEs"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""WIZEN"" -> W, I, Z, E, N -> E, N excluded.

""WIZENED"" too long.

""WIZ"" 3 letters.

""WIZED"" -> W, I, Z, E, D -> E, D excluded.

""JAZZ"" 4 letters.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A excluded.

""HAJJI"" -> H, A, J, J, I -> A excluded, and J repeated.

""HAJ"" 3 letters.

"" FAKIR"" -> F, A, K, I, R -> A, R excluded.

""Fakir"" is a word, but A and R excluded.

""KAFIR"" -> K, A, F, I, R -> A, R excluded.

""KAFIR"" same.

""VIRUS"" -> V, I, R, U, S -> R, U, S excluded.

""VIRAL"" -> V, I, R, A, L -> R, A, L excluded.

""VIRGA"" -> V, I, R, G, A -> R, A excluded.

""VIRID"" -> V, I, R, I, D -> R, D excluded.

""VISOR"" -> V, I, S, O, R -> S, O, R excluded.

""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> S, T, A excluded.

""VITAE"" -> V, I, T, A, E -> T, A, E excluded.

""VITTA"" -> V, I, T, T, A -> T, A excluded.

""VIVID"" -> V, I, V, I, D -> D excluded.

""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> E, N excluded.

""VIZIR"" -> V, I, Z, I, R -> R excluded.

""VIZOR"" -> V, I, Z, O, R -> O, R excluded.

""VODKA"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> O, D, A excluded.

""VOLAR"" -> V, O, L, A, R -> O, L, A, R excluded.

""VOLED"" -> V, O, L, E, D -> O, L, E, D excluded.

""VOLKS"" -> not.

""VOLVE"" -> V, O, L, V, E -> O, L, E excluded.

""VOTED"" -> V, O, T, E, D -> O, T, E, D excluded.

""VOTES"" -> V, O, T, E, S -> O, T, E, S excluded.

""VOWED"" -> V, O, W, E, D -> O, E, D excluded.

""VOWER"" -> V, O, W, E, R -> O, E, R excluded.

""VOWEL"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> O, E, L excluded.

""Voxel"" -> V, O, X, E, L -> O, E, L excluded.

""VUGGY"" -> V, U, G, G, Y -> U excluded.

""VUGHS"" -> V, U, G, H, S -> U, S excluded.

""VULGO"" -> V, U, L, G, O -> U, L, O excluded.

""VYING"" -> V, Y, I, N, G -> N excluded, and I at index2, which is wrong.

""VYING"" has I at index2, which we know is wrong.

But let's see: V, Y, I, N, G -> N excluded, so not valid.

I think we have to try ""JIFFY"" or something similar.

Let's go with ""JIFFY"" as a guess.

So guess: jiffy

But I is at index1, which is wrong, but we test J, F, Y.

Or ""ZIPPY"" to test Z, P, Y.

But ""ZIPPY"" has I at index1.

Perhaps ""PIKed"" not.

Another word: ""Qajaq"" -> not common.

I recall that in Wordle, there is a word ""FAQIR"", but F, A, Q, I, R -> A and R excluded.

""FAQIR"" is not valid.

Perhaps the secret word is ""WICCA"", but W, I, C, C, A -> C and A excluded.

Or ""DIDIE"" not.

We might have to accept that we put I in a wrong position again, but we have to.

Let's choose ""WHIFF"" with I at index2, but we know it's wrong, but we test W, H, F.

But F is repeated.

""WHIFF"" -> W, H, I, F, F

Feedback will be: W(?) H(?) I(-) F(?) F(?) 

But since I is at index2, it will be '-', and we know that.

But we can learn about W, H, F.

If F is in the word, it might be 'x' or '-'.

But it's better than nothing.

Perhaps ""FJORD"" is not possible.

Another idea: ""PHIZ"" is 4 letters, ""PHIZZ"" is not common.

I think we should try ""JIFFY"".

So I'll go with ""jiffy"".

<guess>jiffy</guess>

But let's hope it's valid.",Guess 4: jiffy -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) I(✓) F(✓) F(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
