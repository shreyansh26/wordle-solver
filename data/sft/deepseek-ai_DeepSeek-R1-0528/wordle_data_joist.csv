First, I need to make my first guess for the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the potential for getting useful information.

The key principles for a good starting word in Wordle-style games are:
- Include letters that are common in English words, such as vowels and frequent consonants, to increase the chances of hitting letters in the secret word.
- Aim for a word with a balanced letter distribution to cover multiple possibilities.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc., because they appear frequently.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. A, E are vowels, and R, N are common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". I should pick one that covers a good range.

""CRANE"" has A, E (vowels), and C, R, N (consonants). It might be effective.

I could also consider ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels, but it has duplicate O, and it might not cover consonants well. Having duplicate letters isn't ideal because it wastes a guess slot; if the secret word has only one O, guessing ""AUDIO"" would only indicate O in one position or not, but it could be misleading. Better to avoid duplicates if possible.

""CRANE"" has no duplicate letters, which is good.

Letters frequency: According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

In ""CRANE"", I have C, R, A, N, E. That covers E, A, R, N—all high frequency.

C is less common, but still okay.

An alternative like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. S, T, L, A, E—all very common.

""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but has A, D, I, E, U. D and U are less common than some consonants.

For maximizing information, ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" seems solid.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there are no previous clues to analyze. So my thought process is based on common strategy.

Then, I must output the guessed word in the specified format.

So, my thought process:
- Choose a starting word with common letters to gather broad information.
- Ensure it has no repeating letters.
- ""CRANE"" includes E, A, R, N, C—common letters that can help identify vowels and consonants.
- After this guess, I'll get feedback to refine the next guesses.

Final output should be: <guess>CRANE</guess>

Since there's no prior feedback, I need a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are ideal because they increase the chances of matching letters in the secret word. A good starting word should also avoid duplicate letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, preventing redundancy.
- Based on English letter frequency, E and A are the most common vowels, while R, N, and C are relatively common consonants, potentially providing broad feedback.

This guess will help me identify correct positions, misplaced letters, or absent letters, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

Okay, the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess in this Wordle-style game. Looking at the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", all letters got marked as ""x"" – C, R, A, N, E are all absent in the secret word. That's quite surprising because these are common letters! 

Hmm, this means the secret word contains none of these letters. So I need to completely exclude C, R, A, N, E from consideration. That narrows down possibilities significantly. The word likely uses less common consonants and maybe different vowels. Letters like U, O, I could be vowels to prioritize now, along with consonants like S, T, L that haven't been tested yet.

Since none of those common letters appeared, perhaps the word has duplicates? No, the rules don't specify unique letters but feedback symbols don't indicate duplicates clearly. Still possible. 

For the next guess, I should avoid all previous letters and maximize new information. Possible candidates: ""SPLIT"" tests S, P, L, I – but I is the only vowel. ""MOUTH"" has O, U which are vowels not tested and common consonants M, T, H. ""GUIDE"" has G, U, I, D – but U and I haven't been checked, and E is already excluded. 

""MOUTH"" seems strong: M, O, U, T, H covers new vowels O/U and common T/H. M and H aren't too rare either. ""PILOT"" has reused O but L/T new – but O may be redundant if tested in ""MOUTH"". Since we need maximum new information, ""MOUTH"" gives five brand-new letters. 

Alternatively ""LIGHT"" – L, I, G, H, T – but lacks vowel variety. ""BUOYS"" has Y as vowel substitute? But less common. ""MOIST"" combines many common letters but O/I may cover vowels better. 

Between ""MOUTH"" and ""MOIST"", both have strengths. ""MOUTH"" includes U which is more distinctive while ""MOIST"" has S/T combo. Given previous miss, distinctiveness matters. So ""MOUTH"" it is – U and O in one guess give wider vowel coverage. 

Also confirms absence/presence of T/H which is useful for consonant structure. If secret word avoids common letters, testing mid-frequency characters like T/H might hit something. 

Final choice: ""MOUTH"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess **""CRANE""** (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word**. This means:
- The secret word contains no ""C"", ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- I need to choose a new guess that completely **avoids** these letters to test different vowels/consonants.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- Since common vowels (A, E) are excluded, prioritize other vowels like **O, U, I** and common consonants not yet tested (e.g., **S, T, L, M**).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize new information.
- Probable letters: High-frequency consonants like **S, T, L**, and vowels **O, U, I**.

Good candidate words:
- **""MOUTH""**: Tests M, O, U, T, H (all new letters). Covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, M, H).
- **""GHOUL""**: Tests G, H, O, U, L. Strong vowel coverage (O, U), but less common consonants (G).
- **""PILOT""**: Tests P, I, L, O, T. Solid mix of vowels (I, O) and essential consonants (L, T).

**Best choice: ""MOUTH""**  
Why?  
- It tests five completely new letters: two vowels (**O, U**) and three consonants (**M, T, H**).  
- These letters are moderately common and likely to appear in English words.
- Avoids wasted letters (all excluded from Guess 1).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the potential for getting useful information.

The key principles for a good starting word in Wordle-style games are:
- Include letters that are common in English words, such as vowels and frequent consonants, to increase the chances of hitting letters in the secret word.
- Aim for a word with a balanced letter distribution to cover multiple possibilities.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc., because they appear frequently.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. A, E are vowels, and R, N are common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". I should pick one that covers a good range.

""CRANE"" has A, E (vowels), and C, R, N (consonants). It might be effective.

I could also consider ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels, but it has duplicate O, and it might not cover consonants well. Having duplicate letters isn't ideal because it wastes a guess slot; if the secret word has only one O, guessing ""AUDIO"" would only indicate O in one position or not, but it could be misleading. Better to avoid duplicates if possible.

""CRANE"" has no duplicate letters, which is good.

Letters frequency: According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

In ""CRANE"", I have C, R, A, N, E. That covers E, A, R, N—all high frequency.

C is less common, but still okay.

An alternative like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. S, T, L, A, E—all very common.

""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but has A, D, I, E, U. D and U are less common than some consonants.

For maximizing information, ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" seems solid.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there are no previous clues to analyze. So my thought process is based on common strategy.

Then, I must output the guessed word in the specified format.

So, my thought process:
- Choose a starting word with common letters to gather broad information.
- Ensure it has no repeating letters.
- ""CRANE"" includes E, A, R, N, C—common letters that can help identify vowels and consonants.
- After this guess, I'll get feedback to refine the next guesses.

Final output should be: <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gather about the secret word.

Letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are ideal because they increase the chances of matching letters in the secret word. A good starting word should also avoid duplicate letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, preventing redundancy.
- Based on English letter frequency, E and A are the most common vowels, while R, N, and C are relatively common consonants, potentially providing broad feedback.

This guess will help me identify correct positions, misplaced letters, or absent letters, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess in this Wordle-style game. Looking at the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", all letters got marked as ""x"" – C, R, A, N, E are all absent in the secret word. That's quite surprising because these are common letters! 

Hmm, this means the secret word contains none of these letters. So I need to completely exclude C, R, A, N, E from consideration. That narrows down possibilities significantly. The word likely uses less common consonants and maybe different vowels. Letters like U, O, I could be vowels to prioritize now, along with consonants like S, T, L that haven't been tested yet.

Since none of those common letters appeared, perhaps the word has duplicates? No, the rules don't specify unique letters but feedback symbols don't indicate duplicates clearly. Still possible. 

For the next guess, I should avoid all previous letters and maximize new information. Possible candidates: ""SPLIT"" tests S, P, L, I – but I is the only vowel. ""MOUTH"" has O, U which are vowels not tested and common consonants M, T, H. ""GUIDE"" has G, U, I, D – but U and I haven't been checked, and E is already excluded. 

""MOUTH"" seems strong: M, O, U, T, H covers new vowels O/U and common T/H. M and H aren't too rare either. ""PILOT"" has reused O but L/T new – but O may be redundant if tested in ""MOUTH"". Since we need maximum new information, ""MOUTH"" gives five brand-new letters. 

Alternatively ""LIGHT"" – L, I, G, H, T – but lacks vowel variety. ""BUOYS"" has Y as vowel substitute? But less common. ""MOIST"" combines many common letters but O/I may cover vowels better. 

Between ""MOUTH"" and ""MOIST"", both have strengths. ""MOUTH"" includes U which is more distinctive while ""MOIST"" has S/T combo. Given previous miss, distinctiveness matters. So ""MOUTH"" it is – U and O in one guess give wider vowel coverage. 

Also confirms absence/presence of T/H which is useful for consonant structure. If secret word avoids common letters, testing mid-frequency characters like T/H might hit something. 

Final choice: ""MOUTH"".Based on the feedback from the first guess **""CRANE""** (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word**. This means:
- The secret word contains no ""C"", ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- I need to choose a new guess that completely **avoids** these letters to test different vowels/consonants.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- Since common vowels (A, E) are excluded, prioritize other vowels like **O, U, I** and common consonants not yet tested (e.g., **S, T, L, M**).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize new information.
- Probable letters: High-frequency consonants like **S, T, L**, and vowels **O, U, I**.

Good candidate words:
- **""MOUTH""**: Tests M, O, U, T, H (all new letters). Covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, M, H).
- **""GHOUL""**: Tests G, H, O, U, L. Strong vowel coverage (O, U), but less common consonants (G).
- **""PILOT""**: Tests P, I, L, O, T. Solid mix of vowels (I, O) and essential consonants (L, T).

**Best choice: ""MOUTH""**  
Why?  
- It tests five completely new letters: two vowels (**O, U**) and three consonants (**M, T, H**).  
- These letters are moderately common and likely to appear in English words.
- Avoids wasted letters (all excluded from Guess 1).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters are absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x)

Breaking down the feedback for MOUTH:
- O is correct and in the correct position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed T in the fourth position and it's marked as misplaced).
- M, U, H are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain M, U, or H.

Given that, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also know that from the first guess, we excluded A and E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O (which we have), and possibly Y. But O is already confirmed.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
1. Have O in the second position to match the correct placement.
2. Include the letter T, but not in the fourth position (since it's misplaced there). So T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
3. Avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also want to test new common letters to gather more information. Common letters we haven't tested yet include: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.

Possible positions for T:
- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _
- If T is in position 3: _ O T _ _
- If T is in position 5: _ O _ _ T

We should design a guess that can help us narrow down the position of T and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the second position.
- Must contain T, but not in the fourth position.
- No C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We can consider words like:
- Position 1: T O ... ? 
  - Example: TOILS (but S is new, I is new, L is new) - but we have to check if letters are allowed. TOILS: T, O, I, L, S. O is fixed in second, T in first. But we don't know if T is in first. Also, we have to avoid excluded letters: TOILS is okay? T, O, I, L, S. None of the excluded letters are in it. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H. So TOILS is valid.

- Position 3: _ O T ... 
  - Example: LOTUS, but U is excluded. Not allowed. 
  - Another: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - POINT? But P, O, I, N, T -> N is excluded (from first guess). Not allowed.

- Position 5: _ O _ _ T
  - Example: BOOST? But O is duplicated and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in MOUTH, O was correct and we don't have any duplicate feedback, so we don't know. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary. Also, BOOST has O twice, and we have O already fixed. But let's avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

We need to test new letters. We haven't tested: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, F, V, W, K, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has T in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me try to form a word with T in position 1: T O _ _ _

We need three more letters, avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, W, Y, etc. (but O is already used, and we don't want to duplicate unless necessary).

But we can use O again? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know. But since we have O fixed, and we don't have any indication of a duplicate, it's safer to avoid O in other positions to test more letters.

So for T O _ _ _, we can have:

- T O I _ _ : e.g., TOILS (T,O,I,L,S) -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. But we have T in position 1, which is a possibility. Also, we can test I, L, S.

But note: in MOUTH, T was misplaced in position 4, but now we are putting T in position 1. That's okay because we know T is not in position 4, but it could be in 1.

Another option: T O W _ _ : TOWEL? But E is excluded. Not allowed. TOWED? E excluded. TOWN? W and N, but N is excluded. Not good.

T O P _ _ : TOPIC? C is excluded. TOPAZ? A and Z, A excluded. Not good.

T O K _ _ : TOKEN? E and N excluded. Not good.

T O L _ _ : TOLES? E excluded. TOLYL? Not a word. TOLUS? U excluded.

So TOILS seems a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S. All new letters and not excluded.

What about T in position 3: _ O T _ _

We need first letter, then O, then T, then two more.

First letter: cannot be excluded, so from available: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, W, Y, etc.

Examples:
- B O T _ _ : BOTCH? C and H excluded. BOTHY? H excluded. BOTEL? E excluded. Not good.
- D O T _ _ : DOTED? E excluded. DOTAL? A excluded. Not good.
- G O T _ _ : GOTHS? H excluded. GOTTA? A excluded. Not good.
- L O T _ _ : LOTAS? A excluded? A is excluded. LOTUS? U excluded. 
- P O T _ _ : POTTY? T duplicate? We don't know. But also Y is new. But T is already in the word? We are putting T in position 3, and if the word has another T? But we don't know. POTSY? S and Y. But is POTSY a word? It might be obscure. Let's avoid for now.
- S O T _ _ : SOTOL? O duplicate? S,O,T,O,L -> two O's. But we don't know if O is duplicated. Also, L is new. But SOTOL is a word? It's a plant, but might be accepted. However, we have O again, which we already know is in the word, so it might be better to test new letters.

Not many good options for T in position 3.

Now, T in position 5: _ O _ _ T

Examples:
- B O _ _ T: BOAST? A and S, but A excluded. BOOST? O duplicate. BOLT? Only 4 letters. Need 5.
- D O _ _ T: DOUBT? U excluded. DOWNT? Not a word.
- F O _ _ T: FOIST? O, I, S, T. But O is in second, then I in third? FOIST: F, O, I, S, T. So positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. This avoids excluded letters: F, O, I, S, T. O is fixed, T is in position 5 (which is allowed, since T is not in position 4). And we test F, I, S.

Similarly, G O _ _ T: GOALT? Not a word. GOOST? Not a word. GORST? Not common.
- L O _ _ T: LOIST? O, I, S, T. LOIST: L, O, I, S, T. Similar to FOIST but with L instead of F.
- P O _ _ T: POINT? N excluded. POULT? U excluded. POIST? Not a word.
- S O _ _ T: SOFAT? F and A, A excluded. SORT? 4 letters. SOOTY? O duplicate and Y. But SOOTY: S, O, O, T, Y. We have O again and Y.

So good candidates are:
- TOILS: T in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.
- FOIST: F in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5.
- LOIST: L in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5. (LOIST is a word? It might be archaic, but Wordle often accepts such words. Let me confirm: LOIST is not in standard dictionaries, but it might be in Wordle's word list. To be safe, we can use a more common word.)

Another common word: POSIT? But that's 5 letters: P, O, S, I, T. But then T is in position 5, and O in 2. But POSIT: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That works. And it's a common word.

Similarly, FOIST is also common.

But in POSIT, we have S and I, which are common.

Now, comparing TOILS and POSIT/FOIST:

- TOILS: T in position 1. But we don't know if T is in position 1. If we guess TOILS and T is not in position 1, we might get feedback that T is misplaced (if it's in the word but wrong position) or absent (if it's not in the word? but we know T is in the word, so it would be misplaced). But we know T is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it's not there, it will be marked as misplaced.

Similarly, in POSIT, T is in position 5.

We want to test the position of T.

Also, we want to test new letters.

In TOILS, we test T, I, L, S (O is fixed and known).

In POSIT, we test P, O, S, I, T (O and T are known to be in the word, but we are testing positions).

We also have to consider that in MOUTH, T was in position 4 and was misplaced. So T cannot be in position 4. In TOILS, we put T in 1, L in 4. In POSIT, we put S in 3? POSIT: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. So position 4 is I, not T, so that's fine.

But we are testing T in position 5 in POSIT.

Now, which one to choose? We can also consider the frequency of letters.

We haven't tested S, L, I, P, F, etc.

Another candidate: if we put T in position 3, but we didn't find a great word. What about ""DOGIE""? But E excluded. Not good.

""POLIT""? But L and I, but POLIT: P, O, L, I, T. Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T. That's similar to POSIT but with L instead of S. And POLIT is a word? It might be less common.

I think POSIT is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in the first or last, to force it to be in position 3? But we didn't find a common word.

Another idea: since T is not in position 4, and we have O in 2, we can try to have T in position 3 and use common letters.

For example, ""POTSY""? P, O, T, S, Y. But Y is less common. And is it a word? POTS is a word, but POTSY? Not standard.

""LOFTY""? But F, T, Y. And O in 2? LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y. Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:F, 4:T, 5:Y. But in position 4, we are putting T. But from feedback, T is not in position 4 (because in MOUTH, T in position 4 was misplaced). So we cannot put T in position 4 again. That would be invalid because we know T is not there.

So in any new guess, we must not put T in position 4.

Therefore, in LOFTY, if we put T in position 4, it would be wrong because we know it's not there. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 4 for T.

So for TOILS: T in 1, L in 4 -> L is new, so that's fine.
For POSIT: I in 4, T in 5 -> fine.

Now, let's choose between TOILS and POSIT.

We can also consider ""FOIST"" which is similar to POSIT but with F.

But F is less common than P or S? In English, S is very common.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J is less common.

""HOIST"" - but H is excluded from MOUTH feedback (H(x)).

H is excluded, so we cannot use H.

So HOIST is invalid.

Therefore, FOIST or POSIT.

POSIT is more common.

But let's see the letters: in POSIT, we have P, O, S, I, T.

We test P, S, I.

In TOILS, we have T, O, I, L, S. We test T (position), I, L, S.

Both test I and S, but TOILS tests L and POSIT tests P.

L is more common than P? According to letter frequency, S is the most common, then I, then L, then P? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have exclusions.

Since E, A, O (partially), etc. are excluded, we focus on remaining.

S, I, L, D, P, etc.

S is very common, I is common, L is common, P is less common than S and I.

So TOILS tests S, I, L and also T (which we know is present).

POSIT tests S, I, P and T.

But in TOILS, we are putting T in position 1, which might be risky if T is actually in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, we put T in position 5.

We can choose a word that doesn't commit to a specific position for T but still includes it? But we have to place it somewhere.

Another idea: use a word with T in position 3, but we need a valid word.

What about ""DOZIT""? Not a word.

""KOFTI""? Not common.

I think TOILS or POSIT are fine.

But let's consider the feedback from MOUTH: we have O correct in position 2, and T misplaced. So the word has O in second and T somewhere else.

In TOILS, if we guess:
- If T is in position 1, and if it is correct, we get T(✓), then we know position 1 is T.
- If T is not in position 1, we get T(-) meaning misplaced, and we know it must be in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, if T is in position 5, if correct, we know; if not, it must be in 1 or 3.

But we don't have a word that avoids putting T in a specific position.

We could choose a word that has T in position 3? Let me try to find one.

For example, ""BOITE""? But E excluded and O duplicate? BOITE: B,O,I,T,E -> E excluded.

""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> U excluded.

""TOWIE""? W, I, E -> E excluded.

Not finding good options.

""GOATS""? A excluded.

So I think we should go with either TOILS or POSIT.

I'll choose POSIT because it's a common word and tests P, which is new, and S and I.

In POSIT, we have:
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: O (known correct)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: I (new)
- Position 5: T (known present, but testing position)

This will give us information about the position of T and also test P, S, I.

If P is in the word, we'll know; similarly for S and I.

Also, if I is in the word and in position 4, etc.

So let's go with POSIT.

But we must ensure that the word is valid. POSIT is a valid Wordle word.

Another common word is ""SPOIL"", but that has O in second? S P O I L -> position 2 is P? No, position 2 is O? Let's see: S (1), P (2)? No, SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L -> so position 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:I, 5:L. But we need O in position 2, so that would be wrong. We must have O in position 2.

So we cannot use SPOIL because it has O in position 3.

Similarly, any guess must have O in the second position.

So POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That matches.

Similarly, FOIST: F, O, I, S, T -> same positions.

I think I'll go with POSIT.

But in the feedback, we have T misplaced from position 4, and in POSIT we are putting I in position 4. That's fine.

So my next guess: POSIT.

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H are excluded. POSIT has P,O,S,I,T — none of these are excluded. O is allowed because it's in the word, but we are using it again, which is fine.

So I think it's good.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains **none** of these letters.
- **Guess 2: MOUTH** → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x). This tells us:
  - **O is correct and in position 2** (so the secret word has O as the second letter: `_ O _ _ _`).
  - **T is present but misplaced** (so T is in the word, but not in position 4).
  - M, U, and H are absent (so the secret word contains none of these).
- **Excluded letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H (cannot be used in new guesses).
- **Key constraints for the next guess**:
  - Must have **O in position 2**.
  - Must include **T**, but **not in position 4** (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, B, G, Y) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test the position of T (positions 1, 3, or 5) while introducing new high-frequency letters to maximize information. Common untested letters like S, I, L, and P are good candidates.
- **Word selection**:
  - Considered words like **TOILS** (T in position 1, tests I, L, S) and **FOIST** (T in position 5, tests F, I, S), but **POSIT** was chosen because:
    - It places O in position 2 (required).
    - It places T in position 5 (testing if T is at the end, which is a valid possibility).
    - It tests three new common letters: **P** (position 1), **S** (position 3), and **I** (position 4).
    - All letters (P, O, S, I, T) are distinct and not excluded.
    - ""POSIT"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""to assume as fact"").
- **Expected outcomes**:
  - If P, S, or I are correct or misplaced, it will reveal their status/position.
  - If T is in position 5, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be misplaced (-) and must be in position 1 or 3.
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>POSIT</guess>",POSIT,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters are absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x)

Breaking down the feedback for MOUTH:
- O is correct and in the correct position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed T in the fourth position and it's marked as misplaced).
- M, U, H are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain M, U, or H.

Given that, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also know that from the first guess, we excluded A and E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O (which we have), and possibly Y. But O is already confirmed.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
1. Have O in the second position to match the correct placement.
2. Include the letter T, but not in the fourth position (since it's misplaced there). So T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
3. Avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also want to test new common letters to gather more information. Common letters we haven't tested yet include: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.

Possible positions for T:
- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _
- If T is in position 3: _ O T _ _
- If T is in position 5: _ O _ _ T

We should design a guess that can help us narrow down the position of T and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the second position.
- Must contain T, but not in the fourth position.
- No C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We can consider words like:
- Position 1: T O ... ? 
  - Example: TOILS (but S is new, I is new, L is new) - but we have to check if letters are allowed. TOILS: T, O, I, L, S. O is fixed in second, T in first. But we don't know if T is in first. Also, we have to avoid excluded letters: TOILS is okay? T, O, I, L, S. None of the excluded letters are in it. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H. So TOILS is valid.

- Position 3: _ O T ... 
  - Example: LOTUS, but U is excluded. Not allowed. 
  - Another: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - POINT? But P, O, I, N, T -> N is excluded (from first guess). Not allowed.

- Position 5: _ O _ _ T
  - Example: BOOST? But O is duplicated and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in MOUTH, O was correct and we don't have any duplicate feedback, so we don't know. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary. Also, BOOST has O twice, and we have O already fixed. But let's avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

We need to test new letters. We haven't tested: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, F, V, W, K, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has T in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me try to form a word with T in position 1: T O _ _ _

We need three more letters, avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, W, Y, etc. (but O is already used, and we don't want to duplicate unless necessary).

But we can use O again? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know. But since we have O fixed, and we don't have any indication of a duplicate, it's safer to avoid O in other positions to test more letters.

So for T O _ _ _, we can have:

- T O I _ _ : e.g., TOILS (T,O,I,L,S) -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. But we have T in position 1, which is a possibility. Also, we can test I, L, S.

But note: in MOUTH, T was misplaced in position 4, but now we are putting T in position 1. That's okay because we know T is not in position 4, but it could be in 1.

Another option: T O W _ _ : TOWEL? But E is excluded. Not allowed. TOWED? E excluded. TOWN? W and N, but N is excluded. Not good.

T O P _ _ : TOPIC? C is excluded. TOPAZ? A and Z, A excluded. Not good.

T O K _ _ : TOKEN? E and N excluded. Not good.

T O L _ _ : TOLES? E excluded. TOLYL? Not a word. TOLUS? U excluded.

So TOILS seems a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S. All new letters and not excluded.

What about T in position 3: _ O T _ _

We need first letter, then O, then T, then two more.

First letter: cannot be excluded, so from available: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, W, Y, etc.

Examples:
- B O T _ _ : BOTCH? C and H excluded. BOTHY? H excluded. BOTEL? E excluded. Not good.
- D O T _ _ : DOTED? E excluded. DOTAL? A excluded. Not good.
- G O T _ _ : GOTHS? H excluded. GOTTA? A excluded. Not good.
- L O T _ _ : LOTAS? A excluded? A is excluded. LOTUS? U excluded. 
- P O T _ _ : POTTY? T duplicate? We don't know. But also Y is new. But T is already in the word? We are putting T in position 3, and if the word has another T? But we don't know. POTSY? S and Y. But is POTSY a word? It might be obscure. Let's avoid for now.
- S O T _ _ : SOTOL? O duplicate? S,O,T,O,L -> two O's. But we don't know if O is duplicated. Also, L is new. But SOTOL is a word? It's a plant, but might be accepted. However, we have O again, which we already know is in the word, so it might be better to test new letters.

Not many good options for T in position 3.

Now, T in position 5: _ O _ _ T

Examples:
- B O _ _ T: BOAST? A and S, but A excluded. BOOST? O duplicate. BOLT? Only 4 letters. Need 5.
- D O _ _ T: DOUBT? U excluded. DOWNT? Not a word.
- F O _ _ T: FOIST? O, I, S, T. But O is in second, then I in third? FOIST: F, O, I, S, T. So positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. This avoids excluded letters: F, O, I, S, T. O is fixed, T is in position 5 (which is allowed, since T is not in position 4). And we test F, I, S.

Similarly, G O _ _ T: GOALT? Not a word. GOOST? Not a word. GORST? Not common.
- L O _ _ T: LOIST? O, I, S, T. LOIST: L, O, I, S, T. Similar to FOIST but with L instead of F.
- P O _ _ T: POINT? N excluded. POULT? U excluded. POIST? Not a word.
- S O _ _ T: SOFAT? F and A, A excluded. SORT? 4 letters. SOOTY? O duplicate and Y. But SOOTY: S, O, O, T, Y. We have O again and Y.

So good candidates are:
- TOILS: T in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.
- FOIST: F in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5.
- LOIST: L in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5. (LOIST is a word? It might be archaic, but Wordle often accepts such words. Let me confirm: LOIST is not in standard dictionaries, but it might be in Wordle's word list. To be safe, we can use a more common word.)

Another common word: POSIT? But that's 5 letters: P, O, S, I, T. But then T is in position 5, and O in 2. But POSIT: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That works. And it's a common word.

Similarly, FOIST is also common.

But in POSIT, we have S and I, which are common.

Now, comparing TOILS and POSIT/FOIST:

- TOILS: T in position 1. But we don't know if T is in position 1. If we guess TOILS and T is not in position 1, we might get feedback that T is misplaced (if it's in the word but wrong position) or absent (if it's not in the word? but we know T is in the word, so it would be misplaced). But we know T is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it's not there, it will be marked as misplaced.

Similarly, in POSIT, T is in position 5.

We want to test the position of T.

Also, we want to test new letters.

In TOILS, we test T, I, L, S (O is fixed and known).

In POSIT, we test P, O, S, I, T (O and T are known to be in the word, but we are testing positions).

We also have to consider that in MOUTH, T was in position 4 and was misplaced. So T cannot be in position 4. In TOILS, we put T in 1, L in 4. In POSIT, we put S in 3? POSIT: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. So position 4 is I, not T, so that's fine.

But we are testing T in position 5 in POSIT.

Now, which one to choose? We can also consider the frequency of letters.

We haven't tested S, L, I, P, F, etc.

Another candidate: if we put T in position 3, but we didn't find a great word. What about ""DOGIE""? But E excluded. Not good.

""POLIT""? But L and I, but POLIT: P, O, L, I, T. Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T. That's similar to POSIT but with L instead of S. And POLIT is a word? It might be less common.

I think POSIT is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in the first or last, to force it to be in position 3? But we didn't find a common word.

Another idea: since T is not in position 4, and we have O in 2, we can try to have T in position 3 and use common letters.

For example, ""POTSY""? P, O, T, S, Y. But Y is less common. And is it a word? POTS is a word, but POTSY? Not standard.

""LOFTY""? But F, T, Y. And O in 2? LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y. Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:F, 4:T, 5:Y. But in position 4, we are putting T. But from feedback, T is not in position 4 (because in MOUTH, T in position 4 was misplaced). So we cannot put T in position 4 again. That would be invalid because we know T is not there.

So in any new guess, we must not put T in position 4.

Therefore, in LOFTY, if we put T in position 4, it would be wrong because we know it's not there. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 4 for T.

So for TOILS: T in 1, L in 4 -> L is new, so that's fine.
For POSIT: I in 4, T in 5 -> fine.

Now, let's choose between TOILS and POSIT.

We can also consider ""FOIST"" which is similar to POSIT but with F.

But F is less common than P or S? In English, S is very common.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J is less common.

""HOIST"" - but H is excluded from MOUTH feedback (H(x)).

H is excluded, so we cannot use H.

So HOIST is invalid.

Therefore, FOIST or POSIT.

POSIT is more common.

But let's see the letters: in POSIT, we have P, O, S, I, T.

We test P, S, I.

In TOILS, we have T, O, I, L, S. We test T (position), I, L, S.

Both test I and S, but TOILS tests L and POSIT tests P.

L is more common than P? According to letter frequency, S is the most common, then I, then L, then P? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have exclusions.

Since E, A, O (partially), etc. are excluded, we focus on remaining.

S, I, L, D, P, etc.

S is very common, I is common, L is common, P is less common than S and I.

So TOILS tests S, I, L and also T (which we know is present).

POSIT tests S, I, P and T.

But in TOILS, we are putting T in position 1, which might be risky if T is actually in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, we put T in position 5.

We can choose a word that doesn't commit to a specific position for T but still includes it? But we have to place it somewhere.

Another idea: use a word with T in position 3, but we need a valid word.

What about ""DOZIT""? Not a word.

""KOFTI""? Not common.

I think TOILS or POSIT are fine.

But let's consider the feedback from MOUTH: we have O correct in position 2, and T misplaced. So the word has O in second and T somewhere else.

In TOILS, if we guess:
- If T is in position 1, and if it is correct, we get T(✓), then we know position 1 is T.
- If T is not in position 1, we get T(-) meaning misplaced, and we know it must be in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, if T is in position 5, if correct, we know; if not, it must be in 1 or 3.

But we don't have a word that avoids putting T in a specific position.

We could choose a word that has T in position 3? Let me try to find one.

For example, ""BOITE""? But E excluded and O duplicate? BOITE: B,O,I,T,E -> E excluded.

""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> U excluded.

""TOWIE""? W, I, E -> E excluded.

Not finding good options.

""GOATS""? A excluded.

So I think we should go with either TOILS or POSIT.

I'll choose POSIT because it's a common word and tests P, which is new, and S and I.

In POSIT, we have:
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: O (known correct)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: I (new)
- Position 5: T (known present, but testing position)

This will give us information about the position of T and also test P, S, I.

If P is in the word, we'll know; similarly for S and I.

Also, if I is in the word and in position 4, etc.

So let's go with POSIT.

But we must ensure that the word is valid. POSIT is a valid Wordle word.

Another common word is ""SPOIL"", but that has O in second? S P O I L -> position 2 is P? No, position 2 is O? Let's see: S (1), P (2)? No, SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L -> so position 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:I, 5:L. But we need O in position 2, so that would be wrong. We must have O in position 2.

So we cannot use SPOIL because it has O in position 3.

Similarly, any guess must have O in the second position.

So POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That matches.

Similarly, FOIST: F, O, I, S, T -> same positions.

I think I'll go with POSIT.

But in the feedback, we have T misplaced from position 4, and in POSIT we are putting I in position 4. That's fine.

So my next guess: POSIT.

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H are excluded. POSIT has P,O,S,I,T — none of these are excluded. O is allowed because it's in the word, but we are using it again, which is fine.

So I think it's good.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains **none** of these letters.
- **Guess 2: MOUTH** → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x). This tells us:
  - **O is correct and in position 2** (so the secret word has O as the second letter: `_ O _ _ _`).
  - **T is present but misplaced** (so T is in the word, but not in position 4).
  - M, U, and H are absent (so the secret word contains none of these).
- **Excluded letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H (cannot be used in new guesses).
- **Key constraints for the next guess**:
  - Must have **O in position 2**.
  - Must include **T**, but **not in position 4** (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, B, G, Y) to gather more information.

The key principles for a good starting word in Wordle-style games are:
- Include letters that are common in English words, such as vowels and frequent consonants, to increase the chances of hitting letters in the secret word.
- Aim for a word with a balanced letter distribution to cover multiple possibilities.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc., because they appear frequently.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. A, E are vowels, and R, N are common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". I should pick one that covers a good range.

""CRANE"" has A, E (vowels), and C, R, N (consonants). It might be effective.

I could also consider ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels, but it has duplicate O, and it might not cover consonants well. Having duplicate letters isn't ideal because it wastes a guess slot; if the secret word has only one O, guessing ""AUDIO"" would only indicate O in one position or not, but it could be misleading. Better to avoid duplicates if possible.

""CRANE"" has no duplicate letters, which is good.

Letters frequency: According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

In ""CRANE"", I have C, R, A, N, E. That covers E, A, R, N—all high frequency.

C is less common, but still okay.

An alternative like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. S, T, L, A, E—all very common.

""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but has A, D, I, E, U. D and U are less common than some consonants.

For maximizing information, ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" seems solid.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there are no previous clues to analyze. So my thought process is based on common strategy.

Then, I must output the guessed word in the specified format.

So, my thought process:
- Choose a starting word with common letters to gather broad information.
- Ensure it has no repeating letters.
- ""CRANE"" includes E, A, R, N, C—common letters that can help identify vowels and consonants.
- After this guess, I'll get feedback to refine the next guesses.

Final output should be: <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gather about the secret word. Since there's no prior feedback, I need a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are ideal because they increase the chances of matching letters in the secret word. A good starting word should also avoid duplicate letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, preventing redundancy.
- Based on English letter frequency, E and A are the most common vowels, while R, N, and C are relatively common consonants, potentially providing broad feedback.

This guess will help me identify correct positions, misplaced letters, or absent letters, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess in this Wordle-style game. Looking at the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", all letters got marked as ""x"" – C, R, A, N, E are all absent in the secret word. That's quite surprising because these are common letters! 

Hmm, this means the secret word contains none of these letters. So I need to completely exclude C, R, A, N, E from consideration. That narrows down possibilities significantly. The word likely uses less common consonants and maybe different vowels. Letters like U, O, I could be vowels to prioritize now, along with consonants like S, T, L that haven't been tested yet.

Since none of those common letters appeared, perhaps the word has duplicates? No, the rules don't specify unique letters but feedback symbols don't indicate duplicates clearly. Still possible. 

For the next guess, I should avoid all previous letters and maximize new information. Possible candidates: ""SPLIT"" tests S, P, L, I – but I is the only vowel. ""MOUTH"" has O, U which are vowels not tested and common consonants M, T, H. ""GUIDE"" has G, U, I, D – but U and I haven't been checked, and E is already excluded. 

""MOUTH"" seems strong: M, O, U, T, H covers new vowels O/U and common T/H. M and H aren't too rare either. ""PILOT"" has reused O but L/T new – but O may be redundant if tested in ""MOUTH"". Since we need maximum new information, ""MOUTH"" gives five brand-new letters. 

Alternatively ""LIGHT"" – L, I, G, H, T – but lacks vowel variety. ""BUOYS"" has Y as vowel substitute? But less common. ""MOIST"" combines many common letters but O/I may cover vowels better. 

Between ""MOUTH"" and ""MOIST"", both have strengths. ""MOUTH"" includes U which is more distinctive while ""MOIST"" has S/T combo. Given previous miss, distinctiveness matters. So ""MOUTH"" it is – U and O in one guess give wider vowel coverage. 

Also confirms absence/presence of T/H which is useful for consonant structure. If secret word avoids common letters, testing mid-frequency characters like T/H might hit something. 

Final choice: ""MOUTH"".Based on the feedback from the first guess **""CRANE""** (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word**. This means:
- The secret word contains no ""C"", ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- I need to choose a new guess that completely **avoids** these letters to test different vowels/consonants.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- Since common vowels (A, E) are excluded, prioritize other vowels like **O, U, I** and common consonants not yet tested (e.g., **S, T, L, M**).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize new information.
- Probable letters: High-frequency consonants like **S, T, L**, and vowels **O, U, I**.

Good candidate words:
- **""MOUTH""**: Tests M, O, U, T, H (all new letters). Covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, M, H).
- **""GHOUL""**: Tests G, H, O, U, L. Strong vowel coverage (O, U), but less common consonants (G).
- **""PILOT""**: Tests P, I, L, O, T. Solid mix of vowels (I, O) and essential consonants (L, T).

**Best choice: ""MOUTH""**  
Why?  
- It tests five completely new letters: two vowels (**O, U**) and three consonants (**M, T, H**).  
- These letters are moderately common and likely to appear in English words.
- Avoids wasted letters (all excluded from Guess 1).

<guess>MOUTH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters are absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x)

Breaking down the feedback for MOUTH:
- O is correct and in the correct position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed T in the fourth position and it's marked as misplaced).
- M, U, H are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain M, U, or H.

Given that, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also know that from the first guess, we excluded A and E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O (which we have), and possibly Y. But O is already confirmed.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
1. Have O in the second position to match the correct placement.
2. Include the letter T, but not in the fourth position (since it's misplaced there). So T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
3. Avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also want to test new common letters to gather more information. Common letters we haven't tested yet include: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.

Possible positions for T:
- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _
- If T is in position 3: _ O T _ _
- If T is in position 5: _ O _ _ T

We should design a guess that can help us narrow down the position of T and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the second position.
- Must contain T, but not in the fourth position.
- No C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We can consider words like:
- Position 1: T O ... ? 
  - Example: TOILS (but S is new, I is new, L is new) - but we have to check if letters are allowed. TOILS: T, O, I, L, S. O is fixed in second, T in first. But we don't know if T is in first. Also, we have to avoid excluded letters: TOILS is okay? T, O, I, L, S. None of the excluded letters are in it. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H. So TOILS is valid.

- Position 3: _ O T ... 
  - Example: LOTUS, but U is excluded. Not allowed. 
  - Another: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - POINT? But P, O, I, N, T -> N is excluded (from first guess). Not allowed.

- Position 5: _ O _ _ T
  - Example: BOOST? But O is duplicated and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in MOUTH, O was correct and we don't have any duplicate feedback, so we don't know. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary. Also, BOOST has O twice, and we have O already fixed. But let's avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

We need to test new letters. We haven't tested: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, F, V, W, K, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has T in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me try to form a word with T in position 1: T O _ _ _

We need three more letters, avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, W, Y, etc. (but O is already used, and we don't want to duplicate unless necessary).

But we can use O again? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know. But since we have O fixed, and we don't have any indication of a duplicate, it's safer to avoid O in other positions to test more letters.

So for T O _ _ _, we can have:

- T O I _ _ : e.g., TOILS (T,O,I,L,S) -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. But we have T in position 1, which is a possibility. Also, we can test I, L, S.

But note: in MOUTH, T was misplaced in position 4, but now we are putting T in position 1. That's okay because we know T is not in position 4, but it could be in 1.

Another option: T O W _ _ : TOWEL? But E is excluded. Not allowed. TOWED? E excluded. TOWN? W and N, but N is excluded. Not good.

T O P _ _ : TOPIC? C is excluded. TOPAZ? A and Z, A excluded. Not good.

T O K _ _ : TOKEN? E and N excluded. Not good.

T O L _ _ : TOLES? E excluded. TOLYL? Not a word. TOLUS? U excluded.

So TOILS seems a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S. All new letters and not excluded.

What about T in position 3: _ O T _ _

We need first letter, then O, then T, then two more.

First letter: cannot be excluded, so from available: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, W, Y, etc.

Examples:
- B O T _ _ : BOTCH? C and H excluded. BOTHY? H excluded. BOTEL? E excluded. Not good.
- D O T _ _ : DOTED? E excluded. DOTAL? A excluded. Not good.
- G O T _ _ : GOTHS? H excluded. GOTTA? A excluded. Not good.
- L O T _ _ : LOTAS? A excluded? A is excluded. LOTUS? U excluded. 
- P O T _ _ : POTTY? T duplicate? We don't know. But also Y is new. But T is already in the word? We are putting T in position 3, and if the word has another T? But we don't know. POTSY? S and Y. But is POTSY a word? It might be obscure. Let's avoid for now.
- S O T _ _ : SOTOL? O duplicate? S,O,T,O,L -> two O's. But we don't know if O is duplicated. Also, L is new. But SOTOL is a word? It's a plant, but might be accepted. However, we have O again, which we already know is in the word, so it might be better to test new letters.

Not many good options for T in position 3.

Now, T in position 5: _ O _ _ T

Examples:
- B O _ _ T: BOAST? A and S, but A excluded. BOOST? O duplicate. BOLT? Only 4 letters. Need 5.
- D O _ _ T: DOUBT? U excluded. DOWNT? Not a word.
- F O _ _ T: FOIST? O, I, S, T. But O is in second, then I in third? FOIST: F, O, I, S, T. So positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. This avoids excluded letters: F, O, I, S, T. O is fixed, T is in position 5 (which is allowed, since T is not in position 4). And we test F, I, S.

Similarly, G O _ _ T: GOALT? Not a word. GOOST? Not a word. GORST? Not common.
- L O _ _ T: LOIST? O, I, S, T. LOIST: L, O, I, S, T. Similar to FOIST but with L instead of F.
- P O _ _ T: POINT? N excluded. POULT? U excluded. POIST? Not a word.
- S O _ _ T: SOFAT? F and A, A excluded. SORT? 4 letters. SOOTY? O duplicate and Y. But SOOTY: S, O, O, T, Y. We have O again and Y.

So good candidates are:
- TOILS: T in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.
- FOIST: F in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5.
- LOIST: L in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5. (LOIST is a word? It might be archaic, but Wordle often accepts such words. Let me confirm: LOIST is not in standard dictionaries, but it might be in Wordle's word list. To be safe, we can use a more common word.)

Another common word: POSIT? But that's 5 letters: P, O, S, I, T. But then T is in position 5, and O in 2. But POSIT: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That works. And it's a common word.

Similarly, FOIST is also common.

But in POSIT, we have S and I, which are common.

Now, comparing TOILS and POSIT/FOIST:

- TOILS: T in position 1. But we don't know if T is in position 1. If we guess TOILS and T is not in position 1, we might get feedback that T is misplaced (if it's in the word but wrong position) or absent (if it's not in the word? but we know T is in the word, so it would be misplaced). But we know T is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it's not there, it will be marked as misplaced.

Similarly, in POSIT, T is in position 5.

We want to test the position of T.

Also, we want to test new letters.

In TOILS, we test T, I, L, S (O is fixed and known).

In POSIT, we test P, O, S, I, T (O and T are known to be in the word, but we are testing positions).

We also have to consider that in MOUTH, T was in position 4 and was misplaced. So T cannot be in position 4. In TOILS, we put T in 1, L in 4. In POSIT, we put S in 3? POSIT: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. So position 4 is I, not T, so that's fine.

But we are testing T in position 5 in POSIT.

Now, which one to choose? We can also consider the frequency of letters.

We haven't tested S, L, I, P, F, etc.

Another candidate: if we put T in position 3, but we didn't find a great word. What about ""DOGIE""? But E excluded. Not good.

""POLIT""? But L and I, but POLIT: P, O, L, I, T. Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T. That's similar to POSIT but with L instead of S. And POLIT is a word? It might be less common.

I think POSIT is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in the first or last, to force it to be in position 3? But we didn't find a common word.

Another idea: since T is not in position 4, and we have O in 2, we can try to have T in position 3 and use common letters.

For example, ""POTSY""? P, O, T, S, Y. But Y is less common. And is it a word? POTS is a word, but POTSY? Not standard.

""LOFTY""? But F, T, Y. And O in 2? LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y. Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:F, 4:T, 5:Y. But in position 4, we are putting T. But from feedback, T is not in position 4 (because in MOUTH, T in position 4 was misplaced). So we cannot put T in position 4 again. That would be invalid because we know T is not there.

So in any new guess, we must not put T in position 4.

Therefore, in LOFTY, if we put T in position 4, it would be wrong because we know it's not there. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 4 for T.

So for TOILS: T in 1, L in 4 -> L is new, so that's fine.
For POSIT: I in 4, T in 5 -> fine.

Now, let's choose between TOILS and POSIT.

We can also consider ""FOIST"" which is similar to POSIT but with F.

But F is less common than P or S? In English, S is very common.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J is less common.

""HOIST"" - but H is excluded from MOUTH feedback (H(x)).

H is excluded, so we cannot use H.

So HOIST is invalid.

Therefore, FOIST or POSIT.

POSIT is more common.

But let's see the letters: in POSIT, we have P, O, S, I, T.

We test P, S, I.

In TOILS, we have T, O, I, L, S. We test T (position), I, L, S.

Both test I and S, but TOILS tests L and POSIT tests P.

L is more common than P? According to letter frequency, S is the most common, then I, then L, then P? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have exclusions.

Since E, A, O (partially), etc. are excluded, we focus on remaining.

S, I, L, D, P, etc.

S is very common, I is common, L is common, P is less common than S and I.

So TOILS tests S, I, L and also T (which we know is present).

POSIT tests S, I, P and T.

But in TOILS, we are putting T in position 1, which might be risky if T is actually in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, we put T in position 5.

We can choose a word that doesn't commit to a specific position for T but still includes it? But we have to place it somewhere.

Another idea: use a word with T in position 3, but we need a valid word.

What about ""DOZIT""? Not a word.

""KOFTI""? Not common.

I think TOILS or POSIT are fine.

But let's consider the feedback from MOUTH: we have O correct in position 2, and T misplaced. So the word has O in second and T somewhere else.

In TOILS, if we guess:
- If T is in position 1, and if it is correct, we get T(✓), then we know position 1 is T.
- If T is not in position 1, we get T(-) meaning misplaced, and we know it must be in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, if T is in position 5, if correct, we know; if not, it must be in 1 or 3.

But we don't have a word that avoids putting T in a specific position.

We could choose a word that has T in position 3? Let me try to find one.

For example, ""BOITE""? But E excluded and O duplicate? BOITE: B,O,I,T,E -> E excluded.

""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> U excluded.

""TOWIE""? W, I, E -> E excluded.

Not finding good options.

""GOATS""? A excluded.

So I think we should go with either TOILS or POSIT.

I'll choose POSIT because it's a common word and tests P, which is new, and S and I.

In POSIT, we have:
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: O (known correct)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: I (new)
- Position 5: T (known present, but testing position)

This will give us information about the position of T and also test P, S, I.

If P is in the word, we'll know; similarly for S and I.

Also, if I is in the word and in position 4, etc.

So let's go with POSIT.

But we must ensure that the word is valid. POSIT is a valid Wordle word.

Another common word is ""SPOIL"", but that has O in second? S P O I L -> position 2 is P? No, position 2 is O? Let's see: S (1), P (2)? No, SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L -> so position 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:I, 5:L. But we need O in position 2, so that would be wrong. We must have O in position 2.

So we cannot use SPOIL because it has O in position 3.

Similarly, any guess must have O in the second position.

So POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That matches.

Similarly, FOIST: F, O, I, S, T -> same positions.

I think I'll go with POSIT.

But in the feedback, we have T misplaced from position 4, and in POSIT we are putting I in position 4. That's fine.

So my next guess: POSIT.

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H are excluded. POSIT has P,O,S,I,T — none of these are excluded. O is allowed because it's in the word, but we are using it again, which is fine.

So I think it's good.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains **none** of these letters.
- **Guess 2: MOUTH** → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x). This tells us:
  - **O is correct and in position 2** (so the secret word has O as the second letter: `_ O _ _ _`).
  - **T is present but misplaced** (so T is in the word, but not in position 4).
  - M, U, and H are absent (so the secret word contains none of these).
- **Excluded letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H (cannot be used in new guesses).
- **Key constraints for the next guess**:
  - Must have **O in position 2**.
  - Must include **T**, but **not in position 4** (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, B, G, Y) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test the position of T (positions 1, 3, or 5) while introducing new high-frequency letters to maximize information. Common untested letters like S, I, L, and P are good candidates.
- **Word selection**:
  - Considered words like **TOILS** (T in position 1, tests I, L, S) and **FOIST** (T in position 5, tests F, I, S), but **POSIT** was chosen because:
    - It places O in position 2 (required).
    - It places T in position 5 (testing if T is at the end, which is a valid possibility).
    - It tests three new common letters: **P** (position 1), **S** (position 3), and **I** (position 4).
    - All letters (P, O, S, I, T) are distinct and not excluded.
    - ""POSIT"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""to assume as fact"").
- **Expected outcomes**:
  - If P, S, or I are correct or misplaced, it will reveal their status/position.
  - If T is in position 5, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be misplaced (-) and must be in position 1 or 3.
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for the secret word.

This means:\n- The secret word contains no ""C"", ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", or ""E"".\n- I need to choose a new guess that completely **avoids** these letters to test different vowels/consonants.\n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- Since common vowels (A, E) are excluded, prioritize other vowels like **O, U, I** and common consonants not yet tested (e.g., **S, T, L, M**).\n- Avoid repeating letters to maximize new information.\n- Probable letters: High-frequency consonants like **S, T, L**, and vowels **O, U, I**.\n\nGood candidate words:\n- **""MOUTH""**: Tests M, O, U, T, H (all new letters). Covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, M, H).\n- **""GHOUL""**: Tests G, H, O, U, L. Strong vowel coverage (O, U), but less common consonants (G).\n- **""PILOT""**: Tests P, I, L, O, T. Solid mix of vowels (I, O) and essential consonants (L, T).\n\n**Best choice: ""MOUTH""**  \nWhy?  \n- It tests five completely new letters: two vowels (**O, U**) and three consonants (**M, T, H**).  \n- These letters are moderately common and likely to appear in English words.\n- Avoids wasted letters (all excluded from Guess 1).\n\n<guess>MOUTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> All letters are absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x)\n\nBreaking down the feedback for MOUTH:\n- O is correct and in the correct position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is O.\n- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed T in the fourth position and it\'s marked as misplaced).\n- M, U, H are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain M, U, or H.\n\nGiven that, we know:\n- The secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ _\n- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we excluded A and E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O (which we have), and possibly Y. But O is already confirmed.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to:\n1. Have O in the second position to match the correct placement.\n2. Include the letter T, but not in the fourth position (since it\'s misplaced there). So T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n3. Avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to gather more information. Common letters we haven\'t tested yet include: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.\n\nPossible positions for T:\n- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _\n- If T is in position 3: _ O T _ _\n- If T is in position 5: _ O _ _ T\n\nWe should design a guess that can help us narrow down the position of T and also test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- Must have O in the second position.\n- Must contain T, but not in the fourth position.\n- No C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.\n\nWe can consider words like:\n- Position 1: T O ... ? \n  - Example: TOILS (but S is new, I is new, L is new) - but we have to check if letters are allowed. TOILS: T, O, I, L, S. O is fixed in second, T in first. But we don\'t know if T is in first. Also, we have to avoid excluded letters: TOILS is okay? T, O, I, L, S. None of the excluded letters are in it. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H. So TOILS is valid.\n\n- Position 3: _ O T ... \n  - Example: LOTUS, but U is excluded. Not allowed. \n  - Another: BOTHY? But H is excluded. \n  - POINT? But P, O, I, N, T -> N is excluded (from first guess). Not allowed.\n\n- Position 5: _ O _ _ T\n  - Example: BOOST? But O is duplicated and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in MOUTH, O was correct and we don\'t have any duplicate feedback, so we don\'t know. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary. Also, BOOST has O twice, and we have O already fixed. But let\'s avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.\n\nWe need to test new letters. We haven\'t tested: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, F, V, W, K, etc.\n\nA good candidate might be a word that has T in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\nLet me try to form a word with T in position 1: T O _ _ _\n\nWe need three more letters, avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H.\n\nPossible letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, W, Y, etc. (but O is already used, and we don\'t want to duplicate unless necessary).\n\nBut we can use O again? The secret word might have two O\'s? We don\'t know. But since we have O fixed, and we don\'t have any indication of a duplicate, it\'s safer to avoid O in other positions to test more letters.\n\nSo for T O _ _ _, we can have:\n\n- T O I _ _ : e.g., TOILS (T,O,I,L,S) -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. But we have T in position 1, which is a possibility. Also, we can test I, L, S.\n\nBut note: in MOUTH, T was misplaced in position 4, but now we are putting T in position 1. That\'s okay because we know T is not in position 4, but it could be in 1.\n\nAnother option: T O W _ _ : TOWEL? But E is excluded. Not allowed. TOWED? E excluded. TOWN? W and N, but N is excluded. Not good.\n\nT O P _ _ : TOPIC? C is excluded. TOPAZ? A and Z, A excluded. Not good.\n\nT O K _ _ : TOKEN? E and N excluded. Not good.\n\nT O L _ _ : TOLES? E excluded. TOLYL? Not a word. TOLUS? U excluded.\n\nSo TOILS seems a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S. All new letters and not excluded.\n\nWhat about T in position 3: _ O T _ _\n\nWe need first letter, then O, then T, then two more.\n\nFirst letter: cannot be excluded, so from available: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, W, Y, etc.\n\nExamples:\n- B O T _ _ : BOTCH? C and H excluded. BOTHY? H excluded. BOTEL? E excluded. Not good.\n- D O T _ _ : DOTED? E excluded. DOTAL? A excluded. Not good.\n- G O T _ _ : GOTHS? H excluded. GOTTA? A excluded. Not good.\n- L O T _ _ : LOTAS? A excluded? A is excluded. LOTUS? U excluded. \n- P O T _ _ : POTTY? T duplicate? We don\'t know. But also Y is new. But T is already in the word? We are putting T in position 3, and if the word has another T? But we don\'t know. POTSY? S and Y. But is POTSY a word? It might be obscure. Let\'s avoid for now.\n- S O T _ _ : SOTOL? O duplicate? S,O,T,O,L -> two O\'s. But we don\'t know if O is duplicated. Also, L is new. But SOTOL is a word? It\'s a plant, but might be accepted. However, we have O again, which we already know is in the word, so it might be better to test new letters.\n\nNot many good options for T in position 3.\n\nNow, T in position 5: _ O _ _ T\n\nExamples:\n- B O _ _ T: BOAST? A and S, but A excluded. BOOST? O duplicate. BOLT? Only 4 letters. Need 5.\n- D O _ _ T: DOUBT? U excluded. DOWNT? Not a word.\n- F O _ _ T: FOIST? O, I, S, T. But O is in second, then I in third? FOIST: F, O, I, S, T. So positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. This avoids excluded letters: F, O, I, S, T. O is fixed, T is in position 5 (which is allowed, since T is not in position 4). And we test F, I, S.\n\nSimilarly, G O _ _ T: GOALT? Not a word. GOOST? Not a word. GORST? Not common.\n- L O _ _ T: LOIST? O, I, S, T. LOIST: L, O, I, S, T. Similar to FOIST but with L instead of F.\n- P O _ _ T: POINT? N excluded. POULT? U excluded. POIST? Not a word.\n- S O _ _ T: SOFAT? F and A, A excluded. SORT? 4 letters. SOOTY? O duplicate and Y. But SOOTY: S, O, O, T, Y. We have O again and Y.\n\nSo good candidates are:\n- TOILS: T in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.\n- FOIST: F in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5.\n- LOIST: L in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5. (LOIST is a word? It might be archaic, but Wordle often accepts such words. Let me confirm: LOIST is not in standard dictionaries, but it might be in Wordle\'s word list. To be safe, we can use a more common word.)\n\nAnother common word: POSIT? But that\'s 5 letters: P, O, S, I, T. But then T is in position 5, and O in 2. But POSIT: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That works. And it\'s a common word.\n\nSimilarly, FOIST is also common.\n\nBut in POSIT, we have S and I, which are common.\n\nNow, comparing TOILS and POSIT/FOIST:\n\n- TOILS: T in position 1. But we don\'t know if T is in position 1. If we guess TOILS and T is not in position 1, we might get feedback that T is misplaced (if it\'s in the word but wrong position) or absent (if it\'s not in the word? but we know T is in the word, so it would be misplaced). But we know T is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it\'s not there, it will be marked as misplaced.\n\nSimilarly, in POSIT, T is in position 5.\n\nWe want to test the position of T.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nIn TOILS, we test T, I, L, S (O is fixed and known).\n\nIn POSIT, we test P, O, S, I, T (O and T are known to be in the word, but we are testing positions).\n\nWe also have to consider that in MOUTH, T was in position 4 and was misplaced. So T cannot be in position 4. In TOILS, we put T in 1, L in 4. In POSIT, we put S in 3? POSIT: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. So position 4 is I, not T, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are testing T in position 5 in POSIT.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, L, I, P, F, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: if we put T in position 3, but we didn\'t find a great word. What about ""DOGIE""? But E excluded. Not good.\n\n""POLIT""? But L and I, but POLIT: P, O, L, I, T. Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T. That\'s similar to POSIT but with L instead of S. And POLIT is a word? It might be less common.\n\nI think POSIT is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T in the first or last, to force it to be in position 3? But we didn\'t find a common word.\n\nAnother idea: since T is not in position 4, and we have O in 2, we can try to have T in position 3 and use common letters.\n\nFor example, ""POTSY""? P, O, T, S, Y. But Y is less common. And is it a word? POTS is a word, but POTSY? Not standard.\n\n""LOFTY""? But F, T, Y. And O in 2? LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y. Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:F, 4:T, 5:Y. But in position 4, we are putting T. But from feedback, T is not in position 4 (because in MOUTH, T in position 4 was misplaced). So we cannot put T in position 4 again. That would be invalid because we know T is not there.\n\nSo in any new guess, we must not put T in position 4.\n\nTherefore, in LOFTY, if we put T in position 4, it would be wrong because we know it\'s not there. So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nSimilarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 4 for T.\n\nSo for TOILS: T in 1, L in 4 -> L is new, so that\'s fine.\nFor POSIT: I in 4, T in 5 -> fine.\n\nNow, let\'s choose between TOILS and POSIT.\n\nWe can also consider ""FOIST"" which is similar to POSIT but with F.\n\nBut F is less common than P or S? In English, S is very common.\n\nAnother word: ""JOIST"" - J is less common.\n\n""HOIST"" - but H is excluded from MOUTH feedback (H(x)).\n\nH is excluded, so we cannot use H.\n\nSo HOIST is invalid.\n\nTherefore, FOIST or POSIT.\n\nPOSIT is more common.\n\nBut let\'s see the letters: in POSIT, we have P, O, S, I, T.\n\nWe test P, S, I.\n\nIn TOILS, we have T, O, I, L, S. We test T (position), I, L, S.\n\nBoth test I and S, but TOILS tests L and POSIT tests P.\n\nL is more common than P? According to letter frequency, S is the most common, then I, then L, then P? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have exclusions.\n\nSince E, A, O (partially), etc. are excluded, we focus on remaining.\n\nS, I, L, D, P, etc.\n\nS is very common, I is common, L is common, P is less common than S and I.\n\nSo TOILS tests S, I, L and also T (which we know is present).\n\nPOSIT tests S, I, P and T.\n\nBut in TOILS, we are putting T in position 1, which might be risky if T is actually in position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, in POSIT, we put T in position 5.\n\nWe can choose a word that doesn\'t commit to a specific position for T but still includes it? But we have to place it somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with T in position 3, but we need a valid word.\n\nWhat about ""DOZIT""? Not a word.\n\n""KOFTI""? Not common.\n\nI think TOILS or POSIT are fine.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback from MOUTH: we have O correct in position 2, and T misplaced. So the word has O in second and T somewhere else.\n\nIn TOILS, if we guess:\n- If T is in position 1, and if it is correct, we get T(✓), then we know position 1 is T.\n- If T is not in position 1, we get T(-) meaning misplaced, and we know it must be in position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, in POSIT, if T is in position 5, if correct, we know; if not, it must be in 1 or 3.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that avoids putting T in a specific position.\n\nWe could choose a word that has T in position 3? Let me try to find one.\n\nFor example, ""BOITE""? But E excluded and O duplicate? BOITE: B,O,I,T,E -> E excluded.\n\n""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> U excluded.\n\n""TOWIE""? W, I, E -> E excluded.\n\nNot finding good options.\n\n""GOATS""? A excluded.\n\nSo I think we should go with either TOILS or POSIT.\n\nI\'ll choose POSIT because it\'s a common word and tests P, which is new, and S and I.\n\nIn POSIT, we have:\n- Position 1: P (new)\n- Position 2: O (known correct)\n- Position 3: S (new)\n- Position 4: I (new)\n- Position 5: T (known present, but testing position)\n\nThis will give us information about the position of T and also test P, S, I.\n\nIf P is in the word, we\'ll know; similarly for S and I.\n\nAlso, if I is in the word and in position 4, etc.\n\nSo let\'s go with POSIT.\n\nBut we must ensure that the word is valid. POSIT is a valid Wordle word.\n\nAnother common word is ""SPOIL"", but that has O in second? S P O I L -> position 2 is P? No, position 2 is O? Let\'s see: S (1), P (2)? No, SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L -> so position 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:I, 5:L. But we need O in position 2, so that would be wrong. We must have O in position 2.\n\nSo we cannot use SPOIL because it has O in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, any guess must have O in the second position.\n\nSo POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, FOIST: F, O, I, S, T -> same positions.\n\nI think I\'ll go with POSIT.\n\nBut in the feedback, we have T misplaced from position 4, and in POSIT we are putting I in position 4. That\'s fine.\n\nSo my next guess: POSIT.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H are excluded. POSIT has P,O,S,I,T — none of these are excluded. O is allowed because it\'s in the word, but we are using it again, which is fine.\n\nSo I think it\'s good.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains **none** of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: MOUTH** → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x). This tells us:\n  - **O is correct and in position 2** (so the secret word has O as the second letter: `_ O _ _ _`).\n  - **T is present but misplaced** (so T is in the word, but not in position 4).\n  - M, U, and H are absent (so the secret word contains none of these).\n- **Excluded letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H (cannot be used in new guesses).\n- **Key constraints for the next guess**:\n  - Must have **O in position 2**.\n  - Must include **T**, but **not in position 4** (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 5).\n  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, B, G, Y) to gather more information.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Goal**: Test the position of T (positions 1, 3, or 5) while introducing new high-frequency letters to maximize information. Common untested letters like S, I, L, and P are good candidates.\n- **Word selection**:\n  - Considered words like **TOILS** (T in position 1, tests I, L, S) and **FOIST** (T in position 5, tests F, I, S), but **POSIT** was chosen because:\n    - It places O in position 2 (required).\n    - It places T in position 5 (testing if T is at the end, which is a valid possibility).\n    - It tests three new common letters: **P** (position 1), **S** (position 3), and **I** (position 4).\n    - All letters (P, O, S, I, T) are distinct and not excluded.\n    - ""POSIT"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""to assume as fact"").\n- **Expected outcomes**:\n  - If P, S, or I are correct or misplaced, it will reveal their status/position.\n  - If T is in position 5, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be misplaced (-) and must be in position 1 or 3.\n  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for the secret word.\n\n<guess>POSIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)\nGuess 3: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)
  This tells us:
    - O is in the correct position (second).
    - T is present but not in the fourth position (so T is in position 1, 3, or 5).
    - M, U, H are absent.
Guess 3: POSIT -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)
  This tells us:
    - O is correct (second position, as before).
    - T is correct? T(✓) means T is in the correct position. Since we put T in position 5, T is the fifth letter of the secret word.
    - S is present but not in the third position (we put S in position 3, so it's misplaced).
    - I is present but not in the fourth position (we put I in position 4).
    - P is absent.

So now we know:
  Secret word pattern: _ O _ _ T
    - Second letter is O, fifth letter is T.
  Letters in the word: O, T, S, I (since S and I are present, though misplaced).
  Excluded letters (absent): C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P (from guess 1, 2, and 3).

Additionally, we know S is in the word but not in position 3, and I is in the word but not in position 4.

The secret word has the form: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] T

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4.

Known letters: S and I must be placed in positions 1, 3, or 4. But since we have two letters (S and I) and three positions, and the word has five letters, we know two letters (O and T) and we know S and I are present, so the other two positions must have S and I? Not necessarily, because there could be other letters. We don't know all letters yet.

From feedback:
- S and I are in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicate letters? So far no indication of duplicates.
- We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P and found them absent, so the word must be composed of letters not in this exclusion list.

Available letters: besides S and I, we might have other letters. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled, and we have S and I to place, but there might be another letter that hasn't been tested yet.

But from the constraints:
- Word: [1] O [3] [4] T
- Contains S and I, which must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- But S cannot be in position 3 (because in POSIT, S was in position 3 and marked misplaced, meaning either S is not position 3 or it is but in a duplicate? Given that we don't have duplicate info, assume no duplicates for now).
- Similar for I: cannot be in position 4.

So S must be in position 1 or 4.
I must be in position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we need to consider that only one letter at position 1, so if both S and I are assigned to position 1, conflict? We have to select one for each.

Possible placements:
Position 1: could be S or I, or another letter? If we assign both S and I to positions 1,3,4, but there are three positions, so there might be another letter.

We must include S and I in some of positions 1,3,4, and the remaining spot must be a new letter that we haven't tested (or possibly not, but we might have all letters?).

Since we have two known present letters (S and I) that need to be placed in the three open positions, there must be at least one more letter that hasn't been guessed yet? Or no.

Let me list the knowns:
- The word has O in 2 and T in 5.
- It has S and I somewhere.
- There are three positions left: 1,3,4.
- Each of these positions must be filled with letters not excluded.

But S and I are two letters to place in three spots. Therefore, position 1,3,4 collectively have two of these (S and I) and one other letter.

That other letter has not been guessed yet? We haven't tested many letters.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,O,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z? But O and T are already placed, and we are placing S and I.

So any new letter must come from B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc.

But we know the word has exactly S and I as the other letters, so the third position must be filled with one of these available letters.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test:
- Position 1: S or I or a new letter.
- Position 3: I or S or a new letter, but with constraints.

We want to confirm the positions of S and I and find the new letter.

Perhaps we can form a word that fits possible patterns.

Possible configurations:
Case 1: Position 1 is S, then S must not be in position 3? But we can have it. Then position 3 could be I, position 4 must be a new letter? But I must be in position 1 or 3? Wait, no: I must be placed, and position 4 in this case would be free.

List of possibilities for S and I:
- S can be in pos 1 or 4
- I can be in pos 1 or 3

But if S is in pos 1, then position 4 could be something else, and I must be in pos 3? Or pos 1 is S, so I could be in pos 3? Or pos 1 could be I, then S in pos 4? etc.

Also, since in guess 3, when we put S in pos 3, it was misplaced, meaning S is not position 3. Similarly, I in pos 4 was misplaced, so I is not position 4.

So possible assignments:
- Position 1: either S, I, or a new letter.
- Position 3: can be I (since I can be there) or a new letter, but not S (which is banned from pos 3).
- Position 4: can be S (since S can be there) or a new letter, but not I (banned from pos 4).

But since S and I must be placed in the word, we have to assign them.

So combinations:
A. Position 1: S
   Then I must be in position 3 (since position 4 cannot have I, and position 1 is taken). Then position 4 must be a new letter, say X.
   Word: S O I X T

B. Position 1: I
   Then S must be in position 4 (since position 3 cannot have S, and position 1 is taken). Then position 3 is a new letter, say Y.
   Word: I O Y S T

C. Position 1: new letter, say Z.
   Then we have to place S and I.
   Since S cannot be in 3 and I cannot be in 4:
      Position 3: I (since I can be here, and S cannot)
      Position 4: S (since S can be here, and I cannot)
   Word: Z O I S T

D. Position 1: new letter Z.
   But alternative? If position 3 cannot have S, so must have I or new. But if we put I in position 3, then position 4 must be S? Yes, that's the only option because if position 4 is something else, then I must be placed elsewhere? Only position 3 is available for I in this case? In case C, we have Z O I S T.

What if position 3 is new? But then I must go somewhere. Position 1 is taken by Z, position 3 is new (say W), then position 4 must be S or I? But if position 4 is S, then I has to be in position? Position 1,3,4 are filled: Z (new at pos1), W (new at pos3), S at pos4, then where is I? We know I is in the word. So I must be in one of these positions? Contradiction. Similarly, if position 4 is I, but I cannot be in position 4 from the feedback (I in position 4 was misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4). Therefore, if position 1 is new, then position 3 must be I (since only position 3 available for I), and position 4 must be S. So only C is possible: Z O I S T.

Similarly, if position 1 is S or I, we have cases A and B.

Therefore, possible secret words:
Type A: S O I X T, where X is a new letter (any letter not excluded and not O,T,S,I? But S and I are used, and O,T are fixed).
Type B: I O Y S T, where Y is a new letter.
Type C: Z O I S T, where Z is a new letter.

In type C: Z O I S T, but note that positions: Z at 1, I at 3, S at 4? Then the word has Z, O, I, S, T. So letters: Z,O,I,S,T.

Similarly, type A: S,O,I,X,T? Letters: S,O,I,X,T? But S and I are common, X new.

Type B: I,O,Y,S,T? Letters: I,O,Y,S,T.

For the word to be valid, we need to find actual words.

Not all letters X,Y,Z are possible; only certain letters make real words.

We must choose a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and find the new letter.

We have not tested many letters beyond the common ones. For example, we haven't tested B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc., but we excluded some.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.

So available new letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z? But X,Y,Z are variables.

For the new letter, it can be any consonant or vowel not excluded.

But we need to form a word.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to guess one of the possible patterns.

For example, if we guess a word that fits type A, B, or C, we can get feedback.

But we need to select a word that uses new letters to test.

Since we have limited guesses, we might guess a word that covers the possibilities.

But let's list possible words for each type:

Type A: S O I _ T? Possible words: SOFIT? - meaning? Not a common word. SOBIT? Not a word. KOTIS is not SO IST? What words have S,O,I,?,T with pattern S O I ? T.

Looking at English words: POINT? But P excluded, and N excluded. JOIN? 4 letters. JOINT? Similarly excluded. FOIST? But F,O,I,S,T? Pattern is F O I S T, which is not S O I X T. We want S in position 1.

Valid words? ""SOFTI"" not word. ""SOUTH"" but U excluded. Not many options. ""SOLIT""? Not common.

Perhaps no common word with this pattern? ""STOIT""? Not a word. ""STOIC"" but C excluded. ""SOXIT""? Not word.

So type A might be rare or impossible? Then perhaps we can skip it.

Type B: I O Y S T? Pattern I O ? S T. So position 3 is Y.

Words: I O ? S T. E.g., ""IOTAS""? But A excluded. ""IOCUS""? Not word. ""IOBES""? E excluded. ""IOGHT""? H excluded. Not good.

""IOKST""? Not a word.

Common words? ""JOUST"" but J,O,U,S,T -> U excluded. ""GHOST"" H excluded. Not finding.

Perhaps ""COITS"" but C excluded. So no common words? Then type B might be unlikely.

Type C: ? O I S T. Pattern Z O I S T.

Words: BOIST? Not common. COIST? C excluded. DOIST? Not word. FOIST? F O I S T. That's F in position 1? Then FOIST: F,O,I,S,T -> positions 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T? But in our case for type C, pattern is Z O I S T, so position 1:Z, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T.

But FOIST has the pattern: F,O,I,S,T -> so it matches? But in the word FOIST, position 3 is I and position 4 is S.

But in our case, for type C: Z O I S T, so it has I in position 3, S in position 4.

FOIST is an example: F O I S T.

Now, is F excluded? No, F has not been tested. Only excluded letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P. F is available.

Other possibilities? GOIST? Not common. JOIST: J O I S T. J is available. LOIST? L O I S T. Etc.

Common words: FOIST, JOIST, HOIST? But H is excluded. HOIST has H, excluded. MOIST? M excluded. POIST not word. SOIST? Not common? But SOIST might be obscure.

Valid options: FOIST, JOIST, etc.

But JOIST is a word (a beam in construction). FOIST also.

We also have TOIST? But T is in position 5? Pattern is Z O I S T, position 1 is new. If we put T in position 1, but T is already in position 5? We cannot because letters can repeat? The rules don't prohibit duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any indication.

In this case, secret word could have duplicate? But from feedback, in previous guesses, no duplicates mentioned. But possible.

In FOIST, letters F,O,I,S,T all distinct.

Similarly, in JOIST, J,O,I,S,T - distinct.

So possible secret words include FOIST, JOIST, etc.

But there might be others, like if Z is L, LOIST? Not common, but possible.

But for the guess, we can try to guess one of these.

Since we don't know which, we need to test.

But we have only three guesses left? We are on guess 4, so three more to go? The user said we have 6 tries, so after guess 3, we have three left.

We can guess FOIST, for example, but if it's not correct, we get information about F.

FOIST would be a valid guess, but in our previous guess, we guessed POSIT which has P,O,S,I,T. Now FOIST has F,O,I,S,T. So similar, but F instead of P.

But P was excluded.

So for guess 4, we can guess FOIST.

But FOIST has O in position 2, S in position 4, I in position 3? FOIST: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).

But in the secret word, we have:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown

And we know S is misplaced, I is misplaced.

In FOIST:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 1: F

Now, from the type C pattern, Z O I S T, so if F is in position 1, I in 3, S in 4, then FOIST matches that.

But there could be other patterns? Earlier we concluded only type C is likely? Because types A and B had no common words.

But let's confirm: in the secret word, S cannot be in position 3 (from POSIT feedback S in pos3 misplaced), and I cannot be in position 4.

In FOIST, we are putting I in position 3, S in position 4.

If the secret word is FOIST, then position 3:I should be correct? But we don't know that.

Similarly, position 4:S might be correct.

But by guessing FOIST, we effectively test if the word is FOIST.

If it is, we win.

If not, we get feedback on F, and positions of I and S might be clarified.

S is in position 4 in FOIST. From the feedback, we don't know if S is correct there or misplaced.

Similarly for I in position 3.

But we already know that in POSIT, when we put I in position 4, it was misplaced, so I cannot be in position 4. But position 3 might be okay.

Similarly, S cannot be in position 3.

So FOIST is a candidate.

Another candidate is JOIST.

But to choose, we can pick the most common one.

Perhaps try a word that doesn't assume the S and I positions, but tests them.

For example, put I in position 1 and S in position 4? Or something.

But let's see.

Case: put position 1: I (testing if I is in position 1)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: a new letter, say L
Position 4: S (testing if S is in position 4)
Position 5: T (fixed)

So guess: I O L S T → ""IOLST""? But is that a word? ""LOST"" but with I and S? Not a valid word.

Other possibilities: with F? ""FOLKS""? But K and S? But pattern? Position 4 is S? And K new? But F O ? K T? Not I O ? S T.

To fit the word, it must have S and I somewhere.

But if we put I in position 1 and S in position 4, then position 3 must be a new letter.

Possible words: ?

For example, ""DIGST""? Not word. ""BIGST"" no.

Common words: ""WRIST"" but W,R,I,S,T -> R excluded? R is excluded from guess 1.

""GRIST""? Also R excluded. ""TRYST"" R excluded and Y? etc.

No good five-letter words with I in position 1, O in 2, new in 3, S in 4, T in 5.

Similarly, other patterns are difficult.

So the most likely pattern is type C, like FOIST, JOIST.

Therefore, I'll guess FOIST.

It uses F, which is new, and if correct, we win; if not, we get information.

JOIST is another option, but F is more common than J? Varies.

But FOIST is fine.

So my guess: FOIST
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, let me analyze the constraints and possible options for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Determination**:  
   - From Guess 2 (MOUTH → O(✓)), we know the second letter is **O**.  
   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → O(✓), T(✓)), we know the second letter is **O** and the fifth letter is **T**.  
   - The secret word must be of the form: `_ O _ _ T`.

2. **Present Letters**:  
   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → S(-), I(-)), **S** and **I** are in the word but misplaced.  
   - S cannot be in position 3 (since S was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  
   - I cannot be in position 4 (since I was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  
   - Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 4, and I must be in position 1 or 3.

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - Absent letters from all guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P.  
   - The secret word contains none of these, so only untested letters or known presents (S, I) can be used.

4. **Possible Secret Word Structures**:  
   Given S and I must be placed with their constraints, and no duplicates are indicated, the secret word must match one of three patterns:  
   - **Type A**: `S O I X T` (X is a new untested letter, e.g., F, G, L).  
     - But common English words fitting this pattern (like SOFTI or SOFIT) are rare or invalid.  
   - **Type B**: `I O Y S T` (Y is a new untested letter).  
     - Common words (e.g., IOTAS) are invalid due to excluded letters (A), making this pattern unlikely.  
   - **Type C**: `Z O I S T` (Z is a new untested letter, e.g., F, J, L).  
     - This yield valid words like **FOIST** (F in position 1), **JOIST** (J in position 1), or **LOIST** (L in position 1). FOIST is a common word meaning ""to insert surreptitiously,"" making it plausible.  

5. **Choosing the Next Guess**:  
   - **FOIST** (F O I S T) tests the most likely Type C pattern:  
     - Positions: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).  
     - Verifies if:
       - F is present/absent and its position.
       - S and I positions: I in pos 3 (correct?) and S in pos 4 (correct?).
     - If FOIST is correct, we solve the game. If not, feedback on F, S, and I positions will confirm or refute Type C and guide Guess 5.
   - Alternative candidates like JOIST or LOIST are less common, so FOIST maximizes information and likelihood.

6. **Why FOIST?**  
   - It covers key constraints (O in pos 2, T in pos 5) and positions S and I per rules.  
   - Tests F, a new high-frequency consonant (from available letters B, D, F, G, K, L).  
   - Avoids excluded letters efficiently.

<guess>FOIST</guess>",FOIST,"We now have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)
  This tells us:
    - O is in the correct position (second).
    - T is present but not in the fourth position (so T is in position 1, 3, or 5).
    - M, U, H are absent.
Guess 3: POSIT -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)
  This tells us:
    - O is correct (second position, as before).
    - T is correct? T(✓) means T is in the correct position. Since we put T in position 5, T is the fifth letter of the secret word.
    - S is present but not in the third position (we put S in position 3, so it's misplaced).
    - I is present but not in the fourth position (we put I in position 4).
    - P is absent.

So now we know:
  Secret word pattern: _ O _ _ T
    - Second letter is O, fifth letter is T.
  Letters in the word: O, T, S, I (since S and I are present, though misplaced).
  Excluded letters (absent): C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P (from guess 1, 2, and 3).

Additionally, we know S is in the word but not in position 3, and I is in the word but not in position 4.

The secret word has the form: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] T

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4.

Known letters: S and I must be placed in positions 1, 3, or 4. But since we have two letters (S and I) and three positions, and the word has five letters, we know two letters (O and T) and we know S and I are present, so the other two positions must have S and I? Not necessarily, because there could be other letters. We don't know all letters yet.

From feedback:
- S and I are in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicate letters? So far no indication of duplicates.
- We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P and found them absent, so the word must be composed of letters not in this exclusion list.

Available letters: besides S and I, we might have other letters. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled, and we have S and I to place, but there might be another letter that hasn't been tested yet.

But from the constraints:
- Word: [1] O [3] [4] T
- Contains S and I, which must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- But S cannot be in position 3 (because in POSIT, S was in position 3 and marked misplaced, meaning either S is not position 3 or it is but in a duplicate? Given that we don't have duplicate info, assume no duplicates for now).
- Similar for I: cannot be in position 4.

So S must be in position 1 or 4.
I must be in position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we need to consider that only one letter at position 1, so if both S and I are assigned to position 1, conflict? We have to select one for each.

Possible placements:
Position 1: could be S or I, or another letter? If we assign both S and I to positions 1,3,4, but there are three positions, so there might be another letter.

We must include S and I in some of positions 1,3,4, and the remaining spot must be a new letter that we haven't tested (or possibly not, but we might have all letters?).

Since we have two known present letters (S and I) that need to be placed in the three open positions, there must be at least one more letter that hasn't been guessed yet? Or no.

Let me list the knowns:
- The word has O in 2 and T in 5.
- It has S and I somewhere.
- There are three positions left: 1,3,4.
- Each of these positions must be filled with letters not excluded.

But S and I are two letters to place in three spots. Therefore, position 1,3,4 collectively have two of these (S and I) and one other letter.

That other letter has not been guessed yet? We haven't tested many letters.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,O,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z? But O and T are already placed, and we are placing S and I.

So any new letter must come from B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc.

But we know the word has exactly S and I as the other letters, so the third position must be filled with one of these available letters.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test:
- Position 1: S or I or a new letter.
- Position 3: I or S or a new letter, but with constraints.

We want to confirm the positions of S and I and find the new letter.

Perhaps we can form a word that fits possible patterns.

Possible configurations:
Case 1: Position 1 is S, then S must not be in position 3? But we can have it. Then position 3 could be I, position 4 must be a new letter? But I must be in position 1 or 3? Wait, no: I must be placed, and position 4 in this case would be free.

List of possibilities for S and I:
- S can be in pos 1 or 4
- I can be in pos 1 or 3

But if S is in pos 1, then position 4 could be something else, and I must be in pos 3? Or pos 1 is S, so I could be in pos 3? Or pos 1 could be I, then S in pos 4? etc.

Also, since in guess 3, when we put S in pos 3, it was misplaced, meaning S is not position 3. Similarly, I in pos 4 was misplaced, so I is not position 4.

So possible assignments:
- Position 1: either S, I, or a new letter.
- Position 3: can be I (since I can be there) or a new letter, but not S (which is banned from pos 3).
- Position 4: can be S (since S can be there) or a new letter, but not I (banned from pos 4).

But since S and I must be placed in the word, we have to assign them.

So combinations:
A. Position 1: S
   Then I must be in position 3 (since position 4 cannot have I, and position 1 is taken). Then position 4 must be a new letter, say X.
   Word: S O I X T

B. Position 1: I
   Then S must be in position 4 (since position 3 cannot have S, and position 1 is taken). Then position 3 is a new letter, say Y.
   Word: I O Y S T

C. Position 1: new letter, say Z.
   Then we have to place S and I.
   Since S cannot be in 3 and I cannot be in 4:
      Position 3: I (since I can be here, and S cannot)
      Position 4: S (since S can be here, and I cannot)
   Word: Z O I S T

D. Position 1: new letter Z.
   But alternative? If position 3 cannot have S, so must have I or new. But if we put I in position 3, then position 4 must be S? Yes, that's the only option because if position 4 is something else, then I must be placed elsewhere? Only position 3 is available for I in this case? In case C, we have Z O I S T.

What if position 3 is new? But then I must go somewhere. Position 1 is taken by Z, position 3 is new (say W), then position 4 must be S or I? But if position 4 is S, then I has to be in position? Position 1,3,4 are filled: Z (new at pos1), W (new at pos3), S at pos4, then where is I? We know I is in the word. So I must be in one of these positions? Contradiction. Similarly, if position 4 is I, but I cannot be in position 4 from the feedback (I in position 4 was misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4). Therefore, if position 1 is new, then position 3 must be I (since only position 3 available for I), and position 4 must be S. So only C is possible: Z O I S T.

Similarly, if position 1 is S or I, we have cases A and B.

Therefore, possible secret words:
Type A: S O I X T, where X is a new letter (any letter not excluded and not O,T,S,I? But S and I are used, and O,T are fixed).
Type B: I O Y S T, where Y is a new letter.
Type C: Z O I S T, where Z is a new letter.

In type C: Z O I S T, but note that positions: Z at 1, I at 3, S at 4? Then the word has Z, O, I, S, T. So letters: Z,O,I,S,T.

Similarly, type A: S,O,I,X,T? Letters: S,O,I,X,T? But S and I are common, X new.

Type B: I,O,Y,S,T? Letters: I,O,Y,S,T.

For the word to be valid, we need to find actual words.

Not all letters X,Y,Z are possible; only certain letters make real words.

We must choose a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and find the new letter.

We have not tested many letters beyond the common ones. For example, we haven't tested B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc., but we excluded some.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.

So available new letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z? But X,Y,Z are variables.

For the new letter, it can be any consonant or vowel not excluded.

But we need to form a word.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to guess one of the possible patterns.

For example, if we guess a word that fits type A, B, or C, we can get feedback.

But we need to select a word that uses new letters to test.

Since we have limited guesses, we might guess a word that covers the possibilities.

But let's list possible words for each type:

Type A: S O I _ T? Possible words: SOFIT? - meaning? Not a common word. SOBIT? Not a word. KOTIS is not SO IST? What words have S,O,I,?,T with pattern S O I ? T.

Looking at English words: POINT? But P excluded, and N excluded. JOIN? 4 letters. JOINT? Similarly excluded. FOIST? But F,O,I,S,T? Pattern is F O I S T, which is not S O I X T. We want S in position 1.

Valid words? ""SOFTI"" not word. ""SOUTH"" but U excluded. Not many options. ""SOLIT""? Not common.

Perhaps no common word with this pattern? ""STOIT""? Not a word. ""STOIC"" but C excluded. ""SOXIT""? Not word.

So type A might be rare or impossible? Then perhaps we can skip it.

Type B: I O Y S T? Pattern I O ? S T. So position 3 is Y.

Words: I O ? S T. E.g., ""IOTAS""? But A excluded. ""IOCUS""? Not word. ""IOBES""? E excluded. ""IOGHT""? H excluded. Not good.

""IOKST""? Not a word.

Common words? ""JOUST"" but J,O,U,S,T -> U excluded. ""GHOST"" H excluded. Not finding.

Perhaps ""COITS"" but C excluded. So no common words? Then type B might be unlikely.

Type C: ? O I S T. Pattern Z O I S T.

Words: BOIST? Not common. COIST? C excluded. DOIST? Not word. FOIST? F O I S T. That's F in position 1? Then FOIST: F,O,I,S,T -> positions 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T? But in our case for type C, pattern is Z O I S T, so position 1:Z, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T.

But FOIST has the pattern: F,O,I,S,T -> so it matches? But in the word FOIST, position 3 is I and position 4 is S.

But in our case, for type C: Z O I S T, so it has I in position 3, S in position 4.

FOIST is an example: F O I S T.

Now, is F excluded? No, F has not been tested. Only excluded letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P. F is available.

Other possibilities? GOIST? Not common. JOIST: J O I S T. J is available. LOIST? L O I S T. Etc.

Common words: FOIST, JOIST, HOIST? But H is excluded. HOIST has H, excluded. MOIST? M excluded. POIST not word. SOIST? Not common? But SOIST might be obscure.

Valid options: FOIST, JOIST, etc.

But JOIST is a word (a beam in construction). FOIST also.

We also have TOIST? But T is in position 5? Pattern is Z O I S T, position 1 is new. If we put T in position 1, but T is already in position 5? We cannot because letters can repeat? The rules don't prohibit duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any indication.

In this case, secret word could have duplicate? But from feedback, in previous guesses, no duplicates mentioned. But possible.

In FOIST, letters F,O,I,S,T all distinct.

Similarly, in JOIST, J,O,I,S,T - distinct.

So possible secret words include FOIST, JOIST, etc.

But there might be others, like if Z is L, LOIST? Not common, but possible.

But for the guess, we can try to guess one of these.

Since we don't know which, we need to test.

But we have only three guesses left? We are on guess 4, so three more to go? The user said we have 6 tries, so after guess 3, we have three left.

We can guess FOIST, for example, but if it's not correct, we get information about F.

FOIST would be a valid guess, but in our previous guess, we guessed POSIT which has P,O,S,I,T. Now FOIST has F,O,I,S,T. So similar, but F instead of P.

But P was excluded.

So for guess 4, we can guess FOIST.

But FOIST has O in position 2, S in position 4, I in position 3? FOIST: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).

But in the secret word, we have:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown

And we know S is misplaced, I is misplaced.

In FOIST:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 1: F

Now, from the type C pattern, Z O I S T, so if F is in position 1, I in 3, S in 4, then FOIST matches that.

But there could be other patterns? Earlier we concluded only type C is likely? Because types A and B had no common words.

But let's confirm: in the secret word, S cannot be in position 3 (from POSIT feedback S in pos3 misplaced), and I cannot be in position 4.

In FOIST, we are putting I in position 3, S in position 4.

If the secret word is FOIST, then position 3:I should be correct? But we don't know that.

Similarly, position 4:S might be correct.

But by guessing FOIST, we effectively test if the word is FOIST.

If it is, we win.

If not, we get feedback on F, and positions of I and S might be clarified.

S is in position 4 in FOIST. From the feedback, we don't know if S is correct there or misplaced.

Similarly for I in position 3.

But we already know that in POSIT, when we put I in position 4, it was misplaced, so I cannot be in position 4. But position 3 might be okay.

Similarly, S cannot be in position 3.

So FOIST is a candidate.

Another candidate is JOIST.

But to choose, we can pick the most common one.

Perhaps try a word that doesn't assume the S and I positions, but tests them.

For example, put I in position 1 and S in position 4? Or something.

But let's see.

Case: put position 1: I (testing if I is in position 1)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: a new letter, say L
Position 4: S (testing if S is in position 4)
Position 5: T (fixed)

So guess: I O L S T → ""IOLST""? But is that a word? ""LOST"" but with I and S? Not a valid word.

Other possibilities: with F? ""FOLKS""? But K and S? But pattern? Position 4 is S? And K new? But F O ? K T? Not I O ? S T.

To fit the word, it must have S and I somewhere.

But if we put I in position 1 and S in position 4, then position 3 must be a new letter.

Possible words: ?

For example, ""DIGST""? Not word. ""BIGST"" no.

Common words: ""WRIST"" but W,R,I,S,T -> R excluded? R is excluded from guess 1.

""GRIST""? Also R excluded. ""TRYST"" R excluded and Y? etc.

No good five-letter words with I in position 1, O in 2, new in 3, S in 4, T in 5.

Similarly, other patterns are difficult.

So the most likely pattern is type C, like FOIST, JOIST.

Therefore, I'll guess FOIST.

It uses F, which is new, and if correct, we win; if not, we get information.

JOIST is another option, but F is more common than J? Varies.

But FOIST is fine.

So my guess: FOISTBased on the feedback from previous guesses, let me analyze the constraints and possible options for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Determination**:  
   - From Guess 2 (MOUTH → O(✓)), we know the second letter is **O**.  
   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → O(✓), T(✓)), we know the second letter is **O** and the fifth letter is **T**.  
   - The secret word must be of the form: `_ O _ _ T`.

2. **Present Letters**:  
   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → S(-), I(-)), **S** and **I** are in the word but misplaced.  
   - S cannot be in position 3 (since S was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  
   - I cannot be in position 4 (since I was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  
   - Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 4, and I must be in position 1 or 3.

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - Absent letters from all guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P.  
   - The secret word contains none of these, so only untested letters or known presents (S, I) can be used.

4. **Possible Secret Word Structures**:  
   Given S and I must be placed with their constraints, and no duplicates are indicated, the secret word must match one of three patterns:  
   - **Type A**: `S O I X T` (X is a new untested letter, e.g., F, G, L).  
     - But common English words fitting this pattern (like SOFTI or SOFIT) are rare or invalid.  
   - **Type B**: `I O Y S T` (Y is a new untested letter).  
     - Common words (e.g., IOTAS) are invalid due to excluded letters (A), making this pattern unlikely.  
   - **Type C**: `Z O I S T` (Z is a new untested letter, e.g., F, J, L).  
     - This yield valid words like **FOIST** (F in position 1), **JOIST** (J in position 1), or **LOIST** (L in position 1). FOIST is a common word meaning ""to insert surreptitiously,"" making it plausible.  

5. **Choosing the Next Guess**:  
   - **FOIST** (F O I S T) tests the most likely Type C pattern:  
     - Positions: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).  
     - Verifies if:
       - F is present/absent and its position.
       - S and I positions: I in pos 3 (correct?) and S in pos 4 (correct?).
     - If FOIST is correct, we solve the game. If not, feedback on F, S, and I positions will confirm or refute Type C and guide Guess 5.
   - Alternative candidates like JOIST or LOIST are less common, so FOIST maximizes information and likelihood.

6. **Why FOIST?**  
   - It covers key constraints (O in pos 2, T in pos 5) and positions S and I per rules.  
   - Tests F, a new high-frequency consonant (from available letters B, D, F, G, K, L).  
   - Avoids excluded letters efficiently.",Guess 4: FOIST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the potential for getting useful information.

The key principles for a good starting word in Wordle-style games are:
- Include letters that are common in English words, such as vowels and frequent consonants, to increase the chances of hitting letters in the secret word.
- Aim for a word with a balanced letter distribution to cover multiple possibilities.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc., because they appear frequently.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. A, E are vowels, and R, N are common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". I should pick one that covers a good range.

""CRANE"" has A, E (vowels), and C, R, N (consonants). It might be effective.

I could also consider ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels, but it has duplicate O, and it might not cover consonants well. Having duplicate letters isn't ideal because it wastes a guess slot; if the secret word has only one O, guessing ""AUDIO"" would only indicate O in one position or not, but it could be misleading. Better to avoid duplicates if possible.

""CRANE"" has no duplicate letters, which is good.

Letters frequency: According to English letter frequency, E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common.

In ""CRANE"", I have C, R, A, N, E. That covers E, A, R, N—all high frequency.

C is less common, but still okay.

An alternative like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. S, T, L, A, E—all very common.

""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but has A, D, I, E, U. D and U are less common than some consonants.

For maximizing information, ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" seems solid.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there are no previous clues to analyze. So my thought process is based on common strategy.

Then, I must output the guessed word in the specified format.

So, my thought process:
- Choose a starting word with common letters to gather broad information.
- Ensure it has no repeating letters.
- ""CRANE"" includes E, A, R, N, C—common letters that can help identify vowels and consonants.
- After this guess, I'll get feedback to refine the next guesses.

Final output should be: <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gather about the secret word. Since there's no prior feedback, I need a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are ideal because they increase the chances of matching letters in the secret word. A good starting word should also avoid duplicate letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, preventing redundancy.
- Based on English letter frequency, E and A are the most common vowels, while R, N, and C are relatively common consonants, potentially providing broad feedback.

This guess will help me identify correct positions, misplaced letters, or absent letters, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess in this Wordle-style game. Looking at the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", all letters got marked as ""x"" – C, R, A, N, E are all absent in the secret word. That's quite surprising because these are common letters! 

Hmm, this means the secret word contains none of these letters. So I need to completely exclude C, R, A, N, E from consideration. That narrows down possibilities significantly. The word likely uses less common consonants and maybe different vowels. Letters like U, O, I could be vowels to prioritize now, along with consonants like S, T, L that haven't been tested yet.

Since none of those common letters appeared, perhaps the word has duplicates? No, the rules don't specify unique letters but feedback symbols don't indicate duplicates clearly. Still possible. 

For the next guess, I should avoid all previous letters and maximize new information. Possible candidates: ""SPLIT"" tests S, P, L, I – but I is the only vowel. ""MOUTH"" has O, U which are vowels not tested and common consonants M, T, H. ""GUIDE"" has G, U, I, D – but U and I haven't been checked, and E is already excluded. 

""MOUTH"" seems strong: M, O, U, T, H covers new vowels O/U and common T/H. M and H aren't too rare either. ""PILOT"" has reused O but L/T new – but O may be redundant if tested in ""MOUTH"". Since we need maximum new information, ""MOUTH"" gives five brand-new letters. 

Alternatively ""LIGHT"" – L, I, G, H, T – but lacks vowel variety. ""BUOYS"" has Y as vowel substitute? But less common. ""MOIST"" combines many common letters but O/I may cover vowels better. 

Between ""MOUTH"" and ""MOIST"", both have strengths. ""MOUTH"" includes U which is more distinctive while ""MOIST"" has S/T combo. Given previous miss, distinctiveness matters. So ""MOUTH"" it is – U and O in one guess give wider vowel coverage. 

Also confirms absence/presence of T/H which is useful for consonant structure. If secret word avoids common letters, testing mid-frequency characters like T/H might hit something. 

Final choice: ""MOUTH"".Based on the feedback from the first guess **""CRANE""** (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word**. This means:
- The secret word contains no ""C"", ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- I need to choose a new guess that completely **avoids** these letters to test different vowels/consonants.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- Since common vowels (A, E) are excluded, prioritize other vowels like **O, U, I** and common consonants not yet tested (e.g., **S, T, L, M**).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize new information.
- Probable letters: High-frequency consonants like **S, T, L**, and vowels **O, U, I**.

Good candidate words:
- **""MOUTH""**: Tests M, O, U, T, H (all new letters). Covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, M, H).
- **""GHOUL""**: Tests G, H, O, U, L. Strong vowel coverage (O, U), but less common consonants (G).
- **""PILOT""**: Tests P, I, L, O, T. Solid mix of vowels (I, O) and essential consonants (L, T).

**Best choice: ""MOUTH""**  
Why?  
- It tests five completely new letters: two vowels (**O, U**) and three consonants (**M, T, H**).  
- These letters are moderately common and likely to appear in English words.
- Avoids wasted letters (all excluded from Guess 1).

<guess>MOUTH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters are absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x)

Breaking down the feedback for MOUTH:
- O is correct and in the correct position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed T in the fourth position and it's marked as misplaced).
- M, U, H are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain M, U, or H.

Given that, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also know that from the first guess, we excluded A and E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O (which we have), and possibly Y. But O is already confirmed.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
1. Have O in the second position to match the correct placement.
2. Include the letter T, but not in the fourth position (since it's misplaced there). So T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
3. Avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We also want to test new common letters to gather more information. Common letters we haven't tested yet include: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.

Possible positions for T:
- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _
- If T is in position 3: _ O T _ _
- If T is in position 5: _ O _ _ T

We should design a guess that can help us narrow down the position of T and also test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the second position.
- Must contain T, but not in the fourth position.
- No C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.

We can consider words like:
- Position 1: T O ... ? 
  - Example: TOILS (but S is new, I is new, L is new) - but we have to check if letters are allowed. TOILS: T, O, I, L, S. O is fixed in second, T in first. But we don't know if T is in first. Also, we have to avoid excluded letters: TOILS is okay? T, O, I, L, S. None of the excluded letters are in it. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H. So TOILS is valid.

- Position 3: _ O T ... 
  - Example: LOTUS, but U is excluded. Not allowed. 
  - Another: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - POINT? But P, O, I, N, T -> N is excluded (from first guess). Not allowed.

- Position 5: _ O _ _ T
  - Example: BOOST? But O is duplicated and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in MOUTH, O was correct and we don't have any duplicate feedback, so we don't know. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary. Also, BOOST has O twice, and we have O already fixed. But let's avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

We need to test new letters. We haven't tested: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, F, V, W, K, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has T in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me try to form a word with T in position 1: T O _ _ _

We need three more letters, avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, W, Y, etc. (but O is already used, and we don't want to duplicate unless necessary).

But we can use O again? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know. But since we have O fixed, and we don't have any indication of a duplicate, it's safer to avoid O in other positions to test more letters.

So for T O _ _ _, we can have:

- T O I _ _ : e.g., TOILS (T,O,I,L,S) -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. But we have T in position 1, which is a possibility. Also, we can test I, L, S.

But note: in MOUTH, T was misplaced in position 4, but now we are putting T in position 1. That's okay because we know T is not in position 4, but it could be in 1.

Another option: T O W _ _ : TOWEL? But E is excluded. Not allowed. TOWED? E excluded. TOWN? W and N, but N is excluded. Not good.

T O P _ _ : TOPIC? C is excluded. TOPAZ? A and Z, A excluded. Not good.

T O K _ _ : TOKEN? E and N excluded. Not good.

T O L _ _ : TOLES? E excluded. TOLYL? Not a word. TOLUS? U excluded.

So TOILS seems a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S. All new letters and not excluded.

What about T in position 3: _ O T _ _

We need first letter, then O, then T, then two more.

First letter: cannot be excluded, so from available: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, W, Y, etc.

Examples:
- B O T _ _ : BOTCH? C and H excluded. BOTHY? H excluded. BOTEL? E excluded. Not good.
- D O T _ _ : DOTED? E excluded. DOTAL? A excluded. Not good.
- G O T _ _ : GOTHS? H excluded. GOTTA? A excluded. Not good.
- L O T _ _ : LOTAS? A excluded? A is excluded. LOTUS? U excluded. 
- P O T _ _ : POTTY? T duplicate? We don't know. But also Y is new. But T is already in the word? We are putting T in position 3, and if the word has another T? But we don't know. POTSY? S and Y. But is POTSY a word? It might be obscure. Let's avoid for now.
- S O T _ _ : SOTOL? O duplicate? S,O,T,O,L -> two O's. But we don't know if O is duplicated. Also, L is new. But SOTOL is a word? It's a plant, but might be accepted. However, we have O again, which we already know is in the word, so it might be better to test new letters.

Not many good options for T in position 3.

Now, T in position 5: _ O _ _ T

Examples:
- B O _ _ T: BOAST? A and S, but A excluded. BOOST? O duplicate. BOLT? Only 4 letters. Need 5.
- D O _ _ T: DOUBT? U excluded. DOWNT? Not a word.
- F O _ _ T: FOIST? O, I, S, T. But O is in second, then I in third? FOIST: F, O, I, S, T. So positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. This avoids excluded letters: F, O, I, S, T. O is fixed, T is in position 5 (which is allowed, since T is not in position 4). And we test F, I, S.

Similarly, G O _ _ T: GOALT? Not a word. GOOST? Not a word. GORST? Not common.
- L O _ _ T: LOIST? O, I, S, T. LOIST: L, O, I, S, T. Similar to FOIST but with L instead of F.
- P O _ _ T: POINT? N excluded. POULT? U excluded. POIST? Not a word.
- S O _ _ T: SOFAT? F and A, A excluded. SORT? 4 letters. SOOTY? O duplicate and Y. But SOOTY: S, O, O, T, Y. We have O again and Y.

So good candidates are:
- TOILS: T in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.
- FOIST: F in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5.
- LOIST: L in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5. (LOIST is a word? It might be archaic, but Wordle often accepts such words. Let me confirm: LOIST is not in standard dictionaries, but it might be in Wordle's word list. To be safe, we can use a more common word.)

Another common word: POSIT? But that's 5 letters: P, O, S, I, T. But then T is in position 5, and O in 2. But POSIT: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That works. And it's a common word.

Similarly, FOIST is also common.

But in POSIT, we have S and I, which are common.

Now, comparing TOILS and POSIT/FOIST:

- TOILS: T in position 1. But we don't know if T is in position 1. If we guess TOILS and T is not in position 1, we might get feedback that T is misplaced (if it's in the word but wrong position) or absent (if it's not in the word? but we know T is in the word, so it would be misplaced). But we know T is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it's not there, it will be marked as misplaced.

Similarly, in POSIT, T is in position 5.

We want to test the position of T.

Also, we want to test new letters.

In TOILS, we test T, I, L, S (O is fixed and known).

In POSIT, we test P, O, S, I, T (O and T are known to be in the word, but we are testing positions).

We also have to consider that in MOUTH, T was in position 4 and was misplaced. So T cannot be in position 4. In TOILS, we put T in 1, L in 4. In POSIT, we put S in 3? POSIT: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. So position 4 is I, not T, so that's fine.

But we are testing T in position 5 in POSIT.

Now, which one to choose? We can also consider the frequency of letters.

We haven't tested S, L, I, P, F, etc.

Another candidate: if we put T in position 3, but we didn't find a great word. What about ""DOGIE""? But E excluded. Not good.

""POLIT""? But L and I, but POLIT: P, O, L, I, T. Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T. That's similar to POSIT but with L instead of S. And POLIT is a word? It might be less common.

I think POSIT is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in the first or last, to force it to be in position 3? But we didn't find a common word.

Another idea: since T is not in position 4, and we have O in 2, we can try to have T in position 3 and use common letters.

For example, ""POTSY""? P, O, T, S, Y. But Y is less common. And is it a word? POTS is a word, but POTSY? Not standard.

""LOFTY""? But F, T, Y. And O in 2? LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y. Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:F, 4:T, 5:Y. But in position 4, we are putting T. But from feedback, T is not in position 4 (because in MOUTH, T in position 4 was misplaced). So we cannot put T in position 4 again. That would be invalid because we know T is not there.

So in any new guess, we must not put T in position 4.

Therefore, in LOFTY, if we put T in position 4, it would be wrong because we know it's not there. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 4 for T.

So for TOILS: T in 1, L in 4 -> L is new, so that's fine.
For POSIT: I in 4, T in 5 -> fine.

Now, let's choose between TOILS and POSIT.

We can also consider ""FOIST"" which is similar to POSIT but with F.

But F is less common than P or S? In English, S is very common.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J is less common.

""HOIST"" - but H is excluded from MOUTH feedback (H(x)).

H is excluded, so we cannot use H.

So HOIST is invalid.

Therefore, FOIST or POSIT.

POSIT is more common.

But let's see the letters: in POSIT, we have P, O, S, I, T.

We test P, S, I.

In TOILS, we have T, O, I, L, S. We test T (position), I, L, S.

Both test I and S, but TOILS tests L and POSIT tests P.

L is more common than P? According to letter frequency, S is the most common, then I, then L, then P? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have exclusions.

Since E, A, O (partially), etc. are excluded, we focus on remaining.

S, I, L, D, P, etc.

S is very common, I is common, L is common, P is less common than S and I.

So TOILS tests S, I, L and also T (which we know is present).

POSIT tests S, I, P and T.

But in TOILS, we are putting T in position 1, which might be risky if T is actually in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, we put T in position 5.

We can choose a word that doesn't commit to a specific position for T but still includes it? But we have to place it somewhere.

Another idea: use a word with T in position 3, but we need a valid word.

What about ""DOZIT""? Not a word.

""KOFTI""? Not common.

I think TOILS or POSIT are fine.

But let's consider the feedback from MOUTH: we have O correct in position 2, and T misplaced. So the word has O in second and T somewhere else.

In TOILS, if we guess:
- If T is in position 1, and if it is correct, we get T(✓), then we know position 1 is T.
- If T is not in position 1, we get T(-) meaning misplaced, and we know it must be in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in POSIT, if T is in position 5, if correct, we know; if not, it must be in 1 or 3.

But we don't have a word that avoids putting T in a specific position.

We could choose a word that has T in position 3? Let me try to find one.

For example, ""BOITE""? But E excluded and O duplicate? BOITE: B,O,I,T,E -> E excluded.

""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> U excluded.

""TOWIE""? W, I, E -> E excluded.

Not finding good options.

""GOATS""? A excluded.

So I think we should go with either TOILS or POSIT.

I'll choose POSIT because it's a common word and tests P, which is new, and S and I.

In POSIT, we have:
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: O (known correct)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: I (new)
- Position 5: T (known present, but testing position)

This will give us information about the position of T and also test P, S, I.

If P is in the word, we'll know; similarly for S and I.

Also, if I is in the word and in position 4, etc.

So let's go with POSIT.

But we must ensure that the word is valid. POSIT is a valid Wordle word.

Another common word is ""SPOIL"", but that has O in second? S P O I L -> position 2 is P? No, position 2 is O? Let's see: S (1), P (2)? No, SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L -> so position 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:I, 5:L. But we need O in position 2, so that would be wrong. We must have O in position 2.

So we cannot use SPOIL because it has O in position 3.

Similarly, any guess must have O in the second position.

So POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That matches.

Similarly, FOIST: F, O, I, S, T -> same positions.

I think I'll go with POSIT.

But in the feedback, we have T misplaced from position 4, and in POSIT we are putting I in position 4. That's fine.

So my next guess: POSIT.

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H are excluded. POSIT has P,O,S,I,T — none of these are excluded. O is allowed because it's in the word, but we are using it again, which is fine.

So I think it's good.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains **none** of these letters.
- **Guess 2: MOUTH** → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x). This tells us:
  - **O is correct and in position 2** (so the secret word has O as the second letter: `_ O _ _ _`).
  - **T is present but misplaced** (so T is in the word, but not in position 4).
  - M, U, and H are absent (so the secret word contains none of these).
- **Excluded letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H (cannot be used in new guesses).
- **Key constraints for the next guess**:
  - Must have **O in position 2**.
  - Must include **T**, but **not in position 4** (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, B, G, Y) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test the position of T (positions 1, 3, or 5) while introducing new high-frequency letters to maximize information. Common untested letters like S, I, L, and P are good candidates.
- **Word selection**:
  - Considered words like **TOILS** (T in position 1, tests I, L, S) and **FOIST** (T in position 5, tests F, I, S), but **POSIT** was chosen because:
    - It places O in position 2 (required).
    - It places T in position 5 (testing if T is at the end, which is a valid possibility).
    - It tests three new common letters: **P** (position 1), **S** (position 3), and **I** (position 4).
    - All letters (P, O, S, I, T) are distinct and not excluded.
    - ""POSIT"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""to assume as fact"").
- **Expected outcomes**:
  - If P, S, or I are correct or misplaced, it will reveal their status/position.
  - If T is in position 5, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be misplaced (-) and must be in position 1 or 3.
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>POSIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)
Guess 3: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We now have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)
  This tells us:
    - O is in the correct position (second).
    - T is present but not in the fourth position (so T is in position 1, 3, or 5).
    - M, U, H are absent.
Guess 3: POSIT -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)
  This tells us:
    - O is correct (second position, as before).
    - T is correct? T(✓) means T is in the correct position. Since we put T in position 5, T is the fifth letter of the secret word.
    - S is present but not in the third position (we put S in position 3, so it's misplaced).
    - I is present but not in the fourth position (we put I in position 4).
    - P is absent.

So now we know:
  Secret word pattern: _ O _ _ T
    - Second letter is O, fifth letter is T.
  Letters in the word: O, T, S, I (since S and I are present, though misplaced).
  Excluded letters (absent): C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P (from guess 1, 2, and 3).

Additionally, we know S is in the word but not in position 3, and I is in the word but not in position 4.

The secret word has the form: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] T

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4.

Known letters: S and I must be placed in positions 1, 3, or 4. But since we have two letters (S and I) and three positions, and the word has five letters, we know two letters (O and T) and we know S and I are present, so the other two positions must have S and I? Not necessarily, because there could be other letters. We don't know all letters yet.

From feedback:
- S and I are in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicate letters? So far no indication of duplicates.
- We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P and found them absent, so the word must be composed of letters not in this exclusion list.

Available letters: besides S and I, we might have other letters. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled, and we have S and I to place, but there might be another letter that hasn't been tested yet.

But from the constraints:
- Word: [1] O [3] [4] T
- Contains S and I, which must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- But S cannot be in position 3 (because in POSIT, S was in position 3 and marked misplaced, meaning either S is not position 3 or it is but in a duplicate? Given that we don't have duplicate info, assume no duplicates for now).
- Similar for I: cannot be in position 4.

So S must be in position 1 or 4.
I must be in position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we need to consider that only one letter at position 1, so if both S and I are assigned to position 1, conflict? We have to select one for each.

Possible placements:
Position 1: could be S or I, or another letter? If we assign both S and I to positions 1,3,4, but there are three positions, so there might be another letter.

We must include S and I in some of positions 1,3,4, and the remaining spot must be a new letter that we haven't tested (or possibly not, but we might have all letters?).

Since we have two known present letters (S and I) that need to be placed in the three open positions, there must be at least one more letter that hasn't been guessed yet? Or no.

Let me list the knowns:
- The word has O in 2 and T in 5.
- It has S and I somewhere.
- There are three positions left: 1,3,4.
- Each of these positions must be filled with letters not excluded.

But S and I are two letters to place in three spots. Therefore, position 1,3,4 collectively have two of these (S and I) and one other letter.

That other letter has not been guessed yet? We haven't tested many letters.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,O,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z? But O and T are already placed, and we are placing S and I.

So any new letter must come from B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc.

But we know the word has exactly S and I as the other letters, so the third position must be filled with one of these available letters.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test:
- Position 1: S or I or a new letter.
- Position 3: I or S or a new letter, but with constraints.

We want to confirm the positions of S and I and find the new letter.

Perhaps we can form a word that fits possible patterns.

Possible configurations:
Case 1: Position 1 is S, then S must not be in position 3? But we can have it. Then position 3 could be I, position 4 must be a new letter? But I must be in position 1 or 3? Wait, no: I must be placed, and position 4 in this case would be free.

List of possibilities for S and I:
- S can be in pos 1 or 4
- I can be in pos 1 or 3

But if S is in pos 1, then position 4 could be something else, and I must be in pos 3? Or pos 1 is S, so I could be in pos 3? Or pos 1 could be I, then S in pos 4? etc.

Also, since in guess 3, when we put S in pos 3, it was misplaced, meaning S is not position 3. Similarly, I in pos 4 was misplaced, so I is not position 4.

So possible assignments:
- Position 1: either S, I, or a new letter.
- Position 3: can be I (since I can be there) or a new letter, but not S (which is banned from pos 3).
- Position 4: can be S (since S can be there) or a new letter, but not I (banned from pos 4).

But since S and I must be placed in the word, we have to assign them.

So combinations:
A. Position 1: S
   Then I must be in position 3 (since position 4 cannot have I, and position 1 is taken). Then position 4 must be a new letter, say X.
   Word: S O I X T

B. Position 1: I
   Then S must be in position 4 (since position 3 cannot have S, and position 1 is taken). Then position 3 is a new letter, say Y.
   Word: I O Y S T

C. Position 1: new letter, say Z.
   Then we have to place S and I.
   Since S cannot be in 3 and I cannot be in 4:
      Position 3: I (since I can be here, and S cannot)
      Position 4: S (since S can be here, and I cannot)
   Word: Z O I S T

D. Position 1: new letter Z.
   But alternative? If position 3 cannot have S, so must have I or new. But if we put I in position 3, then position 4 must be S? Yes, that's the only option because if position 4 is something else, then I must be placed elsewhere? Only position 3 is available for I in this case? In case C, we have Z O I S T.

What if position 3 is new? But then I must go somewhere. Position 1 is taken by Z, position 3 is new (say W), then position 4 must be S or I? But if position 4 is S, then I has to be in position? Position 1,3,4 are filled: Z (new at pos1), W (new at pos3), S at pos4, then where is I? We know I is in the word. So I must be in one of these positions? Contradiction. Similarly, if position 4 is I, but I cannot be in position 4 from the feedback (I in position 4 was misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4). Therefore, if position 1 is new, then position 3 must be I (since only position 3 available for I), and position 4 must be S. So only C is possible: Z O I S T.

Similarly, if position 1 is S or I, we have cases A and B.

Therefore, possible secret words:
Type A: S O I X T, where X is a new letter (any letter not excluded and not O,T,S,I? But S and I are used, and O,T are fixed).
Type B: I O Y S T, where Y is a new letter.
Type C: Z O I S T, where Z is a new letter.

In type C: Z O I S T, but note that positions: Z at 1, I at 3, S at 4? Then the word has Z, O, I, S, T. So letters: Z,O,I,S,T.

Similarly, type A: S,O,I,X,T? Letters: S,O,I,X,T? But S and I are common, X new.

Type B: I,O,Y,S,T? Letters: I,O,Y,S,T.

For the word to be valid, we need to find actual words.

Not all letters X,Y,Z are possible; only certain letters make real words.

We must choose a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and find the new letter.

We have not tested many letters beyond the common ones. For example, we haven't tested B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc., but we excluded some.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.

So available new letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z? But X,Y,Z are variables.

For the new letter, it can be any consonant or vowel not excluded.

But we need to form a word.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to guess one of the possible patterns.

For example, if we guess a word that fits type A, B, or C, we can get feedback.

But we need to select a word that uses new letters to test.

Since we have limited guesses, we might guess a word that covers the possibilities.

But let's list possible words for each type:

Type A: S O I _ T? Possible words: SOFIT? - meaning? Not a common word. SOBIT? Not a word. KOTIS is not SO IST? What words have S,O,I,?,T with pattern S O I ? T.

Looking at English words: POINT? But P excluded, and N excluded. JOIN? 4 letters. JOINT? Similarly excluded. FOIST? But F,O,I,S,T? Pattern is F O I S T, which is not S O I X T. We want S in position 1.

Valid words? ""SOFTI"" not word. ""SOUTH"" but U excluded. Not many options. ""SOLIT""? Not common.

Perhaps no common word with this pattern? ""STOIT""? Not a word. ""STOIC"" but C excluded. ""SOXIT""? Not word.

So type A might be rare or impossible? Then perhaps we can skip it.

Type B: I O Y S T? Pattern I O ? S T. So position 3 is Y.

Words: I O ? S T. E.g., ""IOTAS""? But A excluded. ""IOCUS""? Not word. ""IOBES""? E excluded. ""IOGHT""? H excluded. Not good.

""IOKST""? Not a word.

Common words? ""JOUST"" but J,O,U,S,T -> U excluded. ""GHOST"" H excluded. Not finding.

Perhaps ""COITS"" but C excluded. So no common words? Then type B might be unlikely.

Type C: ? O I S T. Pattern Z O I S T.

Words: BOIST? Not common. COIST? C excluded. DOIST? Not word. FOIST? F O I S T. That's F in position 1? Then FOIST: F,O,I,S,T -> positions 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T? But in our case for type C, pattern is Z O I S T, so position 1:Z, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T.

But FOIST has the pattern: F,O,I,S,T -> so it matches? But in the word FOIST, position 3 is I and position 4 is S.

But in our case, for type C: Z O I S T, so it has I in position 3, S in position 4.

FOIST is an example: F O I S T.

Now, is F excluded? No, F has not been tested. Only excluded letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P. F is available.

Other possibilities? GOIST? Not common. JOIST: J O I S T. J is available. LOIST? L O I S T. Etc.

Common words: FOIST, JOIST, HOIST? But H is excluded. HOIST has H, excluded. MOIST? M excluded. POIST not word. SOIST? Not common? But SOIST might be obscure.

Valid options: FOIST, JOIST, etc.

But JOIST is a word (a beam in construction). FOIST also.

We also have TOIST? But T is in position 5? Pattern is Z O I S T, position 1 is new. If we put T in position 1, but T is already in position 5? We cannot because letters can repeat? The rules don't prohibit duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any indication.

In this case, secret word could have duplicate? But from feedback, in previous guesses, no duplicates mentioned. But possible.

In FOIST, letters F,O,I,S,T all distinct.

Similarly, in JOIST, J,O,I,S,T - distinct.

So possible secret words include FOIST, JOIST, etc.

But there might be others, like if Z is L, LOIST? Not common, but possible.

But for the guess, we can try to guess one of these.

Since we don't know which, we need to test.

But we have only three guesses left? We are on guess 4, so three more to go? The user said we have 6 tries, so after guess 3, we have three left.

We can guess FOIST, for example, but if it's not correct, we get information about F.

FOIST would be a valid guess, but in our previous guess, we guessed POSIT which has P,O,S,I,T. Now FOIST has F,O,I,S,T. So similar, but F instead of P.

But P was excluded.

So for guess 4, we can guess FOIST.

But FOIST has O in position 2, S in position 4, I in position 3? FOIST: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).

But in the secret word, we have:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown

And we know S is misplaced, I is misplaced.

In FOIST:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 1: F

Now, from the type C pattern, Z O I S T, so if F is in position 1, I in 3, S in 4, then FOIST matches that.

But there could be other patterns? Earlier we concluded only type C is likely? Because types A and B had no common words.

But let's confirm: in the secret word, S cannot be in position 3 (from POSIT feedback S in pos3 misplaced), and I cannot be in position 4.

In FOIST, we are putting I in position 3, S in position 4.

If the secret word is FOIST, then position 3:I should be correct? But we don't know that.

Similarly, position 4:S might be correct.

But by guessing FOIST, we effectively test if the word is FOIST.

If it is, we win.

If not, we get feedback on F, and positions of I and S might be clarified.

S is in position 4 in FOIST. From the feedback, we don't know if S is correct there or misplaced.

Similarly for I in position 3.

But we already know that in POSIT, when we put I in position 4, it was misplaced, so I cannot be in position 4. But position 3 might be okay.

Similarly, S cannot be in position 3.

So FOIST is a candidate.

Another candidate is JOIST.

But to choose, we can pick the most common one.

Perhaps try a word that doesn't assume the S and I positions, but tests them.

For example, put I in position 1 and S in position 4? Or something.

But let's see.

Case: put position 1: I (testing if I is in position 1)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: a new letter, say L
Position 4: S (testing if S is in position 4)
Position 5: T (fixed)

So guess: I O L S T → ""IOLST""? But is that a word? ""LOST"" but with I and S? Not a valid word.

Other possibilities: with F? ""FOLKS""? But K and S? But pattern? Position 4 is S? And K new? But F O ? K T? Not I O ? S T.

To fit the word, it must have S and I somewhere.

But if we put I in position 1 and S in position 4, then position 3 must be a new letter.

Possible words: ?

For example, ""DIGST""? Not word. ""BIGST"" no.

Common words: ""WRIST"" but W,R,I,S,T -> R excluded? R is excluded from guess 1.

""GRIST""? Also R excluded. ""TRYST"" R excluded and Y? etc.

No good five-letter words with I in position 1, O in 2, new in 3, S in 4, T in 5.

Similarly, other patterns are difficult.

So the most likely pattern is type C, like FOIST, JOIST.

Therefore, I'll guess FOIST.

It uses F, which is new, and if correct, we win; if not, we get information.

JOIST is another option, but F is more common than J? Varies.

But FOIST is fine.

So my guess: FOISTBased on the feedback from previous guesses, let me analyze the constraints and possible options for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern Determination**:  
   - From Guess 2 (MOUTH → O(✓)), we know the second letter is **O**.  
   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → O(✓), T(✓)), we know the second letter is **O** and the fifth letter is **T**.  
   - The secret word must be of the form: `_ O _ _ T`.

2. **Present Letters**:  
   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → S(-), I(-)), **S** and **I** are in the word but misplaced.  
   - S cannot be in position 3 (since S was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  
   - I cannot be in position 4 (since I was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  
   - Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 4, and I must be in position 1 or 3.

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - Absent letters from all guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P.  
   - The secret word contains none of these, so only untested letters or known presents (S, I) can be used.

4. **Possible Secret Word Structures**:  
   Given S and I must be placed with their constraints, and no duplicates are indicated, the secret word must match one of three patterns:  
   - **Type A**: `S O I X T` (X is a new untested letter, e.g., F, G, L).  
     - But common English words fitting this pattern (like SOFTI or SOFIT) are rare or invalid.  
   - **Type B**: `I O Y S T` (Y is a new untested letter).  
     - Common words (e.g., IOTAS) are invalid due to excluded letters (A), making this pattern unlikely.  
   - **Type C**: `Z O I S T` (Z is a new untested letter, e.g., F, J, L).  
     - This yield valid words like **FOIST** (F in position 1), **JOIST** (J in position 1), or **LOIST** (L in position 1). FOIST is a common word meaning ""to insert surreptitiously,"" making it plausible.  

5. **Choosing the Next Guess**:  
   - **FOIST** (F O I S T) tests the most likely Type C pattern:  
     - Positions: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).  
     - Verifies if:
       - F is present/absent and its position.
       - S and I positions: I in pos 3 (correct?) and S in pos 4 (correct?).
     - If FOIST is correct, we solve the game. If not, feedback on F, S, and I positions will confirm or refute Type C and guide Guess 5.
   - Alternative candidates like JOIST or LOIST are less common, so FOIST maximizes information and likelihood.

6. **Why FOIST?**  
   - It covers key constraints (O in pos 2, T in pos 5) and positions S and I per rules.  
   - Tests F, a new high-frequency consonant (from available letters B, D, F, G, K, L).  
   - Avoids excluded letters efficiently.

A good starting word should also avoid duplicate letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.\n\nAfter considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:\n- It includes a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).\n- All letters are distinct, preventing redundancy.\n- Based on English letter frequency, E and A are the most common vowels, while R, N, and C are relatively common consonants, potentially providing broad feedback.\n\nThis guess will help me identify correct positions, misplaced letters, or absent letters, which I can use for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Okay, the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess in this Wordle-style game. Looking at the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", all letters got marked as ""x"" – C, R, A, N, E are all absent in the secret word. That\'s quite surprising because these are common letters! \n\nHmm, this means the secret word contains none of these letters. So I need to completely exclude C, R, A, N, E from consideration. That narrows down possibilities significantly. The word likely uses less common consonants and maybe different vowels. Letters like U, O, I could be vowels to prioritize now, along with consonants like S, T, L that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nSince none of those common letters appeared, perhaps the word has duplicates? No, the rules don\'t specify unique letters but feedback symbols don\'t indicate duplicates clearly. Still possible. \n\nFor the next guess, I should avoid all previous letters and maximize new information. Possible candidates: ""SPLIT"" tests S, P, L, I – but I is the only vowel. ""MOUTH"" has O, U which are vowels not tested and common consonants M, T, H. ""GUIDE"" has G, U, I, D – but U and I haven\'t been checked, and E is already excluded. \n\n""MOUTH"" seems strong: M, O, U, T, H covers new vowels O/U and common T/H. M and H aren\'t too rare either. ""PILOT"" has reused O but L/T new – but O may be redundant if tested in ""MOUTH"". Since we need maximum new information, ""MOUTH"" gives five brand-new letters. \n\nAlternatively ""LIGHT"" – L, I, G, H, T – but lacks vowel variety. ""BUOYS"" has Y as vowel substitute? But less common. ""MOIST"" combines many common letters but O/I may cover vowels better. \n\nBetween ""MOUTH"" and ""MOIST"", both have strengths. ""MOUTH"" includes U which is more distinctive while ""MOIST"" has S/T combo. Given previous miss, distinctiveness matters. So ""MOUTH"" it is – U and O in one guess give wider vowel coverage. \n\nAlso confirms absence/presence of T/H which is useful for consonant structure. If secret word avoids common letters, testing mid-frequency characters like T/H might hit something. \n\nFinal choice: ""MOUTH"".Based on the feedback from the first guess **""CRANE""** (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word**. This means:\n- The secret word contains no ""C"", ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", or ""E"".\n- I need to choose a new guess that completely **avoids** these letters to test different vowels/consonants.\n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- Since common vowels (A, E) are excluded, prioritize other vowels like **O, U, I** and common consonants not yet tested (e.g., **S, T, L, M**).\n- Avoid repeating letters to maximize new information.\n- Probable letters: High-frequency consonants like **S, T, L**, and vowels **O, U, I**.\n\nGood candidate words:\n- **""MOUTH""**: Tests M, O, U, T, H (all new letters). Covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, M, H).\n- **""GHOUL""**: Tests G, H, O, U, L. Strong vowel coverage (O, U), but less common consonants (G).\n- **""PILOT""**: Tests P, I, L, O, T. Solid mix of vowels (I, O) and essential consonants (L, T).\n\n**Best choice: ""MOUTH""**  \nWhy?  \n- It tests five completely new letters: two vowels (**O, U**) and three consonants (**M, T, H**).  \n- These letters are moderately common and likely to appear in English words.\n- Avoids wasted letters (all excluded from Guess 1).\n\n<guess>MOUTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> All letters are absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x)\n\nBreaking down the feedback for MOUTH:\n- O is correct and in the correct position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is O.\n- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed T in the fourth position and it\'s marked as misplaced).\n- M, U, H are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain M, U, or H.\n\nGiven that, we know:\n- The secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ _\n- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we excluded A and E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O (which we have), and possibly Y. But O is already confirmed.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to:\n1. Have O in the second position to match the correct placement.\n2. Include the letter T, but not in the fourth position (since it\'s misplaced there). So T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n3. Avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to gather more information. Common letters we haven\'t tested yet include: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.\n\nPossible positions for T:\n- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _\n- If T is in position 3: _ O T _ _\n- If T is in position 5: _ O _ _ T\n\nWe should design a guess that can help us narrow down the position of T and also test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- Must have O in the second position.\n- Must contain T, but not in the fourth position.\n- No C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H.\n\nWe can consider words like:\n- Position 1: T O ... ? \n  - Example: TOILS (but S is new, I is new, L is new) - but we have to check if letters are allowed. TOILS: T, O, I, L, S. O is fixed in second, T in first. But we don\'t know if T is in first. Also, we have to avoid excluded letters: TOILS is okay? T, O, I, L, S. None of the excluded letters are in it. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H. So TOILS is valid.\n\n- Position 3: _ O T ... \n  - Example: LOTUS, but U is excluded. Not allowed. \n  - Another: BOTHY? But H is excluded. \n  - POINT? But P, O, I, N, T -> N is excluded (from first guess). Not allowed.\n\n- Position 5: _ O _ _ T\n  - Example: BOOST? But O is duplicated and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in MOUTH, O was correct and we don\'t have any duplicate feedback, so we don\'t know. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary. Also, BOOST has O twice, and we have O already fixed. But let\'s avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.\n\nWe need to test new letters. We haven\'t tested: S, L, I, D, P, B, G, Y, F, V, W, K, etc.\n\nA good candidate might be a word that has T in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\nLet me try to form a word with T in position 1: T O _ _ _\n\nWe need three more letters, avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H.\n\nPossible letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, W, Y, etc. (but O is already used, and we don\'t want to duplicate unless necessary).\n\nBut we can use O again? The secret word might have two O\'s? We don\'t know. But since we have O fixed, and we don\'t have any indication of a duplicate, it\'s safer to avoid O in other positions to test more letters.\n\nSo for T O _ _ _, we can have:\n\n- T O I _ _ : e.g., TOILS (T,O,I,L,S) -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. But we have T in position 1, which is a possibility. Also, we can test I, L, S.\n\nBut note: in MOUTH, T was misplaced in position 4, but now we are putting T in position 1. That\'s okay because we know T is not in position 4, but it could be in 1.\n\nAnother option: T O W _ _ : TOWEL? But E is excluded. Not allowed. TOWED? E excluded. TOWN? W and N, but N is excluded. Not good.\n\nT O P _ _ : TOPIC? C is excluded. TOPAZ? A and Z, A excluded. Not good.\n\nT O K _ _ : TOKEN? E and N excluded. Not good.\n\nT O L _ _ : TOLES? E excluded. TOLYL? Not a word. TOLUS? U excluded.\n\nSo TOILS seems a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S. All new letters and not excluded.\n\nWhat about T in position 3: _ O T _ _\n\nWe need first letter, then O, then T, then two more.\n\nFirst letter: cannot be excluded, so from available: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, W, Y, etc.\n\nExamples:\n- B O T _ _ : BOTCH? C and H excluded. BOTHY? H excluded. BOTEL? E excluded. Not good.\n- D O T _ _ : DOTED? E excluded. DOTAL? A excluded. Not good.\n- G O T _ _ : GOTHS? H excluded. GOTTA? A excluded. Not good.\n- L O T _ _ : LOTAS? A excluded? A is excluded. LOTUS? U excluded. \n- P O T _ _ : POTTY? T duplicate? We don\'t know. But also Y is new. But T is already in the word? We are putting T in position 3, and if the word has another T? But we don\'t know. POTSY? S and Y. But is POTSY a word? It might be obscure. Let\'s avoid for now.\n- S O T _ _ : SOTOL? O duplicate? S,O,T,O,L -> two O\'s. But we don\'t know if O is duplicated. Also, L is new. But SOTOL is a word? It\'s a plant, but might be accepted. However, we have O again, which we already know is in the word, so it might be better to test new letters.\n\nNot many good options for T in position 3.\n\nNow, T in position 5: _ O _ _ T\n\nExamples:\n- B O _ _ T: BOAST? A and S, but A excluded. BOOST? O duplicate. BOLT? Only 4 letters. Need 5.\n- D O _ _ T: DOUBT? U excluded. DOWNT? Not a word.\n- F O _ _ T: FOIST? O, I, S, T. But O is in second, then I in third? FOIST: F, O, I, S, T. So positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. This avoids excluded letters: F, O, I, S, T. O is fixed, T is in position 5 (which is allowed, since T is not in position 4). And we test F, I, S.\n\nSimilarly, G O _ _ T: GOALT? Not a word. GOOST? Not a word. GORST? Not common.\n- L O _ _ T: LOIST? O, I, S, T. LOIST: L, O, I, S, T. Similar to FOIST but with L instead of F.\n- P O _ _ T: POINT? N excluded. POULT? U excluded. POIST? Not a word.\n- S O _ _ T: SOFAT? F and A, A excluded. SORT? 4 letters. SOOTY? O duplicate and Y. But SOOTY: S, O, O, T, Y. We have O again and Y.\n\nSo good candidates are:\n- TOILS: T in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.\n- FOIST: F in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5.\n- LOIST: L in 1, O in 2, I in 3, S in 4, T in 5. (LOIST is a word? It might be archaic, but Wordle often accepts such words. Let me confirm: LOIST is not in standard dictionaries, but it might be in Wordle\'s word list. To be safe, we can use a more common word.)\n\nAnother common word: POSIT? But that\'s 5 letters: P, O, S, I, T. But then T is in position 5, and O in 2. But POSIT: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That works. And it\'s a common word.\n\nSimilarly, FOIST is also common.\n\nBut in POSIT, we have S and I, which are common.\n\nNow, comparing TOILS and POSIT/FOIST:\n\n- TOILS: T in position 1. But we don\'t know if T is in position 1. If we guess TOILS and T is not in position 1, we might get feedback that T is misplaced (if it\'s in the word but wrong position) or absent (if it\'s not in the word? but we know T is in the word, so it would be misplaced). But we know T is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it\'s not there, it will be marked as misplaced.\n\nSimilarly, in POSIT, T is in position 5.\n\nWe want to test the position of T.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nIn TOILS, we test T, I, L, S (O is fixed and known).\n\nIn POSIT, we test P, O, S, I, T (O and T are known to be in the word, but we are testing positions).\n\nWe also have to consider that in MOUTH, T was in position 4 and was misplaced. So T cannot be in position 4. In TOILS, we put T in 1, L in 4. In POSIT, we put S in 3? POSIT: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. So position 4 is I, not T, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are testing T in position 5 in POSIT.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, L, I, P, F, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: if we put T in position 3, but we didn\'t find a great word. What about ""DOGIE""? But E excluded. Not good.\n\n""POLIT""? But L and I, but POLIT: P, O, L, I, T. Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T. That\'s similar to POSIT but with L instead of S. And POLIT is a word? It might be less common.\n\nI think POSIT is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T in the first or last, to force it to be in position 3? But we didn\'t find a common word.\n\nAnother idea: since T is not in position 4, and we have O in 2, we can try to have T in position 3 and use common letters.\n\nFor example, ""POTSY""? P, O, T, S, Y. But Y is less common. And is it a word? POTS is a word, but POTSY? Not standard.\n\n""LOFTY""? But F, T, Y. And O in 2? LOFTY: L, O, F, T, Y. Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:F, 4:T, 5:Y. But in position 4, we are putting T. But from feedback, T is not in position 4 (because in MOUTH, T in position 4 was misplaced). So we cannot put T in position 4 again. That would be invalid because we know T is not there.\n\nSo in any new guess, we must not put T in position 4.\n\nTherefore, in LOFTY, if we put T in position 4, it would be wrong because we know it\'s not there. So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nSimilarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 4 for T.\n\nSo for TOILS: T in 1, L in 4 -> L is new, so that\'s fine.\nFor POSIT: I in 4, T in 5 -> fine.\n\nNow, let\'s choose between TOILS and POSIT.\n\nWe can also consider ""FOIST"" which is similar to POSIT but with F.\n\nBut F is less common than P or S? In English, S is very common.\n\nAnother word: ""JOIST"" - J is less common.\n\n""HOIST"" - but H is excluded from MOUTH feedback (H(x)).\n\nH is excluded, so we cannot use H.\n\nSo HOIST is invalid.\n\nTherefore, FOIST or POSIT.\n\nPOSIT is more common.\n\nBut let\'s see the letters: in POSIT, we have P, O, S, I, T.\n\nWe test P, S, I.\n\nIn TOILS, we have T, O, I, L, S. We test T (position), I, L, S.\n\nBoth test I and S, but TOILS tests L and POSIT tests P.\n\nL is more common than P? According to letter frequency, S is the most common, then I, then L, then P? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have exclusions.\n\nSince E, A, O (partially), etc. are excluded, we focus on remaining.\n\nS, I, L, D, P, etc.\n\nS is very common, I is common, L is common, P is less common than S and I.\n\nSo TOILS tests S, I, L and also T (which we know is present).\n\nPOSIT tests S, I, P and T.\n\nBut in TOILS, we are putting T in position 1, which might be risky if T is actually in position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, in POSIT, we put T in position 5.\n\nWe can choose a word that doesn\'t commit to a specific position for T but still includes it? But we have to place it somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with T in position 3, but we need a valid word.\n\nWhat about ""DOZIT""? Not a word.\n\n""KOFTI""? Not common.\n\nI think TOILS or POSIT are fine.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback from MOUTH: we have O correct in position 2, and T misplaced. So the word has O in second and T somewhere else.\n\nIn TOILS, if we guess:\n- If T is in position 1, and if it is correct, we get T(✓), then we know position 1 is T.\n- If T is not in position 1, we get T(-) meaning misplaced, and we know it must be in position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, in POSIT, if T is in position 5, if correct, we know; if not, it must be in 1 or 3.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that avoids putting T in a specific position.\n\nWe could choose a word that has T in position 3? Let me try to find one.\n\nFor example, ""BOITE""? But E excluded and O duplicate? BOITE: B,O,I,T,E -> E excluded.\n\n""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> U excluded.\n\n""TOWIE""? W, I, E -> E excluded.\n\nNot finding good options.\n\n""GOATS""? A excluded.\n\nSo I think we should go with either TOILS or POSIT.\n\nI\'ll choose POSIT because it\'s a common word and tests P, which is new, and S and I.\n\nIn POSIT, we have:\n- Position 1: P (new)\n- Position 2: O (known correct)\n- Position 3: S (new)\n- Position 4: I (new)\n- Position 5: T (known present, but testing position)\n\nThis will give us information about the position of T and also test P, S, I.\n\nIf P is in the word, we\'ll know; similarly for S and I.\n\nAlso, if I is in the word and in position 4, etc.\n\nSo let\'s go with POSIT.\n\nBut we must ensure that the word is valid. POSIT is a valid Wordle word.\n\nAnother common word is ""SPOIL"", but that has O in second? S P O I L -> position 2 is P? No, position 2 is O? Let\'s see: S (1), P (2)? No, SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L -> so position 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:I, 5:L. But we need O in position 2, so that would be wrong. We must have O in position 2.\n\nSo we cannot use SPOIL because it has O in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, any guess must have O in the second position.\n\nSo POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, FOIST: F, O, I, S, T -> same positions.\n\nI think I\'ll go with POSIT.\n\nBut in the feedback, we have T misplaced from position 4, and in POSIT we are putting I in position 4. That\'s fine.\n\nSo my next guess: POSIT.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H are excluded. POSIT has P,O,S,I,T — none of these are excluded. O is allowed because it\'s in the word, but we are using it again, which is fine.\n\nSo I think it\'s good.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains **none** of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: MOUTH** → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), U(x), T(-), H(x). This tells us:\n  - **O is correct and in position 2** (so the secret word has O as the second letter: `_ O _ _ _`).\n  - **T is present but misplaced** (so T is in the word, but not in position 4).\n  - M, U, and H are absent (so the secret word contains none of these).\n- **Excluded letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H (cannot be used in new guesses).\n- **Key constraints for the next guess**:\n  - Must have **O in position 2**.\n  - Must include **T**, but **not in position 4** (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 5).\n  - Avoid all excluded letters and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, B, G, Y) to gather more information.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Goal**: Test the position of T (positions 1, 3, or 5) while introducing new high-frequency letters to maximize information. Common untested letters like S, I, L, and P are good candidates.\n- **Word selection**:\n  - Considered words like **TOILS** (T in position 1, tests I, L, S) and **FOIST** (T in position 5, tests F, I, S), but **POSIT** was chosen because:\n    - It places O in position 2 (required).\n    - It places T in position 5 (testing if T is at the end, which is a valid possibility).\n    - It tests three new common letters: **P** (position 1), **S** (position 3), and **I** (position 4).\n    - All letters (P, O, S, I, T) are distinct and not excluded.\n    - ""POSIT"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""to assume as fact"").\n- **Expected outcomes**:\n  - If P, S, or I are correct or misplaced, it will reveal their status/position.\n  - If T is in position 5, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be misplaced (-) and must be in position 1 or 3.\n  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for the secret word.\n\n<guess>POSIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)\nGuess 3: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> All letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)\n  This tells us:\n    - O is in the correct position (second).\n    - T is present but not in the fourth position (so T is in position 1, 3, or 5).\n    - M, U, H are absent.\nGuess 3: POSIT -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)\n  This tells us:\n    - O is correct (second position, as before).\n    - T is correct? T(✓) means T is in the correct position.

But since we have two letters (S and I) and three positions, and the word has five letters, we know two letters (O and T) and we know S and I are present, so the other two positions must have S and I? Not necessarily, because there could be other letters. We don\'t know all letters yet.\n\nFrom feedback:\n- S and I are in the word, but we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? So far no indication of duplicates.\n- We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P and found them absent, so the word must be composed of letters not in this exclusion list.\n\nAvailable letters: besides S and I, we might have other letters. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled, and we have S and I to place, but there might be another letter that hasn\'t been tested yet.\n\nBut from the constraints:\n- Word: [1] O [3] [4] T\n- Contains S and I, which must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n- But S cannot be in position 3 (because in POSIT, S was in position 3 and marked misplaced, meaning either S is not position 3 or it is but in a duplicate? Given that we don\'t have duplicate info, assume no duplicates for now).\n- Similar for I: cannot be in position 4.\n\nSo S must be in position 1 or 4.\nI must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider that only one letter at position 1, so if both S and I are assigned to position 1, conflict? We have to select one for each.\n\nPossible placements:\nPosition 1: could be S or I, or another letter? If we assign both S and I to positions 1,3,4, but there are three positions, so there might be another letter.\n\nWe must include S and I in some of positions 1,3,4, and the remaining spot must be a new letter that we haven\'t tested (or possibly not, but we might have all letters?).\n\nSince we have two known present letters (S and I) that need to be placed in the three open positions, there must be at least one more letter that hasn\'t been guessed yet? Or no.\n\nLet me list the knowns:\n- The word has O in 2 and T in 5.\n- It has S and I somewhere.\n- There are three positions left: 1,3,4.\n- Each of these positions must be filled with letters not excluded.\n\nBut S and I are two letters to place in three spots. Therefore, position 1,3,4 collectively have two of these (S and I) and one other letter.\n\nThat other letter has not been guessed yet? We haven\'t tested many letters.\n\nExcluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,O,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z? But O and T are already placed, and we are placing S and I.\n\nSo any new letter must come from B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc.\n\nBut we know the word has exactly S and I as the other letters, so the third position must be filled with one of these available letters.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to test:\n- Position 1: S or I or a new letter.\n- Position 3: I or S or a new letter, but with constraints.\n\nWe want to confirm the positions of S and I and find the new letter.\n\nPerhaps we can form a word that fits possible patterns.\n\nPossible configurations:\nCase 1: Position 1 is S, then S must not be in position 3? But we can have it. Then position 3 could be I, position 4 must be a new letter? But I must be in position 1 or 3? Wait, no: I must be placed, and position 4 in this case would be free.\n\nList of possibilities for S and I:\n- S can be in pos 1 or 4\n- I can be in pos 1 or 3\n\nBut if S is in pos 1, then position 4 could be something else, and I must be in pos 3? Or pos 1 is S, so I could be in pos 3? Or pos 1 could be I, then S in pos 4? etc.\n\nAlso, since in guess 3, when we put S in pos 3, it was misplaced, meaning S is not position 3. Similarly, I in pos 4 was misplaced, so I is not position 4.\n\nSo possible assignments:\n- Position 1: either S, I, or a new letter.\n- Position 3: can be I (since I can be there) or a new letter, but not S (which is banned from pos 3).\n- Position 4: can be S (since S can be there) or a new letter, but not I (banned from pos 4).\n\nBut since S and I must be placed in the word, we have to assign them.\n\nSo combinations:\nA. Position 1: S\n   Then I must be in position 3 (since position 4 cannot have I, and position 1 is taken). Then position 4 must be a new letter, say X.\n   Word: S O I X T\n\nB. Position 1: I\n   Then S must be in position 4 (since position 3 cannot have S, and position 1 is taken). Then position 3 is a new letter, say Y.\n   Word: I O Y S T\n\nC. Position 1: new letter, say Z.\n   Then we have to place S and I.\n   Since S cannot be in 3 and I cannot be in 4:\n      Position 3: I (since I can be here, and S cannot)\n      Position 4: S (since S can be here, and I cannot)\n   Word: Z O I S T\n\nD. Position 1: new letter Z.\n   But alternative? If position 3 cannot have S, so must have I or new. But if we put I in position 3, then position 4 must be S? Yes, that\'s the only option because if position 4 is something else, then I must be placed elsewhere? Only position 3 is available for I in this case? In case C, we have Z O I S T.\n\nWhat if position 3 is new? But then I must go somewhere. Position 1 is taken by Z, position 3 is new (say W), then position 4 must be S or I? But if position 4 is S, then I has to be in position? Position 1,3,4 are filled: Z (new at pos1), W (new at pos3), S at pos4, then where is I? We know I is in the word. So I must be in one of these positions? Contradiction. Similarly, if position 4 is I, but I cannot be in position 4 from the feedback (I in position 4 was misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4). Therefore, if position 1 is new, then position 3 must be I (since only position 3 available for I), and position 4 must be S. So only C is possible: Z O I S T.\n\nSimilarly, if position 1 is S or I, we have cases A and B.\n\nTherefore, possible secret words:\nType A: S O I X T, where X is a new letter (any letter not excluded and not O,T,S,I? But S and I are used, and O,T are fixed).\nType B: I O Y S T, where Y is a new letter.\nType C: Z O I S T, where Z is a new letter.\n\nIn type C: Z O I S T, but note that positions: Z at 1, I at 3, S at 4? Then the word has Z, O, I, S, T. So letters: Z,O,I,S,T.\n\nSimilarly, type A: S,O,I,X,T? Letters: S,O,I,X,T? But S and I are common, X new.\n\nType B: I,O,Y,S,T? Letters: I,O,Y,S,T.\n\nFor the word to be valid, we need to find actual words.\n\nNot all letters X,Y,Z are possible; only certain letters make real words.\n\nWe must choose a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and find the new letter.\n\nWe have not tested many letters beyond the common ones. For example, we haven\'t tested B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc., but we excluded some.\n\nExcluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P.\n\nSo available new letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,V,W,X,Y,Z? But X,Y,Z are variables.\n\nFor the new letter, it can be any consonant or vowel not excluded.\n\nBut we need to form a word.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we can try to guess one of the possible patterns.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word that fits type A, B, or C, we can get feedback.\n\nBut we need to select a word that uses new letters to test.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we might guess a word that covers the possibilities.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words for each type:\n\nType A: S O I _ T? Possible words: SOFIT? - meaning? Not a common word. SOBIT? Not a word. KOTIS is not SO IST? What words have S,O,I,?,T with pattern S O I ? T.\n\nLooking at English words: POINT? But P excluded, and N excluded. JOIN? 4 letters. JOINT? Similarly excluded. FOIST? But F,O,I,S,T? Pattern is F O I S T, which is not S O I X T. We want S in position 1.\n\nValid words? ""SOFTI"" not word. ""SOUTH"" but U excluded. Not many options. ""SOLIT""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps no common word with this pattern? ""STOIT""? Not a word. ""STOIC"" but C excluded. ""SOXIT""? Not word.\n\nSo type A might be rare or impossible? Then perhaps we can skip it.\n\nType B: I O Y S T? Pattern I O ? S T. So position 3 is Y.\n\nWords: I O ? S T. E.g., ""IOTAS""? But A excluded. ""IOCUS""? Not word. ""IOBES""? E excluded. ""IOGHT""? H excluded. Not good.\n\n""IOKST""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words? ""JOUST"" but J,O,U,S,T -> U excluded. ""GHOST"" H excluded. Not finding.\n\nPerhaps ""COITS"" but C excluded. So no common words? Then type B might be unlikely.\n\nType C: ? O I S T. Pattern Z O I S T.\n\nWords: BOIST? Not common. COIST? C excluded. DOIST? Not word. FOIST? F O I S T. That\'s F in position 1? Then FOIST: F,O,I,S,T -> positions 1:F, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T? But in our case for type C, pattern is Z O I S T, so position 1:Z, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut FOIST has the pattern: F,O,I,S,T -> so it matches? But in the word FOIST, position 3 is I and position 4 is S.\n\nBut in our case, for type C: Z O I S T, so it has I in position 3, S in position 4.\n\nFOIST is an example: F O I S T.\n\nNow, is F excluded? No, F has not been tested. Only excluded letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,U,H,P. F is available.\n\nOther possibilities? GOIST? Not common. JOIST: J O I S T. J is available. LOIST? L O I S T. Etc.\n\nCommon words: FOIST, JOIST, HOIST? But H is excluded. HOIST has H, excluded. MOIST? M excluded. POIST not word. SOIST? Not common? But SOIST might be obscure.\n\nValid options: FOIST, JOIST, etc.\n\nBut JOIST is a word (a beam in construction). FOIST also.\n\nWe also have TOIST? But T is in position 5? Pattern is Z O I S T, position 1 is new. If we put T in position 1, but T is already in position 5? We cannot because letters can repeat? The rules don\'t prohibit duplicate letters, but we haven\'t seen any indication.\n\nIn this case, secret word could have duplicate? But from feedback, in previous guesses, no duplicates mentioned. But possible.\n\nIn FOIST, letters F,O,I,S,T all distinct.\n\nSimilarly, in JOIST, J,O,I,S,T - distinct.\n\nSo possible secret words include FOIST, JOIST, etc.\n\nBut there might be others, like if Z is L, LOIST? Not common, but possible.\n\nBut for the guess, we can try to guess one of these.\n\nSince we don\'t know which, we need to test.\n\nBut we have only three guesses left? We are on guess 4, so three more to go? The user said we have 6 tries, so after guess 3, we have three left.\n\nWe can guess FOIST, for example, but if it\'s not correct, we get information about F.\n\nFOIST would be a valid guess, but in our previous guess, we guessed POSIT which has P,O,S,I,T. Now FOIST has F,O,I,S,T. So similar, but F instead of P.\n\nBut P was excluded.\n\nSo for guess 4, we can guess FOIST.\n\nBut FOIST has O in position 2, S in position 4, I in position 3? FOIST: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).\n\nBut in the secret word, we have:\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 5: T (fixed)\n- Position 1: unknown\n- Position 3: unknown\n- Position 4: unknown\n\nAnd we know S is misplaced, I is misplaced.\n\nIn FOIST:\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 1: F\n\nNow, from the type C pattern, Z O I S T, so if F is in position 1, I in 3, S in 4, then FOIST matches that.\n\nBut there could be other patterns? Earlier we concluded only type C is likely? Because types A and B had no common words.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: in the secret word, S cannot be in position 3 (from POSIT feedback S in pos3 misplaced), and I cannot be in position 4.\n\nIn FOIST, we are putting I in position 3, S in position 4.\n\nIf the secret word is FOIST, then position 3:I should be correct? But we don\'t know that.\n\nSimilarly, position 4:S might be correct.\n\nBut by guessing FOIST, we effectively test if the word is FOIST.\n\nIf it is, we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on F, and positions of I and S might be clarified.\n\nS is in position 4 in FOIST. From the feedback, we don\'t know if S is correct there or misplaced.\n\nSimilarly for I in position 3.\n\nBut we already know that in POSIT, when we put I in position 4, it was misplaced, so I cannot be in position 4. But position 3 might be okay.\n\nSimilarly, S cannot be in position 3.\n\nSo FOIST is a candidate.\n\nAnother candidate is JOIST.\n\nBut to choose, we can pick the most common one.\n\nPerhaps try a word that doesn\'t assume the S and I positions, but tests them.\n\nFor example, put I in position 1 and S in position 4? Or something.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nCase: put position 1: I (testing if I is in position 1)\nPosition 2: O (fixed)\nPosition 3: a new letter, say L\nPosition 4: S (testing if S is in position 4)\nPosition 5: T (fixed)\n\nSo guess: I O L S T → ""IOLST""? But is that a word? ""LOST"" but with I and S? Not a valid word.\n\nOther possibilities: with F? ""FOLKS""? But K and S? But pattern? Position 4 is S? And K new? But F O ? K T? Not I O ? S T.\n\nTo fit the word, it must have S and I somewhere.\n\nBut if we put I in position 1 and S in position 4, then position 3 must be a new letter.\n\nPossible words: ?\n\nFor example, ""DIGST""? Not word. ""BIGST"" no.\n\nCommon words: ""WRIST"" but W,R,I,S,T -> R excluded? R is excluded from guess 1.\n\n""GRIST""? Also R excluded. ""TRYST"" R excluded and Y? etc.\n\nNo good five-letter words with I in position 1, O in 2, new in 3, S in 4, T in 5.\n\nSimilarly, other patterns are difficult.\n\nSo the most likely pattern is type C, like FOIST, JOIST.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess FOIST.\n\nIt uses F, which is new, and if correct, we win; if not, we get information.\n\nJOIST is another option, but F is more common than J? Varies.\n\nBut FOIST is fine.\n\nSo my guess: FOISTBased on the feedback from previous guesses, let me analyze the constraints and possible options for the next guess:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Pattern Determination**:  \n   - From Guess 2 (MOUTH → O(✓)), we know the second letter is **O**.  \n   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → O(✓), T(✓)), we know the second letter is **O** and the fifth letter is **T**.  \n   - The secret word must be of the form: `_ O _ _ T`.\n\n2. **Present Letters**:  \n   - From Guess 3 (POSIT → S(-), I(-)), **S** and **I** are in the word but misplaced.  \n   - S cannot be in position 3 (since S was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  \n   - I cannot be in position 4 (since I was there in POSIT and marked misplaced).  \n   - Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 4, and I must be in position 1 or 3.\n\n3. **Excluded Letters**:  \n   - Absent letters from all guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P.  \n   - The secret word contains none of these, so only untested letters or known presents (S, I) can be used.\n\n4. **Possible Secret Word Structures**:  \n   Given S and I must be placed with their constraints, and no duplicates are indicated, the secret word must match one of three patterns:  \n   - **Type A**: `S O I X T` (X is a new untested letter, e.g., F, G, L).  \n     - But common English words fitting this pattern (like SOFTI or SOFIT) are rare or invalid.  \n   - **Type B**: `I O Y S T` (Y is a new untested letter).  \n     - Common words (e.g., IOTAS) are invalid due to excluded letters (A), making this pattern unlikely.  \n   - **Type C**: `Z O I S T` (Z is a new untested letter, e.g., F, J, L).  \n     - This yield valid words like **FOIST** (F in position 1), **JOIST** (J in position 1), or **LOIST** (L in position 1). FOIST is a common word meaning ""to insert surreptitiously,"" making it plausible.  \n\n5. **Choosing the Next Guess**:  \n   - **FOIST** (F O I S T) tests the most likely Type C pattern:  \n     - Positions: F (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), T (5).  \n     - Verifies if:\n       - F is present/absent and its position.\n       - S and I positions: I in pos 3 (correct?) and S in pos 4 (correct?).\n     - If FOIST is correct, we solve the game. If not, feedback on F, S, and I positions will confirm or refute Type C and guide Guess 5.\n   - Alternative candidates like JOIST or LOIST are less common, so FOIST maximizes information and likelihood.\n\n6. **Why FOIST?**  \n   - It covers key constraints (O in pos 2, T in pos 5) and positions S and I per rules.  \n   - Tests F, a new high-frequency consonant (from available letters B, D, F, G, K, L).  \n   - Avoids excluded letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>FOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-) H(x)\nGuess 3: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(-) T(✓)\nGuess 4: FOIST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback for Guess 4: FOIST -> F(x) O(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
 This indicates:
   - F is absent (x)
   - O is in the correct position (second letter, as before)
   - I is in the correct position (third letter) because we put I in position 3 and it got ✓
   - S is in the correct position (fourth letter) because we put S at position 4 and it got ✓
   - T is in the correct position (fifth letter, as before)

 Therefore, the secret word must be: _ O I S T

 We know the second letter is O, third is I, fourth is S, fifth is T.
 We need to determine the first letter.

 From previous feedback, we have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P, F (from Guess 1, 2, 3, and 4).

 Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, U, H, P, F

 We also know that the word contains only letters that have not been excluded and must be a valid English word.

 The pattern is: ? O I S T

 We need to find a letter (let's call it L) for position 1 such that L is not excluded and the word L O I S T is valid.

 Possible letters: We have to choose from the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

 Remaining available letters (common ones): B, D, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

 But note: common words that fit ? O I S T:
   - JOIST: J is available? Let's see if it is excluded? No, J has not been guessed. But we have excluded F, so J is possible.
   - Other possibilities: MOIST? But M is excluded. HOIST? H excluded. BOIST? Not a common word. COIST? C excluded. 

 Looking at valid words:
   - ""JOIST"" is a word (a supporting beam). Letters: J, O, I, S, T. 
     - Check excluded: J is not excluded. So JOIST is a candidate.
   - ""HOIST"" is invalid because H is excluded (from GUESS 2: H(x)).
   - ""MOIST"" is invalid because M is excluded (from GUESS 2: M(x)).
   - ""FOIST"" we just guessed and it was wrong because F is absent.
   - Other words: ""TOIST""? Not a word. ""DOIST""? Not common.

 Therefore, the only common word fitting ? O I S T with available letters is ""JOIST"".

 But let me double-check if there are others:
   - ""BOIST"" — not a valid English word.
   - ""GOIST"" — not a word.
   - ""KOIST"" — not a word.
   - ""LOIST"" — obscure, but might be accepted? However, ""JOIST"" is more standard.

 Since we have limited guesses, and JOIST matches the pattern and uses a new letter (J) that is not excluded, it must be the secret word.

 Thus, for the fifth guess, we should guess ""JOIST"".
