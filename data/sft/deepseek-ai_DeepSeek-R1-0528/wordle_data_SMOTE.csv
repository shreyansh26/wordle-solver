We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

This tells us:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Since E is the last letter, we know the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

We need to make a second guess. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

We also know that the word has E in the fifth position.

We want to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (to confirm or get more information about the fifth position, but we already know E is there, so we can use this to test other letters)
- But note: the feedback for E is already correct, so in the next guess we can try to get information about the other positions.

However, we don't know if there are multiple E's? The feedback only tells us about the E in the fifth position. It doesn't say if there are other E's. But since we only have one E in ""crane"" and it was marked correct, we don't have information about other E's. So we should consider that there might be another E.

But note: the feedback for the other letters (C, R, A, N) are all absent, so they are not in the word.

We need to pick a word that:
- Has E at the end (so we can keep that fixed and focus on the first four letters)
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (avoiding C, R, A, N)

Common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many new common vowels and consonants as possible.

Common vowels left: I, O, U (we have used A and E, but E is fixed at the end, and A is absent so we don't use A again).

Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has E at the end and uses other common letters.

Some candidate words: 
- ""SLATE"" (but A is already absent, so we cannot use A) -> A is out, so skip.
- ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but we don't know if O, I, S are in the word? We can use this to test.

But note: we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Let's think of words ending with E and without A, C, R, N.

Possible words:
- ""BIKE"" -> 4 letters, too short.
- ""STOLE"" -> 5 letters: S, T, O, L, E -> without A, C, R, N.
- ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> without A, C, R, N.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> without A, C, R, N.

But we also want to cover common letters.

Another idea: since we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four. We can try a word that has E at the end and uses new letters.

Let me list some common letters: S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: it has S, T, O, L, and E at the end.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, O, or L. This guess will help us find out.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different set of vowels. Since we only have E at the end, we need to test other vowels (I, O, U).

Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> without A, C, R, N.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a vowel.

But let's consider: we have E fixed at the end. We are going to get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

Alternatively, we can try ""QUITE"" to test Q, U, I, T? But Q and U are less common. Maybe not.

Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> but we have S, L, I, M, E. Without A, C, R, N.

But we don't know if M is common? It's okay.

I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

But wait: what if the word has double letters? We don't know. But we can only try one.

I'll go with ""STOLE"".

So the second guess: ""STOLE""

But note: we are going to get feedback for each letter.

We are not sure if any of these letters are in the word, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at the end and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as T, S, L, I, O, etc.

Another candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> without A, C, R, N.

But I think ""STOLE"" is fine.

Let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.

So I'll guess ""STOLE"".

But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is at the end. We are using E again, which is okay because it's in the same position and we know it's correct. So in the feedback, we expect E to be correct again.

So the guess is ""STOLE"".

We'll get feedback for:
- S: position 1
- T: position 2
- O: position 3
- L: position 4
- E: position 5 (we know it will be correct)

But the feedback might show if any of S, T, O, L are in the word and in the correct position or not.

This will give us more information.

So, I choose ""STOLE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid C, R, A, and N, and introduce new common letters to maximize information.
- Common untested letters like S, T, O, L, I, or M are good candidates to test for presence/position.

A strong choice is ""STOLE"":
- It ends with ""E"", confirming the 5th position.
- It tests new common letters: S, T, O, and L.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will provide feedback on the presence/position of S (1st), T (2nd), O (3rd), and L (4th), while reconfirming E (5th).

The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.\n2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nSince E is the last letter, we know the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.\n\nWe also know that the word has E in the fifth position.\n\nWe want to choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (to confirm or get more information about the fifth position, but we already know E is there, so we can use this to test other letters)\n- But note: the feedback for E is already correct, so in the next guess we can try to get information about the other positions.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s? The feedback only tells us about the E in the fifth position. It doesn\'t say if there are other E\'s. But since we only have one E in ""crane"" and it was marked correct, we don\'t have information about other E\'s. So we should consider that there might be another E.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the other letters (C, R, A, N) are all absent, so they are not in the word.\n\nWe need to pick a word that:\n- Has E at the end (so we can keep that fixed and focus on the first four letters)\n- Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (avoiding C, R, A, N)\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to include as many new common vowels and consonants as possible.\n\nCommon vowels left: I, O, U (we have used A and E, but E is fixed at the end, and A is absent so we don\'t use A again).\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has E at the end and uses other common letters.\n\nSome candidate words: \n- ""SLATE"" (but A is already absent, so we cannot use A) -> A is out, so skip.\n- ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but we don\'t know if O, I, S are in the word? We can use this to test.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E and without A, C, R, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BIKE"" -> 4 letters, too short.\n- ""STOLE"" -> 5 letters: S, T, O, L, E -> without A, C, R, N.\n- ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> without A, C, R, N.\n- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> without A, C, R, N.\n\nBut we also want to cover common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four. We can try a word that has E at the end and uses new letters.\n\nLet me list some common letters: S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: it has S, T, O, L, and E at the end.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, O, or L. This guess will help us find out.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a different set of vowels. Since we only have E at the end, we need to test other vowels (I, O, U).\n\nAnother candidate: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> without A, C, R, N.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have E fixed at the end. We are going to get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""QUITE"" to test Q, U, I, T? But Q and U are less common. Maybe not.\n\nAnother common word: ""SLIME"" -> but we have S, L, I, M, E. Without A, C, R, N.\n\nBut we don\'t know if M is common? It\'s okay.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait: what if the word has double letters? We don\'t know. But we can only try one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\nSo the second guess: ""STOLE""\n\nBut note: we are going to get feedback for each letter.\n\nWe are not sure if any of these letters are in the word, but we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E at the end and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested, such as T, S, L, I, O, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> without A, C, R, N.\n\nBut I think ""STOLE"" is fine.\n\nLet me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""STOLE"".\n\nBut note: we are not using the fact that we know E is at the end. We are using E again, which is okay because it\'s in the same position and we know it\'s correct. So in the feedback, we expect E to be correct again.\n\nSo the guess is ""STOLE"".\n\nWe\'ll get feedback for:\n- S: position 1\n- T: position 2\n- O: position 3\n- L: position 4\n- E: position 5 (we know it will be correct)\n\nBut the feedback might show if any of S, T, O, L are in the word and in the correct position or not.\n\nThis will give us more information.\n\nSo, I choose ""STOLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed to be in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" to leverage the known correct position.\n- It should avoid C, R, A, and N, and introduce new common letters to maximize information.\n- Common untested letters like S, T, O, L, I, or M are good candidates to test for presence/position.\n\nA strong choice is ""STOLE"":\n- It ends with ""E"", confirming the 5th position.\n- It tests new common letters: S, T, O, and L.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on the presence/position of S (1st), T (2nd), O (3rd), and L (4th), while reconfirming E (5th).\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have two rounds of feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word ends with E)

Second guess: ""stole""
- S: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word starts with S)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is O)
- L: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so fifth letter is E)

From this, we know:
1. The secret word is of the form: S _ O _ E
2. Letters that are in the word: S, O, E, and T (since T is present but not in the second position)
3. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, L (from ""crane"" and ""stole"")
4. T is in the word but not in the second position. Since the positions we know are 1st: S, 3rd: O, and 5th: E, the T must be in either the 2nd or 4th position? But wait, the 2nd position is currently unknown, but our guess had T in 2nd position and it was marked wrong. So T cannot be in 2nd position. Therefore, T must be in the 4th position? Let me clarify:

- The word has exactly 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: O, position 5: E.
- Position 2 and 4 are unknown.
- We know T is in the word because it got a '-' which means it's present but in the wrong position.
- Since we placed T in position 2 and it was marked wrong, T cannot be in position 2. Therefore, T must be in position 4 (since position 1,3,5 are fixed and we know T isn't there, because if it were in position 1, it would be S which doesn't match T, similarly position 3 is O and position 5 is E). So the only possible position left is position 4.

Therefore, we can deduce that T is the fourth letter. So the secret word is: S _ O T E

Now, we need to find the second letter. The word has the letters: S, O, T, E and one unknown letter for the second position.

We also know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, L (so we avoid these).

We must choose a word that:
- Starts with S,
- Ends with E,
- Has O in the third position, T in the fourth position,
- And tests possible letters for the second position.

But note: we don't know what the second letter is, but we can guess by trying different words that fit S_O T E and use only letters that haven't been eliminated.

Available letters: except for S,O,T,E and excluding C,R,A,N,L, what remains?

All the common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find candidate words that fit the pattern S_O T E, i.e., S followed by one letter, then O, T, E.

Let me think of common words:
- SMOTE (a valid English word? It means to affect powerfully. Yes, it's often seen in literature.) -> S, M, O, T, E -> this fits S? O T E? Wait: S M O T E -> positions: S(1), M(2), O(3), T(4), E(5). Perfect.

But is it valid? Let me confirm if SMOTE is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

We might consider other possibilities? Like:
- SHO T E -> but ""SHOTE"" is a word? It's a variant of SHOTE meaning a young pig? Not very common. But SMOTE is better.
- SCOTE? But C is eliminated (from crane, C=x).
- SLOTE? But L is eliminated (from stole, L=x).
- SNOTE? N is eliminated.

So SMOTE seems a great candidate.

Moreover, note that we must also consider: are there any other constraints? We know T was misplaced in the second guess? But we deduced T should be in the fourth position and with SMOTE, we have T in fourth.

But we haven't tested the letter M. Is M in the word? We don't know, but if we guess SMOTE and it's incorrect, we'll get feedback.

But note: since we have limited tries (only 6 total, this will be our third), we want to maximize correctness.

Alternatively, we can think of other words? What about ""STO T E"" but we need the second letter? We don't have a word STOTE? Not common.

Another word: ""SPITE"" -> but that's S P I T E -> positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, in our pattern, the third letter must be O? Because O is fixed at position 3. So SPITE has I at position 3, not O. So invalid pattern.

It must have O at position 3.

So SMOTE: S M O T E is a perfect fit.

And M has not been tested before? Yes, we didn't use M in previous guesses.

So we can guess ""SMOTE"".

But what if the word has a repeated letter? We don't have any indication of that yet? And E and T and S and O are already used, but M is new.

If SMOTE is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on M.

But since we deduced T must be in position 4 and S,O,E in their positions, the only unknown is the second letter. So essentially, SMOTE might be correct?

We don't know for sure, but let's see.

Another possibility: what about ""SHOTE""? Yes, that is an alternative. SHOTE: S H O T E.

But that's also possible.

So we have two candidate words: SMOTE and SHOTE.

But SHOTE is not as common? And we want to use a common word first? But SMOTE might be more common?

We can guess one that covers more untested letters? But we only have one position variable.

Perhaps to be safe, we can try SMOTE.

Note: the word might be something else? Like ""STOVE""? But STOVE: S T O V E -> but we have T in second position? But in this case, compared to our pattern? We need letter at position 2 and then O at 3, T at 4, E at 5? With STOVE, we have S(1), T(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But this has V at position 4, not T? So it doesn't match because T is at position 2? But our deduction was that T must be at position 4? Because when we had T at position 2 in ""stole"", it was marked wrong (so not position 2), and the other positions 1,3,5 are occupied by S,O,E which are fixed? So T must be at position 4.

Therefore, words like STOVE would not fit because T would be at position 2, which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, ""SPORE""? But we have A and R eliminated? R is eliminated? From crane: R=x. And SPORE: S P O R E -> but R is eliminated? So invalid.

Back to S? O T E: the word must have S, ?, O, T, E, and the ? cannot be C,R,A,N,L.

Common words: 
- SMOTE: M as the second letter.
- SHOTE: H as the second letter.
- SHO T E? But ""shote"" is accepted in some dictionaries.
- Also ""SCORE""? But R is eliminated and also C is out? And score has O in third? But letter positions: S C O R E? But C and R are out.

Another: ""STOKE""? S T O K E -> but then we have T at position 2? Which we know is incorrect because T was marked wrong when it was in position 2. So STOKE would have T at position 2, which is forbidden? So invalid possibility.

Then we have words that have T only at position 4: so only S? O T E.

Others: 
- ""SORTS""? S O R T S? But O would be in position 2? Not position 3. We need O at position 3? So no.
- ""SMITE""? But that would be S M I T E -> O is not in position 3? Instead I is there? So invalid.

So the only possibilities are with letter in second position: and O in third, T in fourth, E in fifth.

So words: 
- SMOTE: valid English word.
- SHOTE: also valid, though less common? But in Wordle dictionaries, it should be included.
- Other possibilities? Like ""SOWTE""? Not a word. ""SWOTE""? Not a word? ""SKOTE""? Not common, and K might be possible? But I don't think it's a word.

So likely SMOTE or SHOTE.

Now, we have to choose one. Since SMOTE seems more common? Or we can test M vs H? We haven't tested either.

But we don't have to guess the correct word necessarily? We have 4 more tries? This is the third. So if we guess SMOTE and it's incorrect, we'll know what M is? Then we can try SHOTE or another.

But if we guess SMOTE and it is correct, we win? So let's guess SMOTE.

Alternatively, to be safe? We can choose a word that uses a letter that we haven't eliminated? But this guess might be the word.

So I will go with SMOTE.

Therefore, our third guess is ""SMOTE"".

But let me double-check the pattern: S M O T E -> 
- Position 1: S (known correct, and matches feedback from guess2: S(✓))
- Position 2: M (unknown)
- Position 3: O (known correct, from guess2: O(✓))
- Position 4: T (we believe it should be T, because T was marked as present but not in position 2, and position 4 is where it would be? If we put T at position 4 and the secret word has T at position 4, it would be marked ✓? Else if not, it might be marked '-' or 'x'? Then we learn? Actually, we must ensure that T is at position 4? Because of the deduction? Is the deduction solid? Yes: because T is in the word, it cannot be in position 1,2,3,5? Position 1 is S, position 3 is O, position 5 is E? So only position 4 remains? Therefore, T must be at position 4? So we expect T to be in position 4? Thus SMOTE fits? Similarly, SHOTE.

So we can guess SMOTE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Deduced Information:
1. **From Guess 1 (crane):**  
   - E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).  
   - C, R, A, and N are NOT in the word (x).  
   
2. **From Guess 2 (stole):**  
   - S is in the word and position 1 (✓).  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
   - O is in the word and position 3 (✓).  
   - L is NOT in the word (x).  
   - E is correct in position 5 (✓), reaffirming E as the last letter.  

### Current State of the Secret Word:
- The secret word must start with S and end with E (S _ _ _ E).  
- Position 3 is O (S _ O _ E).  
- T is in the word but not in position 2. Since positions 1 (S), 3 (O), and 5 (E) are fixed, T must be in position 4 (the only unknown position left for T). Thus, the secret word pattern is **S _ O T E**.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, L.  
- Untested letters for the second position: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The goal is to confirm the second letter of the pattern **S _ O T E**.  
- Possible words:  
  - **SMOTE**: Fits the pattern (S M O T E) and uses an untested letter (M).  
  - **SHOTE**: Also fits (S H O T E), but H is less common than M.  
- **SMOTE** is prioritized as it tests a common consonant (M) and aligns with Wordle strategies to resolve uncertainty efficiently.  
- If SMOTE is correct, the game ends; if not, the feedback will confirm whether M is present and/or in the correct position, narrowing possibilities further.  

### Guess:
<guess>smote</guess>",smote,"We have two rounds of feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word ends with E)

Second guess: ""stole""
- S: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word starts with S)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is O)
- L: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so fifth letter is E)

From this, we know:
1. The secret word is of the form: S _ O _ E
2. Letters that are in the word: S, O, E, and T (since T is present but not in the second position)
3. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, L (from ""crane"" and ""stole"")
4. T is in the word but not in the second position. Since the positions we know are 1st: S, 3rd: O, and 5th: E, the T must be in either the 2nd or 4th position? But wait, the 2nd position is currently unknown, but our guess had T in 2nd position and it was marked wrong. So T cannot be in 2nd position. Therefore, T must be in the 4th position? Let me clarify:

- The word has exactly 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: O, position 5: E.
- Position 2 and 4 are unknown.
- We know T is in the word because it got a '-' which means it's present but in the wrong position.
- Since we placed T in position 2 and it was marked wrong, T cannot be in position 2. Therefore, T must be in position 4 (since position 1,3,5 are fixed and we know T isn't there, because if it were in position 1, it would be S which doesn't match T, similarly position 3 is O and position 5 is E). So the only possible position left is position 4.

Therefore, we can deduce that T is the fourth letter. So the secret word is: S _ O T E

Now, we need to find the second letter. The word has the letters: S, O, T, E and one unknown letter for the second position.

We also know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, L (so we avoid these).

We must choose a word that:
- Starts with S,
- Ends with E,
- Has O in the third position, T in the fourth position,
- And tests possible letters for the second position.

But note: we don't know what the second letter is, but we can guess by trying different words that fit S_O T E and use only letters that haven't been eliminated.

Available letters: except for S,O,T,E and excluding C,R,A,N,L, what remains?

All the common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find candidate words that fit the pattern S_O T E, i.e., S followed by one letter, then O, T, E.

Let me think of common words:
- SMOTE (a valid English word? It means to affect powerfully. Yes, it's often seen in literature.) -> S, M, O, T, E -> this fits S? O T E? Wait: S M O T E -> positions: S(1), M(2), O(3), T(4), E(5). Perfect.

But is it valid? Let me confirm if SMOTE is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

We might consider other possibilities? Like:
- SHO T E -> but ""SHOTE"" is a word? It's a variant of SHOTE meaning a young pig? Not very common. But SMOTE is better.
- SCOTE? But C is eliminated (from crane, C=x).
- SLOTE? But L is eliminated (from stole, L=x).
- SNOTE? N is eliminated.

So SMOTE seems a great candidate.

Moreover, note that we must also consider: are there any other constraints? We know T was misplaced in the second guess? But we deduced T should be in the fourth position and with SMOTE, we have T in fourth.

But we haven't tested the letter M. Is M in the word? We don't know, but if we guess SMOTE and it's incorrect, we'll get feedback.

But note: since we have limited tries (only 6 total, this will be our third), we want to maximize correctness.

Alternatively, we can think of other words? What about ""STO T E"" but we need the second letter? We don't have a word STOTE? Not common.

Another word: ""SPITE"" -> but that's S P I T E -> positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, in our pattern, the third letter must be O? Because O is fixed at position 3. So SPITE has I at position 3, not O. So invalid pattern.

It must have O at position 3.

So SMOTE: S M O T E is a perfect fit.

And M has not been tested before? Yes, we didn't use M in previous guesses.

So we can guess ""SMOTE"".

But what if the word has a repeated letter? We don't have any indication of that yet? And E and T and S and O are already used, but M is new.

If SMOTE is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on M.

But since we deduced T must be in position 4 and S,O,E in their positions, the only unknown is the second letter. So essentially, SMOTE might be correct?

We don't know for sure, but let's see.

Another possibility: what about ""SHOTE""? Yes, that is an alternative. SHOTE: S H O T E.

But that's also possible.

So we have two candidate words: SMOTE and SHOTE.

But SHOTE is not as common? And we want to use a common word first? But SMOTE might be more common?

We can guess one that covers more untested letters? But we only have one position variable.

Perhaps to be safe, we can try SMOTE.

Note: the word might be something else? Like ""STOVE""? But STOVE: S T O V E -> but we have T in second position? But in this case, compared to our pattern? We need letter at position 2 and then O at 3, T at 4, E at 5? With STOVE, we have S(1), T(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But this has V at position 4, not T? So it doesn't match because T is at position 2? But our deduction was that T must be at position 4? Because when we had T at position 2 in ""stole"", it was marked wrong (so not position 2), and the other positions 1,3,5 are occupied by S,O,E which are fixed? So T must be at position 4.

Therefore, words like STOVE would not fit because T would be at position 2, which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, ""SPORE""? But we have A and R eliminated? R is eliminated? From crane: R=x. And SPORE: S P O R E -> but R is eliminated? So invalid.

Back to S? O T E: the word must have S, ?, O, T, E, and the ? cannot be C,R,A,N,L.

Common words: 
- SMOTE: M as the second letter.
- SHOTE: H as the second letter.
- SHO T E? But ""shote"" is accepted in some dictionaries.
- Also ""SCORE""? But R is eliminated and also C is out? And score has O in third? But letter positions: S C O R E? But C and R are out.

Another: ""STOKE""? S T O K E -> but then we have T at position 2? Which we know is incorrect because T was marked wrong when it was in position 2. So STOKE would have T at position 2, which is forbidden? So invalid possibility.

Then we have words that have T only at position 4: so only S? O T E.

Others: 
- ""SORTS""? S O R T S? But O would be in position 2? Not position 3. We need O at position 3? So no.
- ""SMITE""? But that would be S M I T E -> O is not in position 3? Instead I is there? So invalid.

So the only possibilities are with letter in second position: and O in third, T in fourth, E in fifth.

So words: 
- SMOTE: valid English word.
- SHOTE: also valid, though less common? But in Wordle dictionaries, it should be included.
- Other possibilities? Like ""SOWTE""? Not a word. ""SWOTE""? Not a word? ""SKOTE""? Not common, and K might be possible? But I don't think it's a word.

So likely SMOTE or SHOTE.

Now, we have to choose one. Since SMOTE seems more common? Or we can test M vs H? We haven't tested either.

But we don't have to guess the correct word necessarily? We have 4 more tries? This is the third. So if we guess SMOTE and it's incorrect, we'll know what M is? Then we can try SHOTE or another.

But if we guess SMOTE and it is correct, we win? So let's guess SMOTE.

Alternatively, to be safe? We can choose a word that uses a letter that we haven't eliminated? But this guess might be the word.

So I will go with SMOTE.

Therefore, our third guess is ""SMOTE"".

But let me double-check the pattern: S M O T E -> 
- Position 1: S (known correct, and matches feedback from guess2: S(✓))
- Position 2: M (unknown)
- Position 3: O (known correct, from guess2: O(✓))
- Position 4: T (we believe it should be T, because T was marked as present but not in position 2, and position 4 is where it would be? If we put T at position 4 and the secret word has T at position 4, it would be marked ✓? Else if not, it might be marked '-' or 'x'? Then we learn? Actually, we must ensure that T is at position 4? Because of the deduction? Is the deduction solid? Yes: because T is in the word, it cannot be in position 1,2,3,5? Position 1 is S, position 3 is O, position 5 is E? So only position 4 remains? Therefore, T must be at position 4? So we expect T to be in position 4? Thus SMOTE fits? Similarly, SHOTE.

So we can guess SMOTE.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Deduced Information:
1. **From Guess 1 (crane):**  
   - E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).  
   - C, R, A, and N are NOT in the word (x).  
   
2. **From Guess 2 (stole):**  
   - S is in the word and position 1 (✓).  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
   - O is in the word and position 3 (✓).  
   - L is NOT in the word (x).  
   - E is correct in position 5 (✓), reaffirming E as the last letter.  

### Current State of the Secret Word:
- The secret word must start with S and end with E (S _ _ _ E).  
- Position 3 is O (S _ O _ E).  
- T is in the word but not in position 2. Since positions 1 (S), 3 (O), and 5 (E) are fixed, T must be in position 4 (the only unknown position left for T). Thus, the secret word pattern is **S _ O T E**.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, L.  
- Untested letters for the second position: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The goal is to confirm the second letter of the pattern **S _ O T E**.  
- Possible words:  
  - **SMOTE**: Fits the pattern (S M O T E) and uses an untested letter (M).  
  - **SHOTE**: Also fits (S H O T E), but H is less common than M.  
- **SMOTE** is prioritized as it tests a common consonant (M) and aligns with Wordle strategies to resolve uncertainty efficiently.  
- If SMOTE is correct, the game ends; if not, the feedback will confirm whether M is present and/or in the correct position, narrowing possibilities further.  

### Guess:",Guess 3: smote -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) O(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
