We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - 'A' is in the word but in the wrong position (so the word contains 'A', but not in the 3rd position)
   - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word contains 'A' (but not in the 3rd position), we can use that.

 Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, N, E.

 We have 5 remaining tries.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
   - Contains the letter 'A' (but not in the 3rd position)
   - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
   - Includes other common letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, N, E. Some common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 We can try to place 'A' in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Let's consider words that have 'A' and use other common letters.

 Example: 
   - Starting with 'S'? Words like ""SAINT"" but we cannot use N (feedback said N is not in the word). 
   - Instead, how about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid R (which is excluded) and in ""SALAD"" we have L and D.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that A is present and in the wrong position. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple A's. However, we can try a word with only one A for now.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   - A in the first position: ABLE? But E is excluded. 
   - A in the second position: ""PASTA""? But we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven't tested S yet. Also, P, A, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The word ""PASTA"" has two A's? Actually, it has one A at position 2 and one at position 5? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid E (which is in ""PASTA"" at the end? No, ""PASTA"" ends with A, not E). Wait, ""PASTA"" is P-A-S-T-A. So no E. But we have to avoid R? There's no R. And no C, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 But we also want to test more new letters. We have already excluded C, R, N, E. So we can use other letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible and includes A in a position that is not 3.

 Another idea: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but we already know E is excluded and we have to avoid E. So not that.

 Let's list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

   - A in position 1: ALBUM, ALUMS, ALOUD, ALONG (but we cannot use N and G is new) -> ALONG has N? Yes, so avoid. 
   - A in position 2: ""PAINT"" -> has N and T? But N is excluded. So no.
   - A in position 4: We can try words like ""PLAIT"" but has T? and I? But we don't know about T and I. However, we must avoid N? ""PLAIT"" doesn't have N, but it has T and I. But also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E. But note: ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T.

 However, we are not sure about the other letters. We want to test more common letters.

 Another common word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in the first position and we don't know about U, D, I, O. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N, E? It doesn't have any of those. However, we know that A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. In ""AUDIO"", A is in the 1st position, which is fine. But we are not using the information about A being present? Actually, we are: we are putting A in a different position (1st) to test.

 However, we already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test that again? Actually, we do need to find its correct position. But we can also test other letters.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses, so we can try to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a different position and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Some options:

   - A in 1st: ""ADOPT"" -> A, D, O, P, T. All new letters. This is good because we test 4 new letters and A.
   - A in 2nd: ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> N is excluded, so invalid.
   - A in 4th: ""FLAIR"" -> but R is excluded. So no.
   - A in 5th: ""DELTA"" -> but E is excluded and D, E, L, T, A -> E is excluded, so no.

 So let's go with ""ADOPT"". It has A in the first position (which is not the 3rd, so that's allowed) and we test D, O, P, T.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. It doesn't say that A cannot be in the first position. So it's okay.

 However, if the secret word has A in the first position, then in our first guess (crane) the A was in the 3rd position and that was wrong, but if the word has A in the first, then we would get a '-' for A in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, A was in the 3rd position and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not there. If the word has A in the first, then in the first guess we didn't have A in the first, so we wouldn't have known. So now we are testing A in the first.

 So let's guess ""ADOPT"".

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the first. We could put it in the second, fourth, or fifth. But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" (A in second and fifth) -> P, A, S, T, A. This tests P, S, T and two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, if the word has only one A, then one of the A's in ""PASTA"" might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, but we have two and the word has only one, then one will be marked as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? But we don't know. It might complicate.

 So to avoid confusion, we can choose a word with only one A. ""ADOPT"" has one A.

 Therefore, I choose ""ADOPT"".

<guess>adopt</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" (placed in a position other than 3rd to test new locations).
- Must avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", ""O"", ""D"", ""P"") to maximize information.

Selected ""adopt"" because:
- Places ""A"" in the 1st position (testing a new location).

- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

   - A in 4th: ""FLAIR"" -> but R is excluded. So no.
   - A in 5th: ""DELTA"" -> but E is excluded and D, E, L, T, A -> E is excluded, so no.

 So let's go with ""ADOPT"". It has A in the first position (which is not the 3rd, so that's allowed) and we test D, O, P, T.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. It doesn't say that A cannot be in the first position. So it's okay.

 However, if the secret word has A in the first position, then in our first guess (crane) the A was in the 3rd position and that was wrong, but if the word has A in the first, then we would get a '-' for A in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, A was in the 3rd position and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not there. If the word has A in the first, then in the first guess we didn't have A in the first, so we wouldn't have known. So now we are testing A in the first.

 So let's guess ""ADOPT"".

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the first. We could put it in the second, fourth, or fifth. But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" (A in second and fifth) -> P, A, S, T, A. This tests P, S, T and two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, if the word has only one A, then one of the A's in ""PASTA"" might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, but we have two and the word has only one, then one will be marked as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? But we don't know. It might complicate.

 So to avoid confusion, we can choose a word with only one A. ""ADOPT"" has one A.

 Therefore, I choose ""ADOPT"".

<guess>adopt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" (placed in a position other than 3rd to test new locations).
- Must avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", ""O"", ""D"", ""P"") to maximize information.

Selected ""adopt"" because:
- Places ""A"" in the 1st position (testing a new location).
- Introduces four new common letters: ""D"", ""O"", ""P"", ""T"".
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.
- Valid 5-letter English word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)
Meaning:
  - A is still in the word, but not in the 1st position (since we guessed A in 1st and got '-', meaning wrong position).
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position (because we got T(-) in the 5th position).
  - D, O, P are not in the word.

Summary of known information:
1. The word contains 'A' and 'T'.
   - 'A' is not in position 1 or 3.
   - 'T' is not in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Includes 'A' and 'T'
  - Excludes: C, R, N, E, D, O, P
  - Positions for A: since not 1 or 3, possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - Positions for T: not 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Additionally, we have tested many consonants and vowels. The remaining letters are:
Vowels not tested: I, U (A is known, E and O excluded)
Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D, P, and we know they are excluded. 
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, S, T (T is included), V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T is in the word and A is in the word, we know two letters. The word has 3 other letters which must be from the remaining pool.

We should focus on common letters: S, L, I, M, H, G, K, etc.

Also, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we known it was misplaced. So in the actual word, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

In the second guess, A was in position 1 and misplaced? Actually, we got A(-) meaning it exists but not in 1, so now we know A is definitely not in 1 or 3. So positions 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T was in position 5 in the second guess and we got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes A and T, avoids the excluded letters, and tests possible positions.

Let me think of words that have A and T and use common letters from the remaining set.

Since A must be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,2,3,4.

Possible combinations:

- If T is in position 1: then A in 2,4,5. Words like ""T_ A _ _"" or ""T _ _ A _"" or ""T _ _ _ A""
- If T in 2: then A in 4 or 5 (since A cannot be in 2 and T simultaneously? Actually, unless the word has two same letters? But we don't know). But note: A and T could share the same position? No, they cannot. So for a given word, T cannot be in the same spot as A.

But we don't know if there are multiple T's or multiple A's. So far, we only know each is present at least once.

We should try a word that has both A and T in new positions, and introduces new letters.

For example, T in position 1 and A in position 4? Then the word pattern: T _ _ A ?

But the middle two letters must be from the remaining letters.

Example: T? Let's try to include S, L, I, etc.

Word: ""TAXIS""? But it has X and S? Also, we have A in position 2? That's if we do T, A, ...? Wait, ""TAXIS"" is T, A, X, I, S -> A is in position 2.

But note: we should avoid O? Yes, and O is excluded so safe? And no D, P, etc.

But ""TAXIS"" has A in position 2: that's a possible position for A.

But let's check if it fits the constraints:

Position for A: 2 -> allowed (since not 1,3).
Position for T: 1 -> allowed.

Now, the word includes X and I and S.

But we don't know about X, I, S. So we can test.

However, are there more common words?

Another example: ""TABLE"" -> but E is excluded? No, E is excluded so we cannot use E.

""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S -> A in 2nd? Yes. This word: T in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), and letters I, L, S which are new.

Let me check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,N,E,D,O,P? So valid.

But note: we also know that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was misplaced. Now if the word is ""TAILS"", that has A in position 2. Then in the first guess (crane) the A was in position 3: that is not the position for A (which is 2) so it should be marked as '-', which we got. Also, in the second guess (adopt) we put A in position 1 and got '-', which for ""TAILS"" that is correct because A is in position 2.

Also, T in ""TAILS"" is position 1? Then in second guess we put T in position 5? And we got T(-) which is consistent because T is in the word but not at 5.

However, we have to consider the feedback for the second guess: the T was in position 5 and marked '-', meaning the word has T but not at 5. In ""TAILS"", T is at 1, so that's fine.

But note: we also have an I and L and S. We don't know about them.

But we must include both A and T. So ""TAILS"" includes A and T.

Another possibility: ""SAINT""? But N is excluded? No, N was in the first guess and marked absent? So we cannot use N.

Also, in ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T -> but N is excluded? Yes, so invalid.

Another: ""MATCH""? But C is excluded? Yes, cannot use.

""PATHY""? Not 5 letters? 

""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y. This word: A at position 2? And T at position 4? Also, H and S and Y.

But we don't know about H, S, Y.

Compare ""HASTY"" and ""TAILS"": both are valid.

We could also consider words with A in position 4 or 5.

But since we have few information, we might want to place A in a different positions to gather more info.

However, placing A in position 4 or 5 would be a new test.

But let's look for common words.

Alternative: ""LAST"" is only 4 letters? Need 5.

""PLAST""? not word.

""BEAST""? but E is excluded? Yes.

""TOAST"" has O? O is excluded? In second guess O(x), so O is not in word? And also has S and T? Word: T, O, A, S, T -> O is excluded? So we cannot use O? Therefore, ""TOAST"" is invalid.

Back to the idea: words with T at start and A at 2nd: TA* * ?

Words: TABBY? but has B? and Y? 'TABBY': T, A, B, B, Y -> but we don't know about B and Y? Also, two B's? And A at 2.

""TALKS"": T, A, L, K, S -> avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, K, S are okay? Then A in 2nd? This is similar to ""TAILS"", but with K instead of I.

""TAILS"" vs. ""TALKS"": both are valid.

We can also consider having T in other positions.

Another possibility: T at position 4.

Words with A in position 2 and T in 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _.

For instance, ""WAIST""? W, A, I, S, T -> A in 2nd, T in 5th? Actually, WAIST: positions - W1, A2, I3, S4, T5.

But we got feedback that T is not in position 5? Because in second guess we put T in 5 and got T(-). So T cannot be in position 5? Therefore, we cannot have a word with T in 5.

So for A in 2nd and T must be in 1,3,4.

If T is in 4th, then the word would be like: _ A _ T ?

Then the last letter must be filled.

Example: ""HASTY"" as above? H1, A2, S3, T4, Y5 -> but T is in 4th? This avoids T in 5? Then it's okay? And Y in 5th? We haven't tested Y? So acceptable.

But note: we must avoid putting A in 1 or 3? So A in 2nd is okay.

Similarly, we can consider T in position 3? Then pattern: _ _ T A? (if A in 4th) or _ _ T _ A (if A in 5th). 

But let's find words.

Possible words:

1. TAILS: T at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.
   - Tests T at 1 and A at 2? Both positions are new for these letters.

2. HASTY: H at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
   - Tests A at 2 and T at 4? And avoids T at 5? Also tests S at 3 and H and Y.

3. We could also try a word that puts A at a different position? Such as 4th or 5th? For example: 

   - A at 4th: word pattern: ? ? ? A ? 
     And T must be in 1,2,3? Avoid 5.

     Example: ""QUOTA""? but contains U and O? O is excluded? So no.

     ""FATAL"": F, A, T, A, L? But has two A's? And positions: A at 2 and at 5? But we are putting A at 4? No, if we put the fourth letter as A? ""FATAL"": positions: F1, A2, T3, A4, L5 -> so A at 2 and 4? But we already know A is present? So it might have two A's? And T at 3.

     But we need to avoid excluded letters? It has F, T, L? We haven't tested F? So okay? Also, letters: F, A, T, L? And contains L? 

     However, not that common? And we have A at 2? Which we haven't tested? So not efficient.

So to maximize information, I think words like ""TAILS"" or ""HASTY"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider the vowels? We haven't tested I, U? In ""TAILS"" we test I? Which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" has A (known) and Y? So not vowel heavy.

Another candidate: ""SAULT""? S, A, U, L, T -> A at 2nd? And T at 5th? BUT T at 5th is forbidden? Because feedback says T is not in 5th? So we cannot have T at 5th? Therefore, ""SAULT"" is invalid? Because the word must have T? But if we put T at 5th, that is the wrong position? We learned that T is not in 5th? So the word must have T somewhere else? So we cannot guess a word that puts T in 5th now? Because we know it will be misplaced? So it wastes guess? Avoid any word that puts T in 5th? Similarly, we avoid A in 1 or 3.

Therefore, ""SAULT"" not allowed? Because puts T in 5th and we know that position is wrong? We learn nothing new? And wastes a chance? So we should avoid that.

Therefore, I think ""TAILS"" is a good guess because:

- Puts A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Puts T in position 1 (another new position to test).
- Uses three new common letters: I, L, S.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" doesn't put T in 5? So it's okay? But has Y? Which is less common.

Another candidate: ""TAMIS""? T, A, M, I, S? And A in 2nd? But not sure if valid word? I think ""tamis"" is a valid word? But frequency? Maybe not as common.

To be safe, I think ""TAILS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But wait: what about duplicate letters? Not an issue here because each letter in the word is different? And we haven't seen any duplicates? So the word might be all distinct? We don't know? But ""TAILS"" has distinct letters? Which is good? Because if there is a duplicate, we don't know? We'll see? So testing distinct letters will help.

So ""TAILS"" it is.

<guess>tails</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": A is present but not in the 3rd position. C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""adopt"": A is present but not in the 1st position. T is present but not in the 5th position. D, O, P are absent.

Key deductions:
- **A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5** (not 1 or 3).
- **T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4** (not 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.
- **Remaining letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and T while adhering to their positional constraints.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters to gather more information.
- Strong candidates: ""TAILS"" (tests A at position 2, T at position 1, and introduces I, L, S).

Reasoning for ""TAILS"":
- **A**: Position 2 is valid (not 1 or 3).
- **T**: Position 1 is valid (not 5).
- New letters: I, L, S are untested and common.
- Avoids excluded letters: No C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

This guess maximizes information gain on letter positions and coverage of new letters.

<guess>tails</guess>",tails,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)
Meaning:
  - A is still in the word, but not in the 1st position (since we guessed A in 1st and got '-', meaning wrong position).
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position (because we got T(-) in the 5th position).
  - D, O, P are not in the word.

Summary of known information:
1. The word contains 'A' and 'T'.
   - 'A' is not in position 1 or 3.
   - 'T' is not in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Includes 'A' and 'T'
  - Excludes: C, R, N, E, D, O, P
  - Positions for A: since not 1 or 3, possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - Positions for T: not 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Additionally, we have tested many consonants and vowels. The remaining letters are:
Vowels not tested: I, U (A is known, E and O excluded)
Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D, P, and we know they are excluded. 
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, S, T (T is included), V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T is in the word and A is in the word, we know two letters. The word has 3 other letters which must be from the remaining pool.

We should focus on common letters: S, L, I, M, H, G, K, etc.

Also, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we known it was misplaced. So in the actual word, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

In the second guess, A was in position 1 and misplaced? Actually, we got A(-) meaning it exists but not in 1, so now we know A is definitely not in 1 or 3. So positions 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T was in position 5 in the second guess and we got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes A and T, avoids the excluded letters, and tests possible positions.

Let me think of words that have A and T and use common letters from the remaining set.

Since A must be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,2,3,4.

Possible combinations:

- If T is in position 1: then A in 2,4,5. Words like ""T_ A _ _"" or ""T _ _ A _"" or ""T _ _ _ A""
- If T in 2: then A in 4 or 5 (since A cannot be in 2 and T simultaneously? Actually, unless the word has two same letters? But we don't know). But note: A and T could share the same position? No, they cannot. So for a given word, T cannot be in the same spot as A.

But we don't know if there are multiple T's or multiple A's. So far, we only know each is present at least once.

We should try a word that has both A and T in new positions, and introduces new letters.

For example, T in position 1 and A in position 4? Then the word pattern: T _ _ A ?

But the middle two letters must be from the remaining letters.

Example: T? Let's try to include S, L, I, etc.

Word: ""TAXIS""? But it has X and S? Also, we have A in position 2? That's if we do T, A, ...? Wait, ""TAXIS"" is T, A, X, I, S -> A is in position 2.

But note: we should avoid O? Yes, and O is excluded so safe? And no D, P, etc.

But ""TAXIS"" has A in position 2: that's a possible position for A.

But let's check if it fits the constraints:

Position for A: 2 -> allowed (since not 1,3).
Position for T: 1 -> allowed.

Now, the word includes X and I and S.

But we don't know about X, I, S. So we can test.

However, are there more common words?

Another example: ""TABLE"" -> but E is excluded? No, E is excluded so we cannot use E.

""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S -> A in 2nd? Yes. This word: T in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), and letters I, L, S which are new.

Let me check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,N,E,D,O,P? So valid.

But note: we also know that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was misplaced. Now if the word is ""TAILS"", that has A in position 2. Then in the first guess (crane) the A was in position 3: that is not the position for A (which is 2) so it should be marked as '-', which we got. Also, in the second guess (adopt) we put A in position 1 and got '-', which for ""TAILS"" that is correct because A is in position 2.

Also, T in ""TAILS"" is position 1? Then in second guess we put T in position 5? And we got T(-) which is consistent because T is in the word but not at 5.

However, we have to consider the feedback for the second guess: the T was in position 5 and marked '-', meaning the word has T but not at 5. In ""TAILS"", T is at 1, so that's fine.

But note: we also have an I and L and S. We don't know about them.

But we must include both A and T. So ""TAILS"" includes A and T.

Another possibility: ""SAINT""? But N is excluded? No, N was in the first guess and marked absent? So we cannot use N.

Also, in ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T -> but N is excluded? Yes, so invalid.

Another: ""MATCH""? But C is excluded? Yes, cannot use.

""PATHY""? Not 5 letters? 

""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y. This word: A at position 2? And T at position 4? Also, H and S and Y.

But we don't know about H, S, Y.

Compare ""HASTY"" and ""TAILS"": both are valid.

We could also consider words with A in position 4 or 5.

But since we have few information, we might want to place A in a different positions to gather more info.

However, placing A in position 4 or 5 would be a new test.

But let's look for common words.

Alternative: ""LAST"" is only 4 letters? Need 5.

""PLAST""? not word.

""BEAST""? but E is excluded? Yes.

""TOAST"" has O? O is excluded? In second guess O(x), so O is not in word? And also has S and T? Word: T, O, A, S, T -> O is excluded? So we cannot use O? Therefore, ""TOAST"" is invalid.

Back to the idea: words with T at start and A at 2nd: TA* * ?

Words: TABBY? but has B? and Y? 'TABBY': T, A, B, B, Y -> but we don't know about B and Y? Also, two B's? And A at 2.

""TALKS"": T, A, L, K, S -> avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, K, S are okay? Then A in 2nd? This is similar to ""TAILS"", but with K instead of I.

""TAILS"" vs. ""TALKS"": both are valid.

We can also consider having T in other positions.

Another possibility: T at position 4.

Words with A in position 2 and T in 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _.

For instance, ""WAIST""? W, A, I, S, T -> A in 2nd, T in 5th? Actually, WAIST: positions - W1, A2, I3, S4, T5.

But we got feedback that T is not in position 5? Because in second guess we put T in 5 and got T(-). So T cannot be in position 5? Therefore, we cannot have a word with T in 5.

So for A in 2nd and T must be in 1,3,4.

If T is in 4th, then the word would be like: _ A _ T ?

Then the last letter must be filled.

Example: ""HASTY"" as above? H1, A2, S3, T4, Y5 -> but T is in 4th? This avoids T in 5? Then it's okay? And Y in 5th? We haven't tested Y? So acceptable.

But note: we must avoid putting A in 1 or 3? So A in 2nd is okay.

Similarly, we can consider T in position 3? Then pattern: _ _ T A? (if A in 4th) or _ _ T _ A (if A in 5th). 

But let's find words.

Possible words:

1. TAILS: T at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.
   - Tests T at 1 and A at 2? Both positions are new for these letters.

2. HASTY: H at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
   - Tests A at 2 and T at 4? And avoids T at 5? Also tests S at 3 and H and Y.

3. We could also try a word that puts A at a different position? Such as 4th or 5th? For example: 

   - A at 4th: word pattern: ? ? ? A ? 
     And T must be in 1,2,3? Avoid 5.

     Example: ""QUOTA""? but contains U and O? O is excluded? So no.

     ""FATAL"": F, A, T, A, L? But has two A's? And positions: A at 2 and at 5? But we are putting A at 4? No, if we put the fourth letter as A? ""FATAL"": positions: F1, A2, T3, A4, L5 -> so A at 2 and 4? But we already know A is present? So it might have two A's? And T at 3.

     But we need to avoid excluded letters? It has F, T, L? We haven't tested F? So okay? Also, letters: F, A, T, L? And contains L? 

     However, not that common? And we have A at 2? Which we haven't tested? So not efficient.

So to maximize information, I think words like ""TAILS"" or ""HASTY"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider the vowels? We haven't tested I, U? In ""TAILS"" we test I? Which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" has A (known) and Y? So not vowel heavy.

Another candidate: ""SAULT""? S, A, U, L, T -> A at 2nd? And T at 5th? BUT T at 5th is forbidden? Because feedback says T is not in 5th? So we cannot have T at 5th? Therefore, ""SAULT"" is invalid? Because the word must have T? But if we put T at 5th, that is the wrong position? We learned that T is not in 5th? So the word must have T somewhere else? So we cannot guess a word that puts T in 5th now? Because we know it will be misplaced? So it wastes guess? Avoid any word that puts T in 5th? Similarly, we avoid A in 1 or 3.

Therefore, ""SAULT"" not allowed? Because puts T in 5th and we know that position is wrong? We learn nothing new? And wastes a chance? So we should avoid that.

Therefore, I think ""TAILS"" is a good guess because:

- Puts A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Puts T in position 1 (another new position to test).
- Uses three new common letters: I, L, S.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" doesn't put T in 5? So it's okay? But has Y? Which is less common.

Another candidate: ""TAMIS""? T, A, M, I, S? And A in 2nd? But not sure if valid word? I think ""tamis"" is a valid word? But frequency? Maybe not as common.

To be safe, I think ""TAILS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But wait: what about duplicate letters? Not an issue here because each letter in the word is different? And we haven't seen any duplicates? So the word might be all distinct? We don't know? But ""TAILS"" has distinct letters? Which is good? Because if there is a duplicate, we don't know? We'll see? So testing distinct letters will help.

So ""TAILS"" it is.

<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": A is present but not in the 3rd position. C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""adopt"": A is present but not in the 1st position. T is present but not in the 5th position. D, O, P are absent.

Key deductions:
- **A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5** (not 1 or 3).
- **T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4** (not 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.
- **Remaining letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and T while adhering to their positional constraints.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters to gather more information.
- Strong candidates: ""TAILS"" (tests A at position 2, T at position 1, and introduces I, L, S).

Reasoning for ""TAILS"":
- **A**: Position 2 is valid (not 1 or 3).
- **T**: Position 1 is valid (not 5).
- New letters: I, L, S are untested and common.
- Avoids excluded letters: No C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

This guess maximizes information gain on letter positions and coverage of new letters.",Guess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - 'A' is in the word but in the wrong position (so the word contains 'A', but not in the 3rd position)
   - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word contains 'A' (but not in the 3rd position), we can use that.

 Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, N, E.

 We have 5 remaining tries.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
   - Contains the letter 'A' (but not in the 3rd position)
   - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
   - Includes other common letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, N, E. Some common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 We can try to place 'A' in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Let's consider words that have 'A' and use other common letters.

 Example: 
   - Starting with 'S'? Words like ""SAINT"" but we cannot use N (feedback said N is not in the word). 
   - Instead, how about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid R (which is excluded) and in ""SALAD"" we have L and D.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that A is present and in the wrong position. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple A's. However, we can try a word with only one A for now.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   - A in the first position: ABLE? But E is excluded. 
   - A in the second position: ""PASTA""? But we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven't tested S yet. Also, P, A, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The word ""PASTA"" has two A's? Actually, it has one A at position 2 and one at position 5? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid E (which is in ""PASTA"" at the end? No, ""PASTA"" ends with A, not E). Wait, ""PASTA"" is P-A-S-T-A. So no E. But we have to avoid R? There's no R. And no C, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 But we also want to test more new letters. We have already excluded C, R, N, E. So we can use other letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible and includes A in a position that is not 3.

 Another idea: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but we already know E is excluded and we have to avoid E. So not that.

 Let's list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

   - A in position 1: ALBUM, ALUMS, ALOUD, ALONG (but we cannot use N and G is new) -> ALONG has N? Yes, so avoid. 
   - A in position 2: ""PAINT"" -> has N and T? But N is excluded. So no.
   - A in position 4: We can try words like ""PLAIT"" but has T? and I? But we don't know about T and I. However, we must avoid N? ""PLAIT"" doesn't have N, but it has T and I. But also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E. But note: ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T.

 However, we are not sure about the other letters. We want to test more common letters.

 Another common word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in the first position and we don't know about U, D, I, O. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N, E? It doesn't have any of those. However, we know that A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. In ""AUDIO"", A is in the 1st position, which is fine. But we are not using the information about A being present? Actually, we are: we are putting A in a different position (1st) to test.

 However, we already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test that again? Actually, we do need to find its correct position. But we can also test other letters.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses, so we can try to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a different position and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Some options:

   - A in 1st: ""ADOPT"" -> A, D, O, P, T. All new letters. This is good because we test 4 new letters and A.
   - A in 2nd: ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> N is excluded, so invalid.
   - A in 4th: ""FLAIR"" -> but R is excluded. So no.
   - A in 5th: ""DELTA"" -> but E is excluded and D, E, L, T, A -> E is excluded, so no.

 So let's go with ""ADOPT"". It has A in the first position (which is not the 3rd, so that's allowed) and we test D, O, P, T.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. It doesn't say that A cannot be in the first position. So it's okay.

 However, if the secret word has A in the first position, then in our first guess (crane) the A was in the 3rd position and that was wrong, but if the word has A in the first, then we would get a '-' for A in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, A was in the 3rd position and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not there. If the word has A in the first, then in the first guess we didn't have A in the first, so we wouldn't have known. So now we are testing A in the first.

 So let's guess ""ADOPT"".

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the first. We could put it in the second, fourth, or fifth. But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" (A in second and fifth) -> P, A, S, T, A. This tests P, S, T and two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, if the word has only one A, then one of the A's in ""PASTA"" might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, but we have two and the word has only one, then one will be marked as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? But we don't know. It might complicate.

 So to avoid confusion, we can choose a word with only one A. ""ADOPT"" has one A.

 Therefore, I choose ""ADOPT"".

<guess>adopt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" (placed in a position other than 3rd to test new locations).
- Must avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", ""O"", ""D"", ""P"") to maximize information.

Selected ""adopt"" because:
- Places ""A"" in the 1st position (testing a new location).
- Introduces four new common letters: ""D"", ""O"", ""P"", ""T"".
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.
- Valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>adopt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)
Meaning:
  - A is still in the word, but not in the 1st position (since we guessed A in 1st and got '-', meaning wrong position).
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position (because we got T(-) in the 5th position).
  - D, O, P are not in the word.

Summary of known information:
1. The word contains 'A' and 'T'.
   - 'A' is not in position 1 or 3.
   - 'T' is not in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Includes 'A' and 'T'
  - Excludes: C, R, N, E, D, O, P
  - Positions for A: since not 1 or 3, possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - Positions for T: not 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Additionally, we have tested many consonants and vowels. The remaining letters are:
Vowels not tested: I, U (A is known, E and O excluded)
Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D, P, and we know they are excluded. 
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, S, T (T is included), V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T is in the word and A is in the word, we know two letters. The word has 3 other letters which must be from the remaining pool.

We should focus on common letters: S, L, I, M, H, G, K, etc.

Also, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we known it was misplaced. So in the actual word, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

In the second guess, A was in position 1 and misplaced? Actually, we got A(-) meaning it exists but not in 1, so now we know A is definitely not in 1 or 3. So positions 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T was in position 5 in the second guess and we got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes A and T, avoids the excluded letters, and tests possible positions.

Let me think of words that have A and T and use common letters from the remaining set.

Since A must be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,2,3,4.

Possible combinations:

- If T is in position 1: then A in 2,4,5. Words like ""T_ A _ _"" or ""T _ _ A _"" or ""T _ _ _ A""
- If T in 2: then A in 4 or 5 (since A cannot be in 2 and T simultaneously? Actually, unless the word has two same letters? But we don't know). But note: A and T could share the same position? No, they cannot. So for a given word, T cannot be in the same spot as A.

But we don't know if there are multiple T's or multiple A's. So far, we only know each is present at least once.

We should try a word that has both A and T in new positions, and introduces new letters.

For example, T in position 1 and A in position 4? Then the word pattern: T _ _ A ?

But the middle two letters must be from the remaining letters.

Example: T? Let's try to include S, L, I, etc.

Word: ""TAXIS""? But it has X and S? Also, we have A in position 2? That's if we do T, A, ...? Wait, ""TAXIS"" is T, A, X, I, S -> A is in position 2.

But note: we should avoid O? Yes, and O is excluded so safe? And no D, P, etc.

But ""TAXIS"" has A in position 2: that's a possible position for A.

But let's check if it fits the constraints:

Position for A: 2 -> allowed (since not 1,3).
Position for T: 1 -> allowed.

Now, the word includes X and I and S.

But we don't know about X, I, S. So we can test.

However, are there more common words?

Another example: ""TABLE"" -> but E is excluded? No, E is excluded so we cannot use E.

""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S -> A in 2nd? Yes. This word: T in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), and letters I, L, S which are new.

Let me check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,N,E,D,O,P? So valid.

But note: we also know that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was misplaced. Now if the word is ""TAILS"", that has A in position 2. Then in the first guess (crane) the A was in position 3: that is not the position for A (which is 2) so it should be marked as '-', which we got. Also, in the second guess (adopt) we put A in position 1 and got '-', which for ""TAILS"" that is correct because A is in position 2.

Also, T in ""TAILS"" is position 1? Then in second guess we put T in position 5? And we got T(-) which is consistent because T is in the word but not at 5.

However, we have to consider the feedback for the second guess: the T was in position 5 and marked '-', meaning the word has T but not at 5. In ""TAILS"", T is at 1, so that's fine.

But note: we also have an I and L and S. We don't know about them.

But we must include both A and T. So ""TAILS"" includes A and T.

Another possibility: ""SAINT""? But N is excluded? No, N was in the first guess and marked absent? So we cannot use N.

Also, in ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T -> but N is excluded? Yes, so invalid.

Another: ""MATCH""? But C is excluded? Yes, cannot use.

""PATHY""? Not 5 letters? 

""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y. This word: A at position 2? And T at position 4? Also, H and S and Y.

But we don't know about H, S, Y.

Compare ""HASTY"" and ""TAILS"": both are valid.

We could also consider words with A in position 4 or 5.

But since we have few information, we might want to place A in a different positions to gather more info.

However, placing A in position 4 or 5 would be a new test.

But let's look for common words.

Alternative: ""LAST"" is only 4 letters? Need 5.

""PLAST""? not word.

""BEAST""? but E is excluded? Yes.

""TOAST"" has O? O is excluded? In second guess O(x), so O is not in word? And also has S and T? Word: T, O, A, S, T -> O is excluded? So we cannot use O? Therefore, ""TOAST"" is invalid.

Back to the idea: words with T at start and A at 2nd: TA* * ?

Words: TABBY? but has B? and Y? 'TABBY': T, A, B, B, Y -> but we don't know about B and Y? Also, two B's? And A at 2.

""TALKS"": T, A, L, K, S -> avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, K, S are okay? Then A in 2nd? This is similar to ""TAILS"", but with K instead of I.

""TAILS"" vs. ""TALKS"": both are valid.

We can also consider having T in other positions.

Another possibility: T at position 4.

Words with A in position 2 and T in 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _.

For instance, ""WAIST""? W, A, I, S, T -> A in 2nd, T in 5th? Actually, WAIST: positions - W1, A2, I3, S4, T5.

But we got feedback that T is not in position 5? Because in second guess we put T in 5 and got T(-). So T cannot be in position 5? Therefore, we cannot have a word with T in 5.

So for A in 2nd and T must be in 1,3,4.

If T is in 4th, then the word would be like: _ A _ T ?

Then the last letter must be filled.

Example: ""HASTY"" as above? H1, A2, S3, T4, Y5 -> but T is in 4th? This avoids T in 5? Then it's okay? And Y in 5th? We haven't tested Y? So acceptable.

But note: we must avoid putting A in 1 or 3? So A in 2nd is okay.

Similarly, we can consider T in position 3? Then pattern: _ _ T A? (if A in 4th) or _ _ T _ A (if A in 5th). 

But let's find words.

Possible words:

1. TAILS: T at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.
   - Tests T at 1 and A at 2? Both positions are new for these letters.

2. HASTY: H at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
   - Tests A at 2 and T at 4? And avoids T at 5? Also tests S at 3 and H and Y.

3. We could also try a word that puts A at a different position? Such as 4th or 5th? For example: 

   - A at 4th: word pattern: ? ? ? A ? 
     And T must be in 1,2,3? Avoid 5.

     Example: ""QUOTA""? but contains U and O? O is excluded? So no.

     ""FATAL"": F, A, T, A, L? But has two A's? And positions: A at 2 and at 5? But we are putting A at 4? No, if we put the fourth letter as A? ""FATAL"": positions: F1, A2, T3, A4, L5 -> so A at 2 and 4? But we already know A is present? So it might have two A's? And T at 3.

     But we need to avoid excluded letters? It has F, T, L? We haven't tested F? So okay? Also, letters: F, A, T, L? And contains L? 

     However, not that common? And we have A at 2? Which we haven't tested? So not efficient.

So to maximize information, I think words like ""TAILS"" or ""HASTY"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider the vowels? We haven't tested I, U? In ""TAILS"" we test I? Which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" has A (known) and Y? So not vowel heavy.

Another candidate: ""SAULT""? S, A, U, L, T -> A at 2nd? And T at 5th? BUT T at 5th is forbidden? Because feedback says T is not in 5th? So we cannot have T at 5th? Therefore, ""SAULT"" is invalid? Because the word must have T? But if we put T at 5th, that is the wrong position? We learned that T is not in 5th? So the word must have T somewhere else? So we cannot guess a word that puts T in 5th now? Because we know it will be misplaced? So it wastes guess? Avoid any word that puts T in 5th? Similarly, we avoid A in 1 or 3.

Therefore, ""SAULT"" not allowed? Because puts T in 5th and we know that position is wrong? We learn nothing new? And wastes a chance? So we should avoid that.

Therefore, I think ""TAILS"" is a good guess because:

- Puts A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Puts T in position 1 (another new position to test).
- Uses three new common letters: I, L, S.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" doesn't put T in 5? So it's okay? But has Y? Which is less common.

Another candidate: ""TAMIS""? T, A, M, I, S? And A in 2nd? But not sure if valid word? I think ""tamis"" is a valid word? But frequency? Maybe not as common.

To be safe, I think ""TAILS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But wait: what about duplicate letters? Not an issue here because each letter in the word is different? And we haven't seen any duplicates? So the word might be all distinct? We don't know? But ""TAILS"" has distinct letters? Which is good? Because if there is a duplicate, we don't know? We'll see? So testing distinct letters will help.

So ""TAILS"" it is.

<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": A is present but not in the 3rd position. C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""adopt"": A is present but not in the 1st position. T is present but not in the 5th position. D, O, P are absent.

Key deductions:
- **A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5** (not 1 or 3).
- **T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4** (not 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.
- **Remaining letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and T while adhering to their positional constraints.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters to gather more information.
- Strong candidates: ""TAILS"" (tests A at position 2, T at position 1, and introduces I, L, S).

Reasoning for ""TAILS"":
- **A**: Position 2 is valid (not 1 or 3).
- **T**: Position 1 is valid (not 5).
- New letters: I, L, S are untested and common.
- Avoids excluded letters: No C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

This guess maximizes information gain on letter positions and coverage of new letters.

Some common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\n We can try to place \'A\' in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).\n\n Let\'s consider words that have \'A\' and use other common letters.\n\n Example: \n   - Starting with \'S\'? Words like ""SAINT"" but we cannot use N (feedback said N is not in the word). \n   - Instead, how about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have to avoid R (which is excluded) and in ""SALAD"" we have L and D.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that A is present and in the wrong position. It doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple A\'s. However, we can try a word with only one A for now.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n   - A in the first position: ABLE? But E is excluded. \n   - A in the second position: ""PASTA""? But we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven\'t tested S yet. Also, P, A, S, T. But note: we have two A\'s? The word ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? Actually, it has one A at position 2 and one at position 5? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s.\n\n However, we must avoid E (which is in ""PASTA"" at the end? No, ""PASTA"" ends with A, not E). Wait, ""PASTA"" is P-A-S-T-A. So no E. But we have to avoid R? There\'s no R. And no C, N, E. So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we also want to test more new letters. We have already excluded C, R, N, E. So we can use other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible and includes A in a position that is not 3.\n\n Another idea: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but we already know E is excluded and we have to avoid E. So not that.\n\n Let\'s list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:\n\n   - A in position 1: ALBUM, ALUMS, ALOUD, ALONG (but we cannot use N and G is new) -> ALONG has N? Yes, so avoid. \n   - A in position 2: ""PAINT"" -> has N and T? But N is excluded. So no.\n   - A in position 4: We can try words like ""PLAIT"" but has T? and I? But we don\'t know about T and I. However, we must avoid N? ""PLAIT"" doesn\'t have N, but it has T and I. But also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E. But note: ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T.\n\n However, we are not sure about the other letters. We want to test more common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in the first position and we don\'t know about U, D, I, O. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N, E? It doesn\'t have any of those. However, we know that A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. In ""AUDIO"", A is in the 1st position, which is fine. But we are not using the information about A being present? Actually, we are: we are putting A in a different position (1st) to test.\n\n However, we already know A is in the word, so we don\'t need to test that again? Actually, we do need to find its correct position. But we can also test other letters.\n\n But note: we have 5 more guesses, so we can try to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a different position and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Some options:\n\n   - A in 1st: ""ADOPT"" -> A, D, O, P, T. All new letters. This is good because we test 4 new letters and A.\n   - A in 2nd: ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> N is excluded, so invalid.\n   - A in 4th: ""FLAIR"" -> but R is excluded. So no.\n   - A in 5th: ""DELTA"" -> but E is excluded and D, E, L, T, A -> E is excluded, so no.\n\n So let\'s go with ""ADOPT"". It has A in the first position (which is not the 3rd, so that\'s allowed) and we test D, O, P, T.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. It doesn\'t say that A cannot be in the first position. So it\'s okay.\n\n However, if the secret word has A in the first position, then in our first guess (crane) the A was in the 3rd position and that was wrong, but if the word has A in the first, then we would get a \'-\' for A in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, A was in the 3rd position and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not there. If the word has A in the first, then in the first guess we didn\'t have A in the first, so we wouldn\'t have known. So now we are testing A in the first.\n\n So let\'s guess ""ADOPT"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in the first. We could put it in the second, fourth, or fifth. But we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another option: ""PASTA"" (A in second and fifth) -> P, A, S, T, A. This tests P, S, T and two A\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, if the word has only one A, then one of the A\'s in ""PASTA"" might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, but we have two and the word has only one, then one will be marked as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? But we don\'t know. It might complicate.\n\n So to avoid confusion, we can choose a word with only one A. ""ADOPT"" has one A.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""ADOPT"".\n\n<guess>adopt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.\n- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include ""A"" (placed in a position other than 3rd to test new locations).\n- Must avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", ""E"".\n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", ""O"", ""D"", ""P"") to maximize information.\n\nSelected ""adopt"" because:\n- Places ""A"" in the 1st position (testing a new location).\n- Introduces four new common letters: ""D"", ""O"", ""P"", ""T"".\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>adopt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""adopt"" -> A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)\nMeaning:\n  - A is still in the word, but not in the 1st position (since we guessed A in 1st and got \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position (because we got T(-) in the 5th position).\n  - D, O, P are not in the word.\n\nSummary of known information:\n1. The word contains \'A\' and \'T\'.\n   - \'A\' is not in position 1 or 3.\n   - \'T\' is not in position 5.\n2. The word does NOT contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Includes \'A\' and \'T\'\n  - Excludes: C, R, N, E, D, O, P\n  - Positions for A: since not 1 or 3, possible positions: 2, 4, 5.\n  - Positions for T: not 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAdditionally, we have tested many consonants and vowels. The remaining letters are:\nVowels not tested: I, U (A is known, E and O excluded)\nConsonants: We have tested C, R, N, D, P, and we know they are excluded. \nRemaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, S, T (T is included), V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince T is in the word and A is in the word, we know two letters. The word has 3 other letters which must be from the remaining pool.\n\nWe should focus on common letters: S, L, I, M, H, G, K, etc.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we known it was misplaced. So in the actual word, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn the second guess, A was in position 1 and misplaced? Actually, we got A(-) meaning it exists but not in 1, so now we know A is definitely not in 1 or 3. So positions 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, T was in position 5 in the second guess and we got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that includes A and T, avoids the excluded letters, and tests possible positions.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and T and use common letters from the remaining set.\n\nSince A must be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,2,3,4.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- If T is in position 1: then A in 2,4,5. Words like ""T_ A _ _"" or ""T _ _ A _"" or ""T _ _ _ A""\n- If T in 2: then A in 4 or 5 (since A cannot be in 2 and T simultaneously? Actually, unless the word has two same letters? But we don\'t know). But note: A and T could share the same position? No, they cannot. So for a given word, T cannot be in the same spot as A.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are multiple T\'s or multiple A\'s. So far, we only know each is present at least once.\n\nWe should try a word that has both A and T in new positions, and introduces new letters.\n\nFor example, T in position 1 and A in position 4? Then the word pattern: T _ _ A ?\n\nBut the middle two letters must be from the remaining letters.\n\nExample: T? Let\'s try to include S, L, I, etc.\n\nWord: ""TAXIS""? But it has X and S? Also, we have A in position 2? That\'s if we do T, A, ...? Wait, ""TAXIS"" is T, A, X, I, S -> A is in position 2.\n\nBut note: we should avoid O? Yes, and O is excluded so safe? And no D, P, etc.\n\nBut ""TAXIS"" has A in position 2: that\'s a possible position for A.\n\nBut let\'s check if it fits the constraints:\n\nPosition for A: 2 -> allowed (since not 1,3).\nPosition for T: 1 -> allowed.\n\nNow, the word includes X and I and S.\n\nBut we don\'t know about X, I, S. So we can test.\n\nHowever, are there more common words?\n\nAnother example: ""TABLE"" -> but E is excluded? No, E is excluded so we cannot use E.\n\n""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S -> A in 2nd? Yes. This word: T in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), and letters I, L, S which are new.\n\nLet me check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,N,E,D,O,P? So valid.\n\nBut note: we also know that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was misplaced. Now if the word is ""TAILS"", that has A in position 2. Then in the first guess (crane) the A was in position 3: that is not the position for A (which is 2) so it should be marked as \'-\', which we got. Also, in the second guess (adopt) we put A in position 1 and got \'-\', which for ""TAILS"" that is correct because A is in position 2.\n\nAlso, T in ""TAILS"" is position 1? Then in second guess we put T in position 5? And we got T(-) which is consistent because T is in the word but not at 5.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the feedback for the second guess: the T was in position 5 and marked \'-\', meaning the word has T but not at 5. In ""TAILS"", T is at 1, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut note: we also have an I and L and S. We don\'t know about them.\n\nBut we must include both A and T. So ""TAILS"" includes A and T.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SAINT""? But N is excluded? No, N was in the first guess and marked absent? So we cannot use N.\n\nAlso, in ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T -> but N is excluded? Yes, so invalid.\n\nAnother: ""MATCH""? But C is excluded? Yes, cannot use.\n\n""PATHY""? Not 5 letters? \n\n""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y. This word: A at position 2? And T at position 4? Also, H and S and Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H, S, Y.\n\nCompare ""HASTY"" and ""TAILS"": both are valid.\n\nWe could also consider words with A in position 4 or 5.\n\nBut since we have few information, we might want to place A in a different positions to gather more info.\n\nHowever, placing A in position 4 or 5 would be a new test.\n\nBut let\'s look for common words.\n\nAlternative: ""LAST"" is only 4 letters? Need 5.\n\n""PLAST""? not word.\n\n""BEAST""? but E is excluded? Yes.\n\n""TOAST"" has O? O is excluded? In second guess O(x), so O is not in word? And also has S and T? Word: T, O, A, S, T -> O is excluded? So we cannot use O? Therefore, ""TOAST"" is invalid.\n\nBack to the idea: words with T at start and A at 2nd: TA* * ?\n\nWords: TABBY? but has B? and Y? \'TABBY\': T, A, B, B, Y -> but we don\'t know about B and Y? Also, two B\'s? And A at 2.\n\n""TALKS"": T, A, L, K, S -> avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, K, S are okay? Then A in 2nd? This is similar to ""TAILS"", but with K instead of I.\n\n""TAILS"" vs. ""TALKS"": both are valid.\n\nWe can also consider having T in other positions.\n\nAnother possibility: T at position 4.\n\nWords with A in position 2 and T in 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _.\n\nFor instance, ""WAIST""? W, A, I, S, T -> A in 2nd, T in 5th? Actually, WAIST: positions - W1, A2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nBut we got feedback that T is not in position 5? Because in second guess we put T in 5 and got T(-). So T cannot be in position 5? Therefore, we cannot have a word with T in 5.\n\nSo for A in 2nd and T must be in 1,3,4.\n\nIf T is in 4th, then the word would be like: _ A _ T ?\n\nThen the last letter must be filled.\n\nExample: ""HASTY"" as above? H1, A2, S3, T4, Y5 -> but T is in 4th? This avoids T in 5? Then it\'s okay? And Y in 5th? We haven\'t tested Y? So acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must avoid putting A in 1 or 3? So A in 2nd is okay.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider T in position 3? Then pattern: _ _ T A? (if A in 4th) or _ _ T _ A (if A in 5th). \n\nBut let\'s find words.\n\nPossible words:\n\n1. TAILS: T at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n   - Tests T at 1 and A at 2? Both positions are new for these letters.\n\n2. HASTY: H at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n   - Tests A at 2 and T at 4? And avoids T at 5? Also tests S at 3 and H and Y.\n\n3. We could also try a word that puts A at a different position? Such as 4th or 5th? For example: \n\n   - A at 4th: word pattern: ? ? ? A ? \n     And T must be in 1,2,3? Avoid 5.\n\n     Example: ""QUOTA""? but contains U and O? O is excluded? So no.\n\n     ""FATAL"": F, A, T, A, L? But has two A\'s? And positions: A at 2 and at 5? But we are putting A at 4? No, if we put the fourth letter as A? ""FATAL"": positions: F1, A2, T3, A4, L5 -> so A at 2 and 4? But we already know A is present? So it might have two A\'s? And T at 3.\n\n     But we need to avoid excluded letters? It has F, T, L? We haven\'t tested F? So okay? Also, letters: F, A, T, L? And contains L? \n\n     However, not that common? And we have A at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? So not efficient.\n\nSo to maximize information, I think words like ""TAILS"" or ""HASTY"" are good.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider the vowels? We haven\'t tested I, U? In ""TAILS"" we test I? Which is a vowel.\n\nSimilarly, ""HASTY"" has A (known) and Y? So not vowel heavy.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SAULT""? S, A, U, L, T -> A at 2nd? And T at 5th? BUT T at 5th is forbidden? Because feedback says T is not in 5th? So we cannot have T at 5th? Therefore, ""SAULT"" is invalid? Because the word must have T? But if we put T at 5th, that is the wrong position? We learned that T is not in 5th? So the word must have T somewhere else? So we cannot guess a word that puts T in 5th now? Because we know it will be misplaced? So it wastes guess? Avoid any word that puts T in 5th? Similarly, we avoid A in 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, ""SAULT"" not allowed? Because puts T in 5th and we know that position is wrong? We learn nothing new? And wastes a chance? So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, I think ""TAILS"" is a good guess because:\n\n- Puts A in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Puts T in position 1 (another new position to test).\n- Uses three new common letters: I, L, S.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""HASTY"" doesn\'t put T in 5? So it\'s okay? But has Y? Which is less common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TAMIS""? T, A, M, I, S? And A in 2nd? But not sure if valid word? I think ""tamis"" is a valid word? But frequency? Maybe not as common.\n\nTo be safe, I think ""TAILS"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TAILS"".\n\nBut wait: what about duplicate letters? Not an issue here because each letter in the word is different? And we haven\'t seen any duplicates? So the word might be all distinct? We don\'t know? But ""TAILS"" has distinct letters? Which is good? Because if there is a duplicate, we don\'t know? We\'ll see? So testing distinct letters will help.\n\nSo ""TAILS"" it is.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From ""crane"": A is present but not in the 3rd position.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> Feedback: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)
  - A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 3: ""tails"" -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)
  - Now, A is CORRECTLY placed in the 2nd position! (A(✓))
  - T is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got T(-) for position 1).
  - L is in the word but not in the 4th position (since L(-) at position 4).
  - I and S are not in the word at all (I(x), S(x)).

Therefore, we know:
1. The word has A in the second position: _ A _ _ _
2. T is in the word, but not at positions 1,5 (from guesses 2 and 3) and also not at position 1 (from guess 3). So T cannot be in position 1 or 5. Also from guess 3, T is not in the first position? We guessed T at position 1 and got T(-) meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? So from guess 2: T not at 5? And guess 3: T not at 1? Therefore, T must be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is taken by A? So T cannot be at 2 because A is there? Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

3. L is in the word, but not at position 4? (because in ""tails"", L was at position 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position). So L is somewhere else? And since position 2 is taken by A? L can be in position 1,3,5? But wait: when we say not at position 4, we don't know about others? So possible positions for L: 1,3,5? 

Also, we have more constraints:

Excluded letters (from any feedback: x means not in the word): C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.

So excluded: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.

We also know the word contains T, A (at position 2), and L.

Therefore, the word is: _ A _ _ _ , with A at position 2? So pattern: [pos1] A [pos3] [pos4] [pos5]

And the word must include T and L, and exclude the above letters.

Available letters: we have to choose letters from the alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S? So remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y? But T is also included? And we know T is in the word? So we have T and L must be part of the word? So the word has at least three letters: T, A, L.

Moreover, T must be in position 3 or 4? Because it cannot be in 1,2,5? And L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""tails"", we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So L must be in 1,3, or 5.

If T is at position 3, then position 4 and 5 are for other letters? But also L must be in 1,3, or 5? But position 3 is T? So L cannot be at 3 if T is there? So then L must be at 1 or 5? 

If T is at position 4, then L can be at 1,3, or 5? But position 4 is T? So L cannot be at 4? But we already know L not at 4? So okay? Therefore L at 1,3, or 5.

Now, what letters are left? We have to include T and L? And we need two more letters? Or possibly one more if T and L are fixed? Actually, the word has five letters? We have A at 2? Then we need the other three positions? And we know T is one? And L is one? So the word has A(2), T(3 or 4), L(1,3,5) but depending on T's position, we can see overlap.

Case 1: T at position 3.
Then word: _ A T _ _
Then L must be at position 1 or 5? And we need one more letter? Actually, we have two positions: position 1 and 5? But L will take one? And the other position has to be another letter? But we have L? So:

Possible patterns:
- L A T ? ? -> but L at 1? Then last two? Or L at 5 -> then pattern: ? A T ? L

But position for L when T is at position 3: 
If L at 5: then word: _ A T _ L
But we need letters for position 1 and position 4? Also, the letter at position 4? And the letter at position 1?

But also, we must consider that L cannot be at position 4, but that's already taken by T? So we don't put L at 4? So no issue.

Case 2: T at position 4.
Then word: _ A _ T _
Now, L can be at 1,3, or 5? But also we need a letter at position 3? And position 1 and 5? So:

Pattern: L A ? T ? 
And L can be at 1? Then we have positions 3 and 5? Or L at 3? Then pattern: ? A L T ? ? -> no, positions: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: L, 4: T, 5: ? 
Or L at 5: ? A ? T L

So all possible.

But we also have to avoid excluded letters? So the letters must be from {B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y}? And note L is already allowed? Because L is in the word? So we can use L in the guess? But we already know L is in? So not testing new letters? So we should test new letters? But we need to use the existing information? And we might guess the word?

Therefore, we need to form words:

For case 1: T at position 3: word pattern: [L] A T [X] [Y]? But if L at 1? Then L at 1: so L A T X Y? Or if L at 5: then X A T Y L? But L at 5? So pattern: [letter] A T [letter] L

But we need both letters? Similarly for other cases.

Moreover, the word must be valid English words? And we have constraints? So let's try:

Case 1a: T at 3, L at 1? Then word: L A T * *?

What words: ""LATCH""? But C is excluded? ""LATHE""? E is excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? ""LATTE""? but T is repeated? But we guessed T only once? Actually, in ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> we have T twice? And E excluded? So no.

""LATKE""? L, A, T, K, E -> E excluded? No.

""LATUS""? L, A, T, U, S -> but S excluded? No.

Case 1b: T at 3, L at 5? Then word: * A T * L?

So pattern: {letter} A T {letter} L

Now, possible words:

- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> has two T's? Also, E excluded? No. 
- ""MATT L""? Not word. 
- ""CATTLE""? C excluded? 
- ""HATTLE""? Not common? But what is HATTLE? Not valid? 
- ""WATTLE"": W, A, T, T, L -> similar? Two T's? 

But note: we know T is one letter? And if the word has two T's? But we haven't seen that? Also, our feedback doesn't prevent having two T's? But in guess 3 ""tails"", we only had one T? And we found T is in one position? But there might be more? Maybe? 

But let's see: how about ""RATTLE""? R excluded? 

Other possibilities: With distinct letters? 

Actually, hard? 

Case 2: T at position 4? So word: _ A _ T _

Then L at position 1: L A * T *? 

Words: ""LAITH""? But I excluded? ""LATHE""? E excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? 

L at position 3: * A L T *? 

Words: ""HALTS""? H, A, L, T, S -> S excluded? ""VALTA""? Not word? ""BALTIC""? 6 letters? 

""BALTS""? Not common? ""HALTED""? E excluded? 

L at position 5? * A * T L? 

Words: ""MAUTL""? Not word? ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> yes, ""FAULT"". But L at 5? And T at 4? And letters: F and U? 

Check excluded letters: F and U are not in excluded list? Also, ""FAULT"" contains L and T, and A at position 2? Pattern: F A U L T -> positions: A at 2 (correct? yes), T at 5? But wait! From guess 2: T in position 5 was marked as wrong? Because adopt had T at 5 and got T(-). But in ""FAULT"", T is at position 5? And we have T(-) in guess 2? Meaning the word does contain T? But not at position 5? Because it was misplaced when in 5th position? Therefore, if ""FAULT"" has T at 5th, that would be incorrect? Contradiction? So ""FAULT"" would be ruled out? Because T at 5th position is forbidden? So we cannot have that word? Or if the word has T at 5th, then when we say T(-), that means there is another T? But we don't know? 

But in guess 3: tails had T at position 1 and L at 4? Then we got T(-) meaning not at 1, L(-) meaning not at 4? And A(✓) at 2? 

Now, we know A at 2, and we must place T and L? And exclude S,I? 

Let's list possible words that fit:

- A at position 2?
- T must be at 3 or 4?
- L must be at 1,3,5? But 3 cannot be if T is at 3? So depending on T.

Case: T at 3? Then word: _ A T _ _? And L at 1 or 5? 

L at 1: L A T * *? 

Words: 
- ""LATCH""? C excluded? 
- ""LATHE""? E excluded? 
- ""LATIN""? N excluded? 
- ""LATEX""? E excluded? 
- ""LATUS""? S excluded? 
- ""LATHY""? Not common? 

Or L at 5: _ A T * L? 

Words: 
- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> E? Also E excluded? And has two T's? 
- ""WATTLE""? W, A, T, T, L -> E? But ends with E? Not? ""WATTLE"" is W-A-T-T-L? But not 5th has E? No, W-A-T-T-L-E? That's 6. Actually, ""WATTLE"" is often consider 6? But sometimes abbreviated? Anyway, use 5-letter words? ""CATTLE""? C excluded? 
- ""MATTL""? Not word? 
- ""HATTY""? but no L? 
- ""PATTY""? P excluded? 
- ""BATTL""? Not word? 

So struggling? 

Case 2: T at 4? Then word: _ A _ T _? 

L at 1: L A * T *? 
Words: 
- ""LAITY""? I excluded? 
- ""LASTS""? S excluded? 
- ""LAMBS""? M, B? But S excluded? No, S is excluded? 
- ""LAVTS""? Not word. 

L at 3: * A L T *? 
Words: 
- ""HALTS""? S excluded? 
- ""MALTS""? S excluded? 
- ""BALDY""? D excluded? 
- ""GALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""MALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""VALES""? E excluded? 

Some possibility: ""HALLT""? Not word? 

L at 5: * A * T L? 
Words: 
- ""EASTL""? E and S excluded? 
- ""HAUTY""? But no L? 
- ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> but T at 5th? Which is forbidden? So invalid? But if T at 5th? And our feedback from guess 2 says T is not at position 5? So how can it be? 

Unless there is another T? And the word has T at 5th and somewhere else? Then when we put T at 5th, we get T(-) because the other T is correct? But the feedback would say one T is in the wrong position (the one at 5) and maybe the other T is in a correct position? But we got only one T in guess 2? And we put T at 5th and got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at this position? So if the word has two T's, then one T could be at another position? Then putting T at 5th, and if there is a T at another position, we get T(-) because it's not at 5th? But still, the T at 5th is wrong? And the feedback only says it is misplaced? Misplaced means it's in the word at a different position? So the word does have T? But not at 5th? Therefore, we must avoid putting T at 5th? Because it won't be correct? 

But if the word has T at 5th? Then when we put T at 5th, we would get T(✓) if it is in the correct position? Or T(-) only if it is in the word but not at that position? Which would happen if there is a T at another position? And if there is no other T? Then T at 5th should be T(✓)? But we got T(-) in guess 2? But guess 2 feedback: adopt -> T(-) means T is in the word? But not at position 5? So if the word had T only at position 5? Then we would get T(✓)? But we got T(-) which implies that T is not at 5? And also that there must be a T at another position? Because the feedback also says T is in the word? 

Therefore, the word has at least two T's? Or at least, T is in the word not at 5? So a single T word would have T not at 5? If there is only one T, then it must be at a position other than 5? And if there are multiple T's, then one is at another position? So when we put T at 5, we get T(-) because it is not at 5? Or because there is a T but not at position 5? So either way, the word does not have T at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have T at position 5.

For ""FAULT"": F A U L T: T at position 5? So it is invalid? Because T is at 5? But we know T is not at 5? So the word cannot be ""FAULT"".

So no.

Another word for L at 5 with T not at 5? But in the pattern for case 2 and L at 5: * A ? T L? Here T is at position 4? And L at position 5? So ""FAUTL"" not a word? 

Perhaps ""HAV L T""? Not. 

Let's think of words with A at 2, T and L? And no duplicates? And using available letters.

Perhaps T at position 4? And L at position 1? But what's in position 3 and 5? 

I recall that L is in the word? So we can use L? And T? And we have to choose the other two letters.

Another word? ""HALFT""? Not word? 

Perhaps T at position 3? and L at position 5? Then the word would be: for example, ""BATTL"" not word? ""MATTL"" no? 

""KATAL""? Not common? 

""TALKS"" was guessed earlier? But not that.

Back to the feedback of guess 3: ""tails"" produced T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)? 

Also, we didn't have any other feedback? 

Perhaps we have to accept that T is not at 1 or 5? And from the first guess we have no information about other positions? 

But let's consider the letter that can be in position 3 or 4 for T, and then L elsewhere.

It could be that there are multiple L's? But not necessarily.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""THALM"" or something? Not common.

Perhaps ""GAULT""? G, A, U, L, T -> Pattern? If L not at 4? If we place: position 1: G, 2: A, 3: U, 4: L, 5: T -> but T at 5? Forbidden? Again T at 5? So invalid.

Placed differently? ""G A U L T"" has L at 4? But in guess 3, we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So if the word has L at 4, then we would have got L(✓) for guess 3? But we got L(-) which means it is not at 4? Therefore, L cannot be at position 4.

So for ""GAULT"" placing L at 4? We cannot? So if the word is ""GAULT"" then L is at position 4? And we already know L is not at 4? So conflict. Therefore, ""GAULT"" would have L at 4? Which is forbidden? So invalid.

So what words are there?

Let's try to include new letters? For example, H, M, B, etc.

Pattern with T at position 3: then L at position 1: L A T x y? With x and y to be chosen from available letters? Avoiding excluded? And must form a word.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y

But letters to use: we need x and y? And already used L, A, T? So no problem? But the word has L, A, T, and two other letters.

Words: ""LATHE"" not, E excluded.
""LATCH"" C excluded.
""LATIN"" N excluded.
""LATEX"" E and X? E excluded? X not? Also, X available? But ""LATEX"" has E? Excluded? So no.
""LATKE"" E excluded.

Pattern L A T x y? Almost no words? 

With T at position 3 and L at position 5: x A T y L

Words: ""Battle"" not allowed? ""MATTE"" has E? ""WATTL"" not? ""Cattle"" C? ""HATTY"" has Y? But no L? ""HATTY"" is H,A,T,T,Y? No L? Not.

""BATEL"" B, A, T, E, L -> E excluded? 

"" KATAL"" not common? ""KATAL"" is not a valid English word? 

Perhaps the word is ""THALI"" but I excluded? Not.

Alternatively, T at position 4? And L at position 3: then pattern: x A L T y

Words: ""BALTI""? I excluded? ""HALTS"" S excluded? ""MALTY"" M, A, L, T, Y -> S? No, Y? ""MALTY"" is a word? Like malt whiskey? Okay, valid? But S not? Let me check: available letters, Y is available? And not excluded? Also, no S.

So ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y
Positions: 1:M, 2:A (correct), 3:L, 4:T (as required? T at position 4), 5:Y

Check the constraints:
- A at position 2: correct.
- T at position 4: not 1,5 which is allowed. (from earlier, T cannot be 1 or 5? Here, 4 is okay? Also, not 5? So allowed.)
- L at position 3: earlier we had L at position 4 in guess 3 and got L(-) but not its position? So now L at position 3? That can be new.

Also, no excluded letters: M and Y are allowed.

So this seems a valid guess.

Other possibilities: ""HALTU""? Not English.

So ""MALTY"" is a possible candidate.

We can also consider L at position 1? For example, ""LATTU""? Not word? Or ""LATHY"" not common? 

But ""MALTY"" is valid.

Since we have not many alternatives, I'll go with ""MALTY"".

Therefore, guess ""MALTY"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - Interpretation:  
     - A is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.  
     - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""adopt"")**:  
 - A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)  
 - Interpretation:  
   - A is present but not in the 1st position (confirms it cannot be position 1 or 3).  
   - T is present but not in the 5th position.  
   - D, O, P are **absent**.  

3. **Feedback from Guess 3 (""tails"")**:  
 - T(-), A(✓), I(x), L(-), S(x)  
 - Interpretation:  
   - A is **correctly placed in position 2** (pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
   - T is present but not in the 1st position (eliminates positions 1 and 5).  
   - L is present but not in the 4th position.  
   - I and S are **absent**.  

### Key Deductions
- **A**: Must be in position 2 (confirmed by ✓).  
- **T**:  
  - Present in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""adopt"" and ""tails"" feedback).  
  - Possible positions: **3 or 4** (since position 2 is occupied by A).  
- **L**:  
  - Present but not in position 4 (from ""tails"" feedback).  
  - Possible positions: **1, 3, or 5** (but position 3 may conflict with T).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- **Valid letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y (since L is confirmed present).  
- **Word structure**: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).  

### Constraints for the Next Guess
1. Must include **T** and **L** (both confirmed present).  
2. Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S).  
3. **T position**:
   - Cannot be 1 or 5 → must be **3 or 4**.  
4. **L position**:
   - Cannot be 4 → must be **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - Conflict: If T is in position 3, L cannot also be in position 3 → must be in **1 or 5**.  
   - If T is in position 4, L can be in **1, 3, or 5**.  
5. Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., M, H, Y, G) to gather more information.  

### Testing Possible Words
- **Scenario 1: T in position 3** → Pattern: `_ A T _ _`  
  - L must be in 1 or 5.  
  - Options:  
    - L in 1: `L A T _ _` → Valid words like ""LATCH"" (invalid, C excluded), ""LATHE"" (invalid, E excluded), or ""LATUK"" (invalid word). No common valid words found.  
    - L in 5: `_ A T _ L` → Valid words like ""BATTLE"" (invalid, E excluded), ""WATTLE"" (6 letters) → **No feasible words**.  

- **Scenario 2: T in position 4** → Pattern: `_ A _ T _`  
  - L can be in 1, 3, or 5.  
  - Options:  
    - L in 1: `L A _ T _` → No common words (e.g., ""LAITH"", I excluded).  
    - L in 3: `_ A L T _` → Valid word: **""MALTY""** (M A L T Y).  
      - Checks:  
        - M and Y untested → tests new common letters.  
        - T in position 4 (allowed).  
        - L in position 3 (allowed, as feedback only ruled out position 4).  
        - All letters valid: M, A, L, T, Y (A ✓, L and T present, M/Y new).  
        - Avoids excluded letters.  
    - L in 5: `_ A _ T L` → No common valid words (e.g., ""FAULT"" invalid, T cannot be in position 5).  

### Selected Guess: ""MALTY""
- **Why it fits**:  
  - Pattern: `M A L T Y` → **A in position 2 (✓)**, T in position 4 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed).  
  - Tests **T in position 4** and **L in position 3**, new letters **M** and **Y** for positions 1 and 5.  
  - Valid 5-letter English word (meaning: related to malt).  
  - Maximizes information gain:  
    - If M or Y are present/absent, we learn about the remaining positions.  
    - Confirms exact positions for T and L.  

<guess>malty</guess>",malty,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> Feedback: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)
  - A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 3: ""tails"" -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)
  - Now, A is CORRECTLY placed in the 2nd position! (A(✓))
  - T is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got T(-) for position 1).
  - L is in the word but not in the 4th position (since L(-) at position 4).
  - I and S are not in the word at all (I(x), S(x)).

Therefore, we know:
1. The word has A in the second position: _ A _ _ _
2. T is in the word, but not at positions 1,5 (from guesses 2 and 3) and also not at position 1 (from guess 3). So T cannot be in position 1 or 5. Also from guess 3, T is not in the first position? We guessed T at position 1 and got T(-) meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? So from guess 2: T not at 5? And guess 3: T not at 1? Therefore, T must be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is taken by A? So T cannot be at 2 because A is there? Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

3. L is in the word, but not at position 4? (because in ""tails"", L was at position 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position). So L is somewhere else? And since position 2 is taken by A? L can be in position 1,3,5? But wait: when we say not at position 4, we don't know about others? So possible positions for L: 1,3,5? 

Also, we have more constraints:

Excluded letters (from any feedback: x means not in the word): C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.

So excluded: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.

We also know the word contains T, A (at position 2), and L.

Therefore, the word is: _ A _ _ _ , with A at position 2? So pattern: [pos1] A [pos3] [pos4] [pos5]

And the word must include T and L, and exclude the above letters.

Available letters: we have to choose letters from the alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S? So remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y? But T is also included? And we know T is in the word? So we have T and L must be part of the word? So the word has at least three letters: T, A, L.

Moreover, T must be in position 3 or 4? Because it cannot be in 1,2,5? And L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""tails"", we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So L must be in 1,3, or 5.

If T is at position 3, then position 4 and 5 are for other letters? But also L must be in 1,3, or 5? But position 3 is T? So L cannot be at 3 if T is there? So then L must be at 1 or 5? 

If T is at position 4, then L can be at 1,3, or 5? But position 4 is T? So L cannot be at 4? But we already know L not at 4? So okay? Therefore L at 1,3, or 5.

Now, what letters are left? We have to include T and L? And we need two more letters? Or possibly one more if T and L are fixed? Actually, the word has five letters? We have A at 2? Then we need the other three positions? And we know T is one? And L is one? So the word has A(2), T(3 or 4), L(1,3,5) but depending on T's position, we can see overlap.

Case 1: T at position 3.
Then word: _ A T _ _
Then L must be at position 1 or 5? And we need one more letter? Actually, we have two positions: position 1 and 5? But L will take one? And the other position has to be another letter? But we have L? So:

Possible patterns:
- L A T ? ? -> but L at 1? Then last two? Or L at 5 -> then pattern: ? A T ? L

But position for L when T is at position 3: 
If L at 5: then word: _ A T _ L
But we need letters for position 1 and position 4? Also, the letter at position 4? And the letter at position 1?

But also, we must consider that L cannot be at position 4, but that's already taken by T? So we don't put L at 4? So no issue.

Case 2: T at position 4.
Then word: _ A _ T _
Now, L can be at 1,3, or 5? But also we need a letter at position 3? And position 1 and 5? So:

Pattern: L A ? T ? 
And L can be at 1? Then we have positions 3 and 5? Or L at 3? Then pattern: ? A L T ? ? -> no, positions: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: L, 4: T, 5: ? 
Or L at 5: ? A ? T L

So all possible.

But we also have to avoid excluded letters? So the letters must be from {B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y}? And note L is already allowed? Because L is in the word? So we can use L in the guess? But we already know L is in? So not testing new letters? So we should test new letters? But we need to use the existing information? And we might guess the word?

Therefore, we need to form words:

For case 1: T at position 3: word pattern: [L] A T [X] [Y]? But if L at 1? Then L at 1: so L A T X Y? Or if L at 5: then X A T Y L? But L at 5? So pattern: [letter] A T [letter] L

But we need both letters? Similarly for other cases.

Moreover, the word must be valid English words? And we have constraints? So let's try:

Case 1a: T at 3, L at 1? Then word: L A T * *?

What words: ""LATCH""? But C is excluded? ""LATHE""? E is excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? ""LATTE""? but T is repeated? But we guessed T only once? Actually, in ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> we have T twice? And E excluded? So no.

""LATKE""? L, A, T, K, E -> E excluded? No.

""LATUS""? L, A, T, U, S -> but S excluded? No.

Case 1b: T at 3, L at 5? Then word: * A T * L?

So pattern: {letter} A T {letter} L

Now, possible words:

- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> has two T's? Also, E excluded? No. 
- ""MATT L""? Not word. 
- ""CATTLE""? C excluded? 
- ""HATTLE""? Not common? But what is HATTLE? Not valid? 
- ""WATTLE"": W, A, T, T, L -> similar? Two T's? 

But note: we know T is one letter? And if the word has two T's? But we haven't seen that? Also, our feedback doesn't prevent having two T's? But in guess 3 ""tails"", we only had one T? And we found T is in one position? But there might be more? Maybe? 

But let's see: how about ""RATTLE""? R excluded? 

Other possibilities: With distinct letters? 

Actually, hard? 

Case 2: T at position 4? So word: _ A _ T _

Then L at position 1: L A * T *? 

Words: ""LAITH""? But I excluded? ""LATHE""? E excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? 

L at position 3: * A L T *? 

Words: ""HALTS""? H, A, L, T, S -> S excluded? ""VALTA""? Not word? ""BALTIC""? 6 letters? 

""BALTS""? Not common? ""HALTED""? E excluded? 

L at position 5? * A * T L? 

Words: ""MAUTL""? Not word? ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> yes, ""FAULT"". But L at 5? And T at 4? And letters: F and U? 

Check excluded letters: F and U are not in excluded list? Also, ""FAULT"" contains L and T, and A at position 2? Pattern: F A U L T -> positions: A at 2 (correct? yes), T at 5? But wait! From guess 2: T in position 5 was marked as wrong? Because adopt had T at 5 and got T(-). But in ""FAULT"", T is at position 5? And we have T(-) in guess 2? Meaning the word does contain T? But not at position 5? Because it was misplaced when in 5th position? Therefore, if ""FAULT"" has T at 5th, that would be incorrect? Contradiction? So ""FAULT"" would be ruled out? Because T at 5th position is forbidden? So we cannot have that word? Or if the word has T at 5th, then when we say T(-), that means there is another T? But we don't know? 

But in guess 3: tails had T at position 1 and L at 4? Then we got T(-) meaning not at 1, L(-) meaning not at 4? And A(✓) at 2? 

Now, we know A at 2, and we must place T and L? And exclude S,I? 

Let's list possible words that fit:

- A at position 2?
- T must be at 3 or 4?
- L must be at 1,3,5? But 3 cannot be if T is at 3? So depending on T.

Case: T at 3? Then word: _ A T _ _? And L at 1 or 5? 

L at 1: L A T * *? 

Words: 
- ""LATCH""? C excluded? 
- ""LATHE""? E excluded? 
- ""LATIN""? N excluded? 
- ""LATEX""? E excluded? 
- ""LATUS""? S excluded? 
- ""LATHY""? Not common? 

Or L at 5: _ A T * L? 

Words: 
- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> E? Also E excluded? And has two T's? 
- ""WATTLE""? W, A, T, T, L -> E? But ends with E? Not? ""WATTLE"" is W-A-T-T-L? But not 5th has E? No, W-A-T-T-L-E? That's 6. Actually, ""WATTLE"" is often consider 6? But sometimes abbreviated? Anyway, use 5-letter words? ""CATTLE""? C excluded? 
- ""MATTL""? Not word? 
- ""HATTY""? but no L? 
- ""PATTY""? P excluded? 
- ""BATTL""? Not word? 

So struggling? 

Case 2: T at 4? Then word: _ A _ T _? 

L at 1: L A * T *? 
Words: 
- ""LAITY""? I excluded? 
- ""LASTS""? S excluded? 
- ""LAMBS""? M, B? But S excluded? No, S is excluded? 
- ""LAVTS""? Not word. 

L at 3: * A L T *? 
Words: 
- ""HALTS""? S excluded? 
- ""MALTS""? S excluded? 
- ""BALDY""? D excluded? 
- ""GALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""MALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""VALES""? E excluded? 

Some possibility: ""HALLT""? Not word? 

L at 5: * A * T L? 
Words: 
- ""EASTL""? E and S excluded? 
- ""HAUTY""? But no L? 
- ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> but T at 5th? Which is forbidden? So invalid? But if T at 5th? And our feedback from guess 2 says T is not at position 5? So how can it be? 

Unless there is another T? And the word has T at 5th and somewhere else? Then when we put T at 5th, we get T(-) because the other T is correct? But the feedback would say one T is in the wrong position (the one at 5) and maybe the other T is in a correct position? But we got only one T in guess 2? And we put T at 5th and got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at this position? So if the word has two T's, then one T could be at another position? Then putting T at 5th, and if there is a T at another position, we get T(-) because it's not at 5th? But still, the T at 5th is wrong? And the feedback only says it is misplaced? Misplaced means it's in the word at a different position? So the word does have T? But not at 5th? Therefore, we must avoid putting T at 5th? Because it won't be correct? 

But if the word has T at 5th? Then when we put T at 5th, we would get T(✓) if it is in the correct position? Or T(-) only if it is in the word but not at that position? Which would happen if there is a T at another position? And if there is no other T? Then T at 5th should be T(✓)? But we got T(-) in guess 2? But guess 2 feedback: adopt -> T(-) means T is in the word? But not at position 5? So if the word had T only at position 5? Then we would get T(✓)? But we got T(-) which implies that T is not at 5? And also that there must be a T at another position? Because the feedback also says T is in the word? 

Therefore, the word has at least two T's? Or at least, T is in the word not at 5? So a single T word would have T not at 5? If there is only one T, then it must be at a position other than 5? And if there are multiple T's, then one is at another position? So when we put T at 5, we get T(-) because it is not at 5? Or because there is a T but not at position 5? So either way, the word does not have T at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have T at position 5.

For ""FAULT"": F A U L T: T at position 5? So it is invalid? Because T is at 5? But we know T is not at 5? So the word cannot be ""FAULT"".

So no.

Another word for L at 5 with T not at 5? But in the pattern for case 2 and L at 5: * A ? T L? Here T is at position 4? And L at position 5? So ""FAUTL"" not a word? 

Perhaps ""HAV L T""? Not. 

Let's think of words with A at 2, T and L? And no duplicates? And using available letters.

Perhaps T at position 4? And L at position 1? But what's in position 3 and 5? 

I recall that L is in the word? So we can use L? And T? And we have to choose the other two letters.

Another word? ""HALFT""? Not word? 

Perhaps T at position 3? and L at position 5? Then the word would be: for example, ""BATTL"" not word? ""MATTL"" no? 

""KATAL""? Not common? 

""TALKS"" was guessed earlier? But not that.

Back to the feedback of guess 3: ""tails"" produced T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)? 

Also, we didn't have any other feedback? 

Perhaps we have to accept that T is not at 1 or 5? And from the first guess we have no information about other positions? 

But let's consider the letter that can be in position 3 or 4 for T, and then L elsewhere.

It could be that there are multiple L's? But not necessarily.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""THALM"" or something? Not common.

Perhaps ""GAULT""? G, A, U, L, T -> Pattern? If L not at 4? If we place: position 1: G, 2: A, 3: U, 4: L, 5: T -> but T at 5? Forbidden? Again T at 5? So invalid.

Placed differently? ""G A U L T"" has L at 4? But in guess 3, we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So if the word has L at 4, then we would have got L(✓) for guess 3? But we got L(-) which means it is not at 4? Therefore, L cannot be at position 4.

So for ""GAULT"" placing L at 4? We cannot? So if the word is ""GAULT"" then L is at position 4? And we already know L is not at 4? So conflict. Therefore, ""GAULT"" would have L at 4? Which is forbidden? So invalid.

So what words are there?

Let's try to include new letters? For example, H, M, B, etc.

Pattern with T at position 3: then L at position 1: L A T x y? With x and y to be chosen from available letters? Avoiding excluded? And must form a word.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y

But letters to use: we need x and y? And already used L, A, T? So no problem? But the word has L, A, T, and two other letters.

Words: ""LATHE"" not, E excluded.
""LATCH"" C excluded.
""LATIN"" N excluded.
""LATEX"" E and X? E excluded? X not? Also, X available? But ""LATEX"" has E? Excluded? So no.
""LATKE"" E excluded.

Pattern L A T x y? Almost no words? 

With T at position 3 and L at position 5: x A T y L

Words: ""Battle"" not allowed? ""MATTE"" has E? ""WATTL"" not? ""Cattle"" C? ""HATTY"" has Y? But no L? ""HATTY"" is H,A,T,T,Y? No L? Not.

""BATEL"" B, A, T, E, L -> E excluded? 

"" KATAL"" not common? ""KATAL"" is not a valid English word? 

Perhaps the word is ""THALI"" but I excluded? Not.

Alternatively, T at position 4? And L at position 3: then pattern: x A L T y

Words: ""BALTI""? I excluded? ""HALTS"" S excluded? ""MALTY"" M, A, L, T, Y -> S? No, Y? ""MALTY"" is a word? Like malt whiskey? Okay, valid? But S not? Let me check: available letters, Y is available? And not excluded? Also, no S.

So ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y
Positions: 1:M, 2:A (correct), 3:L, 4:T (as required? T at position 4), 5:Y

Check the constraints:
- A at position 2: correct.
- T at position 4: not 1,5 which is allowed. (from earlier, T cannot be 1 or 5? Here, 4 is okay? Also, not 5? So allowed.)
- L at position 3: earlier we had L at position 4 in guess 3 and got L(-) but not its position? So now L at position 3? That can be new.

Also, no excluded letters: M and Y are allowed.

So this seems a valid guess.

Other possibilities: ""HALTU""? Not English.

So ""MALTY"" is a possible candidate.

We can also consider L at position 1? For example, ""LATTU""? Not word? Or ""LATHY"" not common? 

But ""MALTY"" is valid.

Since we have not many alternatives, I'll go with ""MALTY"".

Therefore, guess ""MALTY"".### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - Interpretation:  
     - A is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.  
     - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""adopt"")**:  
 - A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)  
 - Interpretation:  
   - A is present but not in the 1st position (confirms it cannot be position 1 or 3).  
   - T is present but not in the 5th position.  
   - D, O, P are **absent**.  

3. **Feedback from Guess 3 (""tails"")**:  
 - T(-), A(✓), I(x), L(-), S(x)  
 - Interpretation:  
   - A is **correctly placed in position 2** (pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
   - T is present but not in the 1st position (eliminates positions 1 and 5).  
   - L is present but not in the 4th position.  
   - I and S are **absent**.  

### Key Deductions
- **A**: Must be in position 2 (confirmed by ✓).  
- **T**:  
  - Present in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""adopt"" and ""tails"" feedback).  
  - Possible positions: **3 or 4** (since position 2 is occupied by A).  
- **L**:  
  - Present but not in position 4 (from ""tails"" feedback).  
  - Possible positions: **1, 3, or 5** (but position 3 may conflict with T).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- **Valid letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y (since L is confirmed present).  
- **Word structure**: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).  

### Constraints for the Next Guess
1. Must include **T** and **L** (both confirmed present).  
2. Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S).  
3. **T position**:
   - Cannot be 1 or 5 → must be **3 or 4**.  
4. **L position**:
   - Cannot be 4 → must be **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - Conflict: If T is in position 3, L cannot also be in position 3 → must be in **1 or 5**.  
   - If T is in position 4, L can be in **1, 3, or 5**.  
5. Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., M, H, Y, G) to gather more information.  

### Testing Possible Words
- **Scenario 1: T in position 3** → Pattern: `_ A T _ _`  
  - L must be in 1 or 5.  
  - Options:  
    - L in 1: `L A T _ _` → Valid words like ""LATCH"" (invalid, C excluded), ""LATHE"" (invalid, E excluded), or ""LATUK"" (invalid word). No common valid words found.  
    - L in 5: `_ A T _ L` → Valid words like ""BATTLE"" (invalid, E excluded), ""WATTLE"" (6 letters) → **No feasible words**.  

- **Scenario 2: T in position 4** → Pattern: `_ A _ T _`  
  - L can be in 1, 3, or 5.  
  - Options:  
    - L in 1: `L A _ T _` → No common words (e.g., ""LAITH"", I excluded).  
    - L in 3: `_ A L T _` → Valid word: **""MALTY""** (M A L T Y).  
      - Checks:  
        - M and Y untested → tests new common letters.  
        - T in position 4 (allowed).  
        - L in position 3 (allowed, as feedback only ruled out position 4).  
        - All letters valid: M, A, L, T, Y (A ✓, L and T present, M/Y new).  
        - Avoids excluded letters.  
    - L in 5: `_ A _ T L` → No common valid words (e.g., ""FAULT"" invalid, T cannot be in position 5).  

### Selected Guess: ""MALTY""
- **Why it fits**:  
  - Pattern: `M A L T Y` → **A in position 2 (✓)**, T in position 4 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed).  
  - Tests **T in position 4** and **L in position 3**, new letters **M** and **Y** for positions 1 and 5.  
  - Valid 5-letter English word (meaning: related to malt).  
  - Maximizes information gain:  
    - If M or Y are present/absent, we learn about the remaining positions.  
    - Confirms exact positions for T and L.",Guess 4: malty -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) L(✓) T(✓) Y(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - 'A' is in the word but in the wrong position (so the word contains 'A', but not in the 3rd position)
   - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word contains 'A' (but not in the 3rd position), we can use that.

 Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, N, E.

 We have 5 remaining tries.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
   - Contains the letter 'A' (but not in the 3rd position)
   - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
   - Includes other common letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, N, E. Some common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 We can try to place 'A' in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Let's consider words that have 'A' and use other common letters.

 Example: 
   - Starting with 'S'? Words like ""SAINT"" but we cannot use N (feedback said N is not in the word). 
   - Instead, how about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid R (which is excluded) and in ""SALAD"" we have L and D.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that A is present and in the wrong position. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple A's. However, we can try a word with only one A for now.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   - A in the first position: ABLE? But E is excluded. 
   - A in the second position: ""PASTA""? But we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven't tested S yet. Also, P, A, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The word ""PASTA"" has two A's? Actually, it has one A at position 2 and one at position 5? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid E (which is in ""PASTA"" at the end? No, ""PASTA"" ends with A, not E). Wait, ""PASTA"" is P-A-S-T-A. So no E. But we have to avoid R? There's no R. And no C, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 But we also want to test more new letters. We have already excluded C, R, N, E. So we can use other letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible and includes A in a position that is not 3.

 Another idea: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but we already know E is excluded and we have to avoid E. So not that.

 Let's list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

   - A in position 1: ALBUM, ALUMS, ALOUD, ALONG (but we cannot use N and G is new) -> ALONG has N? Yes, so avoid. 
   - A in position 2: ""PAINT"" -> has N and T? But N is excluded. So no.
   - A in position 4: We can try words like ""PLAIT"" but has T? and I? But we don't know about T and I. However, we must avoid N? ""PLAIT"" doesn't have N, but it has T and I. But also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E. But note: ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T.

 However, we are not sure about the other letters. We want to test more common letters.

 Another common word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in the first position and we don't know about U, D, I, O. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N, E? It doesn't have any of those. However, we know that A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. In ""AUDIO"", A is in the 1st position, which is fine. But we are not using the information about A being present? Actually, we are: we are putting A in a different position (1st) to test.

 However, we already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test that again? Actually, we do need to find its correct position. But we can also test other letters.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses, so we can try to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a different position and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Some options:

   - A in 1st: ""ADOPT"" -> A, D, O, P, T. All new letters. This is good because we test 4 new letters and A.
   - A in 2nd: ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> N is excluded, so invalid.
   - A in 4th: ""FLAIR"" -> but R is excluded. So no.
   - A in 5th: ""DELTA"" -> but E is excluded and D, E, L, T, A -> E is excluded, so no.

 So let's go with ""ADOPT"". It has A in the first position (which is not the 3rd, so that's allowed) and we test D, O, P, T.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. It doesn't say that A cannot be in the first position. So it's okay.

 However, if the secret word has A in the first position, then in our first guess (crane) the A was in the 3rd position and that was wrong, but if the word has A in the first, then we would get a '-' for A in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, A was in the 3rd position and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not there. If the word has A in the first, then in the first guess we didn't have A in the first, so we wouldn't have known. So now we are testing A in the first.

 So let's guess ""ADOPT"".

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the first. We could put it in the second, fourth, or fifth. But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" (A in second and fifth) -> P, A, S, T, A. This tests P, S, T and two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, if the word has only one A, then one of the A's in ""PASTA"" might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, but we have two and the word has only one, then one will be marked as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? But we don't know. It might complicate.

 So to avoid confusion, we can choose a word with only one A. ""ADOPT"" has one A.

 Therefore, I choose ""ADOPT"".

<guess>adopt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" (placed in a position other than 3rd to test new locations).
- Must avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", ""O"", ""D"", ""P"") to maximize information.

Selected ""adopt"" because:
- Places ""A"" in the 1st position (testing a new location).
- Introduces four new common letters: ""D"", ""O"", ""P"", ""T"".
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.
- Valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>adopt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)
Meaning:
  - A is still in the word, but not in the 1st position (since we guessed A in 1st and got '-', meaning wrong position).
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position (because we got T(-) in the 5th position).
  - D, O, P are not in the word.

Summary of known information:
1. The word contains 'A' and 'T'.
   - 'A' is not in position 1 or 3.
   - 'T' is not in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Includes 'A' and 'T'
  - Excludes: C, R, N, E, D, O, P
  - Positions for A: since not 1 or 3, possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
  - Positions for T: not 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Additionally, we have tested many consonants and vowels. The remaining letters are:
Vowels not tested: I, U (A is known, E and O excluded)
Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D, P, and we know they are excluded. 
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, S, T (T is included), V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T is in the word and A is in the word, we know two letters. The word has 3 other letters which must be from the remaining pool.

We should focus on common letters: S, L, I, M, H, G, K, etc.

Also, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we known it was misplaced. So in the actual word, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

In the second guess, A was in position 1 and misplaced? Actually, we got A(-) meaning it exists but not in 1, so now we know A is definitely not in 1 or 3. So positions 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T was in position 5 in the second guess and we got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes A and T, avoids the excluded letters, and tests possible positions.

Let me think of words that have A and T and use common letters from the remaining set.

Since A must be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,2,3,4.

Possible combinations:

- If T is in position 1: then A in 2,4,5. Words like ""T_ A _ _"" or ""T _ _ A _"" or ""T _ _ _ A""
- If T in 2: then A in 4 or 5 (since A cannot be in 2 and T simultaneously? Actually, unless the word has two same letters? But we don't know). But note: A and T could share the same position? No, they cannot. So for a given word, T cannot be in the same spot as A.

But we don't know if there are multiple T's or multiple A's. So far, we only know each is present at least once.

We should try a word that has both A and T in new positions, and introduces new letters.

For example, T in position 1 and A in position 4? Then the word pattern: T _ _ A ?

But the middle two letters must be from the remaining letters.

Example: T? Let's try to include S, L, I, etc.

Word: ""TAXIS""? But it has X and S? Also, we have A in position 2? That's if we do T, A, ...? Wait, ""TAXIS"" is T, A, X, I, S -> A is in position 2.

But note: we should avoid O? Yes, and O is excluded so safe? And no D, P, etc.

But ""TAXIS"" has A in position 2: that's a possible position for A.

But let's check if it fits the constraints:

Position for A: 2 -> allowed (since not 1,3).
Position for T: 1 -> allowed.

Now, the word includes X and I and S.

But we don't know about X, I, S. So we can test.

However, are there more common words?

Another example: ""TABLE"" -> but E is excluded? No, E is excluded so we cannot use E.

""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S -> A in 2nd? Yes. This word: T in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), and letters I, L, S which are new.

Let me check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,N,E,D,O,P? So valid.

But note: we also know that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was misplaced. Now if the word is ""TAILS"", that has A in position 2. Then in the first guess (crane) the A was in position 3: that is not the position for A (which is 2) so it should be marked as '-', which we got. Also, in the second guess (adopt) we put A in position 1 and got '-', which for ""TAILS"" that is correct because A is in position 2.

Also, T in ""TAILS"" is position 1? Then in second guess we put T in position 5? And we got T(-) which is consistent because T is in the word but not at 5.

However, we have to consider the feedback for the second guess: the T was in position 5 and marked '-', meaning the word has T but not at 5. In ""TAILS"", T is at 1, so that's fine.

But note: we also have an I and L and S. We don't know about them.

But we must include both A and T. So ""TAILS"" includes A and T.

Another possibility: ""SAINT""? But N is excluded? No, N was in the first guess and marked absent? So we cannot use N.

Also, in ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T -> but N is excluded? Yes, so invalid.

Another: ""MATCH""? But C is excluded? Yes, cannot use.

""PATHY""? Not 5 letters? 

""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y. This word: A at position 2? And T at position 4? Also, H and S and Y.

But we don't know about H, S, Y.

Compare ""HASTY"" and ""TAILS"": both are valid.

We could also consider words with A in position 4 or 5.

But since we have few information, we might want to place A in a different positions to gather more info.

However, placing A in position 4 or 5 would be a new test.

But let's look for common words.

Alternative: ""LAST"" is only 4 letters? Need 5.

""PLAST""? not word.

""BEAST""? but E is excluded? Yes.

""TOAST"" has O? O is excluded? In second guess O(x), so O is not in word? And also has S and T? Word: T, O, A, S, T -> O is excluded? So we cannot use O? Therefore, ""TOAST"" is invalid.

Back to the idea: words with T at start and A at 2nd: TA* * ?

Words: TABBY? but has B? and Y? 'TABBY': T, A, B, B, Y -> but we don't know about B and Y? Also, two B's? And A at 2.

""TALKS"": T, A, L, K, S -> avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, K, S are okay? Then A in 2nd? This is similar to ""TAILS"", but with K instead of I.

""TAILS"" vs. ""TALKS"": both are valid.

We can also consider having T in other positions.

Another possibility: T at position 4.

Words with A in position 2 and T in 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _.

For instance, ""WAIST""? W, A, I, S, T -> A in 2nd, T in 5th? Actually, WAIST: positions - W1, A2, I3, S4, T5.

But we got feedback that T is not in position 5? Because in second guess we put T in 5 and got T(-). So T cannot be in position 5? Therefore, we cannot have a word with T in 5.

So for A in 2nd and T must be in 1,3,4.

If T is in 4th, then the word would be like: _ A _ T ?

Then the last letter must be filled.

Example: ""HASTY"" as above? H1, A2, S3, T4, Y5 -> but T is in 4th? This avoids T in 5? Then it's okay? And Y in 5th? We haven't tested Y? So acceptable.

But note: we must avoid putting A in 1 or 3? So A in 2nd is okay.

Similarly, we can consider T in position 3? Then pattern: _ _ T A? (if A in 4th) or _ _ T _ A (if A in 5th). 

But let's find words.

Possible words:

1. TAILS: T at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.
   - Tests T at 1 and A at 2? Both positions are new for these letters.

2. HASTY: H at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
   - Tests A at 2 and T at 4? And avoids T at 5? Also tests S at 3 and H and Y.

3. We could also try a word that puts A at a different position? Such as 4th or 5th? For example: 

   - A at 4th: word pattern: ? ? ? A ? 
     And T must be in 1,2,3? Avoid 5.

     Example: ""QUOTA""? but contains U and O? O is excluded? So no.

     ""FATAL"": F, A, T, A, L? But has two A's? And positions: A at 2 and at 5? But we are putting A at 4? No, if we put the fourth letter as A? ""FATAL"": positions: F1, A2, T3, A4, L5 -> so A at 2 and 4? But we already know A is present? So it might have two A's? And T at 3.

     But we need to avoid excluded letters? It has F, T, L? We haven't tested F? So okay? Also, letters: F, A, T, L? And contains L? 

     However, not that common? And we have A at 2? Which we haven't tested? So not efficient.

So to maximize information, I think words like ""TAILS"" or ""HASTY"" are good.

But note: we also have to consider the vowels? We haven't tested I, U? In ""TAILS"" we test I? Which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" has A (known) and Y? So not vowel heavy.

Another candidate: ""SAULT""? S, A, U, L, T -> A at 2nd? And T at 5th? BUT T at 5th is forbidden? Because feedback says T is not in 5th? So we cannot have T at 5th? Therefore, ""SAULT"" is invalid? Because the word must have T? But if we put T at 5th, that is the wrong position? We learned that T is not in 5th? So the word must have T somewhere else? So we cannot guess a word that puts T in 5th now? Because we know it will be misplaced? So it wastes guess? Avoid any word that puts T in 5th? Similarly, we avoid A in 1 or 3.

Therefore, ""SAULT"" not allowed? Because puts T in 5th and we know that position is wrong? We learn nothing new? And wastes a chance? So we should avoid that.

Therefore, I think ""TAILS"" is a good guess because:

- Puts A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Puts T in position 1 (another new position to test).
- Uses three new common letters: I, L, S.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" doesn't put T in 5? So it's okay? But has Y? Which is less common.

Another candidate: ""TAMIS""? T, A, M, I, S? And A in 2nd? But not sure if valid word? I think ""tamis"" is a valid word? But frequency? Maybe not as common.

To be safe, I think ""TAILS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But wait: what about duplicate letters? Not an issue here because each letter in the word is different? And we haven't seen any duplicates? So the word might be all distinct? We don't know? But ""TAILS"" has distinct letters? Which is good? Because if there is a duplicate, we don't know? We'll see? So testing distinct letters will help.

So ""TAILS"" it is.

<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": A is present but not in the 3rd position. C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""adopt"": A is present but not in the 1st position. T is present but not in the 5th position. D, O, P are absent.

Key deductions:
- **A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5** (not 1 or 3).
- **T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4** (not 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.
- **Remaining letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and T while adhering to their positional constraints.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters to gather more information.
- Strong candidates: ""TAILS"" (tests A at position 2, T at position 1, and introduces I, L, S).

Reasoning for ""TAILS"":
- **A**: Position 2 is valid (not 1 or 3).
- **T**: Position 1 is valid (not 5).
- New letters: I, L, S are untested and common.
- Avoids excluded letters: No C, R, N, E, D, O, P.

This guess maximizes information gain on letter positions and coverage of new letters.

<guess>tails</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)
Guess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Guess 2: ""adopt"" -> Feedback: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)
  - A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 3: ""tails"" -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)
  - Now, A is CORRECTLY placed in the 2nd position! (A(✓))
  - T is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got T(-) for position 1).
  - L is in the word but not in the 4th position (since L(-) at position 4).
  - I and S are not in the word at all (I(x), S(x)).

Therefore, we know:
1. The word has A in the second position: _ A _ _ _
2. T is in the word, but not at positions 1,5 (from guesses 2 and 3) and also not at position 1 (from guess 3). So T cannot be in position 1 or 5. Also from guess 3, T is not in the first position? We guessed T at position 1 and got T(-) meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? So from guess 2: T not at 5? And guess 3: T not at 1? Therefore, T must be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is taken by A? So T cannot be at 2 because A is there? Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

3. L is in the word, but not at position 4? (because in ""tails"", L was at position 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position). So L is somewhere else? And since position 2 is taken by A? L can be in position 1,3,5? But wait: when we say not at position 4, we don't know about others? So possible positions for L: 1,3,5? 

Also, we have more constraints:

Excluded letters (from any feedback: x means not in the word): C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.

So excluded: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.

We also know the word contains T, A (at position 2), and L.

Therefore, the word is: _ A _ _ _ , with A at position 2? So pattern: [pos1] A [pos3] [pos4] [pos5]

And the word must include T and L, and exclude the above letters.

Available letters: we have to choose letters from the alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S? So remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y? But T is also included? And we know T is in the word? So we have T and L must be part of the word? So the word has at least three letters: T, A, L.

Moreover, T must be in position 3 or 4? Because it cannot be in 1,2,5? And L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""tails"", we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So L must be in 1,3, or 5.

If T is at position 3, then position 4 and 5 are for other letters? But also L must be in 1,3, or 5? But position 3 is T? So L cannot be at 3 if T is there? So then L must be at 1 or 5? 

If T is at position 4, then L can be at 1,3, or 5? But position 4 is T? So L cannot be at 4? But we already know L not at 4? So okay? Therefore L at 1,3, or 5.

Now, what letters are left? We have to include T and L? And we need two more letters? Or possibly one more if T and L are fixed? Actually, the word has five letters? We have A at 2? Then we need the other three positions? And we know T is one? And L is one? So the word has A(2), T(3 or 4), L(1,3,5) but depending on T's position, we can see overlap.

Case 1: T at position 3.
Then word: _ A T _ _
Then L must be at position 1 or 5? And we need one more letter? Actually, we have two positions: position 1 and 5? But L will take one? And the other position has to be another letter? But we have L? So:

Possible patterns:
- L A T ? ? -> but L at 1? Then last two? Or L at 5 -> then pattern: ? A T ? L

But position for L when T is at position 3: 
If L at 5: then word: _ A T _ L
But we need letters for position 1 and position 4? Also, the letter at position 4? And the letter at position 1?

But also, we must consider that L cannot be at position 4, but that's already taken by T? So we don't put L at 4? So no issue.

Case 2: T at position 4.
Then word: _ A _ T _
Now, L can be at 1,3, or 5? But also we need a letter at position 3? And position 1 and 5? So:

Pattern: L A ? T ? 
And L can be at 1? Then we have positions 3 and 5? Or L at 3? Then pattern: ? A L T ? ? -> no, positions: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: L, 4: T, 5: ? 
Or L at 5: ? A ? T L

So all possible.

But we also have to avoid excluded letters? So the letters must be from {B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y}? And note L is already allowed? Because L is in the word? So we can use L in the guess? But we already know L is in? So not testing new letters? So we should test new letters? But we need to use the existing information? And we might guess the word?

Therefore, we need to form words:

For case 1: T at position 3: word pattern: [L] A T [X] [Y]? But if L at 1? Then L at 1: so L A T X Y? Or if L at 5: then X A T Y L? But L at 5? So pattern: [letter] A T [letter] L

But we need both letters? Similarly for other cases.

Moreover, the word must be valid English words? And we have constraints? So let's try:

Case 1a: T at 3, L at 1? Then word: L A T * *?

What words: ""LATCH""? But C is excluded? ""LATHE""? E is excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? ""LATTE""? but T is repeated? But we guessed T only once? Actually, in ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> we have T twice? And E excluded? So no.

""LATKE""? L, A, T, K, E -> E excluded? No.

""LATUS""? L, A, T, U, S -> but S excluded? No.

Case 1b: T at 3, L at 5? Then word: * A T * L?

So pattern: {letter} A T {letter} L

Now, possible words:

- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> has two T's? Also, E excluded? No. 
- ""MATT L""? Not word. 
- ""CATTLE""? C excluded? 
- ""HATTLE""? Not common? But what is HATTLE? Not valid? 
- ""WATTLE"": W, A, T, T, L -> similar? Two T's? 

But note: we know T is one letter? And if the word has two T's? But we haven't seen that? Also, our feedback doesn't prevent having two T's? But in guess 3 ""tails"", we only had one T? And we found T is in one position? But there might be more? Maybe? 

But let's see: how about ""RATTLE""? R excluded? 

Other possibilities: With distinct letters? 

Actually, hard? 

Case 2: T at position 4? So word: _ A _ T _

Then L at position 1: L A * T *? 

Words: ""LAITH""? But I excluded? ""LATHE""? E excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? 

L at position 3: * A L T *? 

Words: ""HALTS""? H, A, L, T, S -> S excluded? ""VALTA""? Not word? ""BALTIC""? 6 letters? 

""BALTS""? Not common? ""HALTED""? E excluded? 

L at position 5? * A * T L? 

Words: ""MAUTL""? Not word? ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> yes, ""FAULT"". But L at 5? And T at 4? And letters: F and U? 

Check excluded letters: F and U are not in excluded list? Also, ""FAULT"" contains L and T, and A at position 2? Pattern: F A U L T -> positions: A at 2 (correct? yes), T at 5? But wait! From guess 2: T in position 5 was marked as wrong? Because adopt had T at 5 and got T(-). But in ""FAULT"", T is at position 5? And we have T(-) in guess 2? Meaning the word does contain T? But not at position 5? Because it was misplaced when in 5th position? Therefore, if ""FAULT"" has T at 5th, that would be incorrect? Contradiction? So ""FAULT"" would be ruled out? Because T at 5th position is forbidden? So we cannot have that word? Or if the word has T at 5th, then when we say T(-), that means there is another T? But we don't know? 

But in guess 3: tails had T at position 1 and L at 4? Then we got T(-) meaning not at 1, L(-) meaning not at 4? And A(✓) at 2? 

Now, we know A at 2, and we must place T and L? And exclude S,I? 

Let's list possible words that fit:

- A at position 2?
- T must be at 3 or 4?
- L must be at 1,3,5? But 3 cannot be if T is at 3? So depending on T.

Case: T at 3? Then word: _ A T _ _? And L at 1 or 5? 

L at 1: L A T * *? 

Words: 
- ""LATCH""? C excluded? 
- ""LATHE""? E excluded? 
- ""LATIN""? N excluded? 
- ""LATEX""? E excluded? 
- ""LATUS""? S excluded? 
- ""LATHY""? Not common? 

Or L at 5: _ A T * L? 

Words: 
- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> E? Also E excluded? And has two T's? 
- ""WATTLE""? W, A, T, T, L -> E? But ends with E? Not? ""WATTLE"" is W-A-T-T-L? But not 5th has E? No, W-A-T-T-L-E? That's 6. Actually, ""WATTLE"" is often consider 6? But sometimes abbreviated? Anyway, use 5-letter words? ""CATTLE""? C excluded? 
- ""MATTL""? Not word? 
- ""HATTY""? but no L? 
- ""PATTY""? P excluded? 
- ""BATTL""? Not word? 

So struggling? 

Case 2: T at 4? Then word: _ A _ T _? 

L at 1: L A * T *? 
Words: 
- ""LAITY""? I excluded? 
- ""LASTS""? S excluded? 
- ""LAMBS""? M, B? But S excluded? No, S is excluded? 
- ""LAVTS""? Not word. 

L at 3: * A L T *? 
Words: 
- ""HALTS""? S excluded? 
- ""MALTS""? S excluded? 
- ""BALDY""? D excluded? 
- ""GALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""MALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""VALES""? E excluded? 

Some possibility: ""HALLT""? Not word? 

L at 5: * A * T L? 
Words: 
- ""EASTL""? E and S excluded? 
- ""HAUTY""? But no L? 
- ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> but T at 5th? Which is forbidden? So invalid? But if T at 5th? And our feedback from guess 2 says T is not at position 5? So how can it be? 

Unless there is another T? And the word has T at 5th and somewhere else? Then when we put T at 5th, we get T(-) because the other T is correct? But the feedback would say one T is in the wrong position (the one at 5) and maybe the other T is in a correct position? But we got only one T in guess 2? And we put T at 5th and got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at this position? So if the word has two T's, then one T could be at another position? Then putting T at 5th, and if there is a T at another position, we get T(-) because it's not at 5th? But still, the T at 5th is wrong? And the feedback only says it is misplaced? Misplaced means it's in the word at a different position? So the word does have T? But not at 5th? Therefore, we must avoid putting T at 5th? Because it won't be correct? 

But if the word has T at 5th? Then when we put T at 5th, we would get T(✓) if it is in the correct position? Or T(-) only if it is in the word but not at that position? Which would happen if there is a T at another position? And if there is no other T? Then T at 5th should be T(✓)? But we got T(-) in guess 2? But guess 2 feedback: adopt -> T(-) means T is in the word? But not at position 5? So if the word had T only at position 5? Then we would get T(✓)? But we got T(-) which implies that T is not at 5? And also that there must be a T at another position? Because the feedback also says T is in the word? 

Therefore, the word has at least two T's? Or at least, T is in the word not at 5? So a single T word would have T not at 5? If there is only one T, then it must be at a position other than 5? And if there are multiple T's, then one is at another position? So when we put T at 5, we get T(-) because it is not at 5? Or because there is a T but not at position 5? So either way, the word does not have T at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have T at position 5.

For ""FAULT"": F A U L T: T at position 5? So it is invalid? Because T is at 5? But we know T is not at 5? So the word cannot be ""FAULT"".

So no.

Another word for L at 5 with T not at 5? But in the pattern for case 2 and L at 5: * A ? T L? Here T is at position 4? And L at position 5? So ""FAUTL"" not a word? 

Perhaps ""HAV L T""? Not. 

Let's think of words with A at 2, T and L? And no duplicates? And using available letters.

Perhaps T at position 4? And L at position 1? But what's in position 3 and 5? 

I recall that L is in the word? So we can use L? And T? And we have to choose the other two letters.

Another word? ""HALFT""? Not word? 

Perhaps T at position 3? and L at position 5? Then the word would be: for example, ""BATTL"" not word? ""MATTL"" no? 

""KATAL""? Not common? 

""TALKS"" was guessed earlier? But not that.

Back to the feedback of guess 3: ""tails"" produced T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)? 

Also, we didn't have any other feedback? 

Perhaps we have to accept that T is not at 1 or 5? And from the first guess we have no information about other positions? 

But let's consider the letter that can be in position 3 or 4 for T, and then L elsewhere.

It could be that there are multiple L's? But not necessarily.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""THALM"" or something? Not common.

Perhaps ""GAULT""? G, A, U, L, T -> Pattern? If L not at 4? If we place: position 1: G, 2: A, 3: U, 4: L, 5: T -> but T at 5? Forbidden? Again T at 5? So invalid.

Placed differently? ""G A U L T"" has L at 4? But in guess 3, we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So if the word has L at 4, then we would have got L(✓) for guess 3? But we got L(-) which means it is not at 4? Therefore, L cannot be at position 4.

So for ""GAULT"" placing L at 4? We cannot? So if the word is ""GAULT"" then L is at position 4? And we already know L is not at 4? So conflict. Therefore, ""GAULT"" would have L at 4? Which is forbidden? So invalid.

So what words are there?

Let's try to include new letters? For example, H, M, B, etc.

Pattern with T at position 3: then L at position 1: L A T x y? With x and y to be chosen from available letters? Avoiding excluded? And must form a word.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y

But letters to use: we need x and y? And already used L, A, T? So no problem? But the word has L, A, T, and two other letters.

Words: ""LATHE"" not, E excluded.
""LATCH"" C excluded.
""LATIN"" N excluded.
""LATEX"" E and X? E excluded? X not? Also, X available? But ""LATEX"" has E? Excluded? So no.
""LATKE"" E excluded.

Pattern L A T x y? Almost no words? 

With T at position 3 and L at position 5: x A T y L

Words: ""Battle"" not allowed? ""MATTE"" has E? ""WATTL"" not? ""Cattle"" C? ""HATTY"" has Y? But no L? ""HATTY"" is H,A,T,T,Y? No L? Not.

""BATEL"" B, A, T, E, L -> E excluded? 

"" KATAL"" not common? ""KATAL"" is not a valid English word? 

Perhaps the word is ""THALI"" but I excluded? Not.

Alternatively, T at position 4? And L at position 3: then pattern: x A L T y

Words: ""BALTI""? I excluded? ""HALTS"" S excluded? ""MALTY"" M, A, L, T, Y -> S? No, Y? ""MALTY"" is a word? Like malt whiskey? Okay, valid? But S not? Let me check: available letters, Y is available? And not excluded? Also, no S.

So ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y
Positions: 1:M, 2:A (correct), 3:L, 4:T (as required? T at position 4), 5:Y

Check the constraints:
- A at position 2: correct.
- T at position 4: not 1,5 which is allowed. (from earlier, T cannot be 1 or 5? Here, 4 is okay? Also, not 5? So allowed.)
- L at position 3: earlier we had L at position 4 in guess 3 and got L(-) but not its position? So now L at position 3? That can be new.

Also, no excluded letters: M and Y are allowed.

So this seems a valid guess.

Other possibilities: ""HALTU""? Not English.

So ""MALTY"" is a possible candidate.

We can also consider L at position 1? For example, ""LATTU""? Not word? Or ""LATHY"" not common? 

But ""MALTY"" is valid.

Since we have not many alternatives, I'll go with ""MALTY"".

Therefore, guess ""MALTY"".### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - Interpretation:  
     - A is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.  
     - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""adopt"")**:  
 - A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)  
 - Interpretation:  
   - A is present but not in the 1st position (confirms it cannot be position 1 or 3).  
   - T is present but not in the 5th position.  
   - D, O, P are **absent**.  

3. **Feedback from Guess 3 (""tails"")**:  
 - T(-), A(✓), I(x), L(-), S(x)  
 - Interpretation:  
   - A is **correctly placed in position 2** (pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
   - T is present but not in the 1st position (eliminates positions 1 and 5).  
   - L is present but not in the 4th position.  
   - I and S are **absent**.  

### Key Deductions
- **A**: Must be in position 2 (confirmed by ✓).  
- **T**:  
  - Present in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""adopt"" and ""tails"" feedback).  
  - Possible positions: **3 or 4** (since position 2 is occupied by A).  
- **L**:  
  - Present but not in position 4 (from ""tails"" feedback).  
  - Possible positions: **1, 3, or 5** (but position 3 may conflict with T).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- **Valid letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y (since L is confirmed present).  
- **Word structure**: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).  

### Constraints for the Next Guess
1. Must include **T** and **L** (both confirmed present).  
2. Avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S).  
3. **T position**:
   - Cannot be 1 or 5 → must be **3 or 4**.  
4. **L position**:
   - Cannot be 4 → must be **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - Conflict: If T is in position 3, L cannot also be in position 3 → must be in **1 or 5**.  
   - If T is in position 4, L can be in **1, 3, or 5**.  
5. Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., M, H, Y, G) to gather more information.  

### Testing Possible Words
- **Scenario 1: T in position 3** → Pattern: `_ A T _ _`  
  - L must be in 1 or 5.  
  - Options:  
    - L in 1: `L A T _ _` → Valid words like ""LATCH"" (invalid, C excluded), ""LATHE"" (invalid, E excluded), or ""LATUK"" (invalid word). No common valid words found.  
    - L in 5: `_ A T _ L` → Valid words like ""BATTLE"" (invalid, E excluded), ""WATTLE"" (6 letters) → **No feasible words**.  

- **Scenario 2: T in position 4** → Pattern: `_ A _ T _`  
  - L can be in 1, 3, or 5.  
  - Options:  
    - L in 1: `L A _ T _` → No common words (e.g., ""LAITH"", I excluded).  
    - L in 3: `_ A L T _` → Valid word: **""MALTY""** (M A L T Y).  
      - Checks:  
        - M and Y untested → tests new common letters.  
        - T in position 4 (allowed).  
        - L in position 3 (allowed, as feedback only ruled out position 4).  
        - All letters valid: M, A, L, T, Y (A ✓, L and T present, M/Y new).  
        - Avoids excluded letters.  
    - L in 5: `_ A _ T L` → No common valid words (e.g., ""FAULT"" invalid, T cannot be in position 5).  

### Selected Guess: ""MALTY""
- **Why it fits**:  
  - Pattern: `M A L T Y` → **A in position 2 (✓)**, T in position 4 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed).  
  - Tests **T in position 4** and **L in position 3**, new letters **M** and **Y** for positions 1 and 5.  
  - Valid 5-letter English word (meaning: related to malt).  
  - Maximizes information gain:  
    - If M or Y are present/absent, we learn about the remaining positions.  
    - Confirms exact positions for T and L.

Some common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\n We can try to place \'A\' in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).\n\n Let\'s consider words that have \'A\' and use other common letters.\n\n Example: \n   - Starting with \'S\'? Words like ""SAINT"" but we cannot use N (feedback said N is not in the word). \n   - Instead, how about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have to avoid R (which is excluded) and in ""SALAD"" we have L and D.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that A is present and in the wrong position. It doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple A\'s. However, we can try a word with only one A for now.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n   - A in the first position: ABLE? But E is excluded. \n   - A in the second position: ""PASTA""? But we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven\'t tested S yet. Also, P, A, S, T. But note: we have two A\'s? The word ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? Actually, it has one A at position 2 and one at position 5? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s.\n\n However, we must avoid E (which is in ""PASTA"" at the end? No, ""PASTA"" ends with A, not E). Wait, ""PASTA"" is P-A-S-T-A. So no E. But we have to avoid R? There\'s no R. And no C, N, E. So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we also want to test more new letters. We have already excluded C, R, N, E. So we can use other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible and includes A in a position that is not 3.\n\n Another idea: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but we already know E is excluded and we have to avoid E. So not that.\n\n Let\'s list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:\n\n   - A in position 1: ALBUM, ALUMS, ALOUD, ALONG (but we cannot use N and G is new) -> ALONG has N? Yes, so avoid. \n   - A in position 2: ""PAINT"" -> has N and T? But N is excluded. So no.\n   - A in position 4: We can try words like ""PLAIT"" but has T? and I? But we don\'t know about T and I. However, we must avoid N? ""PLAIT"" doesn\'t have N, but it has T and I. But also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E. But note: ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T.\n\n However, we are not sure about the other letters. We want to test more common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in the first position and we don\'t know about U, D, I, O. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N, E? It doesn\'t have any of those. However, we know that A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. In ""AUDIO"", A is in the 1st position, which is fine. But we are not using the information about A being present? Actually, we are: we are putting A in a different position (1st) to test.\n\n However, we already know A is in the word, so we don\'t need to test that again? Actually, we do need to find its correct position. But we can also test other letters.\n\n But note: we have 5 more guesses, so we can try to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a different position and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Some options:\n\n   - A in 1st: ""ADOPT"" -> A, D, O, P, T. All new letters. This is good because we test 4 new letters and A.\n   - A in 2nd: ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> N is excluded, so invalid.\n   - A in 4th: ""FLAIR"" -> but R is excluded. So no.\n   - A in 5th: ""DELTA"" -> but E is excluded and D, E, L, T, A -> E is excluded, so no.\n\n So let\'s go with ""ADOPT"". It has A in the first position (which is not the 3rd, so that\'s allowed) and we test D, O, P, T.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. It doesn\'t say that A cannot be in the first position. So it\'s okay.\n\n However, if the secret word has A in the first position, then in our first guess (crane) the A was in the 3rd position and that was wrong, but if the word has A in the first, then we would get a \'-\' for A in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, A was in the 3rd position and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not there. If the word has A in the first, then in the first guess we didn\'t have A in the first, so we wouldn\'t have known. So now we are testing A in the first.\n\n So let\'s guess ""ADOPT"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in the first. We could put it in the second, fourth, or fifth. But we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another option: ""PASTA"" (A in second and fifth) -> P, A, S, T, A. This tests P, S, T and two A\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, if the word has only one A, then one of the A\'s in ""PASTA"" might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, but we have two and the word has only one, then one will be marked as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? But we don\'t know. It might complicate.\n\n So to avoid confusion, we can choose a word with only one A. ""ADOPT"" has one A.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""ADOPT"".\n\n<guess>adopt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is present in the secret word but not in the 3rd position.\n- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include ""A"" (placed in a position other than 3rd to test new locations).\n- Must avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", ""E"".\n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., ""S"", ""T"", ""L"", ""O"", ""D"", ""P"") to maximize information.\n\nSelected ""adopt"" because:\n- Places ""A"" in the 1st position (testing a new location).\n- Introduces four new common letters: ""D"", ""O"", ""P"", ""T"".\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>adopt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""adopt"" -> A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)\nMeaning:\n  - A is still in the word, but not in the 1st position (since we guessed A in 1st and got \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position (because we got T(-) in the 5th position).\n  - D, O, P are not in the word.\n\nSummary of known information:\n1. The word contains \'A\' and \'T\'.\n   - \'A\' is not in position 1 or 3.\n   - \'T\' is not in position 5.\n2. The word does NOT contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Includes \'A\' and \'T\'\n  - Excludes: C, R, N, E, D, O, P\n  - Positions for A: since not 1 or 3, possible positions: 2, 4, 5.\n  - Positions for T: not 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAdditionally, we have tested many consonants and vowels. The remaining letters are:\nVowels not tested: I, U (A is known, E and O excluded)\nConsonants: We have tested C, R, N, D, P, and we know they are excluded. \nRemaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, S, T (T is included), V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince T is in the word and A is in the word, we know two letters. The word has 3 other letters which must be from the remaining pool.\n\nWe should focus on common letters: S, L, I, M, H, G, K, etc.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we known it was misplaced. So in the actual word, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn the second guess, A was in position 1 and misplaced? Actually, we got A(-) meaning it exists but not in 1, so now we know A is definitely not in 1 or 3. So positions 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, T was in position 5 in the second guess and we got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that includes A and T, avoids the excluded letters, and tests possible positions.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and T and use common letters from the remaining set.\n\nSince A must be in 2,4,5 and T in 1,2,3,4.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- If T is in position 1: then A in 2,4,5. Words like ""T_ A _ _"" or ""T _ _ A _"" or ""T _ _ _ A""\n- If T in 2: then A in 4 or 5 (since A cannot be in 2 and T simultaneously? Actually, unless the word has two same letters? But we don\'t know). But note: A and T could share the same position? No, they cannot. So for a given word, T cannot be in the same spot as A.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are multiple T\'s or multiple A\'s. So far, we only know each is present at least once.\n\nWe should try a word that has both A and T in new positions, and introduces new letters.\n\nFor example, T in position 1 and A in position 4? Then the word pattern: T _ _ A ?\n\nBut the middle two letters must be from the remaining letters.\n\nExample: T? Let\'s try to include S, L, I, etc.\n\nWord: ""TAXIS""? But it has X and S? Also, we have A in position 2? That\'s if we do T, A, ...? Wait, ""TAXIS"" is T, A, X, I, S -> A is in position 2.\n\nBut note: we should avoid O? Yes, and O is excluded so safe? And no D, P, etc.\n\nBut ""TAXIS"" has A in position 2: that\'s a possible position for A.\n\nBut let\'s check if it fits the constraints:\n\nPosition for A: 2 -> allowed (since not 1,3).\nPosition for T: 1 -> allowed.\n\nNow, the word includes X and I and S.\n\nBut we don\'t know about X, I, S. So we can test.\n\nHowever, are there more common words?\n\nAnother example: ""TABLE"" -> but E is excluded? No, E is excluded so we cannot use E.\n\n""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S -> A in 2nd? Yes. This word: T in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), and letters I, L, S which are new.\n\nLet me check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,N,E,D,O,P? So valid.\n\nBut note: we also know that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was misplaced. Now if the word is ""TAILS"", that has A in position 2. Then in the first guess (crane) the A was in position 3: that is not the position for A (which is 2) so it should be marked as \'-\', which we got. Also, in the second guess (adopt) we put A in position 1 and got \'-\', which for ""TAILS"" that is correct because A is in position 2.\n\nAlso, T in ""TAILS"" is position 1? Then in second guess we put T in position 5? And we got T(-) which is consistent because T is in the word but not at 5.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the feedback for the second guess: the T was in position 5 and marked \'-\', meaning the word has T but not at 5. In ""TAILS"", T is at 1, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut note: we also have an I and L and S. We don\'t know about them.\n\nBut we must include both A and T. So ""TAILS"" includes A and T.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SAINT""? But N is excluded? No, N was in the first guess and marked absent? So we cannot use N.\n\nAlso, in ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T -> but N is excluded? Yes, so invalid.\n\nAnother: ""MATCH""? But C is excluded? Yes, cannot use.\n\n""PATHY""? Not 5 letters? \n\n""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y. This word: A at position 2? And T at position 4? Also, H and S and Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H, S, Y.\n\nCompare ""HASTY"" and ""TAILS"": both are valid.\n\nWe could also consider words with A in position 4 or 5.\n\nBut since we have few information, we might want to place A in a different positions to gather more info.\n\nHowever, placing A in position 4 or 5 would be a new test.\n\nBut let\'s look for common words.\n\nAlternative: ""LAST"" is only 4 letters? Need 5.\n\n""PLAST""? not word.\n\n""BEAST""? but E is excluded? Yes.\n\n""TOAST"" has O? O is excluded? In second guess O(x), so O is not in word? And also has S and T? Word: T, O, A, S, T -> O is excluded? So we cannot use O? Therefore, ""TOAST"" is invalid.\n\nBack to the idea: words with T at start and A at 2nd: TA* * ?\n\nWords: TABBY? but has B? and Y? \'TABBY\': T, A, B, B, Y -> but we don\'t know about B and Y? Also, two B\'s? And A at 2.\n\n""TALKS"": T, A, L, K, S -> avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, K, S are okay? Then A in 2nd? This is similar to ""TAILS"", but with K instead of I.\n\n""TAILS"" vs. ""TALKS"": both are valid.\n\nWe can also consider having T in other positions.\n\nAnother possibility: T at position 4.\n\nWords with A in position 2 and T in 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _.\n\nFor instance, ""WAIST""? W, A, I, S, T -> A in 2nd, T in 5th? Actually, WAIST: positions - W1, A2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nBut we got feedback that T is not in position 5? Because in second guess we put T in 5 and got T(-). So T cannot be in position 5? Therefore, we cannot have a word with T in 5.\n\nSo for A in 2nd and T must be in 1,3,4.\n\nIf T is in 4th, then the word would be like: _ A _ T ?\n\nThen the last letter must be filled.\n\nExample: ""HASTY"" as above? H1, A2, S3, T4, Y5 -> but T is in 4th? This avoids T in 5? Then it\'s okay? And Y in 5th? We haven\'t tested Y? So acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must avoid putting A in 1 or 3? So A in 2nd is okay.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider T in position 3? Then pattern: _ _ T A? (if A in 4th) or _ _ T _ A (if A in 5th). \n\nBut let\'s find words.\n\nPossible words:\n\n1. TAILS: T at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n   - Tests T at 1 and A at 2? Both positions are new for these letters.\n\n2. HASTY: H at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n   - Tests A at 2 and T at 4? And avoids T at 5? Also tests S at 3 and H and Y.\n\n3. We could also try a word that puts A at a different position? Such as 4th or 5th? For example: \n\n   - A at 4th: word pattern: ? ? ? A ? \n     And T must be in 1,2,3? Avoid 5.\n\n     Example: ""QUOTA""? but contains U and O? O is excluded? So no.\n\n     ""FATAL"": F, A, T, A, L? But has two A\'s? And positions: A at 2 and at 5? But we are putting A at 4? No, if we put the fourth letter as A? ""FATAL"": positions: F1, A2, T3, A4, L5 -> so A at 2 and 4? But we already know A is present? So it might have two A\'s? And T at 3.\n\n     But we need to avoid excluded letters? It has F, T, L? We haven\'t tested F? So okay? Also, letters: F, A, T, L? And contains L? \n\n     However, not that common? And we have A at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? So not efficient.\n\nSo to maximize information, I think words like ""TAILS"" or ""HASTY"" are good.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider the vowels? We haven\'t tested I, U? In ""TAILS"" we test I? Which is a vowel.\n\nSimilarly, ""HASTY"" has A (known) and Y? So not vowel heavy.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SAULT""? S, A, U, L, T -> A at 2nd? And T at 5th? BUT T at 5th is forbidden? Because feedback says T is not in 5th? So we cannot have T at 5th? Therefore, ""SAULT"" is invalid? Because the word must have T? But if we put T at 5th, that is the wrong position? We learned that T is not in 5th? So the word must have T somewhere else? So we cannot guess a word that puts T in 5th now? Because we know it will be misplaced? So it wastes guess? Avoid any word that puts T in 5th? Similarly, we avoid A in 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, ""SAULT"" not allowed? Because puts T in 5th and we know that position is wrong? We learn nothing new? And wastes a chance? So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, I think ""TAILS"" is a good guess because:\n\n- Puts A in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Puts T in position 1 (another new position to test).\n- Uses three new common letters: I, L, S.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""HASTY"" doesn\'t put T in 5? So it\'s okay? But has Y? Which is less common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TAMIS""? T, A, M, I, S? And A in 2nd? But not sure if valid word? I think ""tamis"" is a valid word? But frequency? Maybe not as common.\n\nTo be safe, I think ""TAILS"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TAILS"".\n\nBut wait: what about duplicate letters? Not an issue here because each letter in the word is different? And we haven\'t seen any duplicates? So the word might be all distinct? We don\'t know? But ""TAILS"" has distinct letters? Which is good? Because if there is a duplicate, we don\'t know? We\'ll see? So testing distinct letters will help.\n\nSo ""TAILS"" it is.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From ""crane"": A is present but not in the 3rd position. C, R, N, E are absent.\n- From ""adopt"": A is present but not in the 1st position. T is present but not in the 5th position. D, O, P are absent.\n\nKey deductions:\n- **A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5** (not 1 or 3).\n- **T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4** (not 5).\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, D, O, P.\n- **Remaining letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, etc.) and vowels (I, U).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and T while adhering to their positional constraints.\n- Should prioritize testing new common letters to gather more information.\n- Strong candidates: ""TAILS"" (tests A at position 2, T at position 1, and introduces I, L, S).\n\nReasoning for ""TAILS"":\n- **A**: Position 2 is valid (not 1 or 3).\n- **T**: Position 1 is valid (not 5).\n- New letters: I, L, S are untested and common.\n- Avoids excluded letters: No C, R, N, E, D, O, P.\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain on letter positions and coverage of new letters.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n  - A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n\nGuess 2: ""adopt"" -> Feedback: A(-) D(x) O(x) P(x) T(-)\n  - A is in the word but not in the 1st position.\n  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 3: ""tails"" -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)\n  - Now, A is CORRECTLY placed in the 2nd position! (A(✓))\n  - T is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got T(-) for position 1).\n  - L is in the word but not in the 4th position (since L(-) at position 4).\n  - I and S are not in the word at all (I(x), S(x)).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n1. The word has A in the second position: _ A _ _ _\n2. T is in the word, but not at positions 1,5 (from guesses 2 and 3) and also not at position 1 (from guess 3). So T cannot be in position 1 or 5. Also from guess 3, T is not in the first position? We guessed T at position 1 and got T(-) meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? So from guess 2: T not at 5? And guess 3: T not at 1? Therefore, T must be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is taken by A? So T cannot be at 2 because A is there? Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.\n\n3. L is in the word, but not at position 4? (because in ""tails"", L was at position 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position). So L is somewhere else? And since position 2 is taken by A? L can be in position 1,3,5? But wait: when we say not at position 4, we don\'t know about others? So possible positions for L: 1,3,5? \n\nAlso, we have more constraints:\n\nExcluded letters (from any feedback: x means not in the word): C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.\n\nSo excluded: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S.\n\nWe also know the word contains T, A (at position 2), and L.\n\nTherefore, the word is: _ A _ _ _ , with A at position 2? So pattern: [pos1] A [pos3] [pos4] [pos5]\n\nAnd the word must include T and L, and exclude the above letters.\n\nAvailable letters: we have to choose letters from the alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S? So remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y? But T is also included? And we know T is in the word? So we have T and L must be part of the word? So the word has at least three letters: T, A, L.\n\nMoreover, T must be in position 3 or 4? Because it cannot be in 1,2,5? And L cannot be in position 4? Because in ""tails"", we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So L must be in 1,3, or 5.\n\nIf T is at position 3, then position 4 and 5 are for other letters? But also L must be in 1,3, or 5? But position 3 is T? So L cannot be at 3 if T is there? So then L must be at 1 or 5? \n\nIf T is at position 4, then L can be at 1,3, or 5? But position 4 is T? So L cannot be at 4? But we already know L not at 4? So okay? Therefore L at 1,3, or 5.\n\nNow, what letters are left? We have to include T and L? And we need two more letters? Or possibly one more if T and L are fixed? Actually, the word has five letters? We have A at 2? Then we need the other three positions? And we know T is one? And L is one? So the word has A(2), T(3 or 4), L(1,3,5) but depending on T\'s position, we can see overlap.\n\nCase 1: T at position 3.\nThen word: _ A T _ _\nThen L must be at position 1 or 5? And we need one more letter? Actually, we have two positions: position 1 and 5? But L will take one? And the other position has to be another letter? But we have L? So:\n\nPossible patterns:\n- L A T ? ? -> but L at 1? Then last two? Or L at 5 -> then pattern: ? A T ? L\n\nBut position for L when T is at position 3: \nIf L at 5: then word: _ A T _ L\nBut we need letters for position 1 and position 4? Also, the letter at position 4? And the letter at position 1?\n\nBut also, we must consider that L cannot be at position 4, but that\'s already taken by T? So we don\'t put L at 4? So no issue.\n\nCase 2: T at position 4.\nThen word: _ A _ T _\nNow, L can be at 1,3, or 5? But also we need a letter at position 3? And position 1 and 5? So:\n\nPattern: L A ? T ? \nAnd L can be at 1? Then we have positions 3 and 5? Or L at 3? Then pattern: ? A L T ? ? -> no, positions: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: L, 4: T, 5: ? \nOr L at 5: ? A ? T L\n\nSo all possible.\n\nBut we also have to avoid excluded letters? So the letters must be from {B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y}? And note L is already allowed? Because L is in the word? So we can use L in the guess? But we already know L is in? So not testing new letters? So we should test new letters? But we need to use the existing information? And we might guess the word?\n\nTherefore, we need to form words:\n\nFor case 1: T at position 3: word pattern: [L] A T [X] [Y]? But if L at 1? Then L at 1: so L A T X Y? Or if L at 5: then X A T Y L? But L at 5? So pattern: [letter] A T [letter] L\n\nBut we need both letters? Similarly for other cases.\n\nMoreover, the word must be valid English words? And we have constraints? So let\'s try:\n\nCase 1a: T at 3, L at 1? Then word: L A T * *?\n\nWhat words: ""LATCH""? But C is excluded? ""LATHE""? E is excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? ""LATTE""? but T is repeated? But we guessed T only once? Actually, in ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> we have T twice? And E excluded? So no.\n\n""LATKE""? L, A, T, K, E -> E excluded? No.\n\n""LATUS""? L, A, T, U, S -> but S excluded? No.\n\nCase 1b: T at 3, L at 5? Then word: * A T * L?\n\nSo pattern: {letter} A T {letter} L\n\nNow, possible words:\n\n- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> has two T\'s? Also, E excluded? No. \n- ""MATT L""? Not word. \n- ""CATTLE""? C excluded? \n- ""HATTLE""? Not common? But what is HATTLE? Not valid? \n- ""WATTLE"": W, A, T, T, L -> similar? Two T\'s? \n\nBut note: we know T is one letter? And if the word has two T\'s? But we haven\'t seen that? Also, our feedback doesn\'t prevent having two T\'s? But in guess 3 ""tails"", we only had one T? And we found T is in one position? But there might be more? Maybe? \n\nBut let\'s see: how about ""RATTLE""? R excluded? \n\nOther possibilities: With distinct letters? \n\nActually, hard? \n\nCase 2: T at position 4? So word: _ A _ T _\n\nThen L at position 1: L A * T *? \n\nWords: ""LAITH""? But I excluded? ""LATHE""? E excluded? ""LATER""? E excluded? \n\nL at position 3: * A L T *? \n\nWords: ""HALTS""? H, A, L, T, S -> S excluded? ""VALTA""? Not word? ""BALTIC""? 6 letters? \n\n""BALTS""? Not common? ""HALTED""? E excluded? \n\nL at position 5? * A * T L? \n\nWords: ""MAUTL""? Not word? ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> yes, ""FAULT"". But L at 5? And T at 4? And letters: F and U? \n\nCheck excluded letters: F and U are not in excluded list? Also, ""FAULT"" contains L and T, and A at position 2? Pattern: F A U L T -> positions: A at 2 (correct? yes), T at 5? But wait! From guess 2: T in position 5 was marked as wrong? Because adopt had T at 5 and got T(-). But in ""FAULT"", T is at position 5? And we have T(-) in guess 2? Meaning the word does contain T? But not at position 5? Because it was misplaced when in 5th position? Therefore, if ""FAULT"" has T at 5th, that would be incorrect? Contradiction? So ""FAULT"" would be ruled out? Because T at 5th position is forbidden? So we cannot have that word? Or if the word has T at 5th, then when we say T(-), that means there is another T? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut in guess 3: tails had T at position 1 and L at 4? Then we got T(-) meaning not at 1, L(-) meaning not at 4? And A(✓) at 2? \n\nNow, we know A at 2, and we must place T and L? And exclude S,I? \n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit:\n\n- A at position 2?\n- T must be at 3 or 4?\n- L must be at 1,3,5? But 3 cannot be if T is at 3? So depending on T.\n\nCase: T at 3? Then word: _ A T _ _? And L at 1 or 5? \n\nL at 1: L A T * *? \n\nWords: \n- ""LATCH""? C excluded? \n- ""LATHE""? E excluded? \n- ""LATIN""? N excluded? \n- ""LATEX""? E excluded? \n- ""LATUS""? S excluded? \n- ""LATHY""? Not common? \n\nOr L at 5: _ A T * L? \n\nWords: \n- ""BATTLE""? B, A, T, T, L -> E? Also E excluded? And has two T\'s? \n- ""WATTLE""? W, A, T, T, L -> E? But ends with E? Not? ""WATTLE"" is W-A-T-T-L? But not 5th has E? No, W-A-T-T-L-E? That\'s 6. Actually, ""WATTLE"" is often consider 6? But sometimes abbreviated? Anyway, use 5-letter words? ""CATTLE""? C excluded? \n- ""MATTL""? Not word? \n- ""HATTY""? but no L? \n- ""PATTY""? P excluded? \n- ""BATTL""? Not word? \n\nSo struggling? \n\nCase 2: T at 4? Then word: _ A _ T _? \n\nL at 1: L A * T *? \nWords: \n- ""LAITY""? I excluded? \n- ""LASTS""? S excluded? \n- ""LAMBS""? M, B? But S excluded? No, S is excluded? \n- ""LAVTS""? Not word. \n\nL at 3: * A L T *? \nWords: \n- ""HALTS""? S excluded? \n- ""MALTS""? S excluded? \n- ""BALDY""? D excluded? \n- ""GALT""? 4 letters? \n- ""MALT""? 4 letters? \n- ""VALES""? E excluded? \n\nSome possibility: ""HALLT""? Not word? \n\nL at 5: * A * T L? \nWords: \n- ""EASTL""? E and S excluded? \n- ""HAUTY""? But no L? \n- ""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> but T at 5th? Which is forbidden? So invalid? But if T at 5th? And our feedback from guess 2 says T is not at position 5? So how can it be? \n\nUnless there is another T? And the word has T at 5th and somewhere else? Then when we put T at 5th, we get T(-) because the other T is correct? But the feedback would say one T is in the wrong position (the one at 5) and maybe the other T is in a correct position? But we got only one T in guess 2? And we put T at 5th and got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at this position? So if the word has two T\'s, then one T could be at another position? Then putting T at 5th, and if there is a T at another position, we get T(-) because it\'s not at 5th? But still, the T at 5th is wrong? And the feedback only says it is misplaced? Misplaced means it\'s in the word at a different position? So the word does have T? But not at 5th? Therefore, we must avoid putting T at 5th? Because it won\'t be correct? \n\nBut if the word has T at 5th? Then when we put T at 5th, we would get T(✓) if it is in the correct position? Or T(-) only if it is in the word but not at that position? Which would happen if there is a T at another position? And if there is no other T? Then T at 5th should be T(✓)? But we got T(-) in guess 2? But guess 2 feedback: adopt -> T(-) means T is in the word? But not at position 5? So if the word had T only at position 5? Then we would get T(✓)? But we got T(-) which implies that T is not at 5? And also that there must be a T at another position? Because the feedback also says T is in the word? \n\nTherefore, the word has at least two T\'s? Or at least, T is in the word not at 5? So a single T word would have T not at 5? If there is only one T, then it must be at a position other than 5? And if there are multiple T\'s, then one is at another position? So when we put T at 5, we get T(-) because it is not at 5? Or because there is a T but not at position 5? So either way, the word does not have T at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have T at position 5.\n\nFor ""FAULT"": F A U L T: T at position 5? So it is invalid? Because T is at 5? But we know T is not at 5? So the word cannot be ""FAULT"".\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother word for L at 5 with T not at 5? But in the pattern for case 2 and L at 5: * A ? T L? Here T is at position 4? And L at position 5? So ""FAUTL"" not a word? \n\nPerhaps ""HAV L T""? Not. \n\nLet\'s think of words with A at 2, T and L? And no duplicates? And using available letters.\n\nPerhaps T at position 4? And L at position 1? But what\'s in position 3 and 5? \n\nI recall that L is in the word? So we can use L? And T? And we have to choose the other two letters.\n\nAnother word? ""HALFT""? Not word? \n\nPerhaps T at position 3? and L at position 5? Then the word would be: for example, ""BATTL"" not word? ""MATTL"" no? \n\n""KATAL""? Not common? \n\n""TALKS"" was guessed earlier? But not that.\n\nBack to the feedback of guess 3: ""tails"" produced T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(x)? \n\nAlso, we didn\'t have any other feedback? \n\nPerhaps we have to accept that T is not at 1 or 5? And from the first guess we have no information about other positions? \n\nBut let\'s consider the letter that can be in position 3 or 4 for T, and then L elsewhere.\n\nIt could be that there are multiple L\'s? But not necessarily.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""THALM"" or something? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""GAULT""? G, A, U, L, T -> Pattern? If L not at 4? If we place: position 1: G, 2: A, 3: U, 4: L, 5: T -> but T at 5? Forbidden? Again T at 5? So invalid.\n\nPlaced differently? ""G A U L T"" has L at 4? But in guess 3, we put L at 4 and got L(-) meaning wrong position? So if the word has L at 4, then we would have got L(✓) for guess 3? But we got L(-) which means it is not at 4? Therefore, L cannot be at position 4.\n\nSo for ""GAULT"" placing L at 4? We cannot? So if the word is ""GAULT"" then L is at position 4? And we already know L is not at 4? So conflict. Therefore, ""GAULT"" would have L at 4? Which is forbidden? So invalid.\n\nSo what words are there?\n\nLet\'s try to include new letters? For example, H, M, B, etc.\n\nPattern with T at position 3: then L at position 1: L A T x y? With x and y to be chosen from available letters? Avoiding excluded? And must form a word.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Y\n\nBut letters to use: we need x and y? And already used L, A, T? So no problem? But the word has L, A, T, and two other letters.\n\nWords: ""LATHE"" not, E excluded.\n""LATCH"" C excluded.\n""LATIN"" N excluded.\n""LATEX"" E and X? E excluded? X not? Also, X available? But ""LATEX"" has E? Excluded? So no.\n""LATKE"" E excluded.\n\nPattern L A T x y? Almost no words? \n\nWith T at position 3 and L at position 5: x A T y L\n\nWords: ""Battle"" not allowed? ""MATTE"" has E? ""WATTL"" not? ""Cattle"" C? ""HATTY"" has Y? But no L? ""HATTY"" is H,A,T,T,Y? No L? Not.\n\n""BATEL"" B, A, T, E, L -> E excluded? \n\n"" KATAL"" not common? ""KATAL"" is not a valid English word? \n\nPerhaps the word is ""THALI"" but I excluded? Not.\n\nAlternatively, T at position 4? And L at position 3: then pattern: x A L T y\n\nWords: ""BALTI""? I excluded? ""HALTS"" S excluded? ""MALTY"" M, A, L, T, Y -> S? No, Y? ""MALTY"" is a word? Like malt whiskey? Okay, valid? But S not? Let me check: available letters, Y is available? And not excluded? Also, no S.\n\nSo ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y\nPositions: 1:M, 2:A (correct), 3:L, 4:T (as required? T at position 4), 5:Y\n\nCheck the constraints:\n- A at position 2: correct.\n- T at position 4: not 1,5 which is allowed. (from earlier, T cannot be 1 or 5? Here, 4 is okay? Also, not 5? So allowed.)\n- L at position 3: earlier we had L at position 4 in guess 3 and got L(-) but not its position? So now L at position 3?

We have feedback from the fourth guess: ""malty"" -> M(x) A(✓) L(✓) T(✓) Y(x)
This means:
- A, L, T are in the correct positions: so positions 2, 3, 4 are A, L, T respectively? 
  Specifically: 
    - A is correct at position 2 (which we already knew from guess 3)
    - L is correct at position 3? Because we put L at position 3 and got L(✓)
    - T is correct at position 4? Because we put T at position 4 and got T(✓)
- M and Y are not in the word? So M(x) and Y(x)

Therefore, the word so far is: _ A L T _

We know the first and last letters are missing? And we have to find them.

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- The word contains A, L, T (and we know their positions: A at 2, L at 3, T at 4)
- The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S, M, Y (from all the x's)

We also know that the last letter (position 5) is missing? And the first letter (position 1) is missing.

We need to find a letter for position 1 and position 5? But note: the word has 5 letters? So we have:

Position 1: unknown letter, say X
Position 2: A
Position 3: L
Position 4: T
Position 5: unknown letter, say Z

So the word is: X A L T Z

Now, X and Z must be letters not in the excluded list? And must form a valid English word.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S, M, Y

So available letters: B, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z? But note: we have to use English words? And we must avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words? 

Common words: ""SALT"" is 4 letters? ""HALT"" is 4? 

We need 5-letter words ending with ALT? But we have A L T fixed in positions 2,3,4? So the word is X A L T Z.

What are some words? 

- ""HALTS""? But S is excluded? And also, it would be H A L T S? But S is excluded? So no.
- ""MALTS""? M and S excluded? No.
- ""BALTY""? But Y excluded? And we have Y(x) in guess 4? So no.
- ""FALTS""? Not a word? 
- ""GALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""WALTY""? Not common? 

Another idea: ""EXALT""? E and X? But E is excluded? And X is a letter? But E is in excluded list? So no.

""BASALT"" is 6 letters? 

Perhaps ""VAPLT""? Not a word.

Wait, what about ""DEALT""? D and E excluded? 

""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> but we have positions: F at 1, A at 2, U at 3? But we have L at 3? So not? In ""FAULT"", it's F-A-U-L-T? So positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T? But in our case, position 3 must be L? And position 4 must be T? So ""FAULT"" has L at 4 and T at 5? But we have L at 3 and T at 4? So not matching.

We need a word with the pattern _ A L T _

So the only possibility is that the word has A at 2, L at 3, T at 4? Then the last letter is Z? And first letter X.

Possible words: 

- ""HALTA""? Not English? 
- ""BALTI""? I excluded? 
- ""GALTY""? Y excluded? 
- ""KALTI""? I excluded? 

Wait, is ""SALTO"" a word? But S and O excluded? 

Another: ""WALTZ""? W, A, L, T, Z? But Z is the last letter? And W at first? 

""WALTZ"" is a valid word? Meaning a dance? 

Check the letters: 
- W: not excluded? 
- A: at position 2? 
- L: at position 3? 
- T: at position 4? 
- Z: at position 5? 

And Z is not in the excluded list? Excluded are C,R,N,E,D,O,P,I,S,M,Y? Z is not in that list? So it's allowed.

Therefore, ""WALTZ"" is a candidate.

Are there others? 

""FALTS""? Not word? 

""VALTS""? Not common? 

So ""WALTZ"" seems the only common word? 

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: W -> not excluded? 
- Position 5: Z -> not excluded? 
- The word is ""WALTZ"": W-A-L-T-Z.

So we can guess ""WALTZ"".

But note: we have not used Z before? So it's a new letter? And we are testing it? But we are also trying to solve? 

Since we have only one guess left? Or we have two? We started with 6 tries? We are at guess 5? So we have two more? But if we guess correctly, we win? 

But we are not sure? But ""WALTZ"" fits all the constraints? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more common letters? But we have only two positions? And we know the pattern? So we can guess ""WALTZ"" directly? 

But to be safe? We can think if there is any other possibility? 

Another word: ""HALVA""? But H A L V A? Then positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A? But we need T at position 4? But here T is missing? And we know T is in the word? So no.

""TALMA""? But T at 1? But we have A at 2? And L at 3? Then T at 1? But we have T at 4? And also, T at 1? But we know T is at position 4? So it cannot be at 1? Also, in ""TALMA"": T, A, L, M, A -> M is excluded? And T at 1? But we have T at 4? So it would have two T's? But we don't know? However, in this case, we have M excluded? So invalid.

Therefore, ""WALTZ"" is the only common word I can think of.

So I'll go with ""WALTZ"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is present but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""adopt""**  
  Feedback: A(-), D(x), O(x), P(x), T(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is present but not in position 1.  
  - T is present but not in position 5.  
  - D, O, P are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""tails""**  
  Feedback: T(-), A(✓), I(x), L(-), S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is **correctly placed in position 2** (word pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
  - T is present but not in position 1.  
  - L is present but not in position 4.  
  - I and S are absent.  

- **Guess 4: ""malty""**  
  Feedback: M(x), A(✓), L(✓), T(✓), Y(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A, L, T are **correctly placed in positions 2, 3, and 4** (word pattern: `_ A L T _`).  
  - M and Y are absent.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
   - Position 2: A (✓)  
   - Position 3: L (✓)  
   - Position 4: T (✓)  
   - The word structure is: `[letter1] A L T [letter5]`.  

2. **Absent letters (must be excluded)**:  
   C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S, M, Y.  

3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5**:  
   - Valid letters: B, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z (since all other letters are excluded).  

4. **Constraints from past feedback**:  
   - T is present but cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 2), which is satisfied since T is fixed at position 4.  
   - L is present but cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 3), which is satisfied since L is fixed at position 3.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- We need to solve for **position 1** and **position 5** using the remaining letters.  
- The only common English word fitting the pattern `_ A L T _` and the constraints is **""WALTZ""**:  
  - W (position 1), A (position 2), L (position 3), T (position 4), Z (position 5).  
- Validation:  
  - W and Z are not in the excluded list.  
  - ""WALTZ"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning: a dance or to dance lightly).  
- If ""WALTZ"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal which letters (W or Z) are present/absent, narrowing down to rarer words (e.g., ""HALVA"" is invalid due to missing T at position 4; ""BALTI"" has excluded I).  

### Final Guess
<guess>waltz</guess>",waltz,"We have feedback from the fourth guess: ""malty"" -> M(x) A(✓) L(✓) T(✓) Y(x)
This means:
- A, L, T are in the correct positions: so positions 2, 3, 4 are A, L, T respectively? 
  Specifically: 
    - A is correct at position 2 (which we already knew from guess 3)
    - L is correct at position 3? Because we put L at position 3 and got L(✓)
    - T is correct at position 4? Because we put T at position 4 and got T(✓)
- M and Y are not in the word? So M(x) and Y(x)

Therefore, the word so far is: _ A L T _

We know the first and last letters are missing? And we have to find them.

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- The word contains A, L, T (and we know their positions: A at 2, L at 3, T at 4)
- The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S, M, Y (from all the x's)

We also know that the last letter (position 5) is missing? And the first letter (position 1) is missing.

We need to find a letter for position 1 and position 5? But note: the word has 5 letters? So we have:

Position 1: unknown letter, say X
Position 2: A
Position 3: L
Position 4: T
Position 5: unknown letter, say Z

So the word is: X A L T Z

Now, X and Z must be letters not in the excluded list? And must form a valid English word.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, D, O, P, I, S, M, Y

So available letters: B, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z? But note: we have to use English words? And we must avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words? 

Common words: ""SALT"" is 4 letters? ""HALT"" is 4? 

We need 5-letter words ending with ALT? But we have A L T fixed in positions 2,3,4? So the word is X A L T Z.

What are some words? 

- ""HALTS""? But S is excluded? And also, it would be H A L T S? But S is excluded? So no.
- ""MALTS""? M and S excluded? No.
- ""BALTY""? But Y excluded? And we have Y(x) in guess 4? So no.
- ""FALTS""? Not a word? 
- ""GALT""? 4 letters? 
- ""WALTY""? Not common? 

Another idea: ""EXALT""? E and X? But E is excluded? And X is a letter? But E is in excluded list? So no.

""BASALT"" is 6 letters? 

Perhaps ""VAPLT""? Not a word.

Wait, what about ""DEALT""? D and E excluded? 

""FAULT""? F, A, U, L, T -> but we have positions: F at 1, A at 2, U at 3? But we have L at 3? So not? In ""FAULT"", it's F-A-U-L-T? So positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T? But in our case, position 3 must be L? And position 4 must be T? So ""FAULT"" has L at 4 and T at 5? But we have L at 3 and T at 4? So not matching.

We need a word with the pattern _ A L T _

So the only possibility is that the word has A at 2, L at 3, T at 4? Then the last letter is Z? And first letter X.

Possible words: 

- ""HALTA""? Not English? 
- ""BALTI""? I excluded? 
- ""GALTY""? Y excluded? 
- ""KALTI""? I excluded? 

Wait, is ""SALTO"" a word? But S and O excluded? 

Another: ""WALTZ""? W, A, L, T, Z? But Z is the last letter? And W at first? 

""WALTZ"" is a valid word? Meaning a dance? 

Check the letters: 
- W: not excluded? 
- A: at position 2? 
- L: at position 3? 
- T: at position 4? 
- Z: at position 5? 

And Z is not in the excluded list? Excluded are C,R,N,E,D,O,P,I,S,M,Y? Z is not in that list? So it's allowed.

Therefore, ""WALTZ"" is a candidate.

Are there others? 

""FALTS""? Not word? 

""VALTS""? Not common? 

So ""WALTZ"" seems the only common word? 

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: W -> not excluded? 
- Position 5: Z -> not excluded? 
- The word is ""WALTZ"": W-A-L-T-Z.

So we can guess ""WALTZ"".

But note: we have not used Z before? So it's a new letter? And we are testing it? But we are also trying to solve? 

Since we have only one guess left? Or we have two? We started with 6 tries? We are at guess 5? So we have two more? But if we guess correctly, we win? 

But we are not sure? But ""WALTZ"" fits all the constraints? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more common letters? But we have only two positions? And we know the pattern? So we can guess ""WALTZ"" directly? 

But to be safe? We can think if there is any other possibility? 

Another word: ""HALVA""? But H A L V A? Then positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A? But we need T at position 4? But here T is missing? And we know T is in the word? So no.

""TALMA""? But T at 1? But we have A at 2? And L at 3? Then T at 1? But we have T at 4? And also, T at 1? But we know T is at position 4? So it cannot be at 1? Also, in ""TALMA"": T, A, L, M, A -> M is excluded? And T at 1? But we have T at 4? So it would have two T's? But we don't know? However, in this case, we have M excluded? So invalid.

Therefore, ""WALTZ"" is the only common word I can think of.

So I'll go with ""WALTZ"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback
