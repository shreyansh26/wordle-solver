We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - C, R, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A and N are correct and in positions 3 and 4, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We also know that C, R, E are absent, so they cannot be in the secret word.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
   - Keep A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
   - Avoid using the letters C, R, E.
   - Try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

 Common letters we haven't tested yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, etc.

 The pattern is: _ _ A N _

 We need to form a valid 5-letter word that fits: ? ? A N ?

 Let's think of words that have A as the third letter and N as forth letter.

 Examples:
   - ""BLANK"": B L A N K → but we know E is absent, but we haven't tested B, L, K. However, note that we are avoiding R and C, so this is okay.
   - ""PLANK"": P L A N K
   - ""THANK"": T H A N K
   - ""SHANK"": S H A N K
   - ""FLANK"": F L A N K

 Since we also want to test new letters, we might choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels that are still possible.

 Let's list the constraints:
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, E (so avoid these)
   - The word must have A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 We can try to use the first two positions to test new letters and the last position too.

 We have two tries so far? Wait, no: this is our second guess.

 We have 5 more tries, so we can be a bit aggressive.

 Let's aim for a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""THANK""? 
   - T: new letter
   - H: new letter
   - A: known and in place
   - N: known and in place
   - K: new letter

 This way we test T, H, and K.

 Alternatively, ""SHANK"" for S, H, K.

 But note: We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't know of any repeats because we only have two letters.

 However, the feedback for the first guess did not show any duplicate markers, but that doesn't necessarily mean there are no duplicates? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the secret word has only one, it will be marked accordingly. But in our first guess, we used each of C,R,A,N,E once. So if we saw two of the same non-existent, we might have seen multiple x's. But we haven't seen any duplicates. The secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, we'll assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

 Since the first guess had two correct letters, and they were both fixed, let's proceed.

 I think ""THANK"" is a good word because it tests T, H, K and keeps A and N in place.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is not present. However, note that in ""THANK"", we are avoiding R? Correct.

 Alternatively, we could use ""BLANK"" to test B, L, K.

 But let me think: which letters are more common? T and H are common.

 We can also consider ""PLANT"" but we know E is out and we haven't tested P, L, T. However, note that in ""PLANT"", the T is in the last position? But wait, our pattern is _ _ A N _ so the last letter must be the fifth. ""PLANT"" has A in the third and N in the fourth? Let's spell it: P-L-A-N-T → positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T → yes, it fits.

 However, the feedback said E is absent, so ""PLANT"" doesn't have E, but we are avoiding R and C? Yes. Also, note that in the feedback for the first guess, we know E is absent, so it's okay.

 But wait: we know N is present and correctly placed, and A also. So ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. We haven't tested P, L, T.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 But note: there might be another possibility: the word might be ""BEANY"" but that has E which is absent? No, we know E is absent so any word containing E is invalid.

 Therefore, words that have E are excluded.

 So ""PLANT"" would be valid? Yes.

 But let me compare: ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"".

 ""THANK"": T in first, H in second, A in third, N in fourth, K in fifth. Letters: T, H, A, N, K → A and N are known, so we are testing T, H, K.

 ""PLANT"": P in first, L in second, A in third, N in fourth, T in fifth. Letters: P, L, A, N, T → testing P, L, T.

 Both are valid and avoid C, R, E.

 Which one to pick? We might consider letter frequency.

 Common letters in English: E (but we know E is absent), then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. But R is absent.

 So ignoring R and E: T, A, O, I, N, S, H.

 We have already A and N. So next common: T, O, I, S, H.

 In ""THANK"": T, H, K → we cover T and H (two common letters) and K (less common).
 In ""PLANT"": P, L, T → T is common, L is common, P is less common.

 T is in both. So we are testing H in ""THANK"", and L and P in ""PLANT"". L is more common than P? Yes.

 But note: we are testing the positions too. In ""THANK"", we are putting T in the first position and H in the second. In ""PLANT"", P in first and L in second.

 How common are letters in the first position? Typically, T, S, C, P, A, etc. But we know A cannot be in the first? Actually, we don't know. The secret word could have A elsewhere? But we have A fixed in third, so the first letter cannot be A because it would be a duplicate? Not necessarily. So actually, the first letter might be any letter that is not C, R, E? Or A? Because if A were in the first position, and we already have one A in third, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? So we don't know if the word has multiple A's.

 Therefore, we can't rule out A in the first? Actually, the feedback we have for ""crane"" showed that A was correct in position 3 and the rest were not. So if A were also in the secret word in position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A in the first position (if present) would have been marked as either correct (if it matched) or present (if in wrong position). But we got C(x) meaning that the first letter is not A? How?

 Wait: in the secret word, if there are two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we have A only in position 3. So the A in position 3 is correctly placed. If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then the letter in position 1 of our guess is C, which is not A, so the secret word's letter at position 1 is not the same as our guess. But that doesn't tell us if there's an A elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks are per letter in the guess:

   - The A in position 3 was marked with ✓ because it matches the secret word at that position.
   - If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then when we guessed a C in position 1, that would be marked as x (because it's C and not A) but then the A in the secret word at position 1 would not be accounted for? Actually, no: the feedback for duplicates: each instance is considered separately. So for the secret word having two A's: 
        - The A in the third position of the guess matches the third of the secret, so marked ✓.
        - Then, the first letter of the secret is A, but we provided C, so that gets an x. 
        - The fact that there's an A elsewhere does not change the marking of the C? Correct.

 But also, the duplicate A would result in one more A that hasn't been guessed? Actually, no. We guessed only one A (at position 3) and it matched. If the secret has two A's, then there is still one A that hasn't been guessed? And it would appear in the feedback? Only if we had guessed an A in that position? No.

 Example: secret = ""APPLE"". Guess = ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → A is present but not at position 1? Actually no: the secret word has an A at position 1. Our guess has C. That's a non-match. Since we don't have A anywhere else in the guess at that point? Then the feedback would mark C as x. Then the A in secret word is not matched by any letter in the guess? However, in Wordle rules, for duplicate letters: 
   - When a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark any occurrence that matches the secret as ✓, and if there is an occurrence in a wrong position, it will be marked with -, but only up to the number of occurrences.

 Example: secret ""APPLE"", guess ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → x (because C is not A and not in the word; but A is in the word? But we haven't guessed A elsewhere? Actually, we guessed A only at position 3? 
   So: 
        Position 1: C -> not A -> x (and the secret has A at position 1, but it doesn't count unless we guess it elsewhere? )
   Then position 3: we guess A and the secret has P at position 3? Wait, no: secret ""APPLE"" -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E. 
   Our guess: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

   Now what happens?
     Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the word? Actually, C is not in the secret, so x.
     Position 2: R vs P → R is not in the secret? So x.
     Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? But wait, no: secret has A in the first position. Since we didn't guess any A in an unmatched position? Actually, the A we guessed in position 3 is evaluated: the secret at position 3 is P, which is not A. Then the entire secret word has one A (in position 1) that isn't matched? So the A in position 3 would get a ""-"" ? Because the secret has an A elsewhere? And this is the first time we guessed A?

   So the rule: 
        The letter in the guess gets a ✓ if it matches the same position in the secret.
        Otherwise, it gets a - if the letter is present in the secret in a not-yet-matched position? But note: the number of - marks is limited by the frequency.

   In the example of secret ""APPLE"" and guess ""CRANE"":
        Secret: A P P L E
        Guess:  C R A N E

        Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the secret? Actually, the secret doesn't have C → x.
        Position 2: R is not in secret → x.
        Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? Wait, secret has A only at position 1? And we haven't matched it? Actually, the secret has one A. So if we have an A in our guess in an incorrect position, it would be marked as - because there is an unmatched A in the secret? But position 3: we have A, and the secret at position 3 is P. So it's an A that isn't in the correct position. And the secret has an A at position 1. Since we haven't guessed position 1 correctly? The feedback should mark the A in guess at position 3 as present but wrong position? 

        However, note: in the feedback we got for ""crane"" with the actual secret word (which we don't know), we had A as ✓ and not a -. That means that the A was correctly placed. Therefore, if the secret had another A elsewhere, it would have been reflected if we guessed a duplicate A in a different position? 

        But in our case, we only had one A in the guess and it got ✓, meaning that the secret has an A in the third position? Then there can't be another A? Or can there? Actually, yes, there could be. Because the correct placement of one A doesn't block the possibility of duplicate A's elsewhere? But we didn't guess A elsewhere? 

   So for our first guess: the letter A got ✓ so we know:
        - The secret has at least one A at the third position.

   But it might have more? Then we need to consider in our next guess: if we put an A in another position, we might get more feedback? However, our current constraints are that we avoid C, R, E? So we must avoid those? And we are fixing A and N? 

   Since we don't know about duplicate A, but we already have A in the third, we don't need to test A again? Actually, we can assume that A is fixed? And then if the word has duplicate A, it will appear when we guess? But we aren't forced to.

   So back to choosing the word.

   Among ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"", I think either is fine.

   Let me look for more words? Or we can use ""SLANT"": S L A N T → testing S, L, T.

   Now, S is a common letter.

   How about words using common letters: T, O, I, S, H.

   We could try to include O or I? But we are constrained by having to have A in third and N in fourth.

   Words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and don't contain C, R, E:

        - BLANK (B,L,A,N,K)
        - FLANK (F,L,A,N,K)
        - PLANK (P,L,A,N,K)
        - SHANK (S,H,A,N,K)
        - THANK (T,H,A,N,K)
        - SLANT (S,L,A,N,T)
        - PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)
        - GRANT (G,R,...) → but R is absent? So invalid because R is not allowed? We know R is absent.

   We must avoid R? So GRANT is invalid.

   How about ""STAIN"": but note, that would move the A? We have to have A in third? So STAIN has ""ST"" as positions 1 and 2, A in 3, I in 4, N in 5 → but our pattern requires N in the fourth? So ""STAIN"" has A in third? Correct? But it has N in fifth? We need N in fourth? 

   The pattern is: third letter is A, fourth letter is N → so positions: 
        1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: N, 5: ?

   In ""stain"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) → that's A at position 3, but then I at position 4 and N at position 5. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Therefore, we require the letter at position 4 to be N? So ""STAIN"" has I at position 4? Not N. So invalid pattern.

   So only words that have A at position 3 and N at position 4.

   Let me think of other words: 
        - MELAN → but M E L A N → E is present? We can't use E? 
        - KALAN? That might not be a word? 
 - Valid ones: ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""SHANK"", ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", ""SLANT"", ""ALIGN"" → wait: ""ALIGN"": A L I G N → that would break because we have A in position 1? But our pattern requires position 3 to be A? So we cannot use A in position 1? Or can we? 

   We must have A in position 3? So in ""ALIGN"": positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N? So position 3 is I, not A? So not matching.

   Therefore, we stick to the words we listed.

   How about ""DWARF""? Doesn't fit pattern.

   So let's decide: 
        We want to maximize the number of new letters? And we want to cover common letters.

   Common letters not yet tested: T, O, I, S, L, ....

   Among the choices:

        THANK: T, H, K → we test T, H, K in positions 1,2,5.
        PLANT: P, L, T → tests P, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SLANT: S, L, T → tests S, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SHANK: S, H, K → tests S, H, K in positions 1,2,5.

        ""SLANT"" includes S and L? And T? Which are common? So maybe ""SLANT"" is a good candidate? 

   Also, S is the most common consonant? If we try S in first position? Then L in second? 

   Additionally, we note that the fifth letter is being tested: it could be T or K? 

   I think ""SLANT"" might be a good choice because:
        - It uses common letters: S, L, T.
        - We haven't excluded these letters? So we get information about S, L, T in the respective positions.

   And it fits the pattern: S, L, A, N, T → third A? fixed? fourth N? fixed? and fifth T? first S, second L.

   Therefore, I choose ""SLANT"".

   But wait: we have already fixed A and N? Is that acceptable? Yes.

   Now, what if the secret word is ""SLANT""? Then we win? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, ""PLANT"" is similar? But ""SLANT"" includes S? Which is more common than P? So let's pick ""SLANT"".

   However, we are avoiding letters: we know C, R, E are not in the word? And ""SLANT"" does not contain any of these? Correct? S, L, A, N, T: none are C, R, or E.

   So let's go with ""SLANT"".

   There is one more candidate: ""DAUNT"": D A U N T → but wait: we cannot have A in the second position? The word ""DAUNT"": D-A-U-N-T → position 1: D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T → that doesn't have A at position 3? So invalid?

   Therefore, our choices are limited? So I choose ""SLANT"".

  Guess: SLANT

<guess>slant</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E):
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N is in the correct position (4th letter)
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word

The secret word must fit the pattern: `_ _ A N _`, with no C, R, or E.

For the second guess:
- Must preserve A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position
- Avoid letters C, R, E
- Include new common letters to gather more information

After considering options like ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", and ""SHANK"", ""SLANT"" was selected because:
- It maintains A (3rd) and N (4th) positions
- Avoids C, R, E
- Tests new common letters: S (1st position), L (2nd position), and T (5th position)
- S and T are high-frequency letters, while L helps test potential consonants

This guess efficiently probes key letters in critical positions to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>slant</guess>",slant,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - C, R, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A and N are correct and in positions 3 and 4, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We also know that C, R, E are absent, so they cannot be in the secret word.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
   - Keep A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
   - Avoid using the letters C, R, E.
   - Try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

 Common letters we haven't tested yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, etc.

 The pattern is: _ _ A N _

 We need to form a valid 5-letter word that fits: ? ? A N ?

 Let's think of words that have A as the third letter and N as forth letter.

 Examples:
   - ""BLANK"": B L A N K → but we know E is absent, but we haven't tested B, L, K. However, note that we are avoiding R and C, so this is okay.
   - ""PLANK"": P L A N K
   - ""THANK"": T H A N K
   - ""SHANK"": S H A N K
   - ""FLANK"": F L A N K

 Since we also want to test new letters, we might choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels that are still possible.

 Let's list the constraints:
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, E (so avoid these)
   - The word must have A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 We can try to use the first two positions to test new letters and the last position too.

 We have two tries so far? Wait, no: this is our second guess.

 We have 5 more tries, so we can be a bit aggressive.

 Let's aim for a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""THANK""? 
   - T: new letter
   - H: new letter
   - A: known and in place
   - N: known and in place
   - K: new letter

 This way we test T, H, and K.

 Alternatively, ""SHANK"" for S, H, K.

 But note: We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't know of any repeats because we only have two letters.

 However, the feedback for the first guess did not show any duplicate markers, but that doesn't necessarily mean there are no duplicates? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the secret word has only one, it will be marked accordingly. But in our first guess, we used each of C,R,A,N,E once. So if we saw two of the same non-existent, we might have seen multiple x's. But we haven't seen any duplicates. The secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, we'll assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

 Since the first guess had two correct letters, and they were both fixed, let's proceed.

 I think ""THANK"" is a good word because it tests T, H, K and keeps A and N in place.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is not present. However, note that in ""THANK"", we are avoiding R? Correct.

 Alternatively, we could use ""BLANK"" to test B, L, K.

 But let me think: which letters are more common? T and H are common.

 We can also consider ""PLANT"" but we know E is out and we haven't tested P, L, T. However, note that in ""PLANT"", the T is in the last position? But wait, our pattern is _ _ A N _ so the last letter must be the fifth. ""PLANT"" has A in the third and N in the fourth? Let's spell it: P-L-A-N-T → positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T → yes, it fits.

 However, the feedback said E is absent, so ""PLANT"" doesn't have E, but we are avoiding R and C? Yes. Also, note that in the feedback for the first guess, we know E is absent, so it's okay.

 But wait: we know N is present and correctly placed, and A also. So ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. We haven't tested P, L, T.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 But note: there might be another possibility: the word might be ""BEANY"" but that has E which is absent? No, we know E is absent so any word containing E is invalid.

 Therefore, words that have E are excluded.

 So ""PLANT"" would be valid? Yes.

 But let me compare: ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"".

 ""THANK"": T in first, H in second, A in third, N in fourth, K in fifth. Letters: T, H, A, N, K → A and N are known, so we are testing T, H, K.

 ""PLANT"": P in first, L in second, A in third, N in fourth, T in fifth. Letters: P, L, A, N, T → testing P, L, T.

 Both are valid and avoid C, R, E.

 Which one to pick? We might consider letter frequency.

 Common letters in English: E (but we know E is absent), then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. But R is absent.

 So ignoring R and E: T, A, O, I, N, S, H.

 We have already A and N. So next common: T, O, I, S, H.

 In ""THANK"": T, H, K → we cover T and H (two common letters) and K (less common).
 In ""PLANT"": P, L, T → T is common, L is common, P is less common.

 T is in both. So we are testing H in ""THANK"", and L and P in ""PLANT"". L is more common than P? Yes.

 But note: we are testing the positions too. In ""THANK"", we are putting T in the first position and H in the second. In ""PLANT"", P in first and L in second.

 How common are letters in the first position? Typically, T, S, C, P, A, etc. But we know A cannot be in the first? Actually, we don't know. The secret word could have A elsewhere? But we have A fixed in third, so the first letter cannot be A because it would be a duplicate? Not necessarily. So actually, the first letter might be any letter that is not C, R, E? Or A? Because if A were in the first position, and we already have one A in third, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? So we don't know if the word has multiple A's.

 Therefore, we can't rule out A in the first? Actually, the feedback we have for ""crane"" showed that A was correct in position 3 and the rest were not. So if A were also in the secret word in position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A in the first position (if present) would have been marked as either correct (if it matched) or present (if in wrong position). But we got C(x) meaning that the first letter is not A? How?

 Wait: in the secret word, if there are two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we have A only in position 3. So the A in position 3 is correctly placed. If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then the letter in position 1 of our guess is C, which is not A, so the secret word's letter at position 1 is not the same as our guess. But that doesn't tell us if there's an A elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks are per letter in the guess:

   - The A in position 3 was marked with ✓ because it matches the secret word at that position.
   - If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then when we guessed a C in position 1, that would be marked as x (because it's C and not A) but then the A in the secret word at position 1 would not be accounted for? Actually, no: the feedback for duplicates: each instance is considered separately. So for the secret word having two A's: 
        - The A in the third position of the guess matches the third of the secret, so marked ✓.
        - Then, the first letter of the secret is A, but we provided C, so that gets an x. 
        - The fact that there's an A elsewhere does not change the marking of the C? Correct.

 But also, the duplicate A would result in one more A that hasn't been guessed? Actually, no. We guessed only one A (at position 3) and it matched. If the secret has two A's, then there is still one A that hasn't been guessed? And it would appear in the feedback? Only if we had guessed an A in that position? No.

 Example: secret = ""APPLE"". Guess = ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → A is present but not at position 1? Actually no: the secret word has an A at position 1. Our guess has C. That's a non-match. Since we don't have A anywhere else in the guess at that point? Then the feedback would mark C as x. Then the A in secret word is not matched by any letter in the guess? However, in Wordle rules, for duplicate letters: 
   - When a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark any occurrence that matches the secret as ✓, and if there is an occurrence in a wrong position, it will be marked with -, but only up to the number of occurrences.

 Example: secret ""APPLE"", guess ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → x (because C is not A and not in the word; but A is in the word? But we haven't guessed A elsewhere? Actually, we guessed A only at position 3? 
   So: 
        Position 1: C -> not A -> x (and the secret has A at position 1, but it doesn't count unless we guess it elsewhere? )
   Then position 3: we guess A and the secret has P at position 3? Wait, no: secret ""APPLE"" -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E. 
   Our guess: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

   Now what happens?
     Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the word? Actually, C is not in the secret, so x.
     Position 2: R vs P → R is not in the secret? So x.
     Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? But wait, no: secret has A in the first position. Since we didn't guess any A in an unmatched position? Actually, the A we guessed in position 3 is evaluated: the secret at position 3 is P, which is not A. Then the entire secret word has one A (in position 1) that isn't matched? So the A in position 3 would get a ""-"" ? Because the secret has an A elsewhere? And this is the first time we guessed A?

   So the rule: 
        The letter in the guess gets a ✓ if it matches the same position in the secret.
        Otherwise, it gets a - if the letter is present in the secret in a not-yet-matched position? But note: the number of - marks is limited by the frequency.

   In the example of secret ""APPLE"" and guess ""CRANE"":
        Secret: A P P L E
        Guess:  C R A N E

        Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the secret? Actually, the secret doesn't have C → x.
        Position 2: R is not in secret → x.
        Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? Wait, secret has A only at position 1? And we haven't matched it? Actually, the secret has one A. So if we have an A in our guess in an incorrect position, it would be marked as - because there is an unmatched A in the secret? But position 3: we have A, and the secret at position 3 is P. So it's an A that isn't in the correct position. And the secret has an A at position 1. Since we haven't guessed position 1 correctly? The feedback should mark the A in guess at position 3 as present but wrong position? 

        However, note: in the feedback we got for ""crane"" with the actual secret word (which we don't know), we had A as ✓ and not a -. That means that the A was correctly placed. Therefore, if the secret had another A elsewhere, it would have been reflected if we guessed a duplicate A in a different position? 

        But in our case, we only had one A in the guess and it got ✓, meaning that the secret has an A in the third position? Then there can't be another A? Or can there? Actually, yes, there could be. Because the correct placement of one A doesn't block the possibility of duplicate A's elsewhere? But we didn't guess A elsewhere? 

   So for our first guess: the letter A got ✓ so we know:
        - The secret has at least one A at the third position.

   But it might have more? Then we need to consider in our next guess: if we put an A in another position, we might get more feedback? However, our current constraints are that we avoid C, R, E? So we must avoid those? And we are fixing A and N? 

   Since we don't know about duplicate A, but we already have A in the third, we don't need to test A again? Actually, we can assume that A is fixed? And then if the word has duplicate A, it will appear when we guess? But we aren't forced to.

   So back to choosing the word.

   Among ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"", I think either is fine.

   Let me look for more words? Or we can use ""SLANT"": S L A N T → testing S, L, T.

   Now, S is a common letter.

   How about words using common letters: T, O, I, S, H.

   We could try to include O or I? But we are constrained by having to have A in third and N in fourth.

   Words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and don't contain C, R, E:

        - BLANK (B,L,A,N,K)
        - FLANK (F,L,A,N,K)
        - PLANK (P,L,A,N,K)
        - SHANK (S,H,A,N,K)
        - THANK (T,H,A,N,K)
        - SLANT (S,L,A,N,T)
        - PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)
        - GRANT (G,R,...) → but R is absent? So invalid because R is not allowed? We know R is absent.

   We must avoid R? So GRANT is invalid.

   How about ""STAIN"": but note, that would move the A? We have to have A in third? So STAIN has ""ST"" as positions 1 and 2, A in 3, I in 4, N in 5 → but our pattern requires N in the fourth? So ""STAIN"" has A in third? Correct? But it has N in fifth? We need N in fourth? 

   The pattern is: third letter is A, fourth letter is N → so positions: 
        1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: N, 5: ?

   In ""stain"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) → that's A at position 3, but then I at position 4 and N at position 5. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Therefore, we require the letter at position 4 to be N? So ""STAIN"" has I at position 4? Not N. So invalid pattern.

   So only words that have A at position 3 and N at position 4.

   Let me think of other words: 
        - MELAN → but M E L A N → E is present? We can't use E? 
        - KALAN? That might not be a word? 
 - Valid ones: ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""SHANK"", ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", ""SLANT"", ""ALIGN"" → wait: ""ALIGN"": A L I G N → that would break because we have A in position 1? But our pattern requires position 3 to be A? So we cannot use A in position 1? Or can we? 

   We must have A in position 3? So in ""ALIGN"": positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N? So position 3 is I, not A? So not matching.

   Therefore, we stick to the words we listed.

   How about ""DWARF""? Doesn't fit pattern.

   So let's decide: 
        We want to maximize the number of new letters? And we want to cover common letters.

   Common letters not yet tested: T, O, I, S, L, ....

   Among the choices:

        THANK: T, H, K → we test T, H, K in positions 1,2,5.
        PLANT: P, L, T → tests P, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SLANT: S, L, T → tests S, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SHANK: S, H, K → tests S, H, K in positions 1,2,5.

        ""SLANT"" includes S and L? And T? Which are common? So maybe ""SLANT"" is a good candidate? 

   Also, S is the most common consonant? If we try S in first position? Then L in second? 

   Additionally, we note that the fifth letter is being tested: it could be T or K? 

   I think ""SLANT"" might be a good choice because:
        - It uses common letters: S, L, T.
        - We haven't excluded these letters? So we get information about S, L, T in the respective positions.

   And it fits the pattern: S, L, A, N, T → third A? fixed? fourth N? fixed? and fifth T? first S, second L.

   Therefore, I choose ""SLANT"".

   But wait: we have already fixed A and N? Is that acceptable? Yes.

   Now, what if the secret word is ""SLANT""? Then we win? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, ""PLANT"" is similar? But ""SLANT"" includes S? Which is more common than P? So let's pick ""SLANT"".

   However, we are avoiding letters: we know C, R, E are not in the word? And ""SLANT"" does not contain any of these? Correct? S, L, A, N, T: none are C, R, or E.

   So let's go with ""SLANT"".

   There is one more candidate: ""DAUNT"": D A U N T → but wait: we cannot have A in the second position? The word ""DAUNT"": D-A-U-N-T → position 1: D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T → that doesn't have A at position 3? So invalid?

   Therefore, our choices are limited? So I choose ""SLANT"".

  Guess: SLANT

<guess>slant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E):
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N is in the correct position (4th letter)
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word

The secret word must fit the pattern: `_ _ A N _`, with no C, R, or E.

For the second guess:
- Must preserve A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position
- Avoid letters C, R, E
- Include new common letters to gather more information

After considering options like ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", and ""SHANK"", ""SLANT"" was selected because:
- It maintains A (3rd) and N (4th) positions
- Avoids C, R, E
- Tests new common letters: S (1st position), L (2nd position), and T (5th position)
- S and T are high-frequency letters, while L helps test potential consonants

This guess efficiently probes key letters in critical positions to narrow down possibilities quickly.",Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,gland,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - C, R, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A and N are correct and in positions 3 and 4, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We also know that C, R, E are absent, so they cannot be in the secret word.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
   - Keep A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
   - Avoid using the letters C, R, E.
   - Try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

 Common letters we haven't tested yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, etc.

 The pattern is: _ _ A N _

 We need to form a valid 5-letter word that fits: ? ? A N ?

 Let's think of words that have A as the third letter and N as forth letter.

 Examples:
   - ""BLANK"": B L A N K → but we know E is absent, but we haven't tested B, L, K. However, note that we are avoiding R and C, so this is okay.
   - ""PLANK"": P L A N K
   - ""THANK"": T H A N K
   - ""SHANK"": S H A N K
   - ""FLANK"": F L A N K

 Since we also want to test new letters, we might choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels that are still possible.

 Let's list the constraints:
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, E (so avoid these)
   - The word must have A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 We can try to use the first two positions to test new letters and the last position too.

 We have two tries so far? Wait, no: this is our second guess.

 We have 5 more tries, so we can be a bit aggressive.

 Let's aim for a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""THANK""? 
   - T: new letter
   - H: new letter
   - A: known and in place
   - N: known and in place
   - K: new letter

 This way we test T, H, and K.

 Alternatively, ""SHANK"" for S, H, K.

 But note: We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't know of any repeats because we only have two letters.

 However, the feedback for the first guess did not show any duplicate markers, but that doesn't necessarily mean there are no duplicates? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the secret word has only one, it will be marked accordingly. But in our first guess, we used each of C,R,A,N,E once. So if we saw two of the same non-existent, we might have seen multiple x's. But we haven't seen any duplicates. The secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, we'll assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

 Since the first guess had two correct letters, and they were both fixed, let's proceed.

 I think ""THANK"" is a good word because it tests T, H, K and keeps A and N in place.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is not present. However, note that in ""THANK"", we are avoiding R? Correct.

 Alternatively, we could use ""BLANK"" to test B, L, K.

 But let me think: which letters are more common? T and H are common.

 We can also consider ""PLANT"" but we know E is out and we haven't tested P, L, T. However, note that in ""PLANT"", the T is in the last position? But wait, our pattern is _ _ A N _ so the last letter must be the fifth. ""PLANT"" has A in the third and N in the fourth? Let's spell it: P-L-A-N-T → positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T → yes, it fits.

 However, the feedback said E is absent, so ""PLANT"" doesn't have E, but we are avoiding R and C? Yes. Also, note that in the feedback for the first guess, we know E is absent, so it's okay.

 But wait: we know N is present and correctly placed, and A also. So ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. We haven't tested P, L, T.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 But note: there might be another possibility: the word might be ""BEANY"" but that has E which is absent? No, we know E is absent so any word containing E is invalid.

 Therefore, words that have E are excluded.

 So ""PLANT"" would be valid? Yes.

 But let me compare: ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"".

 ""THANK"": T in first, H in second, A in third, N in fourth, K in fifth. Letters: T, H, A, N, K → A and N are known, so we are testing T, H, K.

 ""PLANT"": P in first, L in second, A in third, N in fourth, T in fifth. Letters: P, L, A, N, T → testing P, L, T.

 Both are valid and avoid C, R, E.

 Which one to pick? We might consider letter frequency.

 Common letters in English: E (but we know E is absent), then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. But R is absent.

 So ignoring R and E: T, A, O, I, N, S, H.

 We have already A and N. So next common: T, O, I, S, H.

 In ""THANK"": T, H, K → we cover T and H (two common letters) and K (less common).
 In ""PLANT"": P, L, T → T is common, L is common, P is less common.

 T is in both. So we are testing H in ""THANK"", and L and P in ""PLANT"". L is more common than P? Yes.

 But note: we are testing the positions too. In ""THANK"", we are putting T in the first position and H in the second. In ""PLANT"", P in first and L in second.

 How common are letters in the first position? Typically, T, S, C, P, A, etc. But we know A cannot be in the first? Actually, we don't know. The secret word could have A elsewhere? But we have A fixed in third, so the first letter cannot be A because it would be a duplicate? Not necessarily. So actually, the first letter might be any letter that is not C, R, E? Or A? Because if A were in the first position, and we already have one A in third, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? So we don't know if the word has multiple A's.

 Therefore, we can't rule out A in the first? Actually, the feedback we have for ""crane"" showed that A was correct in position 3 and the rest were not. So if A were also in the secret word in position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A in the first position (if present) would have been marked as either correct (if it matched) or present (if in wrong position). But we got C(x) meaning that the first letter is not A? How?

 Wait: in the secret word, if there are two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we have A only in position 3. So the A in position 3 is correctly placed. If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then the letter in position 1 of our guess is C, which is not A, so the secret word's letter at position 1 is not the same as our guess. But that doesn't tell us if there's an A elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks are per letter in the guess:

   - The A in position 3 was marked with ✓ because it matches the secret word at that position.
   - If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then when we guessed a C in position 1, that would be marked as x (because it's C and not A) but then the A in the secret word at position 1 would not be accounted for? Actually, no: the feedback for duplicates: each instance is considered separately. So for the secret word having two A's: 
        - The A in the third position of the guess matches the third of the secret, so marked ✓.
        - Then, the first letter of the secret is A, but we provided C, so that gets an x. 
        - The fact that there's an A elsewhere does not change the marking of the C? Correct.

 But also, the duplicate A would result in one more A that hasn't been guessed? Actually, no. We guessed only one A (at position 3) and it matched. If the secret has two A's, then there is still one A that hasn't been guessed? And it would appear in the feedback? Only if we had guessed an A in that position? No.

 Example: secret = ""APPLE"". Guess = ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → A is present but not at position 1? Actually no: the secret word has an A at position 1. Our guess has C. That's a non-match. Since we don't have A anywhere else in the guess at that point? Then the feedback would mark C as x. Then the A in secret word is not matched by any letter in the guess? However, in Wordle rules, for duplicate letters: 
   - When a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark any occurrence that matches the secret as ✓, and if there is an occurrence in a wrong position, it will be marked with -, but only up to the number of occurrences.

 Example: secret ""APPLE"", guess ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → x (because C is not A and not in the word; but A is in the word? But we haven't guessed A elsewhere? Actually, we guessed A only at position 3? 
   So: 
        Position 1: C -> not A -> x (and the secret has A at position 1, but it doesn't count unless we guess it elsewhere? )
   Then position 3: we guess A and the secret has P at position 3? Wait, no: secret ""APPLE"" -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E. 
   Our guess: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

   Now what happens?
     Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the word? Actually, C is not in the secret, so x.
     Position 2: R vs P → R is not in the secret? So x.
     Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? But wait, no: secret has A in the first position. Since we didn't guess any A in an unmatched position? Actually, the A we guessed in position 3 is evaluated: the secret at position 3 is P, which is not A. Then the entire secret word has one A (in position 1) that isn't matched? So the A in position 3 would get a ""-"" ? Because the secret has an A elsewhere? And this is the first time we guessed A?

   So the rule: 
        The letter in the guess gets a ✓ if it matches the same position in the secret.
        Otherwise, it gets a - if the letter is present in the secret in a not-yet-matched position? But note: the number of - marks is limited by the frequency.

   In the example of secret ""APPLE"" and guess ""CRANE"":
        Secret: A P P L E
        Guess:  C R A N E

        Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the secret? Actually, the secret doesn't have C → x.
        Position 2: R is not in secret → x.
        Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? Wait, secret has A only at position 1? And we haven't matched it? Actually, the secret has one A. So if we have an A in our guess in an incorrect position, it would be marked as - because there is an unmatched A in the secret? But position 3: we have A, and the secret at position 3 is P. So it's an A that isn't in the correct position. And the secret has an A at position 1. Since we haven't guessed position 1 correctly? The feedback should mark the A in guess at position 3 as present but wrong position? 

        However, note: in the feedback we got for ""crane"" with the actual secret word (which we don't know), we had A as ✓ and not a -. That means that the A was correctly placed. Therefore, if the secret had another A elsewhere, it would have been reflected if we guessed a duplicate A in a different position? 

        But in our case, we only had one A in the guess and it got ✓, meaning that the secret has an A in the third position? Then there can't be another A? Or can there? Actually, yes, there could be. Because the correct placement of one A doesn't block the possibility of duplicate A's elsewhere? But we didn't guess A elsewhere? 

   So for our first guess: the letter A got ✓ so we know:
        - The secret has at least one A at the third position.

   But it might have more? Then we need to consider in our next guess: if we put an A in another position, we might get more feedback? However, our current constraints are that we avoid C, R, E? So we must avoid those? And we are fixing A and N? 

   Since we don't know about duplicate A, but we already have A in the third, we don't need to test A again? Actually, we can assume that A is fixed? And then if the word has duplicate A, it will appear when we guess? But we aren't forced to.

   So back to choosing the word.

   Among ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"", I think either is fine.

   Let me look for more words? Or we can use ""SLANT"": S L A N T → testing S, L, T.

   Now, S is a common letter.

   How about words using common letters: T, O, I, S, H.

   We could try to include O or I? But we are constrained by having to have A in third and N in fourth.

   Words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and don't contain C, R, E:

        - BLANK (B,L,A,N,K)
        - FLANK (F,L,A,N,K)
        - PLANK (P,L,A,N,K)
        - SHANK (S,H,A,N,K)
        - THANK (T,H,A,N,K)
        - SLANT (S,L,A,N,T)
        - PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)
        - GRANT (G,R,...) → but R is absent? So invalid because R is not allowed? We know R is absent.

   We must avoid R? So GRANT is invalid.

   How about ""STAIN"": but note, that would move the A? We have to have A in third? So STAIN has ""ST"" as positions 1 and 2, A in 3, I in 4, N in 5 → but our pattern requires N in the fourth? So ""STAIN"" has A in third? Correct? But it has N in fifth? We need N in fourth? 

   The pattern is: third letter is A, fourth letter is N → so positions: 
        1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: N, 5: ?

   In ""stain"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) → that's A at position 3, but then I at position 4 and N at position 5. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Therefore, we require the letter at position 4 to be N? So ""STAIN"" has I at position 4? Not N. So invalid pattern.

   So only words that have A at position 3 and N at position 4.

   Let me think of other words: 
        - MELAN → but M E L A N → E is present? We can't use E? 
        - KALAN? That might not be a word? 
 - Valid ones: ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""SHANK"", ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", ""SLANT"", ""ALIGN"" → wait: ""ALIGN"": A L I G N → that would break because we have A in position 1? But our pattern requires position 3 to be A? So we cannot use A in position 1? Or can we? 

   We must have A in position 3? So in ""ALIGN"": positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N? So position 3 is I, not A? So not matching.

   Therefore, we stick to the words we listed.

   How about ""DWARF""? Doesn't fit pattern.

   So let's decide: 
        We want to maximize the number of new letters? And we want to cover common letters.

   Common letters not yet tested: T, O, I, S, L, ....

   Among the choices:

        THANK: T, H, K → we test T, H, K in positions 1,2,5.
        PLANT: P, L, T → tests P, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SLANT: S, L, T → tests S, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SHANK: S, H, K → tests S, H, K in positions 1,2,5.

        ""SLANT"" includes S and L? And T? Which are common? So maybe ""SLANT"" is a good candidate? 

   Also, S is the most common consonant? If we try S in first position? Then L in second? 

   Additionally, we note that the fifth letter is being tested: it could be T or K? 

   I think ""SLANT"" might be a good choice because:
        - It uses common letters: S, L, T.
        - We haven't excluded these letters? So we get information about S, L, T in the respective positions.

   And it fits the pattern: S, L, A, N, T → third A? fixed? fourth N? fixed? and fifth T? first S, second L.

   Therefore, I choose ""SLANT"".

   But wait: we have already fixed A and N? Is that acceptable? Yes.

   Now, what if the secret word is ""SLANT""? Then we win? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, ""PLANT"" is similar? But ""SLANT"" includes S? Which is more common than P? So let's pick ""SLANT"".

   However, we are avoiding letters: we know C, R, E are not in the word? And ""SLANT"" does not contain any of these? Correct? S, L, A, N, T: none are C, R, or E.

   So let's go with ""SLANT"".

   There is one more candidate: ""DAUNT"": D A U N T → but wait: we cannot have A in the second position? The word ""DAUNT"": D-A-U-N-T → position 1: D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T → that doesn't have A at position 3? So invalid?

   Therefore, our choices are limited? So I choose ""SLANT"".

  Guess: SLANT

<guess>slant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E):
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N is in the correct position (4th letter)
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word

The secret word must fit the pattern: `_ _ A N _`, with no C, R, or E.

For the second guess:
- Must preserve A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position
- Avoid letters C, R, E
- Include new common letters to gather more information

After considering options like ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", and ""SHANK"", ""SLANT"" was selected because:
- It maintains A (3rd) and N (4th) positions
- Avoids C, R, E
- Tests new common letters: S (1st position), L (2nd position), and T (5th position)
- S and T are high-frequency letters, while L helps test potential consonants

This guess efficiently probes key letters in critical positions to narrow down possibilities quickly.

However, in this case, we don\'t know of any repeats because we only have two letters.\n\n However, the feedback for the first guess did not show any duplicate markers, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean there are no duplicates? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the secret word has only one, it will be marked accordingly. But in our first guess, we used each of C,R,A,N,E once. So if we saw two of the same non-existent, we might have seen multiple x\'s. But we haven\'t seen any duplicates. The secret word might have duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, we\'ll assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don\'t have any evidence of duplicates yet.\n\n Since the first guess had two correct letters, and they were both fixed, let\'s proceed.\n\n I think ""THANK"" is a good word because it tests T, H, K and keeps A and N in place.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is not present. However, note that in ""THANK"", we are avoiding R? Correct.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""BLANK"" to test B, L, K.\n\n But let me think: which letters are more common? T and H are common.\n\n We can also consider ""PLANT"" but we know E is out and we haven\'t tested P, L, T. However, note that in ""PLANT"", the T is in the last position? But wait, our pattern is _ _ A N _ so the last letter must be the fifth. ""PLANT"" has A in the third and N in the fourth? Let\'s spell it: P-L-A-N-T → positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T → yes, it fits.\n\n However, the feedback said E is absent, so ""PLANT"" doesn\'t have E, but we are avoiding R and C? Yes. Also, note that in the feedback for the first guess, we know E is absent, so it\'s okay.\n\n But wait: we know N is present and correctly placed, and A also. So ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. We haven\'t tested P, L, T.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.\n\n But note: there might be another possibility: the word might be ""BEANY"" but that has E which is absent? No, we know E is absent so any word containing E is invalid.\n\n Therefore, words that have E are excluded.\n\n So ""PLANT"" would be valid? Yes.\n\n But let me compare: ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"".\n\n ""THANK"": T in first, H in second, A in third, N in fourth, K in fifth. Letters: T, H, A, N, K → A and N are known, so we are testing T, H, K.\n\n ""PLANT"": P in first, L in second, A in third, N in fourth, T in fifth. Letters: P, L, A, N, T → testing P, L, T.\n\n Both are valid and avoid C, R, E.\n\n Which one to pick? We might consider letter frequency.\n\n Common letters in English: E (but we know E is absent), then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. But R is absent.\n\n So ignoring R and E: T, A, O, I, N, S, H.\n\n We have already A and N. So next common: T, O, I, S, H.\n\n In ""THANK"": T, H, K → we cover T and H (two common letters) and K (less common).\n In ""PLANT"": P, L, T → T is common, L is common, P is less common.\n\n T is in both. So we are testing H in ""THANK"", and L and P in ""PLANT"". L is more common than P? Yes.\n\n But note: we are testing the positions too. In ""THANK"", we are putting T in the first position and H in the second. In ""PLANT"", P in first and L in second.\n\n How common are letters in the first position? Typically, T, S, C, P, A, etc. But we know A cannot be in the first? Actually, we don\'t know. The secret word could have A elsewhere? But we have A fixed in third, so the first letter cannot be A because it would be a duplicate? Not necessarily. So actually, the first letter might be any letter that is not C, R, E? Or A? Because if A were in the first position, and we already have one A in third, that would be a duplicate. But we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback? So we don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s.\n\n Therefore, we can\'t rule out A in the first? Actually, the feedback we have for ""crane"" showed that A was correct in position 3 and the rest were not. So if A were also in the secret word in position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A in the first position (if present) would have been marked as either correct (if it matched) or present (if in wrong position). But we got C(x) meaning that the first letter is not A? How?\n\n Wait: in the secret word, if there are two A\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"", we have A only in position 3. So the A in position 3 is correctly placed. If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then the letter in position 1 of our guess is C, which is not A, so the secret word\'s letter at position 1 is not the same as our guess. But that doesn\'t tell us if there\'s an A elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks are per letter in the guess:\n\n   - The A in position 3 was marked with ✓ because it matches the secret word at that position.\n   - If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then when we guessed a C in position 1, that would be marked as x (because it\'s C and not A) but then the A in the secret word at position 1 would not be accounted for? Actually, no: the feedback for duplicates: each instance is considered separately. So for the secret word having two A\'s: \n        - The A in the third position of the guess matches the third of the secret, so marked ✓.\n        - Then, the first letter of the secret is A, but we provided C, so that gets an x. \n        - The fact that there\'s an A elsewhere does not change the marking of the C? Correct.\n\n But also, the duplicate A would result in one more A that hasn\'t been guessed? Actually, no. We guessed only one A (at position 3) and it matched. If the secret has two A\'s, then there is still one A that hasn\'t been guessed? And it would appear in the feedback? Only if we had guessed an A in that position? No.\n\n Example: secret = ""APPLE"". Guess = ""CRANE"":\n   Position 1: C vs A → A is present but not at position 1? Actually no: the secret word has an A at position 1. Our guess has C. That\'s a non-match. Since we don\'t have A anywhere else in the guess at that point? Then the feedback would mark C as x. Then the A in secret word is not matched by any letter in the guess? However, in Wordle rules, for duplicate letters: \n   - When a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark any occurrence that matches the secret as ✓, and if there is an occurrence in a wrong position, it will be marked with -, but only up to the number of occurrences.\n\n Example: secret ""APPLE"", guess ""CRANE"":\n   Position 1: C vs A → x (because C is not A and not in the word; but A is in the word? But we haven\'t guessed A elsewhere? Actually, we guessed A only at position 3? \n   So: \n        Position 1: C -> not A -> x (and the secret has A at position 1, but it doesn\'t count unless we guess it elsewhere? )\n   Then position 3: we guess A and the secret has P at position 3? Wait, no: secret ""APPLE"" -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E. \n   Our guess: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).\n\n   Now what happens?\n     Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the word? Actually, C is not in the secret, so x.\n     Position 2: R vs P → R is not in the secret? So x.\n     Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? But wait, no: secret has A in the first position. Since we didn\'t guess any A in an unmatched position? Actually, the A we guessed in position 3 is evaluated: the secret at position 3 is P, which is not A. Then the entire secret word has one A (in position 1) that isn\'t matched? So the A in position 3 would get a ""-"" ? Because the secret has an A elsewhere? And this is the first time we guessed A?\n\n   So the rule: \n        The letter in the guess gets a ✓ if it matches the same position in the secret.\n        Otherwise, it gets a - if the letter is present in the secret in a not-yet-matched position? But note: the number of - marks is limited by the frequency.\n\n   In the example of secret ""APPLE"" and guess ""CRANE"":\n        Secret: A P P L E\n        Guess:  C R A N E\n\n        Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the secret? Actually, the secret doesn\'t have C → x.\n        Position 2: R is not in secret → x.\n        Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? Wait, secret has A only at position 1? And we haven\'t matched it? Actually, the secret has one A. So if we have an A in our guess in an incorrect position, it would be marked as - because there is an unmatched A in the secret? But position 3: we have A, and the secret at position 3 is P. So it\'s an A that isn\'t in the correct position. And the secret has an A at position 1. Since we haven\'t guessed position 1 correctly? The feedback should mark the A in guess at position 3 as present but wrong position? \n\n        However, note: in the feedback we got for ""crane"" with the actual secret word (which we don\'t know), we had A as ✓ and not a -. That means that the A was correctly placed. Therefore, if the secret had another A elsewhere, it would have been reflected if we guessed a duplicate A in a different position? \n\n        But in our case, we only had one A in the guess and it got ✓, meaning that the secret has an A in the third position? Then there can\'t be another A? Or can there? Actually, yes, there could be. Because the correct placement of one A doesn\'t block the possibility of duplicate A\'s elsewhere? But we didn\'t guess A elsewhere? \n\n   So for our first guess: the letter A got ✓ so we know:\n        - The secret has at least one A at the third position.\n\n   But it might have more? Then we need to consider in our next guess: if we put an A in another position, we might get more feedback? However, our current constraints are that we avoid C, R, E? So we must avoid those? And we are fixing A and N? \n\n   Since we don\'t know about duplicate A, but we already have A in the third, we don\'t need to test A again? Actually, we can assume that A is fixed? And then if the word has duplicate A, it will appear when we guess? But we aren\'t forced to.\n\n   So back to choosing the word.\n\n   Among ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"", I think either is fine.\n\n   Let me look for more words? Or we can use ""SLANT"": S L A N T → testing S, L, T.\n\n   Now, S is a common letter.\n\n   How about words using common letters: T, O, I, S, H.\n\n   We could try to include O or I? But we are constrained by having to have A in third and N in fourth.\n\n   Words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and don\'t contain C, R, E:\n\n        - BLANK (B,L,A,N,K)\n        - FLANK (F,L,A,N,K)\n        - PLANK (P,L,A,N,K)\n        - SHANK (S,H,A,N,K)\n        - THANK (T,H,A,N,K)\n        - SLANT (S,L,A,N,T)\n        - PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)\n        - GRANT (G,R,...) → but R is absent? So invalid because R is not allowed? We know R is absent.\n\n   We must avoid R? So GRANT is invalid.\n\n   How about ""STAIN"": but note, that would move the A? We have to have A in third? So STAIN has ""ST"" as positions 1 and 2, A in 3, I in 4, N in 5 → but our pattern requires N in the fourth? So ""STAIN"" has A in third? Correct? But it has N in fifth? We need N in fourth? \n\n   The pattern is: third letter is A, fourth letter is N → so positions: \n        1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: N, 5: ?\n\n   In ""stain"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) → that\'s A at position 3, but then I at position 4 and N at position 5. So that doesn\'t fit our pattern? Therefore, we require the letter at position 4 to be N? So ""STAIN"" has I at position 4? Not N. So invalid pattern.\n\n   So only words that have A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\n   Let me think of other words: \n        - MELAN → but M E L A N → E is present? We can\'t use E? \n        - KALAN? That might not be a word? \n - Valid ones: ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""SHANK"", ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", ""SLANT"", ""ALIGN"" → wait: ""ALIGN"": A L I G N → that would break because we have A in position 1? But our pattern requires position 3 to be A? So we cannot use A in position 1? Or can we? \n\n   We must have A in position 3? So in ""ALIGN"": positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N? So position 3 is I, not A? So not matching.\n\n   Therefore, we stick to the words we listed.\n\n   How about ""DWARF""?

And T? Which are common? So maybe ""SLANT"" is a good candidate? \n\n   Also, S is the most common consonant? If we try S in first position? Then L in second? \n\n   Additionally, we note that the fifth letter is being tested: it could be T or K? \n\n   I think ""SLANT"" might be a good choice because:\n        - It uses common letters: S, L, T.\n        - We haven\'t excluded these letters? So we get information about S, L, T in the respective positions.\n\n   And it fits the pattern: S, L, A, N, T → third A? fixed? fourth N? fixed? and fifth T? first S, second L.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""SLANT"".\n\n   But wait: we have already fixed A and N? Is that acceptable? Yes.\n\n   Now, what if the secret word is ""SLANT""? Then we win? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PLANT"" is similar? But ""SLANT"" includes S? Which is more common than P? So let\'s pick ""SLANT"".\n\n   However, we are avoiding letters: we know C, R, E are not in the word? And ""SLANT"" does not contain any of these? Correct? S, L, A, N, T: none are C, R, or E.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\n   There is one more candidate: ""DAUNT"": D A U N T → but wait: we cannot have A in the second position? The word ""DAUNT"": D-A-U-N-T → position 1: D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T → that doesn\'t have A at position 3? So invalid?\n\n   Therefore, our choices are limited? So I choose ""SLANT"".\n\n  Guess: SLANT\n\n<guess>slant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E):\n- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N is in the correct position (4th letter)\n- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word\n\nThe secret word must fit the pattern: `_ _ A N _`, with no C, R, or E.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must preserve A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position\n- Avoid letters C, R, E\n- Include new common letters to gather more information\n\nAfter considering options like ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", and ""SHANK"", ""SLANT"" was selected because:\n- It maintains A (3rd) and N (4th) positions\n- Avoids C, R, E\n- Tests new common letters: S (1st position), L (2nd position), and T (5th position)\n- S and T are high-frequency letters, while L helps test potential consonants\n\nThis guess efficiently probes key letters in critical positions to narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the second guess: ""slant"" → S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - S and T are not in the word at all.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, E are not in the word.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ L A N _

 And we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [not C,R,E,S,T] L A N [not C,R,E,S,T]

 Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn't contain the absent letters.

 We have to choose the first and last letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C,R,E,S,T.

 Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 We also know that the first letter cannot be L (because if it were, then we would have L in the first and second? But we don't have any feedback about duplicates? However, we haven't tested that. But we know L is fixed at the second position, so the first letter is a different letter? So it cannot be L? Actually, it could be L? But if the first letter were L, then the second letter is also L? That would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""slant"" had L as correct in the second position, but if the secret had two L's, we might have seen a different feedback? However, we didn't have an L in the first position? So we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter could be L? However, in the pattern we have the second letter as L, so if the first letter is also L, then the secret word would have two L's? And we haven't seen any indication of that? But we haven't tested it? So we cannot rule it out? Actually, we can: because if the secret word had two L's, and we only provided one L (in the second position) and it was marked as correct, then the other L in the secret word (if in the first position) would not be matched? So in our guess ""slant"", the first letter S was marked as absent. That means that the secret word's first letter is not S, and also, if the secret word had an L in the first position, then we would have gotten a '-' for the S? No, because S is not L? So the absence of a '-' for the first letter doesn't tell us about L? It only tells us that S is not present? 

 Therefore, the first letter could be L? But that would mean the secret word is ""LLAN?""? But that might not be a word? 

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: ? L A N ?

 Known words: 
   - ""BLANK"": but we know S and T are absent? But B is still possible? However, we haven't tested B? But note: the last letter of ""BLANK"" is K, which is not excluded? So ""BLANK"" is a candidate? But we have to check the feedback: if we guess ""BLANK"", we would have:
        Position 1: B (new)
        Position 2: L (correct)
        Position 3: A (correct)
        Position 4: N (correct)
        Position 5: K (new)

   But we also have the possibility of ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", etc.

 However, we also have the constraint that the first letter cannot be S (absent) and the last letter cannot be T (absent). 

 But note: we have more information: the first guess ""crane"" had A and N correct? And now we have L also correct? So the word is ? L A N ?

 We need to choose a word that tests possible letters for the first and fifth positions.

 Since we have three positions fixed (L, A, N) and only two unknown, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and last, and also tests for the possibility of other letters? But we have only two unknowns? So we can try to cover as many possibilities? 

 However, we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 4 more guesses? We've used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

 We can try to guess a word that might be the solution? 

 Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid C,R,E,S,T:

   - BLANK
   - FLANK
   - PLANK
   - CLANK? but C is absent? So invalid.
   - BLAND? but D is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? and the last letter must be a consonant? 
   - BLAND: B L A N D → last letter D? 
   - But note: the pattern is fixed: second L, third A, fourth N? So ""BLAND"" fits? 
   - Also, ""GLAND"", ""PLAND""? not a word? 
   - ""FLAND""? not a word.
   - ""ALAND""? but first letter A? Then we have A in first and third? Duplicate? But we don't know? And also, we haven't tested A in first? But in the first guess, we had A only in third? So if we try ""ALAND"", that would be A in first? But we know from the first guess that the first letter is not A? Because in ""crane"", the first letter C was marked absent? And if the secret had A in first, then we would have gotten a '-' for the A in the first? But we didn't? Actually, in ""crane"", we had A only in the third? So the first letter of the secret is not A? Because if it were, then when we guessed C in first, we would have gotten a '-' for the A? But we got an 'x' for C? And the A in third was correct? So the secret has A only in the third? Or it could have more? But if it had an A in first, then we would have gotten a '-' for the A in the first? But we didn't have an A in the first? We had C? So the feedback for C was x? That doesn't tell us about A? 

   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: 
        C: x → meaning C is not in the word? 
        R: x → R not in the word?
        A: ✓ → A is in the correct position (third)
        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)
        E: x → E not in the word.

   So the secret word does not have C, R, E? And we know the third letter is A and fourth is N? But the first letter could be A? Only if the secret has two A's? But we don't know? 

   However, in the second guess ""slant"": 
        S: x → S not in the word?
        L: ✓ → L in correct position (second)
        A: ✓ → A in correct position (third)
        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)
        T: x → T not in the word.

   So now we know S and T are not in the word? 

   And if the secret had an A in the first position, then in the second guess we would have had a '-' for the S? Because the secret has an A in the first? But we guessed S? So S is not A? Then the feedback for S would be x? And that's what we got? So we don't know if the first letter is A? 

   But wait: if the secret word had an A in the first position, then in the first guess we would have had a '-' for the A? But we didn't? We had A only in the third? And it was correct? So the secret word must have an A in the third? But it might have another A? 

   However, in the first guess, we only had one A? So if the secret has two A's, then the one we guessed in the third was correct? But the one in the first? We didn't guess? So we wouldn't have any feedback for it? 

   Therefore, we cannot rule out that the first letter is A? But we have to avoid S, T, C, R, E? A is not in that list? So A is still possible? 

   But if the first letter is A, then the word would be ""A L A N ?"" → that's two A's? 

   Is that possible? Yes, for example, ""ALANE""? But E is absent? So not. ""ALAND""? But that might not be a word? 

   Actually, ""aland"" is not a common word? But we are playing with a word list? We should consider only valid words.

   Let me list possible words:

        BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, ALANG? (not common), ULNA? (too short), ELAND? (but E is absent) → so ELAND is invalid.

   So possible words: 
        - BLANK: B L A N K
        - FLANK: F L A N K
        - PLANK: P L A N K
        - BLAND: B L A N D
        - GLAND: G L A N D
        - Also, ""KLANG""? but K is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? → so ""KLANG"" would be K L A N G → that fits? But we haven't excluded K or G? 

   But note: ""KLANG"" is a word? It means a sharp ringing sound? 

   Also, ""PLANE""? but E is absent? So invalid.

   ""PLATE""? T is absent? and E? invalid.

   So the candidates are: BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, KLANG, and maybe others? 

   How about ""OLANA""? not a word? 

   ""ILAND""? not a word? 

   So we have a limited set.

   Now, we need to choose a guess that can distinguish between these? 

   We have to pick a word that has the form: ? L A N ? and uses letters that are still possible? 

   We can try to use a word that uses multiple possibilities? For example, if we guess ""BLANK"", then:
        If the first letter is B and the last is K, we win? 
        If the first letter is B and the last is not K, then we get feedback on the last letter? 
        But if the first letter is not B, then we know it's one of the others? 

   However, we have 4 guesses left? So we can afford to guess one of these? 

   But note: we also want to test for the possibility of D? So if we guess ""BLAND"", we test B and D? 

   How about we choose a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple candidates? 

   Looking at the candidates:

        BLANK: B, K
        FLANK: F, K
        PLANK: P, K
        BLAND: B, D
        GLAND: G, D
        KLANG: K, G

   The common letters for the first position: B, F, P, G, K? 
   The common letters for the last position: K, D, G? 

   We see that K appears in three candidates (BLANK, FLANK, PLANK) and also in KLANG? So four? 
   D appears in two (BLAND, GLAND) and also in KLANG? No, KLANG ends with G? 

   So if we can test for K and D? But we can't test both at once? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a K in the last position? Then if we get a ✓ for K, we know the last letter is K? Then the first letter must be B, F, or P? 

   Or if we get an x for K, then the last letter is not K? Then it must be D or G? 

   But we can also test the first letter? 

   Since we have to choose a word that fits the pattern, we can pick one of the candidates? 

   Let's pick ""BLANK"" as a guess? 

   But if we pick ""BLANK"", and the secret is ""FLANK"", then we get:
        B: x (because first letter is F, not B)
        L: ✓
        A: ✓
        N: ✓
        K: ✓ (if the last is K? but in FLANK, last is K? so K would be ✓? 

   Then we know the word is ? L A N K? and we have to figure out the first letter? 

   Then we can try ""FLANK"" next? 

   But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of the candidates? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N ? and avoid C,R,E,S,T? 

   For example, we could guess ""GLAND""? Then we test G and D? 

   But if we guess ""GLAND"", and the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:
        G: x (first letter is B? so x)
        L: ✓
        A: ✓
        N: ✓
        D: x (last letter is K? so x)

   Then we know the first letter is not G and last letter is not D? So it must be one of B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"" next? 

   But we have two guesses? 

   However, we can do better? 

   We can choose a word that uses a letter that covers multiple possibilities? 

   But note: the first and last are independent? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter in the first position that is not in the candidate set? But that might not help? 

   Since we have many candidates with K at the end, and a few with D, we can test for the last letter being K? 

   How? We can choose a word that has K in the last position? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N K? 

   And we can choose the first letter to be one that we want to test? 

   For example, we can choose ""BLANK"" to test B and K? 

   Or we can choose ""KLANG"" to test K and G? But ""KLANG"" has K in the first and G in the last? 

   If we guess ""KLANG"":
        Position 1: K? 
        Position 2: L (correct)
        Position 3: A (correct)
        Position 4: N (correct)
        Position 5: G?

   Then if the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:
        K: x (first letter is B? so x) and G: x (last letter is K? so x) → then we know the first letter is not K and last letter is not G? So it must be B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", or ""PLANK""? 

   But we have three possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? So we can do it? 

   However, we might get lucky? 

   But let's think of a word that can test multiple first letters? 

   We cannot because the first letter is only one? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't fix the last letter to K? But we have to? 

   Another idea: we can use a word that has a duplicate letter? But we don't know? 

   Given the constraints, I think it's efficient to guess one of the candidates? 

   Let's choose the most common word? Or one that covers common letters? 

   ""BLANK"" is a common word? 

   But we can also consider letter frequency? 

   The first letter: among the candidates, B, F, P, G, K? 
        B is more common than F, P, G, K? 

   The last letter: K, D, G? 
        K is more common than D and G? 

   So ""BLANK"" has B and K? Both common? 

   Therefore, I choose ""BLANK"" as the next guess.

   But note: we are avoiding S, T, C, R, E? and ""BLANK"" has B, L, A, N, K? which are all allowed? 

   So guess: BLANK

   If we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us about B and K? 

   Let's do it.

<guess>blank</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(correct position), E(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - A is the 3rd letter.  
  - N is the 4th letter.  
  - C, R, E are **not** in the word.  
  Secret pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → Feedback: S(absent), L(correct position), A(correct position), N(correct position), T(absent).  
  This adds:  
  - L is the 2nd letter.  
  - S and T are **not** in the word.  
  Updated secret pattern: `_ L A N _`, with absent letters: **C, R, E, S, T**.

### Deductions:
- The secret word is `? L A N ?`, where:
  - The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters are fixed as **L**, **A**, **N**.
  - The 1st and 5th letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, E, S, T).
- Possible candidates include: **BLANK**, **FLANK**, **PLANK**, **BLAND**, **GLAND**, **KLANG** (valid English words fitting the pattern and constraints).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency consonants for the 1st and 5th positions to narrow down candidates.
- **""BLANK""** is chosen because:
  - It tests **B** (common 1st-letter candidate) and **K** (common 5th-letter candidate).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, T).
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B/K will eliminate multiple candidates at once (e.g., if B is absent, FLANK/PLANK/KLANG become more likely; if K is absent, BLAND/GLAND are prioritized).

<guess>blank</guess>",blank,"We are given feedback from the second guess: ""slant"" → S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - S and T are not in the word at all.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, E are not in the word.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ L A N _

 And we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [not C,R,E,S,T] L A N [not C,R,E,S,T]

 Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn't contain the absent letters.

 We have to choose the first and last letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C,R,E,S,T.

 Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 We also know that the first letter cannot be L (because if it were, then we would have L in the first and second? But we don't have any feedback about duplicates? However, we haven't tested that. But we know L is fixed at the second position, so the first letter is a different letter? So it cannot be L? Actually, it could be L? But if the first letter were L, then the second letter is also L? That would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""slant"" had L as correct in the second position, but if the secret had two L's, we might have seen a different feedback? However, we didn't have an L in the first position? So we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter could be L? However, in the pattern we have the second letter as L, so if the first letter is also L, then the secret word would have two L's? And we haven't seen any indication of that? But we haven't tested it? So we cannot rule it out? Actually, we can: because if the secret word had two L's, and we only provided one L (in the second position) and it was marked as correct, then the other L in the secret word (if in the first position) would not be matched? So in our guess ""slant"", the first letter S was marked as absent. That means that the secret word's first letter is not S, and also, if the secret word had an L in the first position, then we would have gotten a '-' for the S? No, because S is not L? So the absence of a '-' for the first letter doesn't tell us about L? It only tells us that S is not present? 

 Therefore, the first letter could be L? But that would mean the secret word is ""LLAN?""? But that might not be a word? 

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: ? L A N ?

 Known words: 
   - ""BLANK"": but we know S and T are absent? But B is still possible? However, we haven't tested B? But note: the last letter of ""BLANK"" is K, which is not excluded? So ""BLANK"" is a candidate? But we have to check the feedback: if we guess ""BLANK"", we would have:
        Position 1: B (new)
        Position 2: L (correct)
        Position 3: A (correct)
        Position 4: N (correct)
        Position 5: K (new)

   But we also have the possibility of ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", etc.

 However, we also have the constraint that the first letter cannot be S (absent) and the last letter cannot be T (absent). 

 But note: we have more information: the first guess ""crane"" had A and N correct? And now we have L also correct? So the word is ? L A N ?

 We need to choose a word that tests possible letters for the first and fifth positions.

 Since we have three positions fixed (L, A, N) and only two unknown, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and last, and also tests for the possibility of other letters? But we have only two unknowns? So we can try to cover as many possibilities? 

 However, we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 4 more guesses? We've used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

 We can try to guess a word that might be the solution? 

 Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid C,R,E,S,T:

   - BLANK
   - FLANK
   - PLANK
   - CLANK? but C is absent? So invalid.
   - BLAND? but D is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? and the last letter must be a consonant? 
   - BLAND: B L A N D → last letter D? 
   - But note: the pattern is fixed: second L, third A, fourth N? So ""BLAND"" fits? 
   - Also, ""GLAND"", ""PLAND""? not a word? 
   - ""FLAND""? not a word.
   - ""ALAND""? but first letter A? Then we have A in first and third? Duplicate? But we don't know? And also, we haven't tested A in first? But in the first guess, we had A only in third? So if we try ""ALAND"", that would be A in first? But we know from the first guess that the first letter is not A? Because in ""crane"", the first letter C was marked absent? And if the secret had A in first, then we would have gotten a '-' for the A in the first? But we didn't? Actually, in ""crane"", we had A only in the third? So the first letter of the secret is not A? Because if it were, then when we guessed C in first, we would have gotten a '-' for the A? But we got an 'x' for C? And the A in third was correct? So the secret has A only in the third? Or it could have more? But if it had an A in first, then we would have gotten a '-' for the A in the first? But we didn't have an A in the first? We had C? So the feedback for C was x? That doesn't tell us about A? 

   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: 
        C: x → meaning C is not in the word? 
        R: x → R not in the word?
        A: ✓ → A is in the correct position (third)
        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)
        E: x → E not in the word.

   So the secret word does not have C, R, E? And we know the third letter is A and fourth is N? But the first letter could be A? Only if the secret has two A's? But we don't know? 

   However, in the second guess ""slant"": 
        S: x → S not in the word?
        L: ✓ → L in correct position (second)
        A: ✓ → A in correct position (third)
        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)
        T: x → T not in the word.

   So now we know S and T are not in the word? 

   And if the secret had an A in the first position, then in the second guess we would have had a '-' for the S? Because the secret has an A in the first? But we guessed S? So S is not A? Then the feedback for S would be x? And that's what we got? So we don't know if the first letter is A? 

   But wait: if the secret word had an A in the first position, then in the first guess we would have had a '-' for the A? But we didn't? We had A only in the third? And it was correct? So the secret word must have an A in the third? But it might have another A? 

   However, in the first guess, we only had one A? So if the secret has two A's, then the one we guessed in the third was correct? But the one in the first? We didn't guess? So we wouldn't have any feedback for it? 

   Therefore, we cannot rule out that the first letter is A? But we have to avoid S, T, C, R, E? A is not in that list? So A is still possible? 

   But if the first letter is A, then the word would be ""A L A N ?"" → that's two A's? 

   Is that possible? Yes, for example, ""ALANE""? But E is absent? So not. ""ALAND""? But that might not be a word? 

   Actually, ""aland"" is not a common word? But we are playing with a word list? We should consider only valid words.

   Let me list possible words:

        BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, ALANG? (not common), ULNA? (too short), ELAND? (but E is absent) → so ELAND is invalid.

   So possible words: 
        - BLANK: B L A N K
        - FLANK: F L A N K
        - PLANK: P L A N K
        - BLAND: B L A N D
        - GLAND: G L A N D
        - Also, ""KLANG""? but K is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? → so ""KLANG"" would be K L A N G → that fits? But we haven't excluded K or G? 

   But note: ""KLANG"" is a word? It means a sharp ringing sound? 

   Also, ""PLANE""? but E is absent? So invalid.

   ""PLATE""? T is absent? and E? invalid.

   So the candidates are: BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, KLANG, and maybe others? 

   How about ""OLANA""? not a word? 

   ""ILAND""? not a word? 

   So we have a limited set.

   Now, we need to choose a guess that can distinguish between these? 

   We have to pick a word that has the form: ? L A N ? and uses letters that are still possible? 

   We can try to use a word that uses multiple possibilities? For example, if we guess ""BLANK"", then:
        If the first letter is B and the last is K, we win? 
        If the first letter is B and the last is not K, then we get feedback on the last letter? 
        But if the first letter is not B, then we know it's one of the others? 

   However, we have 4 guesses left? So we can afford to guess one of these? 

   But note: we also want to test for the possibility of D? So if we guess ""BLAND"", we test B and D? 

   How about we choose a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple candidates? 

   Looking at the candidates:

        BLANK: B, K
        FLANK: F, K
        PLANK: P, K
        BLAND: B, D
        GLAND: G, D
        KLANG: K, G

   The common letters for the first position: B, F, P, G, K? 
   The common letters for the last position: K, D, G? 

   We see that K appears in three candidates (BLANK, FLANK, PLANK) and also in KLANG? So four? 
   D appears in two (BLAND, GLAND) and also in KLANG? No, KLANG ends with G? 

   So if we can test for K and D? But we can't test both at once? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a K in the last position? Then if we get a ✓ for K, we know the last letter is K? Then the first letter must be B, F, or P? 

   Or if we get an x for K, then the last letter is not K? Then it must be D or G? 

   But we can also test the first letter? 

   Since we have to choose a word that fits the pattern, we can pick one of the candidates? 

   Let's pick ""BLANK"" as a guess? 

   But if we pick ""BLANK"", and the secret is ""FLANK"", then we get:
        B: x (because first letter is F, not B)
        L: ✓
        A: ✓
        N: ✓
        K: ✓ (if the last is K? but in FLANK, last is K? so K would be ✓? 

   Then we know the word is ? L A N K? and we have to figure out the first letter? 

   Then we can try ""FLANK"" next? 

   But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of the candidates? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N ? and avoid C,R,E,S,T? 

   For example, we could guess ""GLAND""? Then we test G and D? 

   But if we guess ""GLAND"", and the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:
        G: x (first letter is B? so x)
        L: ✓
        A: ✓
        N: ✓
        D: x (last letter is K? so x)

   Then we know the first letter is not G and last letter is not D? So it must be one of B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"" next? 

   But we have two guesses? 

   However, we can do better? 

   We can choose a word that uses a letter that covers multiple possibilities? 

   But note: the first and last are independent? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter in the first position that is not in the candidate set? But that might not help? 

   Since we have many candidates with K at the end, and a few with D, we can test for the last letter being K? 

   How? We can choose a word that has K in the last position? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N K? 

   And we can choose the first letter to be one that we want to test? 

   For example, we can choose ""BLANK"" to test B and K? 

   Or we can choose ""KLANG"" to test K and G? But ""KLANG"" has K in the first and G in the last? 

   If we guess ""KLANG"":
        Position 1: K? 
        Position 2: L (correct)
        Position 3: A (correct)
        Position 4: N (correct)
        Position 5: G?

   Then if the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:
        K: x (first letter is B? so x) and G: x (last letter is K? so x) → then we know the first letter is not K and last letter is not G? So it must be B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", or ""PLANK""? 

   But we have three possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? So we can do it? 

   However, we might get lucky? 

   But let's think of a word that can test multiple first letters? 

   We cannot because the first letter is only one? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't fix the last letter to K? But we have to? 

   Another idea: we can use a word that has a duplicate letter? But we don't know? 

   Given the constraints, I think it's efficient to guess one of the candidates? 

   Let's choose the most common word? Or one that covers common letters? 

   ""BLANK"" is a common word? 

   But we can also consider letter frequency? 

   The first letter: among the candidates, B, F, P, G, K? 
        B is more common than F, P, G, K? 

   The last letter: K, D, G? 
        K is more common than D and G? 

   So ""BLANK"" has B and K? Both common? 

   Therefore, I choose ""BLANK"" as the next guess.

   But note: we are avoiding S, T, C, R, E? and ""BLANK"" has B, L, A, N, K? which are all allowed? 

   So guess: BLANK

   If we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us about B and K? 

   Let's do it.

<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(correct position), E(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - A is the 3rd letter.  
  - N is the 4th letter.  
  - C, R, E are **not** in the word.  
  Secret pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → Feedback: S(absent), L(correct position), A(correct position), N(correct position), T(absent).  
  This adds:  
  - L is the 2nd letter.  
  - S and T are **not** in the word.  
  Updated secret pattern: `_ L A N _`, with absent letters: **C, R, E, S, T**.

### Deductions:
- The secret word is `? L A N ?`, where:
  - The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters are fixed as **L**, **A**, **N**.
  - The 1st and 5th letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, E, S, T).
- Possible candidates include: **BLANK**, **FLANK**, **PLANK**, **BLAND**, **GLAND**, **KLANG** (valid English words fitting the pattern and constraints).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency consonants for the 1st and 5th positions to narrow down candidates.
- **""BLANK""** is chosen because:
  - It tests **B** (common 1st-letter candidate) and **K** (common 5th-letter candidate).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, T).
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B/K will eliminate multiple candidates at once (e.g., if B is absent, FLANK/PLANK/KLANG become more likely; if K is absent, BLAND/GLAND are prioritized).",Guess 3: blank -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,gland,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - C, R, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A and N are correct and in positions 3 and 4, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We also know that C, R, E are absent, so they cannot be in the secret word.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
   - Keep A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
   - Avoid using the letters C, R, E.
   - Try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

 Common letters we haven't tested yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, etc.

 The pattern is: _ _ A N _

 We need to form a valid 5-letter word that fits: ? ? A N ?

 Let's think of words that have A as the third letter and N as forth letter.

 Examples:
   - ""BLANK"": B L A N K → but we know E is absent, but we haven't tested B, L, K. However, note that we are avoiding R and C, so this is okay.
   - ""PLANK"": P L A N K
   - ""THANK"": T H A N K
   - ""SHANK"": S H A N K
   - ""FLANK"": F L A N K

 Since we also want to test new letters, we might choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels that are still possible.

 Let's list the constraints:
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, E (so avoid these)
   - The word must have A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 We can try to use the first two positions to test new letters and the last position too.

 We have two tries so far? Wait, no: this is our second guess.

 We have 5 more tries, so we can be a bit aggressive.

 Let's aim for a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""THANK""? 
   - T: new letter
   - H: new letter
   - A: known and in place
   - N: known and in place
   - K: new letter

 This way we test T, H, and K.

 Alternatively, ""SHANK"" for S, H, K.

 But note: We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't know of any repeats because we only have two letters.

 However, the feedback for the first guess did not show any duplicate markers, but that doesn't necessarily mean there are no duplicates? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the secret word has only one, it will be marked accordingly. But in our first guess, we used each of C,R,A,N,E once. So if we saw two of the same non-existent, we might have seen multiple x's. But we haven't seen any duplicates. The secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, we'll assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

 Since the first guess had two correct letters, and they were both fixed, let's proceed.

 I think ""THANK"" is a good word because it tests T, H, K and keeps A and N in place.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is not present. However, note that in ""THANK"", we are avoiding R? Correct.

 Alternatively, we could use ""BLANK"" to test B, L, K.

 But let me think: which letters are more common? T and H are common.

 We can also consider ""PLANT"" but we know E is out and we haven't tested P, L, T. However, note that in ""PLANT"", the T is in the last position? But wait, our pattern is _ _ A N _ so the last letter must be the fifth. ""PLANT"" has A in the third and N in the fourth? Let's spell it: P-L-A-N-T → positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T → yes, it fits.

 However, the feedback said E is absent, so ""PLANT"" doesn't have E, but we are avoiding R and C? Yes. Also, note that in the feedback for the first guess, we know E is absent, so it's okay.

 But wait: we know N is present and correctly placed, and A also. So ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. We haven't tested P, L, T.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 But note: there might be another possibility: the word might be ""BEANY"" but that has E which is absent? No, we know E is absent so any word containing E is invalid.

 Therefore, words that have E are excluded.

 So ""PLANT"" would be valid? Yes.

 But let me compare: ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"".

 ""THANK"": T in first, H in second, A in third, N in fourth, K in fifth. Letters: T, H, A, N, K → A and N are known, so we are testing T, H, K.

 ""PLANT"": P in first, L in second, A in third, N in fourth, T in fifth. Letters: P, L, A, N, T → testing P, L, T.

 Both are valid and avoid C, R, E.

 Which one to pick? We might consider letter frequency.

 Common letters in English: E (but we know E is absent), then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. But R is absent.

 So ignoring R and E: T, A, O, I, N, S, H.

 We have already A and N. So next common: T, O, I, S, H.

 In ""THANK"": T, H, K → we cover T and H (two common letters) and K (less common).
 In ""PLANT"": P, L, T → T is common, L is common, P is less common.

 T is in both. So we are testing H in ""THANK"", and L and P in ""PLANT"". L is more common than P? Yes.

 But note: we are testing the positions too. In ""THANK"", we are putting T in the first position and H in the second. In ""PLANT"", P in first and L in second.

 How common are letters in the first position? Typically, T, S, C, P, A, etc. But we know A cannot be in the first? Actually, we don't know. The secret word could have A elsewhere? But we have A fixed in third, so the first letter cannot be A because it would be a duplicate? Not necessarily. So actually, the first letter might be any letter that is not C, R, E? Or A? Because if A were in the first position, and we already have one A in third, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? So we don't know if the word has multiple A's.

 Therefore, we can't rule out A in the first? Actually, the feedback we have for ""crane"" showed that A was correct in position 3 and the rest were not. So if A were also in the secret word in position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A in the first position (if present) would have been marked as either correct (if it matched) or present (if in wrong position). But we got C(x) meaning that the first letter is not A? How?

 Wait: in the secret word, if there are two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we have A only in position 3. So the A in position 3 is correctly placed. If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then the letter in position 1 of our guess is C, which is not A, so the secret word's letter at position 1 is not the same as our guess. But that doesn't tell us if there's an A elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks are per letter in the guess:

   - The A in position 3 was marked with ✓ because it matches the secret word at that position.
   - If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then when we guessed a C in position 1, that would be marked as x (because it's C and not A) but then the A in the secret word at position 1 would not be accounted for? Actually, no: the feedback for duplicates: each instance is considered separately. So for the secret word having two A's: 
        - The A in the third position of the guess matches the third of the secret, so marked ✓.
        - Then, the first letter of the secret is A, but we provided C, so that gets an x. 
        - The fact that there's an A elsewhere does not change the marking of the C? Correct.

 But also, the duplicate A would result in one more A that hasn't been guessed? Actually, no. We guessed only one A (at position 3) and it matched. If the secret has two A's, then there is still one A that hasn't been guessed? And it would appear in the feedback? Only if we had guessed an A in that position? No.

 Example: secret = ""APPLE"". Guess = ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → A is present but not at position 1? Actually no: the secret word has an A at position 1. Our guess has C. That's a non-match. Since we don't have A anywhere else in the guess at that point? Then the feedback would mark C as x. Then the A in secret word is not matched by any letter in the guess? However, in Wordle rules, for duplicate letters: 
   - When a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark any occurrence that matches the secret as ✓, and if there is an occurrence in a wrong position, it will be marked with -, but only up to the number of occurrences.

 Example: secret ""APPLE"", guess ""CRANE"":
   Position 1: C vs A → x (because C is not A and not in the word; but A is in the word? But we haven't guessed A elsewhere? Actually, we guessed A only at position 3? 
   So: 
        Position 1: C -> not A -> x (and the secret has A at position 1, but it doesn't count unless we guess it elsewhere? )
   Then position 3: we guess A and the secret has P at position 3? Wait, no: secret ""APPLE"" -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E. 
   Our guess: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

   Now what happens?
     Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the word? Actually, C is not in the secret, so x.
     Position 2: R vs P → R is not in the secret? So x.
     Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? But wait, no: secret has A in the first position. Since we didn't guess any A in an unmatched position? Actually, the A we guessed in position 3 is evaluated: the secret at position 3 is P, which is not A. Then the entire secret word has one A (in position 1) that isn't matched? So the A in position 3 would get a ""-"" ? Because the secret has an A elsewhere? And this is the first time we guessed A?

   So the rule: 
        The letter in the guess gets a ✓ if it matches the same position in the secret.
        Otherwise, it gets a - if the letter is present in the secret in a not-yet-matched position? But note: the number of - marks is limited by the frequency.

   In the example of secret ""APPLE"" and guess ""CRANE"":
        Secret: A P P L E
        Guess:  C R A N E

        Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the secret? Actually, the secret doesn't have C → x.
        Position 2: R is not in secret → x.
        Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? Wait, secret has A only at position 1? And we haven't matched it? Actually, the secret has one A. So if we have an A in our guess in an incorrect position, it would be marked as - because there is an unmatched A in the secret? But position 3: we have A, and the secret at position 3 is P. So it's an A that isn't in the correct position. And the secret has an A at position 1. Since we haven't guessed position 1 correctly? The feedback should mark the A in guess at position 3 as present but wrong position? 

        However, note: in the feedback we got for ""crane"" with the actual secret word (which we don't know), we had A as ✓ and not a -. That means that the A was correctly placed. Therefore, if the secret had another A elsewhere, it would have been reflected if we guessed a duplicate A in a different position? 

        But in our case, we only had one A in the guess and it got ✓, meaning that the secret has an A in the third position? Then there can't be another A? Or can there? Actually, yes, there could be. Because the correct placement of one A doesn't block the possibility of duplicate A's elsewhere? But we didn't guess A elsewhere? 

   So for our first guess: the letter A got ✓ so we know:
        - The secret has at least one A at the third position.

   But it might have more? Then we need to consider in our next guess: if we put an A in another position, we might get more feedback? However, our current constraints are that we avoid C, R, E? So we must avoid those? And we are fixing A and N? 

   Since we don't know about duplicate A, but we already have A in the third, we don't need to test A again? Actually, we can assume that A is fixed? And then if the word has duplicate A, it will appear when we guess? But we aren't forced to.

   So back to choosing the word.

   Among ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"", I think either is fine.

   Let me look for more words? Or we can use ""SLANT"": S L A N T → testing S, L, T.

   Now, S is a common letter.

   How about words using common letters: T, O, I, S, H.

   We could try to include O or I? But we are constrained by having to have A in third and N in fourth.

   Words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and don't contain C, R, E:

        - BLANK (B,L,A,N,K)
        - FLANK (F,L,A,N,K)
        - PLANK (P,L,A,N,K)
        - SHANK (S,H,A,N,K)
        - THANK (T,H,A,N,K)
        - SLANT (S,L,A,N,T)
        - PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)
        - GRANT (G,R,...) → but R is absent? So invalid because R is not allowed? We know R is absent.

   We must avoid R? So GRANT is invalid.

   How about ""STAIN"": but note, that would move the A? We have to have A in third? So STAIN has ""ST"" as positions 1 and 2, A in 3, I in 4, N in 5 → but our pattern requires N in the fourth? So ""STAIN"" has A in third? Correct? But it has N in fifth? We need N in fourth? 

   The pattern is: third letter is A, fourth letter is N → so positions: 
        1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: N, 5: ?

   In ""stain"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) → that's A at position 3, but then I at position 4 and N at position 5. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Therefore, we require the letter at position 4 to be N? So ""STAIN"" has I at position 4? Not N. So invalid pattern.

   So only words that have A at position 3 and N at position 4.

   Let me think of other words: 
        - MELAN → but M E L A N → E is present? We can't use E? 
        - KALAN? That might not be a word? 
 - Valid ones: ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""SHANK"", ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", ""SLANT"", ""ALIGN"" → wait: ""ALIGN"": A L I G N → that would break because we have A in position 1? But our pattern requires position 3 to be A? So we cannot use A in position 1? Or can we? 

   We must have A in position 3? So in ""ALIGN"": positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N? So position 3 is I, not A? So not matching.

   Therefore, we stick to the words we listed.

   How about ""DWARF""? Doesn't fit pattern.

   So let's decide: 
        We want to maximize the number of new letters? And we want to cover common letters.

   Common letters not yet tested: T, O, I, S, L, ....

   Among the choices:

        THANK: T, H, K → we test T, H, K in positions 1,2,5.
        PLANT: P, L, T → tests P, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SLANT: S, L, T → tests S, L, T in positions 1,2,5.
        SHANK: S, H, K → tests S, H, K in positions 1,2,5.

        ""SLANT"" includes S and L? And T? Which are common? So maybe ""SLANT"" is a good candidate? 

   Also, S is the most common consonant? If we try S in first position? Then L in second? 

   Additionally, we note that the fifth letter is being tested: it could be T or K? 

   I think ""SLANT"" might be a good choice because:
        - It uses common letters: S, L, T.
        - We haven't excluded these letters? So we get information about S, L, T in the respective positions.

   And it fits the pattern: S, L, A, N, T → third A? fixed? fourth N? fixed? and fifth T? first S, second L.

   Therefore, I choose ""SLANT"".

   But wait: we have already fixed A and N? Is that acceptable? Yes.

   Now, what if the secret word is ""SLANT""? Then we win? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, ""PLANT"" is similar? But ""SLANT"" includes S? Which is more common than P? So let's pick ""SLANT"".

   However, we are avoiding letters: we know C, R, E are not in the word? And ""SLANT"" does not contain any of these? Correct? S, L, A, N, T: none are C, R, or E.

   So let's go with ""SLANT"".

   There is one more candidate: ""DAUNT"": D A U N T → but wait: we cannot have A in the second position? The word ""DAUNT"": D-A-U-N-T → position 1: D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T → that doesn't have A at position 3? So invalid?

   Therefore, our choices are limited? So I choose ""SLANT"".

  Guess: SLANT

<guess>slant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E):
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N is in the correct position (4th letter)
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word

The secret word must fit the pattern: `_ _ A N _`, with no C, R, or E.

For the second guess:
- Must preserve A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position
- Avoid letters C, R, E
- Include new common letters to gather more information

After considering options like ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", and ""SHANK"", ""SLANT"" was selected because:
- It maintains A (3rd) and N (4th) positions
- Avoids C, R, E
- Tests new common letters: S (1st position), L (2nd position), and T (5th position)
- S and T are high-frequency letters, while L helps test potential consonants

This guess efficiently probes key letters in critical positions to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>slant</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess: ""slant"" → S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
   - S and T are not in the word at all.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, E are not in the word.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ L A N _

 And we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [not C,R,E,S,T] L A N [not C,R,E,S,T]

 Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn't contain the absent letters.

 We have to choose the first and last letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C,R,E,S,T.

 Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 We also know that the first letter cannot be L (because if it were, then we would have L in the first and second? But we don't have any feedback about duplicates? However, we haven't tested that. But we know L is fixed at the second position, so the first letter is a different letter? So it cannot be L? Actually, it could be L? But if the first letter were L, then the second letter is also L? That would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""slant"" had L as correct in the second position, but if the secret had two L's, we might have seen a different feedback? However, we didn't have an L in the first position? So we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter could be L? However, in the pattern we have the second letter as L, so if the first letter is also L, then the secret word would have two L's? And we haven't seen any indication of that? But we haven't tested it? So we cannot rule it out? Actually, we can: because if the secret word had two L's, and we only provided one L (in the second position) and it was marked as correct, then the other L in the secret word (if in the first position) would not be matched? So in our guess ""slant"", the first letter S was marked as absent. That means that the secret word's first letter is not S, and also, if the secret word had an L in the first position, then we would have gotten a '-' for the S? No, because S is not L? So the absence of a '-' for the first letter doesn't tell us about L? It only tells us that S is not present? 

 Therefore, the first letter could be L? But that would mean the secret word is ""LLAN?""? But that might not be a word? 

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: ? L A N ?

 Known words: 
   - ""BLANK"": but we know S and T are absent? But B is still possible? However, we haven't tested B? But note: the last letter of ""BLANK"" is K, which is not excluded? So ""BLANK"" is a candidate? But we have to check the feedback: if we guess ""BLANK"", we would have:
        Position 1: B (new)
        Position 2: L (correct)
        Position 3: A (correct)
        Position 4: N (correct)
        Position 5: K (new)

   But we also have the possibility of ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", etc.

 However, we also have the constraint that the first letter cannot be S (absent) and the last letter cannot be T (absent). 

 But note: we have more information: the first guess ""crane"" had A and N correct? And now we have L also correct? So the word is ? L A N ?

 We need to choose a word that tests possible letters for the first and fifth positions.

 Since we have three positions fixed (L, A, N) and only two unknown, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and last, and also tests for the possibility of other letters? But we have only two unknowns? So we can try to cover as many possibilities? 

 However, we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 4 more guesses? We've used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

 We can try to guess a word that might be the solution? 

 Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid C,R,E,S,T:

   - BLANK
   - FLANK
   - PLANK
   - CLANK? but C is absent? So invalid.
   - BLAND? but D is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? and the last letter must be a consonant? 
   - BLAND: B L A N D → last letter D? 
   - But note: the pattern is fixed: second L, third A, fourth N? So ""BLAND"" fits? 
   - Also, ""GLAND"", ""PLAND""? not a word? 
   - ""FLAND""? not a word.
   - ""ALAND""? but first letter A? Then we have A in first and third? Duplicate? But we don't know? And also, we haven't tested A in first? But in the first guess, we had A only in third? So if we try ""ALAND"", that would be A in first? But we know from the first guess that the first letter is not A? Because in ""crane"", the first letter C was marked absent? And if the secret had A in first, then we would have gotten a '-' for the A in the first? But we didn't? Actually, in ""crane"", we had A only in the third? So the first letter of the secret is not A? Because if it were, then when we guessed C in first, we would have gotten a '-' for the A? But we got an 'x' for C? And the A in third was correct? So the secret has A only in the third? Or it could have more? But if it had an A in first, then we would have gotten a '-' for the A in the first? But we didn't have an A in the first? We had C? So the feedback for C was x? That doesn't tell us about A? 

   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: 
        C: x → meaning C is not in the word? 
        R: x → R not in the word?
        A: ✓ → A is in the correct position (third)
        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)
        E: x → E not in the word.

   So the secret word does not have C, R, E? And we know the third letter is A and fourth is N? But the first letter could be A? Only if the secret has two A's? But we don't know? 

   However, in the second guess ""slant"": 
        S: x → S not in the word?
        L: ✓ → L in correct position (second)
        A: ✓ → A in correct position (third)
        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)
        T: x → T not in the word.

   So now we know S and T are not in the word? 

   And if the secret had an A in the first position, then in the second guess we would have had a '-' for the S? Because the secret has an A in the first? But we guessed S? So S is not A? Then the feedback for S would be x? And that's what we got? So we don't know if the first letter is A? 

   But wait: if the secret word had an A in the first position, then in the first guess we would have had a '-' for the A? But we didn't? We had A only in the third? And it was correct? So the secret word must have an A in the third? But it might have another A? 

   However, in the first guess, we only had one A? So if the secret has two A's, then the one we guessed in the third was correct? But the one in the first? We didn't guess? So we wouldn't have any feedback for it? 

   Therefore, we cannot rule out that the first letter is A? But we have to avoid S, T, C, R, E? A is not in that list? So A is still possible? 

   But if the first letter is A, then the word would be ""A L A N ?"" → that's two A's? 

   Is that possible? Yes, for example, ""ALANE""? But E is absent? So not. ""ALAND""? But that might not be a word? 

   Actually, ""aland"" is not a common word? But we are playing with a word list? We should consider only valid words.

   Let me list possible words:

        BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, ALANG? (not common), ULNA? (too short), ELAND? (but E is absent) → so ELAND is invalid.

   So possible words: 
        - BLANK: B L A N K
        - FLANK: F L A N K
        - PLANK: P L A N K
        - BLAND: B L A N D
        - GLAND: G L A N D
        - Also, ""KLANG""? but K is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? → so ""KLANG"" would be K L A N G → that fits? But we haven't excluded K or G? 

   But note: ""KLANG"" is a word? It means a sharp ringing sound? 

   Also, ""PLANE""? but E is absent? So invalid.

   ""PLATE""? T is absent? and E? invalid.

   So the candidates are: BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, KLANG, and maybe others? 

   How about ""OLANA""? not a word? 

   ""ILAND""? not a word? 

   So we have a limited set.

   Now, we need to choose a guess that can distinguish between these? 

   We have to pick a word that has the form: ? L A N ? and uses letters that are still possible? 

   We can try to use a word that uses multiple possibilities? For example, if we guess ""BLANK"", then:
        If the first letter is B and the last is K, we win? 
        If the first letter is B and the last is not K, then we get feedback on the last letter? 
        But if the first letter is not B, then we know it's one of the others? 

   However, we have 4 guesses left? So we can afford to guess one of these? 

   But note: we also want to test for the possibility of D? So if we guess ""BLAND"", we test B and D? 

   How about we choose a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple candidates? 

   Looking at the candidates:

        BLANK: B, K
        FLANK: F, K
        PLANK: P, K
        BLAND: B, D
        GLAND: G, D
        KLANG: K, G

   The common letters for the first position: B, F, P, G, K? 
   The common letters for the last position: K, D, G? 

   We see that K appears in three candidates (BLANK, FLANK, PLANK) and also in KLANG? So four? 
   D appears in two (BLAND, GLAND) and also in KLANG? No, KLANG ends with G? 

   So if we can test for K and D? But we can't test both at once? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a K in the last position? Then if we get a ✓ for K, we know the last letter is K? Then the first letter must be B, F, or P? 

   Or if we get an x for K, then the last letter is not K? Then it must be D or G? 

   But we can also test the first letter? 

   Since we have to choose a word that fits the pattern, we can pick one of the candidates? 

   Let's pick ""BLANK"" as a guess? 

   But if we pick ""BLANK"", and the secret is ""FLANK"", then we get:
        B: x (because first letter is F, not B)
        L: ✓
        A: ✓
        N: ✓
        K: ✓ (if the last is K? but in FLANK, last is K? so K would be ✓? 

   Then we know the word is ? L A N K? and we have to figure out the first letter? 

   Then we can try ""FLANK"" next? 

   But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of the candidates? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N ? and avoid C,R,E,S,T? 

   For example, we could guess ""GLAND""? Then we test G and D? 

   But if we guess ""GLAND"", and the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:
        G: x (first letter is B? so x)
        L: ✓
        A: ✓
        N: ✓
        D: x (last letter is K? so x)

   Then we know the first letter is not G and last letter is not D? So it must be one of B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"" next? 

   But we have two guesses? 

   However, we can do better? 

   We can choose a word that uses a letter that covers multiple possibilities? 

   But note: the first and last are independent? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter in the first position that is not in the candidate set? But that might not help? 

   Since we have many candidates with K at the end, and a few with D, we can test for the last letter being K? 

   How? We can choose a word that has K in the last position? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N K? 

   And we can choose the first letter to be one that we want to test? 

   For example, we can choose ""BLANK"" to test B and K? 

   Or we can choose ""KLANG"" to test K and G? But ""KLANG"" has K in the first and G in the last? 

   If we guess ""KLANG"":
        Position 1: K? 
        Position 2: L (correct)
        Position 3: A (correct)
        Position 4: N (correct)
        Position 5: G?

   Then if the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:
        K: x (first letter is B? so x) and G: x (last letter is K? so x) → then we know the first letter is not K and last letter is not G? So it must be B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", or ""PLANK""? 

   But we have three possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? So we can do it? 

   However, we might get lucky? 

   But let's think of a word that can test multiple first letters? 

   We cannot because the first letter is only one? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't fix the last letter to K? But we have to? 

   Another idea: we can use a word that has a duplicate letter? But we don't know? 

   Given the constraints, I think it's efficient to guess one of the candidates? 

   Let's choose the most common word? Or one that covers common letters? 

   ""BLANK"" is a common word? 

   But we can also consider letter frequency? 

   The first letter: among the candidates, B, F, P, G, K? 
        B is more common than F, P, G, K? 

   The last letter: K, D, G? 
        K is more common than D and G? 

   So ""BLANK"" has B and K? Both common? 

   Therefore, I choose ""BLANK"" as the next guess.

   But note: we are avoiding S, T, C, R, E? and ""BLANK"" has B, L, A, N, K? which are all allowed? 

   So guess: BLANK

   If we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us about B and K? 

   Let's do it.

<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(correct position), E(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - A is the 3rd letter.  
  - N is the 4th letter.  
  - C, R, E are **not** in the word.  
  Secret pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → Feedback: S(absent), L(correct position), A(correct position), N(correct position), T(absent).  
  This adds:  
  - L is the 2nd letter.  
  - S and T are **not** in the word.  
  Updated secret pattern: `_ L A N _`, with absent letters: **C, R, E, S, T**.

### Deductions:
- The secret word is `? L A N ?`, where:
  - The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters are fixed as **L**, **A**, **N**.
  - The 1st and 5th letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, E, S, T).
- Possible candidates include: **BLANK**, **FLANK**, **PLANK**, **BLAND**, **GLAND**, **KLANG** (valid English words fitting the pattern and constraints).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency consonants for the 1st and 5th positions to narrow down candidates.
- **""BLANK""** is chosen because:
  - It tests **B** (common 1st-letter candidate) and **K** (common 5th-letter candidate).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, T).
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B/K will eliminate multiple candidates at once (e.g., if B is absent, FLANK/PLANK/KLANG become more likely; if K is absent, BLAND/GLAND are prioritized).

Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the secret word has only one, it will be marked accordingly. But in our first guess, we used each of C,R,A,N,E once. So if we saw two of the same non-existent, we might have seen multiple x\'s. But we haven\'t seen any duplicates. The secret word might have duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, we\'ll assume no duplicates for now?

However, note that in ""THANK"", we are avoiding R? Correct.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""BLANK"" to test B, L, K.\n\n But let me think: which letters are more common? T and H are common.\n\n We can also consider ""PLANT"" but we know E is out and we haven\'t tested P, L, T. However, note that in ""PLANT"", the T is in the last position? But wait, our pattern is _ _ A N _ so the last letter must be the fifth. ""PLANT"" has A in the third and N in the fourth? Let\'s spell it: P-L-A-N-T → positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T → yes, it fits.\n\n However, the feedback said E is absent, so ""PLANT"" doesn\'t have E, but we are avoiding R and C? Yes. Also, note that in the feedback for the first guess, we know E is absent, so it\'s okay.\n\n But wait: we know N is present and correctly placed, and A also. So ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T.

Yes.\n\n But let me compare: ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"".\n\n ""THANK"": T in first, H in second, A in third, N in fourth, K in fifth. Letters: T, H, A, N, K → A and N are known, so we are testing T, H, K.\n\n ""PLANT"": P in first, L in second, A in third, N in fourth, T in fifth. Letters: P, L, A, N, T → testing P, L, T.\n\n Both are valid and avoid C, R, E.\n\n Which one to pick? We might consider letter frequency.\n\n Common letters in English: E (but we know E is absent), then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. But R is absent.\n\n So ignoring R and E: T, A, O, I, N, S, H.\n\n We have already A and N. So next common: T, O, I, S, H.\n\n In ""THANK"": T, H, K → we cover T and H (two common letters) and K (less common).\n In ""PLANT"": P, L, T → T is common, L is common, P is less common.\n\n T is in both. So we are testing H in ""THANK"", and L and P in ""PLANT"". L is more common than P? Yes.\n\n But note: we are testing the positions too. In ""THANK"", we are putting T in the first position and H in the second. In ""PLANT"", P in first and L in second.\n\n How common are letters in the first position? Typically, T, S, C, P, A, etc. But we know A cannot be in the first? Actually, we don\'t know. The secret word could have A elsewhere? But we have A fixed in third, so the first letter cannot be A because it would be a duplicate? Not necessarily. So actually, the first letter might be any letter that is not C, R, E? Or A? Because if A were in the first position, and we already have one A in third, that would be a duplicate. But we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback? So we don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s.\n\n Therefore, we can\'t rule out A in the first? Actually, the feedback we have for ""crane"" showed that A was correct in position 3 and the rest were not. So if A were also in the secret word in position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A in the first position (if present) would have been marked as either correct (if it matched) or present (if in wrong position). But we got C(x) meaning that the first letter is not A? How?\n\n Wait: in the secret word, if there are two A\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"", we have A only in position 3. So the A in position 3 is correctly placed. If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then the letter in position 1 of our guess is C, which is not A, so the secret word\'s letter at position 1 is not the same as our guess. But that doesn\'t tell us if there\'s an A elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks are per letter in the guess:\n\n   - The A in position 3 was marked with ✓ because it matches the secret word at that position.\n   - If there were an A in position 1 in the secret word, then when we guessed a C in position 1, that would be marked as x (because it\'s C and not A) but then the A in the secret word at position 1 would not be accounted for? Actually, no: the feedback for duplicates: each instance is considered separately. So for the secret word having two A\'s: \n        - The A in the third position of the guess matches the third of the secret, so marked ✓.\n        - Then, the first letter of the secret is A, but we provided C, so that gets an x. \n        - The fact that there\'s an A elsewhere does not change the marking of the C? Correct.\n\n But also, the duplicate A would result in one more A that hasn\'t been guessed? Actually, no. We guessed only one A (at position 3) and it matched. If the secret has two A\'s, then there is still one A that hasn\'t been guessed? And it would appear in the feedback? Only if we had guessed an A in that position? No.\n\n Example: secret = ""APPLE"". Guess = ""CRANE"":\n   Position 1: C vs A → A is present but not at position 1? Actually no: the secret word has an A at position 1. Our guess has C. That\'s a non-match. Since we don\'t have A anywhere else in the guess at that point? Then the feedback would mark C as x. Then the A in secret word is not matched by any letter in the guess? However, in Wordle rules, for duplicate letters: \n   - When a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark any occurrence that matches the secret as ✓, and if there is an occurrence in a wrong position, it will be marked with -, but only up to the number of occurrences.\n\n Example: secret ""APPLE"", guess ""CRANE"":\n   Position 1: C vs A → x (because C is not A and not in the word; but A is in the word? But we haven\'t guessed A elsewhere? Actually, we guessed A only at position 3? \n   So: \n        Position 1: C -> not A -> x (and the secret has A at position 1, but it doesn\'t count unless we guess it elsewhere? )\n   Then position 3: we guess A and the secret has P at position 3? Wait, no: secret ""APPLE"" -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E. \n   Our guess: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).\n\n   Now what happens?\n     Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the word? Actually, C is not in the secret, so x.\n     Position 2: R vs P → R is not in the secret? So x.\n     Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? But wait, no: secret has A in the first position. Since we didn\'t guess any A in an unmatched position? Actually, the A we guessed in position 3 is evaluated: the secret at position 3 is P, which is not A. Then the entire secret word has one A (in position 1) that isn\'t matched? So the A in position 3 would get a ""-"" ? Because the secret has an A elsewhere? And this is the first time we guessed A?\n\n   So the rule: \n        The letter in the guess gets a ✓ if it matches the same position in the secret.\n        Otherwise, it gets a - if the letter is present in the secret in a not-yet-matched position? But note: the number of - marks is limited by the frequency.\n\n   In the example of secret ""APPLE"" and guess ""CRANE"":\n        Secret: A P P L E\n        Guess:  C R A N E\n\n        Position 1: C vs A → C is not in the secret? Actually, the secret doesn\'t have C → x.\n        Position 2: R is not in secret → x.\n        Position 3: A vs P → A is not in the secret? Wait, secret has A only at position 1? And we haven\'t matched it? Actually, the secret has one A. So if we have an A in our guess in an incorrect position, it would be marked as - because there is an unmatched A in the secret? But position 3: we have A, and the secret at position 3 is P. So it\'s an A that isn\'t in the correct position. And the secret has an A at position 1. Since we haven\'t guessed position 1 correctly? The feedback should mark the A in guess at position 3 as present but wrong position? \n\n        However, note: in the feedback we got for ""crane"" with the actual secret word (which we don\'t know), we had A as ✓ and not a -. That means that the A was correctly placed. Therefore, if the secret had another A elsewhere, it would have been reflected if we guessed a duplicate A in a different position? \n\n        But in our case, we only had one A in the guess and it got ✓, meaning that the secret has an A in the third position? Then there can\'t be another A? Or can there? Actually, yes, there could be. Because the correct placement of one A doesn\'t block the possibility of duplicate A\'s elsewhere? But we didn\'t guess A elsewhere? \n\n   So for our first guess: the letter A got ✓ so we know:\n        - The secret has at least one A at the third position.\n\n   But it might have more? Then we need to consider in our next guess: if we put an A in another position, we might get more feedback? However, our current constraints are that we avoid C, R, E? So we must avoid those? And we are fixing A and N? \n\n   Since we don\'t know about duplicate A, but we already have A in the third, we don\'t need to test A again? Actually, we can assume that A is fixed? And then if the word has duplicate A, it will appear when we guess? But we aren\'t forced to.\n\n   So back to choosing the word.\n\n   Among ""THANK"" and ""PLANT"", I think either is fine.\n\n   Let me look for more words? Or we can use ""SLANT"": S L A N T → testing S, L, T.\n\n   Now, S is a common letter.\n\n   How about words using common letters: T, O, I, S, H.\n\n   We could try to include O or I? But we are constrained by having to have A in third and N in fourth.\n\n   Words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and don\'t contain C, R, E:\n\n        - BLANK (B,L,A,N,K)\n        - FLANK (F,L,A,N,K)\n        - PLANK (P,L,A,N,K)\n        - SHANK (S,H,A,N,K)\n        - THANK (T,H,A,N,K)\n        - SLANT (S,L,A,N,T)\n        - PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)\n        - GRANT (G,R,...) → but R is absent? So invalid because R is not allowed? We know R is absent.\n\n   We must avoid R? So GRANT is invalid.\n\n   How about ""STAIN"": but note, that would move the A? We have to have A in third? So STAIN has ""ST"" as positions 1 and 2, A in 3, I in 4, N in 5 → but our pattern requires N in the fourth? So ""STAIN"" has A in third? Correct? But it has N in fifth? We need N in fourth? \n\n   The pattern is: third letter is A, fourth letter is N → so positions: \n        1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: N, 5: ?\n\n   In ""stain"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) → that\'s A at position 3, but then I at position 4 and N at position 5. So that doesn\'t fit our pattern? Therefore, we require the letter at position 4 to be N? So ""STAIN"" has I at position 4? Not N. So invalid pattern.\n\n   So only words that have A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\n   Let me think of other words: \n        - MELAN → but M E L A N → E is present? We can\'t use E? \n        - KALAN? That might not be a word? \n - Valid ones: ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""SHANK"", ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", ""SLANT"", ""ALIGN"" → wait: ""ALIGN"": A L I G N → that would break because we have A in position 1? But our pattern requires position 3 to be A? So we cannot use A in position 1? Or can we? \n\n   We must have A in position 3? So in ""ALIGN"": positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N? So position 3 is I, not A? So not matching.\n\n   Therefore, we stick to the words we listed.\n\n   How about ""DWARF""? Doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\n   So let\'s decide: \n        We want to maximize the number of new letters? And we want to cover common letters.\n\n   Common letters not yet tested: T, O, I, S, L, ....\n\n   Among the choices:\n\n        THANK: T, H, K → we test T, H, K in positions 1,2,5.\n        PLANT: P, L, T → tests P, L, T in positions 1,2,5.\n        SLANT: S, L, T → tests S, L, T in positions 1,2,5.\n        SHANK: S, H, K → tests S, H, K in positions 1,2,5.\n\n        ""SLANT"" includes S and L? And T? Which are common? So maybe ""SLANT"" is a good candidate? \n\n   Also, S is the most common consonant? If we try S in first position? Then L in second? \n\n   Additionally, we note that the fifth letter is being tested: it could be T or K? \n\n   I think ""SLANT"" might be a good choice because:\n        - It uses common letters: S, L, T.\n        - We haven\'t excluded these letters? So we get information about S, L, T in the respective positions.\n\n   And it fits the pattern: S, L, A, N, T → third A? fixed? fourth N? fixed? and fifth T? first S, second L.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""SLANT"".\n\n   But wait: we have already fixed A and N? Is that acceptable? Yes.\n\n   Now, what if the secret word is ""SLANT""? Then we win? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PLANT"" is similar? But ""SLANT"" includes S? Which is more common than P? So let\'s pick ""SLANT"".\n\n   However, we are avoiding letters: we know C, R, E are not in the word? And ""SLANT"" does not contain any of these? Correct? S, L, A, N, T: none are C, R, or E.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\n   There is one more candidate: ""DAUNT"": D A U N T → but wait: we cannot have A in the second position? The word ""DAUNT"": D-A-U-N-T → position 1: D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T → that doesn\'t have A at position 3? So invalid?\n\n   Therefore, our choices are limited? So I choose ""SLANT"".\n\n  Guess: SLANT\n\n<guess>slant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E):\n- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N is in the correct position (4th letter)\n- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word\n\nThe secret word must fit the pattern: `_ _ A N _`, with no C, R, or E.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must preserve A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position\n- Avoid letters C, R, E\n- Include new common letters to gather more information\n\nAfter considering options like ""THANK"", ""PLANT"", and ""SHANK"", ""SLANT"" was selected because:\n- It maintains A (3rd) and N (4th) positions\n- Avoids C, R, E\n- Tests new common letters: S (1st position), L (2nd position), and T (5th position)\n- S and T are high-frequency letters, while L helps test potential consonants\n\nThis guess efficiently probes key letters in critical positions to narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess: ""slant"" → S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)\n This means:\n   - L is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).\n   - A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).\n   - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).\n   - S and T are not in the word at all.\n\n Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, E are not in the word.\n\n So, the secret word has the form: _ L A N _\n\n And we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T.\n\n Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [not C,R,E,S,T] L A N [not C,R,E,S,T]\n\n Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn\'t contain the absent letters.\n\n We have to choose the first and last letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C,R,E,S,T.\n\n Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: the word must be a valid English word.\n\n We also know that the first letter cannot be L (because if it were, then we would have L in the first and second? But we don\'t have any feedback about duplicates? However, we haven\'t tested that. But we know L is fixed at the second position, so the first letter is a different letter? So it cannot be L? Actually, it could be L? But if the first letter were L, then the second letter is also L? That would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""slant"" had L as correct in the second position, but if the secret had two L\'s, we might have seen a different feedback? However, we didn\'t have an L in the first position? So we don\'t know.\n\n But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter could be L? However, in the pattern we have the second letter as L, so if the first letter is also L, then the secret word would have two L\'s? And we haven\'t seen any indication of that? But we haven\'t tested it? So we cannot rule it out? Actually, we can: because if the secret word had two L\'s, and we only provided one L (in the second position) and it was marked as correct, then the other L in the secret word (if in the first position) would not be matched? So in our guess ""slant"", the first letter S was marked as absent. That means that the secret word\'s first letter is not S, and also, if the secret word had an L in the first position, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the S? No, because S is not L? So the absence of a \'-\' for the first letter doesn\'t tell us about L? It only tells us that S is not present? \n\n Therefore, the first letter could be L? But that would mean the secret word is ""LLAN?""? But that might not be a word? \n\n Let\'s think of words that fit the pattern: ? L A N ?\n\n Known words: \n   - ""BLANK"": but we know S and T are absent? But B is still possible? However, we haven\'t tested B? But note: the last letter of ""BLANK"" is K, which is not excluded? So ""BLANK"" is a candidate? But we have to check the feedback: if we guess ""BLANK"", we would have:\n        Position 1: B (new)\n        Position 2: L (correct)\n        Position 3: A (correct)\n        Position 4: N (correct)\n        Position 5: K (new)\n\n   But we also have the possibility of ""FLANK"", ""PLANK"", etc.\n\n However, we also have the constraint that the first letter cannot be S (absent) and the last letter cannot be T (absent). \n\n But note: we have more information: the first guess ""crane"" had A and N correct? And now we have L also correct? So the word is ? L A N ?\n\n We need to choose a word that tests possible letters for the first and fifth positions.\n\n Since we have three positions fixed (L, A, N) and only two unknown, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and last, and also tests for the possibility of other letters? But we have only two unknowns? So we can try to cover as many possibilities? \n\n However, we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 4 more guesses? We\'ve used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.\n\n We can try to guess a word that might be the solution? \n\n Let\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid C,R,E,S,T:\n\n   - BLANK\n   - FLANK\n   - PLANK\n   - CLANK? but C is absent? So invalid.\n   - BLAND? but D is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? and the last letter must be a consonant? \n   - BLAND: B L A N D → last letter D? \n   - But note: the pattern is fixed: second L, third A, fourth N? So ""BLAND"" fits? \n   - Also, ""GLAND"", ""PLAND""? not a word? \n   - ""FLAND""? not a word.\n   - ""ALAND""? but first letter A? Then we have A in first and third? Duplicate? But we don\'t know? And also, we haven\'t tested A in first? But in the first guess, we had A only in third? So if we try ""ALAND"", that would be A in first? But we know from the first guess that the first letter is not A? Because in ""crane"", the first letter C was marked absent? And if the secret had A in first, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the A in the first? But we didn\'t? Actually, in ""crane"", we had A only in the third? So the first letter of the secret is not A? Because if it were, then when we guessed C in first, we would have gotten a \'-\' for the A? But we got an \'x\' for C? And the A in third was correct? So the secret has A only in the third? Or it could have more? But if it had an A in first, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the A in the first? But we didn\'t have an A in the first? We had C? So the feedback for C was x? That doesn\'t tell us about A? \n\n   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: \n        C: x → meaning C is not in the word? \n        R: x → R not in the word?\n        A: ✓ → A is in the correct position (third)\n        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)\n        E: x → E not in the word.\n\n   So the secret word does not have C, R, E? And we know the third letter is A and fourth is N? But the first letter could be A? Only if the secret has two A\'s? But we don\'t know? \n\n   However, in the second guess ""slant"": \n        S: x → S not in the word?\n        L: ✓ → L in correct position (second)\n        A: ✓ → A in correct position (third)\n        N: ✓ → N in correct position (fourth)\n        T: x → T not in the word.\n\n   So now we know S and T are not in the word? \n\n   And if the secret had an A in the first position, then in the second guess we would have had a \'-\' for the S? Because the secret has an A in the first? But we guessed S? So S is not A? Then the feedback for S would be x? And that\'s what we got? So we don\'t know if the first letter is A? \n\n   But wait: if the secret word had an A in the first position, then in the first guess we would have had a \'-\' for the A? But we didn\'t? We had A only in the third? And it was correct? So the secret word must have an A in the third? But it might have another A? \n\n   However, in the first guess, we only had one A? So if the secret has two A\'s, then the one we guessed in the third was correct? But the one in the first? We didn\'t guess? So we wouldn\'t have any feedback for it? \n\n   Therefore, we cannot rule out that the first letter is A? But we have to avoid S, T, C, R, E? A is not in that list? So A is still possible? \n\n   But if the first letter is A, then the word would be ""A L A N ?"" → that\'s two A\'s? \n\n   Is that possible? Yes, for example, ""ALANE""? But E is absent? So not. ""ALAND""? But that might not be a word? \n\n   Actually, ""aland"" is not a common word? But we are playing with a word list? We should consider only valid words.\n\n   Let me list possible words:\n\n        BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, ALANG? (not common), ULNA? (too short), ELAND? (but E is absent) → so ELAND is invalid.\n\n   So possible words: \n        - BLANK: B L A N K\n        - FLANK: F L A N K\n        - PLANK: P L A N K\n        - BLAND: B L A N D\n        - GLAND: G L A N D\n        - Also, ""KLANG""? but K is possible? But the pattern is ? L A N ? → so ""KLANG"" would be K L A N G → that fits? But we haven\'t excluded K or G? \n\n   But note: ""KLANG"" is a word? It means a sharp ringing sound? \n\n   Also, ""PLANE""? but E is absent? So invalid.\n\n   ""PLATE""? T is absent? and E? invalid.\n\n   So the candidates are: BLANK, FLANK, PLANK, BLAND, GLAND, KLANG, and maybe others? \n\n   How about ""OLANA""? not a word? \n\n   ""ILAND""? not a word? \n\n   So we have a limited set.\n\n   Now, we need to choose a guess that can distinguish between these? \n\n   We have to pick a word that has the form: ? L A N ? and uses letters that are still possible? \n\n   We can try to use a word that uses multiple possibilities? For example, if we guess ""BLANK"", then:\n        If the first letter is B and the last is K, we win? \n        If the first letter is B and the last is not K, then we get feedback on the last letter? \n        But if the first letter is not B, then we know it\'s one of the others? \n\n   However, we have 4 guesses left? So we can afford to guess one of these? \n\n   But note: we also want to test for the possibility of D? So if we guess ""BLAND"", we test B and D? \n\n   How about we choose a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple candidates? \n\n   Looking at the candidates:\n\n        BLANK: B, K\n        FLANK: F, K\n        PLANK: P, K\n        BLAND: B, D\n        GLAND: G, D\n        KLANG: K, G\n\n   The common letters for the first position: B, F, P, G, K? \n   The common letters for the last position: K, D, G? \n\n   We see that K appears in three candidates (BLANK, FLANK, PLANK) and also in KLANG? So four? \n   D appears in two (BLAND, GLAND) and also in KLANG? No, KLANG ends with G? \n\n   So if we can test for K and D? But we can\'t test both at once? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a K in the last position? Then if we get a ✓ for K, we know the last letter is K? Then the first letter must be B, F, or P? \n\n   Or if we get an x for K, then the last letter is not K? Then it must be D or G? \n\n   But we can also test the first letter? \n\n   Since we have to choose a word that fits the pattern, we can pick one of the candidates? \n\n   Let\'s pick ""BLANK"" as a guess? \n\n   But if we pick ""BLANK"", and the secret is ""FLANK"", then we get:\n        B: x (because first letter is F, not B)\n        L: ✓\n        A: ✓\n        N: ✓\n        K: ✓ (if the last is K? but in FLANK, last is K? so K would be ✓? \n\n   Then we know the word is ? L A N K? and we have to figure out the first letter? \n\n   Then we can try ""FLANK"" next? \n\n   But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of the candidates? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N ? and avoid C,R,E,S,T? \n\n   For example, we could guess ""GLAND""? Then we test G and D? \n\n   But if we guess ""GLAND"", and the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:\n        G: x (first letter is B? so x)\n        L: ✓\n        A: ✓\n        N: ✓\n        D: x (last letter is K? so x)\n\n   Then we know the first letter is not G and last letter is not D? So it must be one of B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"" next? \n\n   But we have two guesses? \n\n   However, we can do better? \n\n   We can choose a word that uses a letter that covers multiple possibilities? \n\n   But note: the first and last are independent? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter in the first position that is not in the candidate set? But that might not help? \n\n   Since we have many candidates with K at the end, and a few with D, we can test for the last letter being K? \n\n   How? We can choose a word that has K in the last position? But we have to have the pattern ? L A N K? \n\n   And we can choose the first letter to be one that we want to test? \n\n   For example, we can choose ""BLANK"" to test B and K? \n\n   Or we can choose ""KLANG"" to test K and G? But ""KLANG"" has K in the first and G in the last? \n\n   If we guess ""KLANG"":\n        Position 1: K? \n        Position 2: L (correct)\n        Position 3: A (correct)\n        Position 4: N (correct)\n        Position 5: G?\n\n   Then if the secret is ""BLANK"", we get:\n        K: x (first letter is B? so x) and G: x (last letter is K? so x) → then we know the first letter is not K and last letter is not G? So it must be B, F, P for first? and K for last? Then we can guess ""BLANK"", ""FLANK"", or ""PLANK""? \n\n   But we have three possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? So we can do it? \n\n   However, we might get lucky? \n\n   But let\'s think of a word that can test multiple first letters? \n\n   We cannot because the first letter is only one? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t fix the last letter to K? But we have to? \n\n   Another idea: we can use a word that has a duplicate letter? But we don\'t know? \n\n   Given the constraints, I think it\'s efficient to guess one of the candidates? \n\n   Let\'s choose the most common word? Or one that covers common letters? \n\n   ""BLANK"" is a common word? \n\n   But we can also consider letter frequency? \n\n   The first letter: among the candidates, B, F, P, G, K? \n        B is more common than F, P, G, K? \n\n   The last letter: K, D, G? \n        K is more common than D and G? \n\n   So ""BLANK"" has B and K? Both common? \n\n   Therefore, I choose ""BLANK"" as the next guess.\n\n   But note: we are avoiding S, T, C, R, E? and ""BLANK"" has B, L, A, N, K? which are all allowed? \n\n   So guess: BLANK\n\n   If we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us about B and K? \n\n   Let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(correct position), E(absent).  \n  This reveals:  \n  - A is the 3rd letter.  \n  - N is the 4th letter.  \n  - C, R, E are **not** in the word.  \n  Secret pattern: `_ _ A N _`.\n\n- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → Feedback: S(absent), L(correct position), A(correct position), N(correct position), T(absent).  \n  This adds:  \n  - L is the 2nd letter.  \n  - S and T are **not** in the word.  \n  Updated secret pattern: `_ L A N _`, with absent letters: **C, R, E, S, T**.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word is `? L A N ?`, where:\n  - The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters are fixed as **L**, **A**, **N**.\n  - The 1st and 5th letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, E, S, T).\n- Possible candidates include: **BLANK**, **FLANK**, **PLANK**, **BLAND**, **GLAND**, **KLANG** (valid English words fitting the pattern and constraints).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test high-frequency consonants for the 1st and 5th positions to narrow down candidates.\n- **""BLANK""** is chosen because:\n  - It tests **B** (common 1st-letter candidate) and **K** (common 5th-letter candidate).\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, T).\n  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B/K will eliminate multiple candidates at once (e.g., if B is absent, FLANK/PLANK/KLANG become more likely; if K is absent, BLAND/GLAND are prioritized).\n\n<guess>blank</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: blank -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess: ""blank"" → B(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)
 This means:
   - L, A, N are still correct and in the same positions (2nd, 3rd, 4th).
   - B and K are absent from the word entirely.

 So now we know the secret word is: _ L A N _

 And the absent letters are: C, R, E, S, T, B, K.

 We must avoid these letters: C, R, E, S, T, B, K.

 The pattern is fixed: positions 2,3,4 are L, A, N.

 We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5] 
 where letter1 and letter5 are not in {C, R, E, S, T, B, K}.

 Possible letters for the first and last positions: 
   Remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
   Vowels: O, U, I (but note: we already have A, so vowels are still possible)

 We must form a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern and avoid the absent letters.

 Examples:
   - ""FLANK"": F L A N K → but K is absent? So invalid? Because K is now known to be absent? So we cannot use K? 
   - ""PLANK"": P L A N K → K is absent? Invalid.
   - ""BLAND"": B L A N D → B is absent? Invalid.
   - ""GLAND"": G L A N D → G and D? Both are still possible? 
        - First letter G, last letter D? 
        - Avoids absent letters? Yes: G and D are not in {C,R,E,S,T,B,K}.
        - So ""GLAND"" is a candidate.

   - ""FLAND""? Not a word.
   - ""PLAND""? Not a word.
   - ""DLAND""? Not a word.

   - ""FLANX""? Not a word.

   How about ""ALAND""? But we have to check: 
        ""ALAND"": A L A N D → but we have A in the first position? And we already have A in the third? 
        Is ""ALAND"" a word? It might be archaic? But let's avoid if not common? 

   - ""ELAND"": E L A N D → but E is absent? So invalid.

   - ""ULNAE""? Not matching pattern? Pattern requires 5 letters: _ L A N _ → so ""ULNAE"" would be U L N A E? No, that doesn't fit? 

   - ""HAND""? Too short.

   - ""PLANE"": E is absent? Invalid.

   - ""PLATE"": T and E absent? Invalid.

   - ""FLAME"": M and E? E is absent? Invalid.

   - ""GLAND"" and ""FLANX"" (not word) → so ""GLAND"" is a candidate.

   But wait: what about ""FLANK"" without K? We can't. 

   Another candidate: ""DIANE""? But pattern: D I A N E → but we need L in second? So not? 

   We must have L in second? So the word must be: [letter1] L A N [letter5]

   How about ""WLANA""? Not a word.

   ""YLANG""? Y L A N G → is that a word? Yes, ""ylang"" is a word (a type of tree)? But note: the last letter is G? And we haven't excluded G? 

   So ""YLANG"": Y L A N G → fits the pattern? 

   But we have to avoid absent letters? Y and G are not in the absent list? So ""YLANG"" is a candidate? 

   Also, ""GLAND"" and ""YLANG"" are candidates? 

   But note: ""GLAND"" has D at the end? ""YLANG"" has G at the end? 

   Another candidate: ""FLANS""? But S is absent? And also, the pattern requires the last letter to be the fifth? And S is absent? 

   ""FLAN"" is only 4 letters? 

   ""PLANS"": P L A N S → but S is absent? Invalid.

   ""PLANE"": E absent? Invalid.

   So we have two candidates? ""GLAND"" and ""YLANG""? 

   But wait: what about ""CLANS""? C and S absent? Invalid.

   ""DEIGN""? Doesn't fit pattern? 

   ""FLING""? Doesn't have A in third? 

   So let's list:
        GLAND: G L A N D
        YLANG: Y L A N G

   Also, ""ELANS""? E and S absent? Invalid.

   ""OLANA""? Not a word? 

   ""ILAND""? Not a word? 

   ""ULNAE""? Not matching? 

   So we have two strong candidates? 

   But note: we might have missed one? What about ""FLAME""? But E is absent? 

   ""PLAZA""? Doesn't fit? 

   ""GRANA""? Not matching? 

   So we have to choose between ""GLAND"" and ""YLANG""? 

   How about ""DHOLE""? Doesn't fit? 

   We need to test? 

   We can guess ""GLAND"" to test? 

   But if we guess ""GLAND"", and the secret is ""YLANG"", we get:
        G: in the first? But secret is Y? So G would be absent? 
        L: correct
        A: correct
        N: correct
        D: absent? 

   Then we know the secret has Y and G? But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses both G and Y? But we have to fit the pattern? 

   How about ""GYNAE""? Not a word? 

   We are constrained by the pattern? 

   Another candidate: ""GUANO""? Doesn't fit? 

   So we have to pick one? 

   Let's consider letter frequency? 

   For the first letter: G is more common than Y? 
   For the last letter: D and G? G is more common? 

   But ""GLAND"" is a common word? 

   Also, note: we haven't tested D or G? 

   We can also consider ""DHABA""? Not a word? 

   I think we should guess ""GLAND"" because it's a common word? 

   But let's check: if we guess ""GLAND"", and the secret is ""GLAND"", we win? 

   If not, and we get feedback that G is absent? Then the first letter must be Y? And the last letter must be G? So the secret is ""YLANG""? 

   Then we can guess ""YLANG"" next? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So it's safe? 

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? 

   How about we use a word that doesn't fix the last letter? But we have to? 

   We can try to use a word that has a different letter in the first and last? But we are? 

   So I choose ""GLAND"". 

   But wait: what if the secret is ""FLAME""? But E is absent? So not? 

   So let's go with ""GLAND"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)`  
  - **A** (3rd) and **N** (4th) are correct and in position.  
  - **C, R, E** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → Feedback: `S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)`  
  - **L** (2nd) is correct and in position.  
  - **S, T** are absent.  
- **Guess 3: ""blank""** → Feedback: `B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)`  
  - **L, A, N** remain fixed in positions 2–4.  
  - **B, K** are absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ L A N _` (positions 2–4 fixed as **L, A, N**).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, B, K (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Possible letters** for positions 1 and 5:  
  - Consonants: D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
  - Vowels: I, O, U  
- **Valid candidates** (fitting pattern and constraints):  
  - **GLAND** (G L A N D)  
  - **YLANG** (Y L A N G)  
  - Less common: **FLANS** (invalid, S absent), **PLAND** (invalid), **DHABA** (invalid).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test likely candidates while maximizing new letter coverage.  
- **""GLAND""** is chosen because:  
  - Tests **G** (position 1) and **D** (position 5), both high-frequency letters.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on **G/D** will confirm **YLANG** (Y L A N G) as the solution.  
- Avoids all absent letters and fits the fixed pattern `_ L A N _`.
