We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since there's no prior information, we pick a word that consists of common letters to maximize the information we get.

Common letters in English 5-letter words often include vowels and frequent consonants. A good starting word can be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

I chose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it's a strategic starting word in Wordle. It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C and N), which helps test for frequent letters in different positions. This maximizes the chances of getting informative feedback early in the game.

We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is not in the secret word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the secret word (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not in the fourth position (since in ""CRANE"", N is at position 4, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'N' in it, but not at position 4. Also, we should avoid letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
3. We can use other vowels or common consonants. Since A and E are out, the vowels we have left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, we have many consonants.

Consider that we only know one letter is in the word: 'N'. We want to test other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, and others. But note: we have no information about them.

We also know that 'N' is not at the 4th position. So in our next guess, we can put 'N' in any position except 4, to try to find its correct place.

Since we have to avoid C, R, A, E, and include N, we can think of words that have N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Also, we might want to include other common letters to maximize information.

Possible good next guesses: We can try words like ""LIONS"", ""POINT"", ""JOINT"", etc., but note that:
- We must avoid A and E? Actually, A and E are absent, so we should avoid them. Also C, R.

But let me check: ""LIONS"" has S and O, which are common. But it has E? No, ""LIONS"" is L-I-O-N-S, no E? Wait, no E. But it does have O and S? Also note, E is absent so don't use E.

""LIONS"" contains: L, I, O, N, S. None of C, R, A, E. And N is at position 4? In ""LIONS"", let's index:

Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: O
Position 4: N
Position 5: S

But the feedback for our first guess said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 again, it might be wrong position again, or if the word has N only once and we put it in the wrong place, it might get a dash again. However, we want to move N to a different position to find the correct one.

So ideally, in our new guess, we should put N in a position other than 4.

Let me list positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 are available for N.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

For example:
- Starting with N: N ... but not at position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 for N.

We can have:
- Words with N at position 1: e.g., NOISE, NOBLE? But we must avoid A, E? E is absent, so avoid E.

""NOISE"" has E at the end? Yes, E is absent so we can't use E.

But the secret word does not have E? That's ruled out.

So we must avoid E. Therefore no words with E? Yes.

Similarly, avoid C, R, A.

So, words starting with N: NIGHT, NIGHT has G, H, I, T? All new letters.

NIGHT: Letters N, I, G, H, T. None of C,R,A,E.

N is at position 1? In ""NIGHT"": N is position 1.

But we don't know if that's the right position, but it's allowed since it's not position 4.

Or we could try words with N at the end? Position 5: e.g., WAGON? But WAGON has A? Avoid A. So no.

Similarly, other words: OCEAN? Avoid C and A, and E? So no.

Another idea: WORD ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. N at position 4? But we don't want N at position 4 to avoid duplication? But actually, it's okay to test N at different positions. Since we must try a position other than 4.

In ""POINT"", N is at position 4 — same as before. Since we know N is not at position 4, if we put it at position 4 again and it returns dash, that would duplicate information. So it would be more efficient to try N at a new position.

Therefore, better to try N at position 1,2,3, or 5 but not at 4.

So for ""POINT"", N is at position 4. So skip.

Instead, how about ""TOTAL""? But T at the beginning? Also has A? Avoid A? So no A.

A is absent.

So we must avoid A as well.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Available letters: All others: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But with N included.

Now, a word with N and other common letters: e.g., N at position 1: KNOWN? But has O, W, N? but it ends with N? So positions: K,N,O,W,N? No, ""KNOWN"" has K,N,O,W,N? Actually K-N-O-W-N. So positions: N is at position 2 and 5? That's double N? But we don't know if the word has multiple Ns? The feedback only showed one N? But it could be more? Not necessarily.

In our guess, we can have multiple of a letter? But we need to be careful.

However, in this case, we can try ""SNOWY""? But S and Y? Also has O, W. N is at position 3? ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y, so N at position 2.

Yes, but ""SNOWY"" has no A,E,C,R? Good.

But we don't know about O, S, W, Y yet.

Alternatively, ""POINT"" avoided because N at 4? But let's see.

Another word: ""JOINT"" same.

How about ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S, N at position 3? So not position 4.

And letters: M, I, N, T, S — all new, except N.

Also avoids C, R, A, E.

This seems good because we test M, I, T, S as well.

But S at the end? And T? Also, vowels: I is available.

We could also consider ""POINT"" if we ignore the position, but better not.

Since we know N is in the word, but not at position 4, and we have to avoid E,A,R,C.

Another common approach is to choose a word that has other vowels? Since A and E are out, use I or O or U.

For example, with I and O: words like ""POINT"" but N at 4? We won't know if N is correct elsewhere.

So let's list possible words that have N and not at position 4.

Examples:

- N at 1: NIGHT, NOISY? But NOISY has E? NOISY is N-O-I-S-Y? No E? But Y at end? Also, I and O.

NOISY: N, O, I, S, Y — no forbidden letters? Avoid C,R,A,E: yes, none.

But N is at position 1? We can use it to see if N is at 1.

Similarly, N at 2: such as ""SNOUT"" ? S-N-O-U-T. U is vowel? Has S,N,O,U,T.

Avoided letters: no C,R,A,E? A is absent, so avoid? But U is allowed.

But we need to check if S, O, U, T are possible? Yes.

But we have no information.

Alternatively, ""MINTS"" as I thought earlier.

Or ""PINTO""? P-I-N-T-O: N at position 3? And O? Avoids forbidden? But has O? Yes? PINTO: letters P,I,N,T,O — no C,R,A,E.

Also, we get to test P,I,T,O.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. But with only one known letter, we want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: After avoiding C,R,A,E, common letters include S, T, L, O, N (but we know N is present) etc.

So, including S, T, O might be good.

Therefore, a word like ""TONGS""? T-O-N-G-S: N at position 3? And G? Then we test T,O,G,S.

But we miss I? Might not be essential.

To include vowels, we have O and I. So perhaps a word with I and O?

Such as ""POINT"" but N at position 4: that's bad because we don't want to test position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

For example, if I guess ""POINT"", and if N is the only information, it might give dash for N again? But we won't know other positions.

Better to shift the position.

So let's choose a word that has N in position 1,2,3 or 5.

Let me pick a word with N at 1: e.g., ""NIGHT""

""NIGHT"": N-I-G-H-T

Positions: N at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.

So, N is at 1: not position 4? Good.

We test letters: N (which we know), I, G, H, T.

All new? Yes.

Avoid forbidden letters? C,R,A,E? Yes.

So, ""NIGHT"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""SNOUT"" with S at 1, N at 2? Also good.

But ""SNOUT"" uses U? Less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""POINT"" avoided? How about ""PAINT""? But has A? Avoid A? Yes.

So not ""PAINT"".

Another word: ""JOINS""? But JOINS: J-O-I-N-S? But has N at position 4? Same position.

""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S? Yes, N at position 4.

We don't want that? Because N at position 4 is known to be wrong? Since previous feedback, we know that in position 4, N is not correct? But the word might have N at that position? Wait, no: the feedback said N is in the word but wrong position, so the secret word has N, but not at position 4? Exactly.

Therefore, we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, from the rule: if we put N at position 4, then:

- If the secret word doesn't have N at 4, but has N elsewhere, we get a dash (wrong position) again.

But if we put N at a new position, say position 1, then:

- If N is at position 1, we get correct (✓).

- If N is not at 1, but has N elsewhere, we get dash at position 1 if it is elsewhere? Wait, the symbol: dash means the letter is in the word but wrong position.

So if we put N at position 1:

- If secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓.

- If secret word has N at position 2,3, or 5, we get - for position 1? Only if position 1 of secret is not N? Then it will show dash meaning N is in word but position wrong? 

Actually, the feedback per letter: 

For each position:

- Compare guessed letter to secret letter at same position.

So at position 1: 

- If N is secret letter, ✓.

- If N is not at position 1, but N is in the word at another position, then dash.

- If N is not in word? But we know it is, so it's either ✓ or dash.

In our case, since we know N is in the word, if we put it at a position, it will be either ✓ or dash, depending on whether that position is correct for N.

Therefore, to get more information, we should test N at a position we haven't tried? Only we tried position 4? So we can try position 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for other letters.

Therefore, testing N at a new position is better.

In ""NIGHT"", we test position 1 for N.

Similarly, in ""MINTS"", we test position 3 for N? MINTS: M-I-N-T-S? N at position 3.

Or ""MATHS""? But avoid A? No.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a valid word: available in word lists? We assume it is.

Another common word: ""SOUTH""? But no N? So we must have N? Because we have to include it? Not necessarily? But we know N is in the word, so if we don't include N, we might miss.

But the feedback for this guess might not help? We should include N to confirm or get new info? But we know N is in the word, so the guess must include N? Actually, no: we can guess without N? But if we don't know its position, leaving out N might waste a guess? Because we still don't know where it is? So better to include it? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" is bad because N at position 4? Same as before? Actually ""JOINT"" is J-O-I-N-T? N at position 4? We shouldn't reuse position.

But if we have no better word? We have better.

Another word: ""POINT"" same.

So let's go with ""NIGHT"".

But wait: another option is ""ONION""? But O-N-I-O-N? Two Ns? And O twice? Then positions: so our guess has O at position 1 and 4, N at position 2 and 5? 

But if the secret word has only one N? The feedback might be confusing? For example, if N is not at 2, and not at 5? But it must be somewhere? Still, having multiple same letter might complicate? But doable.

I think for simplicity, using a word with distinct letters is better? But not necessary.

""NIGHT"" has distinct letters? N,I,G,H,T? All distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""MINTS"" has M,I,N,T,S? Distinct? M,I,N,T,S — all distinct? Yes.

Between ""NIGHT"" and ""MINTS"", both are good?

But ""MINTS"" might be better? Because it includes S? More common? But not sure.

We want to cover vowels? Vowels left: I,O,U,Y and consonants.

""NIGHT"" has the vowel I? Yes.

So both have I? ""MINTS"" also has I at position 2.

Actually, ""MINTS"" has M-I-N-T-S: positions: M at1, I at2, N at3? Position 3: N? Not 4? Good.

And one vowel I? But English words require vowels? Well, ""CRANE"" had vowels? But now they are absent? The secret word lacks A and E? So vowels must be I,O,U,Y? So important to test one of those? But in both, we test I.

Also, ""MINTS"" tests S at position 5? S commonly ends words.

Similarly, ""NIGHT"" tests T at position 5? Also common? But might be less than S? Not sure.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but avoid? No, let's abandon that.

Another word: ""JOINS"" has N at position 4? Skip.

""TUNIC""? T-U-N-I-C? But C is absent? Avoid C? Yes? So invalid.

""FUNGI""? F-U-N-G-I? Avoid? Letters F,U,N,G,I — no C,R,A,E? But U? Okay? Includes G,I,U? And N at position 3? Position 3: N? Good.

But ""FUNGI"" might be less common? Might not be in word list? We can assume standard Wordle words? But usually acceptable? Or prefer more common words? I think ""NIGHT"" is common.

So I'll go with ""NIGHT"".

But to be safe, I can choose ""POINT"" but with N at position 4? No better not? Because we know position 4 is wrong? So if we try position 4 again, we get dash again? Not helpful? Whereas new position: if N at 1? If correct, we get ✓? Else dash? But at least we learn about position 1.

Similarly, we'll learn about the letters I,G,H,T? For new positions.

So yes.

Therefore, my second guess: ""NIGHT""

Now, write the code? Response format.

We are at attempt 2.

So, guess: ""NIGHT""

Thus, <guess>NIGHT</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is absent (x), N is present but in the wrong position (-), and E is absent (x). This provides the following insights for the next guess:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not in the fourth position (since it was marked as wrong position in ""CRANE"").
- The secret word does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.
- Therefore, the next guess should include 'N' in a position other than the fourth (to narrow down its correct placement) and avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Choosing a word that maximizes new information:
- Include 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (new positions from the first guess).
- Use common consonants and vowels not yet excluded (e.g., S, T, G, H, I, O, L, M).
- Avoid letters already ruled out (C, R, A, E) and prioritize high-frequency English letters to cover more ground.
- ""NIGHT"" fits well: it contains 'N' in the first position (testing a new spot), avoids excluded letters, and introduces new common letters like G, H, I, and T.

<guess>NIGHT</guess>",NIGHT,"We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is not in the secret word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the secret word (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not in the fourth position (since in ""CRANE"", N is at position 4, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'N' in it, but not at position 4. Also, we should avoid letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
3. We can use other vowels or common consonants. Since A and E are out, the vowels we have left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, we have many consonants.

Consider that we only know one letter is in the word: 'N'. We want to test other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, and others. But note: we have no information about them.

We also know that 'N' is not at the 4th position. So in our next guess, we can put 'N' in any position except 4, to try to find its correct place.

Since we have to avoid C, R, A, E, and include N, we can think of words that have N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Also, we might want to include other common letters to maximize information.

Possible good next guesses: We can try words like ""LIONS"", ""POINT"", ""JOINT"", etc., but note that:
- We must avoid A and E? Actually, A and E are absent, so we should avoid them. Also C, R.

But let me check: ""LIONS"" has S and O, which are common. But it has E? No, ""LIONS"" is L-I-O-N-S, no E? Wait, no E. But it does have O and S? Also note, E is absent so don't use E.

""LIONS"" contains: L, I, O, N, S. None of C, R, A, E. And N is at position 4? In ""LIONS"", let's index:

Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: O
Position 4: N
Position 5: S

But the feedback for our first guess said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 again, it might be wrong position again, or if the word has N only once and we put it in the wrong place, it might get a dash again. However, we want to move N to a different position to find the correct one.

So ideally, in our new guess, we should put N in a position other than 4.

Let me list positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 are available for N.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

For example:
- Starting with N: N ... but not at position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 for N.

We can have:
- Words with N at position 1: e.g., NOISE, NOBLE? But we must avoid A, E? E is absent, so avoid E.

""NOISE"" has E at the end? Yes, E is absent so we can't use E.

But the secret word does not have E? That's ruled out.

So we must avoid E. Therefore no words with E? Yes.

Similarly, avoid C, R, A.

So, words starting with N: NIGHT, NIGHT has G, H, I, T? All new letters.

NIGHT: Letters N, I, G, H, T. None of C,R,A,E.

N is at position 1? In ""NIGHT"": N is position 1.

But we don't know if that's the right position, but it's allowed since it's not position 4.

Or we could try words with N at the end? Position 5: e.g., WAGON? But WAGON has A? Avoid A. So no.

Similarly, other words: OCEAN? Avoid C and A, and E? So no.

Another idea: WORD ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. N at position 4? But we don't want N at position 4 to avoid duplication? But actually, it's okay to test N at different positions. Since we must try a position other than 4.

In ""POINT"", N is at position 4 — same as before. Since we know N is not at position 4, if we put it at position 4 again and it returns dash, that would duplicate information. So it would be more efficient to try N at a new position.

Therefore, better to try N at position 1,2,3, or 5 but not at 4.

So for ""POINT"", N is at position 4. So skip.

Instead, how about ""TOTAL""? But T at the beginning? Also has A? Avoid A? So no A.

A is absent.

So we must avoid A as well.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Available letters: All others: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But with N included.

Now, a word with N and other common letters: e.g., N at position 1: KNOWN? But has O, W, N? but it ends with N? So positions: K,N,O,W,N? No, ""KNOWN"" has K,N,O,W,N? Actually K-N-O-W-N. So positions: N is at position 2 and 5? That's double N? But we don't know if the word has multiple Ns? The feedback only showed one N? But it could be more? Not necessarily.

In our guess, we can have multiple of a letter? But we need to be careful.

However, in this case, we can try ""SNOWY""? But S and Y? Also has O, W. N is at position 3? ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y, so N at position 2.

Yes, but ""SNOWY"" has no A,E,C,R? Good.

But we don't know about O, S, W, Y yet.

Alternatively, ""POINT"" avoided because N at 4? But let's see.

Another word: ""JOINT"" same.

How about ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S, N at position 3? So not position 4.

And letters: M, I, N, T, S — all new, except N.

Also avoids C, R, A, E.

This seems good because we test M, I, T, S as well.

But S at the end? And T? Also, vowels: I is available.

We could also consider ""POINT"" if we ignore the position, but better not.

Since we know N is in the word, but not at position 4, and we have to avoid E,A,R,C.

Another common approach is to choose a word that has other vowels? Since A and E are out, use I or O or U.

For example, with I and O: words like ""POINT"" but N at 4? We won't know if N is correct elsewhere.

So let's list possible words that have N and not at position 4.

Examples:

- N at 1: NIGHT, NOISY? But NOISY has E? NOISY is N-O-I-S-Y? No E? But Y at end? Also, I and O.

NOISY: N, O, I, S, Y — no forbidden letters? Avoid C,R,A,E: yes, none.

But N is at position 1? We can use it to see if N is at 1.

Similarly, N at 2: such as ""SNOUT"" ? S-N-O-U-T. U is vowel? Has S,N,O,U,T.

Avoided letters: no C,R,A,E? A is absent, so avoid? But U is allowed.

But we need to check if S, O, U, T are possible? Yes.

But we have no information.

Alternatively, ""MINTS"" as I thought earlier.

Or ""PINTO""? P-I-N-T-O: N at position 3? And O? Avoids forbidden? But has O? Yes? PINTO: letters P,I,N,T,O — no C,R,A,E.

Also, we get to test P,I,T,O.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. But with only one known letter, we want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: After avoiding C,R,A,E, common letters include S, T, L, O, N (but we know N is present) etc.

So, including S, T, O might be good.

Therefore, a word like ""TONGS""? T-O-N-G-S: N at position 3? And G? Then we test T,O,G,S.

But we miss I? Might not be essential.

To include vowels, we have O and I. So perhaps a word with I and O?

Such as ""POINT"" but N at position 4: that's bad because we don't want to test position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

For example, if I guess ""POINT"", and if N is the only information, it might give dash for N again? But we won't know other positions.

Better to shift the position.

So let's choose a word that has N in position 1,2,3 or 5.

Let me pick a word with N at 1: e.g., ""NIGHT""

""NIGHT"": N-I-G-H-T

Positions: N at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.

So, N is at 1: not position 4? Good.

We test letters: N (which we know), I, G, H, T.

All new? Yes.

Avoid forbidden letters? C,R,A,E? Yes.

So, ""NIGHT"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""SNOUT"" with S at 1, N at 2? Also good.

But ""SNOUT"" uses U? Less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""POINT"" avoided? How about ""PAINT""? But has A? Avoid A? Yes.

So not ""PAINT"".

Another word: ""JOINS""? But JOINS: J-O-I-N-S? But has N at position 4? Same position.

""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S? Yes, N at position 4.

We don't want that? Because N at position 4 is known to be wrong? Since previous feedback, we know that in position 4, N is not correct? But the word might have N at that position? Wait, no: the feedback said N is in the word but wrong position, so the secret word has N, but not at position 4? Exactly.

Therefore, we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, from the rule: if we put N at position 4, then:

- If the secret word doesn't have N at 4, but has N elsewhere, we get a dash (wrong position) again.

But if we put N at a new position, say position 1, then:

- If N is at position 1, we get correct (✓).

- If N is not at 1, but has N elsewhere, we get dash at position 1 if it is elsewhere? Wait, the symbol: dash means the letter is in the word but wrong position.

So if we put N at position 1:

- If secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓.

- If secret word has N at position 2,3, or 5, we get - for position 1? Only if position 1 of secret is not N? Then it will show dash meaning N is in word but position wrong? 

Actually, the feedback per letter: 

For each position:

- Compare guessed letter to secret letter at same position.

So at position 1: 

- If N is secret letter, ✓.

- If N is not at position 1, but N is in the word at another position, then dash.

- If N is not in word? But we know it is, so it's either ✓ or dash.

In our case, since we know N is in the word, if we put it at a position, it will be either ✓ or dash, depending on whether that position is correct for N.

Therefore, to get more information, we should test N at a position we haven't tried? Only we tried position 4? So we can try position 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for other letters.

Therefore, testing N at a new position is better.

In ""NIGHT"", we test position 1 for N.

Similarly, in ""MINTS"", we test position 3 for N? MINTS: M-I-N-T-S? N at position 3.

Or ""MATHS""? But avoid A? No.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a valid word: available in word lists? We assume it is.

Another common word: ""SOUTH""? But no N? So we must have N? Because we have to include it? Not necessarily? But we know N is in the word, so if we don't include N, we might miss.

But the feedback for this guess might not help? We should include N to confirm or get new info? But we know N is in the word, so the guess must include N? Actually, no: we can guess without N? But if we don't know its position, leaving out N might waste a guess? Because we still don't know where it is? So better to include it? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" is bad because N at position 4? Same as before? Actually ""JOINT"" is J-O-I-N-T? N at position 4? We shouldn't reuse position.

But if we have no better word? We have better.

Another word: ""POINT"" same.

So let's go with ""NIGHT"".

But wait: another option is ""ONION""? But O-N-I-O-N? Two Ns? And O twice? Then positions: so our guess has O at position 1 and 4, N at position 2 and 5? 

But if the secret word has only one N? The feedback might be confusing? For example, if N is not at 2, and not at 5? But it must be somewhere? Still, having multiple same letter might complicate? But doable.

I think for simplicity, using a word with distinct letters is better? But not necessary.

""NIGHT"" has distinct letters? N,I,G,H,T? All distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""MINTS"" has M,I,N,T,S? Distinct? M,I,N,T,S — all distinct? Yes.

Between ""NIGHT"" and ""MINTS"", both are good?

But ""MINTS"" might be better? Because it includes S? More common? But not sure.

We want to cover vowels? Vowels left: I,O,U,Y and consonants.

""NIGHT"" has the vowel I? Yes.

So both have I? ""MINTS"" also has I at position 2.

Actually, ""MINTS"" has M-I-N-T-S: positions: M at1, I at2, N at3? Position 3: N? Not 4? Good.

And one vowel I? But English words require vowels? Well, ""CRANE"" had vowels? But now they are absent? The secret word lacks A and E? So vowels must be I,O,U,Y? So important to test one of those? But in both, we test I.

Also, ""MINTS"" tests S at position 5? S commonly ends words.

Similarly, ""NIGHT"" tests T at position 5? Also common? But might be less than S? Not sure.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but avoid? No, let's abandon that.

Another word: ""JOINS"" has N at position 4? Skip.

""TUNIC""? T-U-N-I-C? But C is absent? Avoid C? Yes? So invalid.

""FUNGI""? F-U-N-G-I? Avoid? Letters F,U,N,G,I — no C,R,A,E? But U? Okay? Includes G,I,U? And N at position 3? Position 3: N? Good.

But ""FUNGI"" might be less common? Might not be in word list? We can assume standard Wordle words? But usually acceptable? Or prefer more common words? I think ""NIGHT"" is common.

So I'll go with ""NIGHT"".

But to be safe, I can choose ""POINT"" but with N at position 4? No better not? Because we know position 4 is wrong? So if we try position 4 again, we get dash again? Not helpful? Whereas new position: if N at 1? If correct, we get ✓? Else dash? But at least we learn about position 1.

Similarly, we'll learn about the letters I,G,H,T? For new positions.

So yes.

Therefore, my second guess: ""NIGHT""

Now, write the code? Response format.

We are at attempt 2.

So, guess: ""NIGHT""

Thus, <guess>NIGHT</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is absent (x), N is present but in the wrong position (-), and E is absent (x). This provides the following insights for the next guess:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not in the fourth position (since it was marked as wrong position in ""CRANE"").
- The secret word does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.
- Therefore, the next guess should include 'N' in a position other than the fourth (to narrow down its correct placement) and avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Choosing a word that maximizes new information:
- Include 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (new positions from the first guess).
- Use common consonants and vowels not yet excluded (e.g., S, T, G, H, I, O, L, M).
- Avoid letters already ruled out (C, R, A, E) and prioritize high-frequency English letters to cover more ground.
- ""NIGHT"" fits well: it contains 'N' in the first position (testing a new spot), avoids excluded letters, and introduces new common letters like G, H, I, and T.",Guess 2: NIGHT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,NOISY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since there's no prior information, we pick a word that consists of common letters to maximize the information we get.

Common letters in English 5-letter words often include vowels and frequent consonants. A good starting word can be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I chose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it's a strategic starting word in Wordle. It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C and N), which helps test for frequent letters in different positions. This maximizes the chances of getting informative feedback early in the game.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is not in the secret word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the secret word (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not in the fourth position (since in ""CRANE"", N is at position 4, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'N' in it, but not at position 4. Also, we should avoid letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
3. We can use other vowels or common consonants. Since A and E are out, the vowels we have left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, we have many consonants.

Consider that we only know one letter is in the word: 'N'. We want to test other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, and others. But note: we have no information about them.

We also know that 'N' is not at the 4th position. So in our next guess, we can put 'N' in any position except 4, to try to find its correct place.

Since we have to avoid C, R, A, E, and include N, we can think of words that have N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Also, we might want to include other common letters to maximize information.

Possible good next guesses: We can try words like ""LIONS"", ""POINT"", ""JOINT"", etc., but note that:
- We must avoid A and E? Actually, A and E are absent, so we should avoid them. Also C, R.

But let me check: ""LIONS"" has S and O, which are common. But it has E? No, ""LIONS"" is L-I-O-N-S, no E? Wait, no E. But it does have O and S? Also note, E is absent so don't use E.

""LIONS"" contains: L, I, O, N, S. None of C, R, A, E. And N is at position 4? In ""LIONS"", let's index:

Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: O
Position 4: N
Position 5: S

But the feedback for our first guess said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 again, it might be wrong position again, or if the word has N only once and we put it in the wrong place, it might get a dash again. However, we want to move N to a different position to find the correct one.

So ideally, in our new guess, we should put N in a position other than 4.

Let me list positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 are available for N.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with N in position 1,2,3, or 5.

For example:
- Starting with N: N ... but not at position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 for N.

We can have:
- Words with N at position 1: e.g., NOISE, NOBLE? But we must avoid A, E? E is absent, so avoid E.

""NOISE"" has E at the end? Yes, E is absent so we can't use E.

But the secret word does not have E? That's ruled out.

So we must avoid E. Therefore no words with E? Yes.

Similarly, avoid C, R, A.

So, words starting with N: NIGHT, NIGHT has G, H, I, T? All new letters.

NIGHT: Letters N, I, G, H, T. None of C,R,A,E.

N is at position 1? In ""NIGHT"": N is position 1.

But we don't know if that's the right position, but it's allowed since it's not position 4.

Or we could try words with N at the end? Position 5: e.g., WAGON? But WAGON has A? Avoid A. So no.

Similarly, other words: OCEAN? Avoid C and A, and E? So no.

Another idea: WORD ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. N at position 4? But we don't want N at position 4 to avoid duplication? But actually, it's okay to test N at different positions. Since we must try a position other than 4.

In ""POINT"", N is at position 4 — same as before. Since we know N is not at position 4, if we put it at position 4 again and it returns dash, that would duplicate information. So it would be more efficient to try N at a new position.

Therefore, better to try N at position 1,2,3, or 5 but not at 4.

So for ""POINT"", N is at position 4. So skip.

Instead, how about ""TOTAL""? But T at the beginning? Also has A? Avoid A? So no A.

A is absent.

So we must avoid A as well.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Available letters: All others: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But with N included.

Now, a word with N and other common letters: e.g., N at position 1: KNOWN? But has O, W, N? but it ends with N? So positions: K,N,O,W,N? No, ""KNOWN"" has K,N,O,W,N? Actually K-N-O-W-N. So positions: N is at position 2 and 5? That's double N? But we don't know if the word has multiple Ns? The feedback only showed one N? But it could be more? Not necessarily.

In our guess, we can have multiple of a letter? But we need to be careful.

However, in this case, we can try ""SNOWY""? But S and Y? Also has O, W. N is at position 3? ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y, so N at position 2.

Yes, but ""SNOWY"" has no A,E,C,R? Good.

But we don't know about O, S, W, Y yet.

Alternatively, ""POINT"" avoided because N at 4? But let's see.

Another word: ""JOINT"" same.

How about ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S, N at position 3? So not position 4.

And letters: M, I, N, T, S — all new, except N.

Also avoids C, R, A, E.

This seems good because we test M, I, T, S as well.

But S at the end? And T? Also, vowels: I is available.

We could also consider ""POINT"" if we ignore the position, but better not.

Since we know N is in the word, but not at position 4, and we have to avoid E,A,R,C.

Another common approach is to choose a word that has other vowels? Since A and E are out, use I or O or U.

For example, with I and O: words like ""POINT"" but N at 4? We won't know if N is correct elsewhere.

So let's list possible words that have N and not at position 4.

Examples:

- N at 1: NIGHT, NOISY? But NOISY has E? NOISY is N-O-I-S-Y? No E? But Y at end? Also, I and O.

NOISY: N, O, I, S, Y — no forbidden letters? Avoid C,R,A,E: yes, none.

But N is at position 1? We can use it to see if N is at 1.

Similarly, N at 2: such as ""SNOUT"" ? S-N-O-U-T. U is vowel? Has S,N,O,U,T.

Avoided letters: no C,R,A,E? A is absent, so avoid? But U is allowed.

But we need to check if S, O, U, T are possible? Yes.

But we have no information.

Alternatively, ""MINTS"" as I thought earlier.

Or ""PINTO""? P-I-N-T-O: N at position 3? And O? Avoids forbidden? But has O? Yes? PINTO: letters P,I,N,T,O — no C,R,A,E.

Also, we get to test P,I,T,O.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. But with only one known letter, we want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: After avoiding C,R,A,E, common letters include S, T, L, O, N (but we know N is present) etc.

So, including S, T, O might be good.

Therefore, a word like ""TONGS""? T-O-N-G-S: N at position 3? And G? Then we test T,O,G,S.

But we miss I? Might not be essential.

To include vowels, we have O and I. So perhaps a word with I and O?

Such as ""POINT"" but N at position 4: that's bad because we don't want to test position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

For example, if I guess ""POINT"", and if N is the only information, it might give dash for N again? But we won't know other positions.

Better to shift the position.

So let's choose a word that has N in position 1,2,3 or 5.

Let me pick a word with N at 1: e.g., ""NIGHT""

""NIGHT"": N-I-G-H-T

Positions: N at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.

So, N is at 1: not position 4? Good.

We test letters: N (which we know), I, G, H, T.

All new? Yes.

Avoid forbidden letters? C,R,A,E? Yes.

So, ""NIGHT"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""SNOUT"" with S at 1, N at 2? Also good.

But ""SNOUT"" uses U? Less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""POINT"" avoided? How about ""PAINT""? But has A? Avoid A? Yes.

So not ""PAINT"".

Another word: ""JOINS""? But JOINS: J-O-I-N-S? But has N at position 4? Same position.

""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S? Yes, N at position 4.

We don't want that? Because N at position 4 is known to be wrong? Since previous feedback, we know that in position 4, N is not correct? But the word might have N at that position? Wait, no: the feedback said N is in the word but wrong position, so the secret word has N, but not at position 4? Exactly.

Therefore, we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, from the rule: if we put N at position 4, then:

- If the secret word doesn't have N at 4, but has N elsewhere, we get a dash (wrong position) again.

But if we put N at a new position, say position 1, then:

- If N is at position 1, we get correct (✓).

- If N is not at 1, but has N elsewhere, we get dash at position 1 if it is elsewhere? Wait, the symbol: dash means the letter is in the word but wrong position.

So if we put N at position 1:

- If secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓.

- If secret word has N at position 2,3, or 5, we get - for position 1? Only if position 1 of secret is not N? Then it will show dash meaning N is in word but position wrong? 

Actually, the feedback per letter: 

For each position:

- Compare guessed letter to secret letter at same position.

So at position 1: 

- If N is secret letter, ✓.

- If N is not at position 1, but N is in the word at another position, then dash.

- If N is not in word? But we know it is, so it's either ✓ or dash.

In our case, since we know N is in the word, if we put it at a position, it will be either ✓ or dash, depending on whether that position is correct for N.

Therefore, to get more information, we should test N at a position we haven't tried? Only we tried position 4? So we can try position 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for other letters.

Therefore, testing N at a new position is better.

In ""NIGHT"", we test position 1 for N.

Similarly, in ""MINTS"", we test position 3 for N? MINTS: M-I-N-T-S? N at position 3.

Or ""MATHS""? But avoid A? No.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a valid word: available in word lists? We assume it is.

Another common word: ""SOUTH""? But no N? So we must have N? Because we have to include it? Not necessarily? But we know N is in the word, so if we don't include N, we might miss.

But the feedback for this guess might not help? We should include N to confirm or get new info? But we know N is in the word, so the guess must include N? Actually, no: we can guess without N? But if we don't know its position, leaving out N might waste a guess? Because we still don't know where it is? So better to include it? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" is bad because N at position 4? Same as before? Actually ""JOINT"" is J-O-I-N-T? N at position 4? We shouldn't reuse position.

But if we have no better word? We have better.

Another word: ""POINT"" same.

So let's go with ""NIGHT"".

But wait: another option is ""ONION""? But O-N-I-O-N? Two Ns? And O twice? Then positions: so our guess has O at position 1 and 4, N at position 2 and 5? 

But if the secret word has only one N? The feedback might be confusing? For example, if N is not at 2, and not at 5? But it must be somewhere? Still, having multiple same letter might complicate? But doable.

I think for simplicity, using a word with distinct letters is better? But not necessary.

""NIGHT"" has distinct letters? N,I,G,H,T? All distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""MINTS"" has M,I,N,T,S? Distinct? M,I,N,T,S — all distinct? Yes.

Between ""NIGHT"" and ""MINTS"", both are good?

But ""MINTS"" might be better? Because it includes S? More common? But not sure.

We want to cover vowels? Vowels left: I,O,U,Y and consonants.

""NIGHT"" has the vowel I? Yes.

So both have I? ""MINTS"" also has I at position 2.

Actually, ""MINTS"" has M-I-N-T-S: positions: M at1, I at2, N at3? Position 3: N? Not 4? Good.

And one vowel I? But English words require vowels? Well, ""CRANE"" had vowels? But now they are absent? The secret word lacks A and E? So vowels must be I,O,U,Y? So important to test one of those? But in both, we test I.

Also, ""MINTS"" tests S at position 5? S commonly ends words.

Similarly, ""NIGHT"" tests T at position 5? Also common? But might be less than S? Not sure.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but avoid? No, let's abandon that.

Another word: ""JOINS"" has N at position 4? Skip.

""TUNIC""? T-U-N-I-C? But C is absent? Avoid C? Yes? So invalid.

""FUNGI""? F-U-N-G-I? Avoid? Letters F,U,N,G,I — no C,R,A,E? But U? Okay? Includes G,I,U? And N at position 3? Position 3: N? Good.

But ""FUNGI"" might be less common? Might not be in word list? We can assume standard Wordle words? But usually acceptable? Or prefer more common words? I think ""NIGHT"" is common.

So I'll go with ""NIGHT"".

But to be safe, I can choose ""POINT"" but with N at position 4? No better not? Because we know position 4 is wrong? So if we try position 4 again, we get dash again? Not helpful? Whereas new position: if N at 1? If correct, we get ✓? Else dash? But at least we learn about position 1.

Similarly, we'll learn about the letters I,G,H,T? For new positions.

So yes.

Therefore, my second guess: ""NIGHT""

Now, write the code? Response format.

We are at attempt 2.

So, guess: ""NIGHT""

Thus, <guess>NIGHT</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is absent (x), N is present but in the wrong position (-), and E is absent (x). This provides the following insights for the next guess:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not in the fourth position (since it was marked as wrong position in ""CRANE"").
- The secret word does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.
- Therefore, the next guess should include 'N' in a position other than the fourth (to narrow down its correct placement) and avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Choosing a word that maximizes new information:
- Include 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (new positions from the first guess).
- Use common consonants and vowels not yet excluded (e.g., S, T, G, H, I, O, L, M).
- Avoid letters already ruled out (C, R, A, E) and prioritize high-frequency English letters to cover more ground.
- ""NIGHT"" fits well: it contains 'N' in the first position (testing a new spot), avoids excluded letters, and introduces new common letters like G, H, I, and T.

Since there\'s no prior information, we pick a word that consists of common letters to maximize the information we get.\n\nCommon letters in English 5-letter words often include vowels and frequent consonants.

I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I chose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it\'s a strategic starting word in Wordle. It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C and N), which helps test for frequent letters in different positions. This maximizes the chances of getting informative feedback early in the game.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nInterpretation:\n- C is not in the secret word (x)\n- R is not in the secret word (x)\n- A is not in the secret word (x)\n- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- E is not in the secret word (x)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter \'N\', but not in the fourth position (since in ""CRANE"", N is at position 4, and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n- The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the letter \'N\' in it, but not at position 4. Also, we should avoid letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Contains the letter \'N\' (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the fourth position.\n2. Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are absent).\n3. We can use other vowels or common consonants. Since A and E are out, the vowels we have left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, we have many consonants.\n\nConsider that we only know one letter is in the word: \'N\'. We want to test other common letters that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, and others. But note: we have no information about them.\n\nWe also know that \'N\' is not at the 4th position. So in our next guess, we can put \'N\' in any position except 4, to try to find its correct place.\n\nSince we have to avoid C, R, A, E, and include N, we can think of words that have N in position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nAlso, we might want to include other common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible good next guesses: We can try words like ""LIONS"", ""POINT"", ""JOINT"", etc., but note that:\n- We must avoid A and E? Actually, A and E are absent, so we should avoid them. Also C, R.\n\nBut let me check: ""LIONS"" has S and O, which are common. But it has E? No, ""LIONS"" is L-I-O-N-S, no E? Wait, no E. But it does have O and S? Also note, E is absent so don\'t use E.\n\n""LIONS"" contains: L, I, O, N, S. None of C, R, A, E. And N is at position 4? In ""LIONS"", let\'s index:\n\nPosition 1: L\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: N\nPosition 5: S\n\nBut the feedback for our first guess said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 again, it might be wrong position again, or if the word has N only once and we put it in the wrong place, it might get a dash again. However, we want to move N to a different position to find the correct one.\n\nSo ideally, in our new guess, we should put N in a position other than 4.\n\nLet me list positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 are available for N.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s think of 5-letter words with N in position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- Starting with N: N ... but not at position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 for N.\n\nWe can have:\n- Words with N at position 1: e.g., NOISE, NOBLE? But we must avoid A, E? E is absent, so avoid E.\n\n""NOISE"" has E at the end? Yes, E is absent so we can\'t use E.\n\nBut the secret word does not have E? That\'s ruled out.\n\nSo we must avoid E. Therefore no words with E? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, avoid C, R, A.\n\nSo, words starting with N: NIGHT, NIGHT has G, H, I, T? All new letters.\n\nNIGHT: Letters N, I, G, H, T. None of C,R,A,E.\n\nN is at position 1? In ""NIGHT"": N is position 1.\n\nBut we don\'t know if that\'s the right position, but it\'s allowed since it\'s not position 4.\n\nOr we could try words with N at the end? Position 5: e.g., WAGON? But WAGON has A? Avoid A. So no.\n\nSimilarly, other words: OCEAN? Avoid C and A, and E? So no.\n\nAnother idea: WORD ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. N at position 4? But we don\'t want N at position 4 to avoid duplication? But actually, it\'s okay to test N at different positions. Since we must try a position other than 4.\n\nIn ""POINT"", N is at position 4 — same as before. Since we know N is not at position 4, if we put it at position 4 again and it returns dash, that would duplicate information. So it would be more efficient to try N at a new position.\n\nTherefore, better to try N at position 1,2,3, or 5 but not at 4.\n\nSo for ""POINT"", N is at position 4. So skip.\n\nInstead, how about ""TOTAL""? But T at the beginning? Also has A? Avoid A? So no A.\n\nA is absent.\n\nSo we must avoid A as well.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, A, E.\n\nAvailable letters: All others: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But with N included.\n\nNow, a word with N and other common letters: e.g., N at position 1: KNOWN? But has O, W, N? but it ends with N? So positions: K,N,O,W,N? No, ""KNOWN"" has K,N,O,W,N? Actually K-N-O-W-N. So positions: N is at position 2 and 5? That\'s double N? But we don\'t know if the word has multiple Ns? The feedback only showed one N? But it could be more? Not necessarily.\n\nIn our guess, we can have multiple of a letter? But we need to be careful.\n\nHowever, in this case, we can try ""SNOWY""? But S and Y? Also has O, W. N is at position 3? ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y, so N at position 2.\n\nYes, but ""SNOWY"" has no A,E,C,R? Good.\n\nBut we don\'t know about O, S, W, Y yet.\n\nAlternatively, ""POINT"" avoided because N at 4? But let\'s see.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINT"" same.\n\nHow about ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S, N at position 3? So not position 4.\n\nAnd letters: M, I, N, T, S — all new, except N.\n\nAlso avoids C, R, A, E.\n\nThis seems good because we test M, I, T, S as well.\n\nBut S at the end? And T? Also, vowels: I is available.\n\nWe could also consider ""POINT"" if we ignore the position, but better not.\n\nSince we know N is in the word, but not at position 4, and we have to avoid E,A,R,C.\n\nAnother common approach is to choose a word that has other vowels? Since A and E are out, use I or O or U.\n\nFor example, with I and O: words like ""POINT"" but N at 4? We won\'t know if N is correct elsewhere.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words that have N and not at position 4.\n\nExamples:\n\n- N at 1: NIGHT, NOISY? But NOISY has E? NOISY is N-O-I-S-Y? No E? But Y at end? Also, I and O.\n\nNOISY: N, O, I, S, Y — no forbidden letters? Avoid C,R,A,E: yes, none.\n\nBut N is at position 1? We can use it to see if N is at 1.\n\nSimilarly, N at 2: such as ""SNOUT"" ? S-N-O-U-T. U is vowel? Has S,N,O,U,T.\n\nAvoided letters: no C,R,A,E? A is absent, so avoid? But U is allowed.\n\nBut we need to check if S, O, U, T are possible? Yes.\n\nBut we have no information.\n\nAlternatively, ""MINTS"" as I thought earlier.\n\nOr ""PINTO""? P-I-N-T-O: N at position 3? And O? Avoids forbidden? But has O? Yes? PINTO: letters P,I,N,T,O — no C,R,A,E.\n\nAlso, we get to test P,I,T,O.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. But with only one known letter, we want to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: After avoiding C,R,A,E, common letters include S, T, L, O, N (but we know N is present) etc.\n\nSo, including S, T, O might be good.\n\nTherefore, a word like ""TONGS""? T-O-N-G-S: N at position 3? And G? Then we test T,O,G,S.\n\nBut we miss I? Might not be essential.\n\nTo include vowels, we have O and I. So perhaps a word with I and O?\n\nSuch as ""POINT"" but N at position 4: that\'s bad because we don\'t want to test position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, if I guess ""POINT"", and if N is the only information, it might give dash for N again? But we won\'t know other positions.\n\nBetter to shift the position.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has N in position 1,2,3 or 5.\n\nLet me pick a word with N at 1: e.g., ""NIGHT""\n\n""NIGHT"": N-I-G-H-T\n\nPositions: N at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.\n\nSo, N is at 1: not position 4? Good.\n\nWe test letters: N (which we know), I, G, H, T.\n\nAll new? Yes.\n\nAvoid forbidden letters? C,R,A,E? Yes.\n\nSo, ""NIGHT"" is a valid guess.\n\nAnother option: ""SNOUT"" with S at 1, N at 2? Also good.\n\nBut ""SNOUT"" uses U? Less common, but okay.\n\nPerhaps ""POINT"" avoided? How about ""PAINT""? But has A? Avoid A? Yes.\n\nSo not ""PAINT"".\n\nAnother word: ""JOINS""? But JOINS: J-O-I-N-S? But has N at position 4? Same position.\n\n""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S? Yes, N at position 4.\n\nWe don\'t want that? Because N at position 4 is known to be wrong? Since previous feedback, we know that in position 4, N is not correct? But the word might have N at that position? Wait, no: the feedback said N is in the word but wrong position, so the secret word has N, but not at position 4? Exactly.\n\nTherefore, we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, from the rule: if we put N at position 4, then:\n\n- If the secret word doesn\'t have N at 4, but has N elsewhere, we get a dash (wrong position) again.\n\nBut if we put N at a new position, say position 1, then:\n\n- If N is at position 1, we get correct (✓).\n\n- If N is not at 1, but has N elsewhere, we get dash at position 1 if it is elsewhere? Wait, the symbol: dash means the letter is in the word but wrong position.\n\nSo if we put N at position 1:\n\n- If secret word has N at position 1, we get ✓.\n\n- If secret word has N at position 2,3, or 5, we get - for position 1? Only if position 1 of secret is not N? Then it will show dash meaning N is in word but position wrong? \n\nActually, the feedback per letter: \n\nFor each position:\n\n- Compare guessed letter to secret letter at same position.\n\nSo at position 1: \n\n- If N is secret letter, ✓.\n\n- If N is not at position 1, but N is in the word at another position, then dash.\n\n- If N is not in word? But we know it is, so it\'s either ✓ or dash.\n\nIn our case, since we know N is in the word, if we put it at a position, it will be either ✓ or dash, depending on whether that position is correct for N.\n\nTherefore, to get more information, we should test N at a position we haven\'t tried? Only we tried position 4? So we can try position 1,2,3,5.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nTherefore, testing N at a new position is better.\n\nIn ""NIGHT"", we test position 1 for N.\n\nSimilarly, in ""MINTS"", we test position 3 for N? MINTS: M-I-N-T-S? N at position 3.\n\nOr ""MATHS""? But avoid A? No.\n\nI think ""NIGHT"" is a valid word: available in word lists? We assume it is.\n\nAnother common word: ""SOUTH""? But no N? So we must have N? Because we have to include it? Not necessarily? But we know N is in the word, so if we don\'t include N, we might miss.\n\nBut the feedback for this guess might not help? We should include N to confirm or get new info? But we know N is in the word, so the guess must include N? Actually, no: we can guess without N? But if we don\'t know its position, leaving out N might waste a guess? Because we still don\'t know where it is? So better to include it? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" is bad because N at position 4? Same as before? Actually ""JOINT"" is J-O-I-N-T? N at position 4? We shouldn\'t reuse position.\n\nBut if we have no better word? We have better.\n\nAnother word: ""POINT"" same.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""NIGHT"".\n\nBut wait: another option is ""ONION""? But O-N-I-O-N? Two Ns? And O twice? Then positions: so our guess has O at position 1 and 4, N at position 2 and 5? \n\nBut if the secret word has only one N? The feedback might be confusing? For example, if N is not at 2, and not at 5? But it must be somewhere? Still, having multiple same letter might complicate? But doable.\n\nI think for simplicity, using a word with distinct letters is better? But not necessary.\n\n""NIGHT"" has distinct letters? N,I,G,H,T? All distinct? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINTS"" has M,I,N,T,S? Distinct? M,I,N,T,S — all distinct? Yes.\n\nBetween ""NIGHT"" and ""MINTS"", both are good?\n\nBut ""MINTS"" might be better? Because it includes S? More common? But not sure.\n\nWe want to cover vowels? Vowels left: I,O,U,Y and consonants.\n\n""NIGHT"" has the vowel I? Yes.\n\nSo both have I? ""MINTS"" also has I at position 2.\n\nActually, ""MINTS"" has M-I-N-T-S: positions: M at1, I at2, N at3? Position 3: N? Not 4? Good.\n\nAnd one vowel I? But English words require vowels? Well, ""CRANE"" had vowels? But now they are absent? The secret word lacks A and E? So vowels must be I,O,U,Y? So important to test one of those? But in both, we test I.\n\nAlso, ""MINTS"" tests S at position 5? S commonly ends words.\n\nSimilarly, ""NIGHT"" tests T at position 5? Also common? But might be less than S? Not sure.\n\nI could also consider ""POINT"" but avoid? No, let\'s abandon that.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINS"" has N at position 4? Skip.\n\n""TUNIC""? T-U-N-I-C? But C is absent? Avoid C? Yes? So invalid.\n\n""FUNGI""? F-U-N-G-I? Avoid? Letters F,U,N,G,I — no C,R,A,E? But U? Okay? Includes G,I,U? And N at position 3? Position 3: N? Good.\n\nBut ""FUNGI"" might be less common? Might not be in word list? We can assume standard Wordle words? But usually acceptable? Or prefer more common words? I think ""NIGHT"" is common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NIGHT"".\n\nBut to be safe, I can choose ""POINT"" but with N at position 4? No better not? Because we know position 4 is wrong? So if we try position 4 again, we get dash again? Not helpful? Whereas new position: if N at 1? If correct, we get ✓? Else dash? But at least we learn about position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we\'ll learn about the letters I,G,H,T? For new positions.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, my second guess: ""NIGHT""\n\nNow, write the code? Response format.\n\nWe are at attempt 2.\n\nSo, guess: ""NIGHT""\n\nThus, <guess>NIGHT</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is absent (x), N is present but in the wrong position (-), and E is absent (x). This provides the following insights for the next guess:\n- The secret word contains the letter \'N\', but not in the fourth position (since it was marked as wrong position in ""CRANE"").\n- The secret word does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.\n- Therefore, the next guess should include \'N\' in a position other than the fourth (to narrow down its correct placement) and avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nChoosing a word that maximizes new information:\n- Include \'N\' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (new positions from the first guess).\n- Use common consonants and vowels not yet excluded (e.g., S, T, G, H, I, O, L, M).\n- Avoid letters already ruled out (C, R, A, E) and prioritize high-frequency English letters to cover more ground.\n- ""NIGHT"" fits well: it contains \'N\' in the first position (testing a new spot), avoids excluded letters, and introduces new common letters like G, H, I, and T.\n\n<guess>NIGHT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: NIGHT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (since in CRANE it was at position 4).

Guess 2: NIGHT -> N(✓), I(-), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- N is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with N.
- I is present but not in position 2 (since in NIGHT it was at position 2).
- G, H, T are absent.

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word starts with N.
- The secret word contains I, but not in position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, G, H, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know N is not at position 4, but now we have it at position 1 and correct, so that's consistent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with N.
- Contains I (but not in position 2).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, G, H, T.

Available letters: We have to use letters from the remaining set. The English alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, R, A, E, G, H, T.

Available: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: N is fixed at position 1, and I must be included but not at position 2.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We can think of words starting with N and having I in positions 3, 4, or 5? But not position 2.

Also, we should avoid the excluded letters.

Let's consider possible positions for I:

- Position 3: e.g., N?I??
- Position 4: e.g., N??I?
- Position 5: e.g., N???I

But we need to fill the other positions with available letters.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common available letters: S, O, L, D, U, P, M, etc.

Since we have I to place, let's think of words.

For example, position 3 for I: words like ""NOISY"" but ""NOISY"" has O and S? But let's see: N-O-I-S-Y. But we have to avoid? Excluded letters: no, O and S are available. But ""NOISY"" has I at position 3? Yes.

But we need to check if it meets the criteria.

""NOISY"": 
- Starts with N: good.
- I is at position 3: not position 2, good.
- Letters: N, O, I, S, Y. 
- Check excluded: C,R,A,E,G,H,T? None of these, so all are allowed.

But we have to consider that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 wrong, but now we have N at position 1 correct, so that's fine.

Another word: ""NAIVE""? But A is excluded? A is absent, so we cannot use A. ""NAIVE"" has A? So invalid.

""NOBLE""? But E is excluded? And B? B is available? But E is excluded? ""NOBLE"" has E? So no.

""NOISY"" seems okay? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""NADIR""? But A is excluded? No.

""NEWLY""? But E and W? E is excluded? So no.

""JUMPS""? But doesn't start with N? We need N at start.

We need N at position 1.

""NOILS""? But O,I,L,S? ""NOILS"" is N-O-I-L-S? I at position 3? Good.

Letters: N,O,I,L,S. All available? L is available? Yes, not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,E,G,H,T. So L is okay.

Similarly, ""NOISY"" as above.

But ""NOISY"" has Y? Y is available? Yes.

We might also consider words with I at position 4: e.g., ""NOMAD""? But A is excluded? No.

""NOTED""? But E and T? T is excluded? T is absent, so no.

""NOUNS""? N-O-U-N-S? But has two Ns? And I is not included? We must include I? Because we know I is in the word? From the feedback of NIGHT: I is present, so we must have I in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But if we don't include I, we won't get information about its position? But we can, but it might be inefficient? Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its correct position? Yes, that would be better.

Therefore, we should include I in this guess to narrow down its position.

So, words that start with N and contain I, with I not at position 2.

Possible words:

- I at position 3: e.g., NOISY, NOILS, NOINT? NOINT? Not common? Or ""NOILY""? But Y? Or ""NAILS""? But A? Excluded.

""NAILS"" has A? No.

""NEIGH""? But E and G? Excluded? E and G are both excluded? So no.

""NOULD""? Not a word.

""MOIST""? But doesn't start with N? We need N at start.

So, ""NOISY"" and ""NOILS"" are candidates.

""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y

""NOILS"": N, O, I, L, S

Which one to choose? We might want to cover more common letters? S is common, O is common, L and Y are less common? But both are valid.

We could also consider ""NIXES""? But X? And E? E is excluded? So no.

""LIONS""? But doesn't start with N? We need N at start.

Another word: ""NUDIE""? But U,D,I,E? E is excluded? So no.

""QUICK""? But Q? And doesn't start with N? No.

So, ""NOISY"" or ""NOILS"".

Perhaps ""NOISY"" is more common? Or we can choose one that tests more vowels? But O is a vowel? We have O in both.

We have to avoid A and E, so O and I are the vowels we have? And U? But not in these words.

Since we have I to place, and we know it's not at position 2, we can try it at position 3 or 4 or 5.

In ""NOISY"", I is at position 3? So we test position 3 for I.

In ""NOILS"", I is also at position 3? Same.

We could try a word with I at position 4? For example, ""NOVICE""? But V,I,C,E? C and E excluded? No.

""NOBLE"" has E? No.

""NASTY""? But A? Excluded.

""NORTH""? But R and T? Excluded? R and T are absent? So no.

""NOULD""? Not a word.

""NOUNS"" doesn't have I? So we skip.

So, it seems difficult to have I at position 4? So position 3 is easier.

Another word: ""NOISY"" or ""NOILS"" or ""NOILY"" (if accepted?).

But let's go with ""NOISY"" for now? Or perhaps ""NICOL""? But C? C is excluded? No.

""MINCE""? But M at start? Not N? And C and E? Excluded.

So, I think ""NOISY"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 wrong, but now we know N is at position 1, so that's fixed.

Also, we need to fill the other positions.

Another idea: ""NOISE""? But E? E is excluded? So no.

""NOISY"" is without E? Yes.

Similarly, ""NOILS"" is without E? Yes.

But ""NOILS"" might be less common? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? I think both are valid.

To have more common letters, S and O are good.

But in ""NOISY"", we have Y? Which is less common? But okay.

We could use ""NODES""? But E? Excluded.

So, I think ""NOISY"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include U? For example, ""NOUNS"" but no I? We need I? Or do we?

We must include I? Not mandatory, but highly recommended to get info on I.

If we don't include I, we might not learn about its position? But we can guess a word without I? Then the feedback might show if I is in the word? But we already know I is in the word? From the second guess: I is present? So we don't need to confirm? But we need to find its position? So we should include it.

Therefore, I will go with ""NOISY"".

So, guess: ""NOISY""

But let's confirm the positions:

N at 1: should be correct? We know it is, so we expect ✓ for N.

I at 3: we are testing if it is correct or not? Or if it is present? We know it is present, so we are testing the position.

Similarly, O at 2, S at 4, Y at 5.

We also get to test O, S, Y? Which are new.

So, <guess>NOISY</guess>

But we have feedback that I is not at position 2? But in this word, I is at position 3? So that's fine? We are not putting it at 2.

Yes.

Another word: ""NIXED""? But E and X? E excluded? No.

So, I think ""NOISY"" is good.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - C, R, A, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - N is **present** but not in position 4 (since it was marked as wrong position).  

- **Guess 2: NIGHT → Feedback: N(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - N is **correct and in position 1** (so the secret word starts with N).  
  - I is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - G, H, T are **absent**.  

### Key Insights for the Next Guess:
- The secret word **starts with N** (position 1 is confirmed).  
- The secret word **contains I**, but **not in position 2** (so I must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, G, H, T (cannot be used).  
- **Available letters**: Focus on common consonants (e.g., S, L, O, P, D) and vowels (e.g., O, U, Y), excluding the absent letters.  
- Strategy:  
  - Include **I** to test its position (positions 3, 4, or 5).  
  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, O, L) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid reusing positions for I that are already ruled out (e.g., position 2).  

### Chosen Guess: ""NOISY""
- **Why ""NOISY""?**  
  - Starts with **N** (position 1), which is confirmed.  
  - Places **I in position 3** (a new position to test, since position 2 is invalid).  
  - Uses **new common letters**: O (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5), which are all available and help cover frequent letters.  
  - **No absent letters**: Avoids C, R, A, E, G, H, T.  
  - **Word validity**: ""NOISY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.  

This guess efficiently tests the position of I while exploring new letters to narrow down possibilities.  

<guess>NOISY</guess>",NOISY,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (since in CRANE it was at position 4).

Guess 2: NIGHT -> N(✓), I(-), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- N is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with N.
- I is present but not in position 2 (since in NIGHT it was at position 2).
- G, H, T are absent.

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word starts with N.
- The secret word contains I, but not in position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, G, H, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know N is not at position 4, but now we have it at position 1 and correct, so that's consistent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with N.
- Contains I (but not in position 2).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, G, H, T.

Available letters: We have to use letters from the remaining set. The English alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, R, A, E, G, H, T.

Available: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: N is fixed at position 1, and I must be included but not at position 2.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We can think of words starting with N and having I in positions 3, 4, or 5? But not position 2.

Also, we should avoid the excluded letters.

Let's consider possible positions for I:

- Position 3: e.g., N?I??
- Position 4: e.g., N??I?
- Position 5: e.g., N???I

But we need to fill the other positions with available letters.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common available letters: S, O, L, D, U, P, M, etc.

Since we have I to place, let's think of words.

For example, position 3 for I: words like ""NOISY"" but ""NOISY"" has O and S? But let's see: N-O-I-S-Y. But we have to avoid? Excluded letters: no, O and S are available. But ""NOISY"" has I at position 3? Yes.

But we need to check if it meets the criteria.

""NOISY"": 
- Starts with N: good.
- I is at position 3: not position 2, good.
- Letters: N, O, I, S, Y. 
- Check excluded: C,R,A,E,G,H,T? None of these, so all are allowed.

But we have to consider that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 wrong, but now we have N at position 1 correct, so that's fine.

Another word: ""NAIVE""? But A is excluded? A is absent, so we cannot use A. ""NAIVE"" has A? So invalid.

""NOBLE""? But E is excluded? And B? B is available? But E is excluded? ""NOBLE"" has E? So no.

""NOISY"" seems okay? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""NADIR""? But A is excluded? No.

""NEWLY""? But E and W? E is excluded? So no.

""JUMPS""? But doesn't start with N? We need N at start.

We need N at position 1.

""NOILS""? But O,I,L,S? ""NOILS"" is N-O-I-L-S? I at position 3? Good.

Letters: N,O,I,L,S. All available? L is available? Yes, not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,E,G,H,T. So L is okay.

Similarly, ""NOISY"" as above.

But ""NOISY"" has Y? Y is available? Yes.

We might also consider words with I at position 4: e.g., ""NOMAD""? But A is excluded? No.

""NOTED""? But E and T? T is excluded? T is absent, so no.

""NOUNS""? N-O-U-N-S? But has two Ns? And I is not included? We must include I? Because we know I is in the word? From the feedback of NIGHT: I is present, so we must have I in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But if we don't include I, we won't get information about its position? But we can, but it might be inefficient? Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its correct position? Yes, that would be better.

Therefore, we should include I in this guess to narrow down its position.

So, words that start with N and contain I, with I not at position 2.

Possible words:

- I at position 3: e.g., NOISY, NOILS, NOINT? NOINT? Not common? Or ""NOILY""? But Y? Or ""NAILS""? But A? Excluded.

""NAILS"" has A? No.

""NEIGH""? But E and G? Excluded? E and G are both excluded? So no.

""NOULD""? Not a word.

""MOIST""? But doesn't start with N? We need N at start.

So, ""NOISY"" and ""NOILS"" are candidates.

""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y

""NOILS"": N, O, I, L, S

Which one to choose? We might want to cover more common letters? S is common, O is common, L and Y are less common? But both are valid.

We could also consider ""NIXES""? But X? And E? E is excluded? So no.

""LIONS""? But doesn't start with N? We need N at start.

Another word: ""NUDIE""? But U,D,I,E? E is excluded? So no.

""QUICK""? But Q? And doesn't start with N? No.

So, ""NOISY"" or ""NOILS"".

Perhaps ""NOISY"" is more common? Or we can choose one that tests more vowels? But O is a vowel? We have O in both.

We have to avoid A and E, so O and I are the vowels we have? And U? But not in these words.

Since we have I to place, and we know it's not at position 2, we can try it at position 3 or 4 or 5.

In ""NOISY"", I is at position 3? So we test position 3 for I.

In ""NOILS"", I is also at position 3? Same.

We could try a word with I at position 4? For example, ""NOVICE""? But V,I,C,E? C and E excluded? No.

""NOBLE"" has E? No.

""NASTY""? But A? Excluded.

""NORTH""? But R and T? Excluded? R and T are absent? So no.

""NOULD""? Not a word.

""NOUNS"" doesn't have I? So we skip.

So, it seems difficult to have I at position 4? So position 3 is easier.

Another word: ""NOISY"" or ""NOILS"" or ""NOILY"" (if accepted?).

But let's go with ""NOISY"" for now? Or perhaps ""NICOL""? But C? C is excluded? No.

""MINCE""? But M at start? Not N? And C and E? Excluded.

So, I think ""NOISY"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 wrong, but now we know N is at position 1, so that's fixed.

Also, we need to fill the other positions.

Another idea: ""NOISE""? But E? E is excluded? So no.

""NOISY"" is without E? Yes.

Similarly, ""NOILS"" is without E? Yes.

But ""NOILS"" might be less common? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? I think both are valid.

To have more common letters, S and O are good.

But in ""NOISY"", we have Y? Which is less common? But okay.

We could use ""NODES""? But E? Excluded.

So, I think ""NOISY"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include U? For example, ""NOUNS"" but no I? We need I? Or do we?

We must include I? Not mandatory, but highly recommended to get info on I.

If we don't include I, we might not learn about its position? But we can guess a word without I? Then the feedback might show if I is in the word? But we already know I is in the word? From the second guess: I is present? So we don't need to confirm? But we need to find its position? So we should include it.

Therefore, I will go with ""NOISY"".

So, guess: ""NOISY""

But let's confirm the positions:

N at 1: should be correct? We know it is, so we expect ✓ for N.

I at 3: we are testing if it is correct or not? Or if it is present? We know it is present, so we are testing the position.

Similarly, O at 2, S at 4, Y at 5.

We also get to test O, S, Y? Which are new.

So, <guess>NOISY</guess>

But we have feedback that I is not at position 2? But in this word, I is at position 3? So that's fine? We are not putting it at 2.

Yes.

Another word: ""NIXED""? But E and X? E excluded? No.

So, I think ""NOISY"" is good.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
