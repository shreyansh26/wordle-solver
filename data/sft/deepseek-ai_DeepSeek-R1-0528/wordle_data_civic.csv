We are making the first guess, so we have no prior feedback. We need to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 Common strategies include using words with common letters and a variety of distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 A good starting word might have common letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 However, note that we are allowed only English words. We can choose any valid word.

 Alternative starting words: ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if allowed).

 Let's pick ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 But note: the example secret word provided was ""BRISK"", which has B, R, I, S, K. Our guess ""CRANE"" would get:
   C is not in BRISK -> x
   R is in BRISK and at the correct position? In ""BRISK"", R is at position 2. In ""CRANE"", R is at position 2 as well? 
     Actually: 
        BRISK: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        CRANE: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   So comparing:
        C vs B -> x
        R vs R -> ✓ (since same position)
        A vs I -> x (I is in the word but not A? Actually, BRISK has I, but at position 3, so A is not in the word -> x)
        N vs S -> x (S is in the word but not at position 4? N is not in the word -> x)
        E vs K -> x

   Therefore, feedback would be: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Since we are starting, we don't have prior information. We'll use ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, let me consider ""RAISE"": 
   R, A, I, S, E. These are also common. But it shares the R and A with our example? Actually, we don't know the word yet.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E.

 How about ""ADIEU""? It has many vowels (A, I, E, U) and D. But U is less common.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We are making the first guess so any word is acceptable as long as it's 5-letter English.

 Decision: We'll go with ""CRANE"".
</think>
I am making the first guess with no prior feedback. I need a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize initial information. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Letters are distinct, so feedback will reveal more about possible matches
- Covers frequent letters likely to appear in many words

This will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback pattern.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

This tells us:
- The first letter of the secret word is C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter English word that starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, E.

We should try to use other common letters to get more information. Since we know the first letter is C, we can focus on the remaining four positions.

Possible letters to use: We have 21 letters left (excluding R, A, N, E). We should choose letters that are common in 5-letter words.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but note we already know A and E are out, so the word must use other vowels or sometimes Y).

We must avoid: R, A, N, E.

Let's think of words that start with C and do not have R, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- ""cough""
- ""civic""
- ""chill""
- ""comet"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, E is excluded because feedback said E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

We must avoid E as well.

So, let's list without E: 
- Words like ""cough"", ""could"", ""crown"" -> but crown has R and we know R is not in the word? Wait, feedback for R was x (not in the word), so we cannot use R either.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

So, available letters: all except R, A, N, E.

We can use: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that starts with C and uses only these letters.

Let's think of common words:
- ""could"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> all allowed? O, U, L, D are not in the exclusion list. But note: we have to check if they are in the word? We don't know, but we can use them to test.
- ""child"" -> C, H, I, L, D -> allowed.
- ""chill"" -> C, H, I, L, L -> but L repeated? We can use repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but the feedback will show if the letter is repeated. However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We should use a word with distinct letters to cover more ground.

So, ""child"" has distinct letters: C, H, I, L, D. But wait, C is already known to be in the first position, so we are testing H, I, L, D in positions 2,3,4,5.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel to check for vowels since we know A and E are out. The only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Let me try to think of a word that uses common letters and includes a vowel.

Some options:
- ""cloud"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> distinct and uses O and U.
- ""pouch"" -> but doesn't start with C? We need to start with C.

We must start with C.

So, let's list:
- ""chomp"" -> C, H, O, M, P -> distinct and uses O.
- ""chump"" -> similar.

But we don't know if these are words? We have to use valid English words.

Another idea: use a word that has S and T because they are common.

For example: ""cists"" -> but has S repeated? And not very common. Also, we want distinct if possible.

""cough"" -> C, O, U, G, H -> distinct? O, U, G, H are distinct. But G and H are less common? 

We can also consider ""civic"" -> but has two I's and two C's? C is already at the start, so we are using C again? The word is C I V I C. But we know the first letter is C, so the last letter being C would be a repeat. But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are trying to test new letters.

But note: we are avoiding R, A, N, E. ""civic"" has I and V. I is a vowel we haven't tested.

But let's choose a word that maximizes new information.

I think ""chomp"" is a valid word? Actually, ""chomp"" means to chew noisily. It's acceptable.

But let me check: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""chomp"" has C, H, O, M, P. None of these are in the exclusion list.

Alternatively, ""cloth"" -> C, L, O, T, H -> also good.

But we don't know if O is in the word. We need to test a vowel? Since A and E are out, the word must have one of I, O, U, or Y.

So, including a vowel is important.

We can use ""could"": C, O, U, L, D -> tests O and U (two vowels) and L, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any word, but we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another option: ""cushy"" -> C, U, S, H, Y -> uses Y as a vowel? And S and H. This is also good.

But let's pick one.

I think ""cloud"" is a good choice: C, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, two vowels (O and U), and common consonants (L, D).

But wait, we are starting with C, so the word is ""cloud"".

But note: the first letter is fixed as C, so we are guessing the rest: L, O, U, D.

We can also consider ""pound"" but it doesn't start with C.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me confirm: is ""cloud"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""could"" is also valid and uses the same letters except the last is D instead of ... wait, ""could"" is C, O, U, L, D -> same as ""cloud"" but rearranged? Actually, ""cloud"" is C-L-O-U-D, and ""could"" is C-O-U-L-D. But we are testing different positions.

But we don't know the positions, so we can choose either.

However, we want to test the vowels in different positions.

But since we are only on the second guess, it's okay.

I think ""chill"" is also an option, but it has double L. We can avoid repeats for now.

So, I choose ""cloud"".

But wait, we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" has none of these.

Therefore, we guess ""cloud"".

But note: the feedback for the first letter will be ✓ because we know it's C. So we are testing the other four.

So, let's write the guess: cloud.

But wait, the word must be in uppercase? The example was in uppercase. But the problem says ""5-letter English word"", and in the example they used uppercase. However, in the response we can use lowercase? The format says to return in <guess> tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.

In the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don't know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven't excluded it.

But ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.

But I think ""cloud"" is fine.

Another common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.

Similarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.

So, we must avoid R.

Therefore, ""cloud"" is safe.

So, second guess: ""cloud""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The secret word does not contain **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- The remaining letters (positions 2–5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding these letters.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It should avoid using **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., **O**, **U**, **L**, **D**, **S**, **T**, **I**) and use distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- A good candidate is **""cloud""** because:
  - It starts with **C**.
  - It uses new, common letters (**L**, **O**, **U**, **D**).
  - It tests two vowels (**O** and **U**), which are likely given the absence of **A** and **E**.
  - All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing new information.

<guess>cloud</guess>","tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.

In the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don't know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven't excluded it.

But ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.

But I think ""cloud"" is fine.

Another common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.

Similarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.

So, we must avoid R.

Therefore, ""cloud"" is safe.

So, second guess: ""cloud""

We can use: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that starts with C and uses only these letters.

Let's think of common words:
- ""could"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> all allowed? O, U, L, D are not in the exclusion list. But note: we have to check if they are in the word? We don't know, but we can use them to test.
- ""child"" -> C, H, I, L, D -> allowed.
- ""chill"" -> C, H, I, L, L -> but L repeated? We can use repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but the feedback will show if the letter is repeated. However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We should use a word with distinct letters to cover more ground.

So, ""child"" has distinct letters: C, H, I, L, D. But wait, C is already known to be in the first position, so we are testing H, I, L, D in positions 2,3,4,5.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel to check for vowels since we know A and E are out. The only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Let me try to think of a word that uses common letters and includes a vowel.

Some options:
- ""cloud"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> distinct and uses O and U.
- ""pouch"" -> but doesn't start with C? We need to start with C.

We must start with C.

So, let's list:
- ""chomp"" -> C, H, O, M, P -> distinct and uses O.
- ""chump"" -> similar.

But we don't know if these are words? We have to use valid English words.

Another idea: use a word that has S and T because they are common.

For example: ""cists"" -> but has S repeated? And not very common. Also, we want distinct if possible.

""cough"" -> C, O, U, G, H -> distinct? O, U, G, H are distinct. But G and H are less common? 

We can also consider ""civic"" -> but has two I's and two C's? C is already at the start, so we are using C again? The word is C I V I C. But we know the first letter is C, so the last letter being C would be a repeat. But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are trying to test new letters.

But note: we are avoiding R, A, N, E. ""civic"" has I and V. I is a vowel we haven't tested.

But let's choose a word that maximizes new information.

I think ""chomp"" is a valid word? Actually, ""chomp"" means to chew noisily. It's acceptable.

But let me check: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""chomp"" has C, H, O, M, P. None of these are in the exclusion list.

Alternatively, ""cloth"" -> C, L, O, T, H -> also good.

But we don't know if O is in the word. We need to test a vowel? Since A and E are out, the word must have one of I, O, U, or Y.

So, including a vowel is important.

We can use ""could"": C, O, U, L, D -> tests O and U (two vowels) and L, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any word, but we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another option: ""cushy"" -> C, U, S, H, Y -> uses Y as a vowel? And S and H. This is also good.

But let's pick one.

I think ""cloud"" is a good choice: C, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, two vowels (O and U), and common consonants (L, D).

But wait, we are starting with C, so the word is ""cloud"".

But note: the first letter is fixed as C, so we are guessing the rest: L, O, U, D.

We can also consider ""pound"" but it doesn't start with C.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me confirm: is ""cloud"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""could"" is also valid and uses the same letters except the last is D instead of ... wait, ""could"" is C, O, U, L, D -> same as ""cloud"" but rearranged? Actually, ""cloud"" is C-L-O-U-D, and ""could"" is C-O-U-L-D. But we are testing different positions.

But we don't know the positions, so we can choose either.

However, we want to test the vowels in different positions.

But since we are only on the second guess, it's okay.

I think ""chill"" is also an option, but it has double L. We can avoid repeats for now.

So, I choose ""cloud"".

But wait, we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" has none of these.

Therefore, we guess ""cloud"".

But note: the feedback for the first letter will be ✓ because we know it's C. So we are testing the other four.

So, let's write the guess: cloud.

But wait, the word must be in uppercase? The example was in uppercase. But the problem says ""5-letter English word"", and in the example they used uppercase. However, in the response we can use lowercase? The format says to return in <guess> tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.

In the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don't know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven't excluded it.

But ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.

But I think ""cloud"" is fine.

Another common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.

Similarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.

So, we must avoid R.

Therefore, ""cloud"" is safe.

So, second guess: ""cloud""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The secret word does not contain **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- The remaining letters (positions 2–5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding these letters.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It should avoid using **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., **O**, **U**, **L**, **D**, **S**, **T**, **I**) and use distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- A good candidate is **""cloud""** because:
  - It starts with **C**.
  - It uses new, common letters (**L**, **O**, **U**, **D**).
  - It tests two vowels (**O** and **U**), which are likely given the absence of **A** and **E**.
  - All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing new information.","Guess 2: tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.

In the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don't know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven't excluded it.

But ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.

But I think ""cloud"" is fine.

Another common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.

Similarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.

So, we must avoid R.

Therefore, ""cloud"" is safe.

So, second guess: ""cloud""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,civic,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, so we have no prior feedback. We need to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 Common strategies include using words with common letters and a variety of distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 A good starting word might have common letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 However, note that we are allowed only English words. We can choose any valid word.

 Alternative starting words: ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if allowed).

 Let's pick ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 But note: the example secret word provided was ""BRISK"", which has B, R, I, S, K. Our guess ""CRANE"" would get:
   C is not in BRISK -> x
   R is in BRISK and at the correct position? In ""BRISK"", R is at position 2. In ""CRANE"", R is at position 2 as well? 
     Actually: 
        BRISK: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        CRANE: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   So comparing:
        C vs B -> x
        R vs R -> ✓ (since same position)
        A vs I -> x (I is in the word but not A? Actually, BRISK has I, but at position 3, so A is not in the word -> x)
        N vs S -> x (S is in the word but not at position 4? N is not in the word -> x)
        E vs K -> x

   Therefore, feedback would be: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Since we are starting, we don't have prior information. We'll use ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, let me consider ""RAISE"": 
   R, A, I, S, E. These are also common. But it shares the R and A with our example? Actually, we don't know the word yet.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E.

 How about ""ADIEU""? It has many vowels (A, I, E, U) and D. But U is less common.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We are making the first guess so any word is acceptable as long as it's 5-letter English.

 Decision: We'll go with ""CRANE"".I am making the first guess with no prior feedback. I need a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize initial information. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Letters are distinct, so feedback will reveal more about possible matches
- Covers frequent letters likely to appear in many words

This will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback pattern.

Based on the previous guess ""crane"" which gave feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x), we know:
1. The first letter of the secret word is **C**.
2. The secret word **does not contain R, A, N, or E** anywhere.

Therefore, for the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word starting with **C**.
- Must not include the letters **R, A, N, E**.
- Should introduce new common letters to test vowels and consonants that haven't been eliminated yet.

Possible new letters to test include vowels: **O, U, I** and consonants: **L, S, T, H, D, B, M, P**, etc.

A good choice would be a word like **""cloud""**. However, checking the word:
- **C** is fixed at position 1 (correct).
- **L** is a common consonant.
- **O** and **U** are vowels (since A and E are absent, testing others).
- **D** is a common ending letter.

Alternatively, **""cough""** but it ends with GH and repeats O? Let's think of others.

Best options:
1. **""could""** - uses C, O, U, L, D. Distinct letters.
2. **""child""** - uses C, H, I, L, D. Tests H and I.
3. **""combo""** - but O is repeated? Wait, letters aren't distinct? Actually ""combo"" has two O's but that might not be efficient.

Since we need more information, distinct letters are better. **""could""** is valid:
- Avoids R, A, N, E.
- Tests O, U, L, D.

But let's confirm: **""could""** is 5 letters.

Another option is **""cloth""**, testing T and H.

But **""could""** covers vowel sounds more broadly.

Actually, **""chill""** has double L, not efficient.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,civic,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, so we have no prior feedback. We need to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 Common strategies include using words with common letters and a variety of distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 A good starting word might have common letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 However, note that we are allowed only English words. We can choose any valid word.

 Alternative starting words: ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if allowed).

 Let's pick ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 But note: the example secret word provided was ""BRISK"", which has B, R, I, S, K. Our guess ""CRANE"" would get:
   C is not in BRISK -> x
   R is in BRISK and at the correct position? In ""BRISK"", R is at position 2. In ""CRANE"", R is at position 2 as well? 
     Actually: 
        BRISK: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        CRANE: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   So comparing:
        C vs B -> x
        R vs R -> ✓ (since same position)
        A vs I -> x (I is in the word but not A? Actually, BRISK has I, but at position 3, so A is not in the word -> x)
        N vs S -> x (S is in the word but not at position 4? N is not in the word -> x)
        E vs K -> x

   Therefore, feedback would be: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Since we are starting, we don't have prior information. We'll use ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, let me consider ""RAISE"": 
   R, A, I, S, E. These are also common. But it shares the R and A with our example? Actually, we don't know the word yet.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E.

 How about ""ADIEU""? It has many vowels (A, I, E, U) and D. But U is less common.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We are making the first guess so any word is acceptable as long as it's 5-letter English.

 Decision: We'll go with ""CRANE"".I am making the first guess with no prior feedback. I need a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize initial information. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Letters are distinct, so feedback will reveal more about possible matches
- Covers frequent letters likely to appear in many words

This will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback pattern.

Here is some previous feedback:

<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The secret word does not contain **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- The remaining letters (positions 2–5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding these letters.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It should avoid using **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., **O**, **U**, **L**, **D**, **S**, **T**, **I**) and use distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- A good candidate is **""cloud""** because:
  - It starts with **C**.
  - It uses new, common letters (**L**, **O**, **U**, **D**).
  - It tests two vowels (**O** and **U**), which are likely given the absence of **A** and **E**.
  - All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing new information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.

In the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don't know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven't excluded it.

But ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.

But I think ""cloud"" is fine.

Another common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.

Similarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.

So, we must avoid R.

Therefore, ""cloud"" is safe.

We should choose letters that are common in 5-letter words.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\nCommon vowels: O, I, U (but note we already know A and E are out, so the word must use other vowels or sometimes Y).\n\nWe must avoid: R, A, N, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with C and do not have R, A, N, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""cough""\n- ""civic""\n- ""chill""\n- ""comet"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, E is excluded because feedback said E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E as well.\n\nSo, let\'s list without E: \n- Words like ""cough"", ""could"", ""crown"" -> but crown has R and we know R is not in the word? Wait, feedback for R was x (not in the word), so we cannot use R either.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, available letters: all except R, A, N, E.\n\nWe can use: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need a word that starts with C and uses only these letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words:\n- ""could"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> all allowed? O, U, L, D are not in the exclusion list. But note: we have to check if they are in the word? We don\'t know, but we can use them to test.\n- ""child"" -> C, H, I, L, D -> allowed.\n- ""chill"" -> C, H, I, L, L -> but L repeated? We can use repeated letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but the feedback will show if the letter is repeated. However, we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters.\n\nBut note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We should use a word with distinct letters to cover more ground.\n\nSo, ""child"" has distinct letters: C, H, I, L, D. But wait, C is already known to be in the first position, so we are testing H, I, L, D in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel to check for vowels since we know A and E are out. The only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nLet me try to think of a word that uses common letters and includes a vowel.\n\nSome options:\n- ""cloud"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> distinct and uses O and U.\n- ""pouch"" -> but doesn\'t start with C? We need to start with C.\n\nWe must start with C.\n\nSo, let\'s list:\n- ""chomp"" -> C, H, O, M, P -> distinct and uses O.\n- ""chump"" -> similar.\n\nBut we don\'t know if these are words? We have to use valid English words.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has S and T because they are common.\n\nFor example: ""cists"" -> but has S repeated? And not very common. Also, we want distinct if possible.\n\n""cough"" -> C, O, U, G, H -> distinct? O, U, G, H are distinct. But G and H are less common? \n\nWe can also consider ""civic"" -> but has two I\'s and two C\'s? C is already at the start, so we are using C again? The word is C I V I C. But we know the first letter is C, so the last letter being C would be a repeat. But we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are trying to test new letters.\n\nBut note: we are avoiding R, A, N, E. ""civic"" has I and V. I is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that maximizes new information.\n\nI think ""chomp"" is a valid word? Actually, ""chomp"" means to chew noisily. It\'s acceptable.\n\nBut let me check: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""chomp"" has C, H, O, M, P. None of these are in the exclusion list.\n\nAlternatively, ""cloth"" -> C, L, O, T, H -> also good.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word. We need to test a vowel? Since A and E are out, the word must have one of I, O, U, or Y.\n\nSo, including a vowel is important.\n\nWe can use ""could"": C, O, U, L, D -> tests O and U (two vowels) and L, D.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any word, but we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother option: ""cushy"" -> C, U, S, H, Y -> uses Y as a vowel? And S and H. This is also good.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nI think ""cloud"" is a good choice: C, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, two vowels (O and U), and common consonants (L, D).\n\nBut wait, we are starting with C, so the word is ""cloud"".\n\nBut note: the first letter is fixed as C, so we are guessing the rest: L, O, U, D.\n\nWe can also consider ""pound"" but it doesn\'t start with C.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""cloud"".\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""cloud"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, ""could"" is also valid and uses the same letters except the last is D instead of ... wait, ""could"" is C, O, U, L, D -> same as ""cloud"" but rearranged? Actually, ""cloud"" is C-L-O-U-D, and ""could"" is C-O-U-L-D. But we are testing different positions.\n\nBut we don\'t know the positions, so we can choose either.\n\nHowever, we want to test the vowels in different positions.\n\nBut since we are only on the second guess, it\'s okay.\n\nI think ""chill"" is also an option, but it has double L. We can avoid repeats for now.\n\nSo, I choose ""cloud"".\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" has none of these.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""cloud"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first letter will be ✓ because we know it\'s C. So we are testing the other four.\n\nSo, let\'s write the guess: cloud.\n\nBut wait, the word must be in uppercase? The example was in uppercase. But the problem says ""5-letter English word"", and in the example they used uppercase. However, in the response we can use lowercase? The format says to return in <guess> tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.\n\nIn the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""cloud"".\n\nBut let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don\'t know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven\'t excluded it.\n\nBut ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.\n\nBut I think ""cloud"" is fine.\n\nAnother common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.\n\nSimilarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.\n\nSo, we must avoid R.\n\nTherefore, ""cloud"" is safe.\n\nSo, second guess: ""cloud""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).\n- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word starts with **C**.\n- The secret word does not contain **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.\n- The remaining letters (positions 2–5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding these letters.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must start with **C**.\n- It should avoid using **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.\n- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., **O**, **U**, **L**, **D**, **S**, **T**, **I**) and use distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- A good candidate is **""cloud""** because:\n  - It starts with **C**.\n  - It uses new, common letters (**L**, **O**, **U**, **D**).\n  - It tests two vowels (**O** and **U**), which are likely given the absence of **A** and **E**.\n  - All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing new information.\n\n<guess>tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.\n\nIn the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase.

This leaves the possible letters for positions 2-5 from: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The secret word starts with C and has no R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must use only letters not excluded: from the remaining alphabet.
- Should prioritize common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters: S, T, H, I, M, B, P, etc.

Another option: ""chime"" but E is excluded -> invalid.
""shine"" doesn't start with C.

""craft"" has R and A -> excluded.

Best: ""chips"" or ""shift""? But ""shift"" starts with S, not C.

All distinct and common.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, so we have no prior feedback. We need to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 Common strategies include using words with common letters and a variety of distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 A good starting word might have common letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 However, note that we are allowed only English words. We can choose any valid word.

 Alternative starting words: ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if allowed).

 Let's pick ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 But note: the example secret word provided was ""BRISK"", which has B, R, I, S, K. Our guess ""CRANE"" would get:
   C is not in BRISK -> x
   R is in BRISK and at the correct position? In ""BRISK"", R is at position 2. In ""CRANE"", R is at position 2 as well? 
     Actually: 
        BRISK: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        CRANE: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   So comparing:
        C vs B -> x
        R vs R -> ✓ (since same position)
        A vs I -> x (I is in the word but not A? Actually, BRISK has I, but at position 3, so A is not in the word -> x)
        N vs S -> x (S is in the word but not at position 4? N is not in the word -> x)
        E vs K -> x

   Therefore, feedback would be: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Since we are starting, we don't have prior information. We'll use ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, let me consider ""RAISE"": 
   R, A, I, S, E. These are also common. But it shares the R and A with our example? Actually, we don't know the word yet.

 Another popular word is ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E.

 How about ""ADIEU""? It has many vowels (A, I, E, U) and D. But U is less common.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We are making the first guess so any word is acceptable as long as it's 5-letter English.

 Decision: We'll go with ""CRANE"".I am making the first guess with no prior feedback. I need a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize initial information. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because:
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Letters are distinct, so feedback will reveal more about possible matches
- Covers frequent letters likely to appear in many words

This will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback pattern.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The secret word does not contain **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- The remaining letters (positions 2–5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding these letters.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It should avoid using **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., **O**, **U**, **L**, **D**, **S**, **T**, **I**) and use distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- A good candidate is **""cloud""** because:
  - It starts with **C**.
  - It uses new, common letters (**L**, **O**, **U**, **D**).
  - It tests two vowels (**O** and **U**), which are likely given the absence of **A** and **E**.
  - All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing new information.

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.

In the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.

So, I'll go with ""cloud"".

But let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don't know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven't excluded it.

But ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.

But I think ""cloud"" is fine.

Another common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.

Similarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.

So, we must avoid R.

Therefore, ""cloud"" is safe.

So, second guess: ""cloud""

<guess>cloud -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the previous guess ""crane"" which gave feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x), we know:
1. The first letter of the secret word is **C**.
2. The secret word **does not contain R, A, N, or E** anywhere.

Therefore, for the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word starting with **C**.
- Must not include the letters **R, A, N, E**.
- Should introduce new common letters to test vowels and consonants that haven't been eliminated yet.

Possible new letters to test include vowels: **O, U, I** and consonants: **L, S, T, H, D, B, M, P**, etc.

A good choice would be a word like **""cloud""**. However, checking the word:
- **C** is fixed at position 1 (correct).
- **L** is a common consonant.
- **O** and **U** are vowels (since A and E are absent, testing others).
- **D** is a common ending letter.

Alternatively, **""cough""** but it ends with GH and repeats O? Let's think of others.

Best options:
1. **""could""** - uses C, O, U, L, D. Distinct letters.
2. **""child""** - uses C, H, I, L, D. Tests H and I.
3. **""combo""** - but O is repeated? Wait, letters aren't distinct? Actually ""combo"" has two O's but that might not be efficient.

Since we need more information, distinct letters are better. **""could""** is valid:
- Avoids R, A, N, E.
- Tests O, U, L, D.

But let's confirm: **""could""** is 5 letters.

Another option is **""cloth""**, testing T and H.

But **""could""** covers vowel sounds more broadly.

Actually, **""chill""** has double L, not efficient. 

Better to go with **""could""**.

Alternatively, **""build""** doesn't start with C.

So, I'll choose **""could""** as the guess.

<guess>could</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"":
- **C** is confirmed in the correct position (1st letter).
- **R, A, N, E** are confirmed absent from the secret word entirely.

For the next guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must exclude **R, A, N, E**.
- Should prioritize introducing new, common untested letters (e.g., **O, U, L, I, S, T, H, D**) to maximize information.
- **""could""** is selected because:
  - Starts with **C**.
  - Uses new letters (**O, U, L, D**).
  - Tests vowels (**O, U**) given the absence of **A** and **E**.
  - Five distinct letters increase the chances of revealing positional matches.

<guess>cloud -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: could -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:
1. Guess: crane -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - First letter is C and correct.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess: cloud -> Feedback: C(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)
   - First letter C is correct, as expected.
   - L, O, U, D are not in the word.

Combining the feedback:
- Known correct: Position 1 is C.
- Known absent letters: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D.

This leaves the possible letters for positions 2-5 from: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The secret word starts with C and has no R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D.

For the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must use only letters not excluded: from the remaining alphabet.
- Should prioritize common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters: S, T, H, I, M, B, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""cities"" but it's 6 letters. No, must be 5 letters.

Possible words:
- ""chips"": C, H, I, P, S
- ""cysts"": C, Y, S, T, S (but Y is less common and repeated S)
- ""chimp"": C, H, I, M, P (not a common word? but valid)
- ""cwtch"": not common English.

Better: ""chips"" tests H, I, P, S, which are common.

Or ""smith"" doesn't start with C.

Another option: ""chime"" but E is excluded -> invalid.
""shine"" doesn't start with C.

""craft"" has R and A -> excluded.

Best: ""chips"" or ""shift""? But ""shift"" starts with S, not C.

Focus on words starting with C and using the allowed letters.

Common valid words:
- ""chips"": C, H, I, P, S
- ""chits"": C, H, I, T, S (though T and S in different positions)
- ""civic"": has two Cs and two Is? Not distinct, inefficient.

Since we have few letters to exclude and many possibilities, choose a word with high-frequency letters not tested.

I'll go with ""chips"".

It tests H, I, P, S.

All distinct and common.

Another word: ""bombs"" doesn't start with C.

So, ""chips"" seems good.

But let me confirm: C is at position 1, and then H, I, P, S are all new.

<guess>chips</guess>Based on the cumulative feedback:
- From ""crane"": **C** is in position 1 (✓), **R**, **A**, **N**, **E** absent.
- From ""cloud"": **C** confirmed again (✓), **L**, **O**, **U**, **D** absent.

Deduction:
- The secret word starts with **C** and avoids **R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D**.
- Possible letters for positions 2–5: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (from remaining alphabet).
- Prioritize common letters: **S**, **T**, **H**, **I**, **M**, **B**, **P**, **F** (high-frequency consonants/vowels).

For the third guess:
- Must start with **C** and exclude the absent letters.
- Choose a word with distinct, untested letters to maximize information gain.
- **""chips""** is selected because:
  - Starts with **C**.
  - Uses **H**, **I**, **P**, **S** (common letters; **I** tests a vowel given absent vowels A/E/O/U).
  - All 5 letters are distinct, testing multiple new possibilities.

Potential alternatives (e.g., ""chimp"", ""cysts"") are less optimal due to infrequent letters or repeats.

The guess must be a 5-letter English word that starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, E.\n\nWe should try to use other common letters to get more information. Since we know the first letter is C, we can focus on the remaining four positions.\n\nPossible letters to use: We have 21 letters left (excluding R, A, N, E). We should choose letters that are common in 5-letter words.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\nCommon vowels: O, I, U (but note we already know A and E are out, so the word must use other vowels or sometimes Y).\n\nWe must avoid: R, A, N, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with C and do not have R, A, N, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""cough""\n- ""civic""\n- ""chill""\n- ""comet"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, E is excluded because feedback said E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E as well.\n\nSo, let\'s list without E: \n- Words like ""cough"", ""could"", ""crown"" -> but crown has R and we know R is not in the word? Wait, feedback for R was x (not in the word), so we cannot use R either.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, available letters: all except R, A, N, E.\n\nWe can use: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need a word that starts with C and uses only these letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words:\n- ""could"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> all allowed? O, U, L, D are not in the exclusion list. But note: we have to check if they are in the word? We don\'t know, but we can use them to test.\n- ""child"" -> C, H, I, L, D -> allowed.\n- ""chill"" -> C, H, I, L, L -> but L repeated? We can use repeated letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but the feedback will show if the letter is repeated. However, we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters.\n\nBut note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We should use a word with distinct letters to cover more ground.\n\nSo, ""child"" has distinct letters: C, H, I, L, D. But wait, C is already known to be in the first position, so we are testing H, I, L, D in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a vowel to check for vowels since we know A and E are out. The only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nLet me try to think of a word that uses common letters and includes a vowel.\n\nSome options:\n- ""cloud"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> distinct and uses O and U.\n- ""pouch"" -> but doesn\'t start with C? We need to start with C.\n\nWe must start with C.\n\nSo, let\'s list:\n- ""chomp"" -> C, H, O, M, P -> distinct and uses O.\n- ""chump"" -> similar.\n\nBut we don\'t know if these are words? We have to use valid English words.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has S and T because they are common.\n\nFor example: ""cists"" -> but has S repeated? And not very common. Also, we want distinct if possible.\n\n""cough"" -> C, O, U, G, H -> distinct? O, U, G, H are distinct. But G and H are less common? \n\nWe can also consider ""civic"" -> but has two I\'s and two C\'s? C is already at the start, so we are using C again? The word is C I V I C. But we know the first letter is C, so the last letter being C would be a repeat. But we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. However, we are trying to test new letters.\n\nBut note: we are avoiding R, A, N, E. ""civic"" has I and V. I is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that maximizes new information.\n\nI think ""chomp"" is a valid word? Actually, ""chomp"" means to chew noisily. It\'s acceptable.\n\nBut let me check: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""chomp"" has C, H, O, M, P. None of these are in the exclusion list.\n\nAlternatively, ""cloth"" -> C, L, O, T, H -> also good.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word. We need to test a vowel? Since A and E are out, the word must have one of I, O, U, or Y.\n\nSo, including a vowel is important.\n\nWe can use ""could"": C, O, U, L, D -> tests O and U (two vowels) and L, D.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any word, but we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother option: ""cushy"" -> C, U, S, H, Y -> uses Y as a vowel? And S and H. This is also good.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nI think ""cloud"" is a good choice: C, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, two vowels (O and U), and common consonants (L, D).\n\nBut wait, we are starting with C, so the word is ""cloud"".\n\nBut note: the first letter is fixed as C, so we are guessing the rest: L, O, U, D.\n\nWe can also consider ""pound"" but it doesn\'t start with C.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""cloud"".\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""cloud"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, ""could"" is also valid and uses the same letters except the last is D instead of ... wait, ""could"" is C, O, U, L, D -> same as ""cloud"" but rearranged? Actually, ""cloud"" is C-L-O-U-D, and ""could"" is C-O-U-L-D. But we are testing different positions.\n\nBut we don\'t know the positions, so we can choose either.\n\nHowever, we want to test the vowels in different positions.\n\nBut since we are only on the second guess, it\'s okay.\n\nI think ""chill"" is also an option, but it has double L. We can avoid repeats for now.\n\nSo, I choose ""cloud"".\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" has none of these.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""cloud"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first letter will be ✓ because we know it\'s C. So we are testing the other four.\n\nSo, let\'s write the guess: cloud.\n\nBut wait, the word must be in uppercase? The example was in uppercase. But the problem says ""5-letter English word"", and in the example they used uppercase. However, in the response we can use lowercase? The format says to return in <guess> tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.\n\nIn the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase. So we can use lowercase.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""cloud"".\n\nBut let me think of other words: ""cough"" is also good? Or ""combo"" -> but has O and B, but also we don\'t know if B is allowed? It is, because we haven\'t excluded it.\n\nBut ""combo"" has M and B. We can use.\n\nBut I think ""cloud"" is fine.\n\nAnother common word: ""crown"" -> but has R and we know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R. Therefore, ""crown"" is invalid because it contains R.\n\nSimilarly, ""crane"" we already used and it had R, which we now know is absent.\n\nSo, we must avoid R.\n\nTherefore, ""cloud"" is safe.\n\nSo, second guess: ""cloud""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The first letter is **C** and it is in the correct position (✓).\n- The letters **R**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all (x).\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word starts with **C**.\n- The secret word does not contain **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.\n- The remaining letters (positions 2–5) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding these letters.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must start with **C**.\n- It should avoid using **R**, **A**, **N**, or **E**.\n- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., **O**, **U**, **L**, **D**, **S**, **T**, **I**) and use distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- A good candidate is **""cloud""** because:\n  - It starts with **C**.\n  - It uses new, common letters (**L**, **O**, **U**, **D**).\n  - It tests two vowels (**O** and **U**), which are likely given the absence of **A** and **E**.\n  - All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing new information.\n\n<guess>tags, and the example used lowercase in the tags.\n\nIn the previous response, I used ""crane"" in lowercase.

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - The first letter is C and correct.
   - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.

2. **cloud**: C(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)
   - The first letter C is correct (as expected).
   - L, O, U, D are absent.

3. **could**: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(x) D(x) (same as above, redundant but confirms absence of O, U, L, D)

4. **chips**: C(✓) H(x) I(-) P(x) S(x)
   - C is correct (position 1).
   - H, P, S are absent.
   - I is present in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position).

Key deductions:
- **Correct position**: Only position 1 is confirmed as C.
- **Present but misplaced**: I is in the word, but not at position 3.
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S (from all feedback).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since I is present, it must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5).

Constraints for the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include the letter I (since it's present), but not in position 3.
- Cannot use any absent letters: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S.
- Should test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible positions for I:
- Since I is not in position 3, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Given the absent letters, the word must be composed of:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5: Letters from B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, with I appearing exactly once (since no feedback suggests duplicates, and we haven't tested duplicates).

Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test the position of I and other new letters.
- Choose a word that places I in one of the possible positions (2, 4, or 5) and uses other untested common letters (e.g., T, M, B, F, G, K) to maximize information.

Good candidate words:
- **""civic""**: But it has two I's and two C's. C is already fixed at position 1, and we don't know if there's another C. Also, it uses I at positions 2 and 5, but we don't know if I appears twice. Moreover, V is untested. However, it repeats I and C, which might not be efficient. Also, ""civic"" is a valid word.
- **""brick""**: But B and K are allowed, but it has R which is absent -> invalid.
- **""click""**: Has L (absent) and repeats C -> invalid.
- **""chink""**: Has H (absent) -> invalid.
- **""crimp""**: Has R and P (absent) -> invalid.

Better options:
- **""cwtch""**: Not common, and W is less frequent.
- **""cynic""**: Has N (absent) -> invalid.
- **""comic""**: Has O and M? O is absent -> invalid.

After filtering, consider:
- **""big"" words? Must be 5 letters and start with C.

List of possible words with C, I in position 2, 4, or 5, and no absent letters:
- Position 2: C I _ _ _ 
  - Examples: ""ci**t**y"" (but Y is allowed, and T is new) -> ""city"" is 4 letters, not 5. 
  - 5-letter: ""ciggy"" (slang, not ideal), ""civic"" (as above, but double I and C).
  - ""civvy"" (informal, but valid: meaning civilian clothes) - letters: C, I, V, V, Y. But V is repeated? Not distinct, and we don't know about duplicates.

- Position 4: C _ _ I _
  - Examples: ""c**t**i**c"" -> ""cthic"" not a word. 
  - ""c**b**i**d**"" -> but D is absent. 
  - ""c**f**i**k**"" not a word.
  - Better: ""c**w**i**g**"" -> ""cwig"" not 5 letters. 
  - ""c**o**i**t**s"" has O (absent). 
  - Hard to find common words.

- Position 5: C _ _ _ I
  - Examples: ""c**b**i**t**i"" -> 5 letters? ""cbiti"" not a word. 
  - ""c**t**i**z**i"" not a word. 
  - ""c**k**i**t**i"" not a word. 
  - ""c**w**i**t**i"" not a word. 
  - ""c**v**i**t**i"" -> ""cviti"" not a word.

Alternatively, consider words with I in position 2:
- ""ciggy"" is 5 letters? It's informal for cigarette, but might be accepted. Letters: C, I, G, G, Y. But G repeated and Y is less common.
- ""civvy"": C, I, V, V, Y (repeated V).

But we need to test new letters. Let's think of words with I in position 4 or 5 that are valid.

Another idea: ""mitig"" not a word. ""cutis"" has U (absent). 

Focus on position 4 for I:
- ""antic"" has A and N (absent). 
- ""biotic"" is 6 letters. 
- ""conic"" has O and N (absent). 

Position 5 for I:
- ""ascii"" has A and S (absent). 
- ""kiwi"" not 5 letters. 
- ""taxi"" not 5 letters. 

Perhaps position 2 is easier. Let's list 5-letter words starting with C, with I in position 2, and no absent letters:
- ""chill"" has H and L (absent). 
- ""civic"": C, I, V, I, C -> I at positions 2 and 5, C at 1 and 5. We know C is at 1, but position 5 might be C? We don't know. Also, V is new. 
- ""civie"": but E is absent. 
- ""civvy"": as above.

Other letters: T, M, B, F, G, K, W, X, Y, Z are available.

How about ""city"" with an added letter? No.

Another word: ""cimex"" (a type of bug) - C, I, M, E, X. But E is absent -> invalid.

""cimic"" has E? No, C, I, M, I, C -> but E not present? ""cimic"" is not a common word, and it has two I's and two C's.

Perhaps we can try ""cwtch"" (Welsh word, accepted in some dictionaries): C, W, T, C, H -> but H is absent (from ""chips"" feedback: H(x)), and it has two C's. So invalid.

Let's use a word with I in position 4 or 5 and common letters.

Position 4: C _ _ I _
- ""busti"" not a word. 
- ""fusti"" not a word. 
- ""musti"" not a word. 
- ""tecti"" not a word. 
- ""vecti"" not a word. 
- ""wyted"" not with I.

Better: ""cutie"" has U and E (absent). 

Position 5: C _ _ _ I
- ""arki"" not 5. 
- ""bassi"" has A and S (absent). 
- ""benni"" has E and N (absent). 
- ""bi**t**i"" -> ""biti"" not 5. 
- ""cacti"": C, A, C, T, I -> A is absent -> invalid. 
- ""cesti"" not a word. 
- ""f**g**i"" -> ""cfgi"" not 5. 
- ""m**t**i"" -> ""cmti"" not a word. 
- ""t**b**i"" -> ""ctbi"" not a word. 
- ""v**t**i"" -> ""cvti"" not a word. 
- ""w**t**i"" -> ""cwti"" not a word. 
- ""x**t**i"" -> ""cxti"" not a word. 
- ""y**t**i"" -> ""cyti"" not a word. 
- ""z**t**i"" -> ""czti"" not a word.

This is difficult. Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: ""civic"" is valid, so let's use it despite the repeats. It tests I at positions 2 and 5, and V at position 3. We know position 1 is C, so if position 5 is also C, that would be new information. But it's a risk.

Alternatively, ""cyton"" has Y and T, but N is absent -> invalid.

""cymas"" has A and S -> invalid.

""cymol"" has O and L -> invalid.

Perhaps ""cysts"" has S (absent) -> invalid.

Let's think of words with I in position 2 and other allowed letters.

Word: ""ciggy"" (slang) - C, I, G, G, Y. But G is repeated, and Y is less common. But it tests G and Y.

Another: ""civvy"" - C, I, V, V, Y. Tests V and Y, but V repeated.

But we need to make progress. Let's choose ""civic"" as it's a standard word.

Or ""brick"" but R is absent.

Wait, we have I present, so we must include I in the guess.

Another common word: ""witch"" but doesn't start with C.

""pitch"" doesn't start with C.

Focus: Start with C, include I not in position 3, and use allowed letters.

Possible word: ""cabin"" has A and N (absent) -> invalid.

""cubic"" has U (absent) -> invalid.

""medic"" doesn't start with C.

""music"" has S and U (absent) -> invalid.

""toxic"" has O and X? O is absent -> invalid.

""logic"" has L and O (absent) -> invalid.

""magic"" has A and G? A is absent -> invalid.

""comic"" has O (absent) -> invalid.

""ionic"" has O and N (absent) -> invalid.

This is challenging. Let's consider less common letters.

Word: ""cyber"" has E and R (absent) -> invalid.

""cycad"" has A and D (absent) -> invalid.

""cycle"" has E and L (absent) -> invalid.

""cymar"" has A and M? A absent -> invalid.

""cymes"" has E and S (absent) -> invalid.

""cymol"" has O and L -> invalid.

""cyton"" has N and O -> invalid.

Perhaps ""cwtch"" is the only option? But H is absent.

Another idea: ""klick"" doesn't start with C.

We must use I. How about ""cinch"" has N and H (absent) -> invalid.

""cinct"" has N and T? N absent -> invalid.

""cines"" has E and S -> invalid.

""cions"" has O and S -> invalid.

Perhaps ""civie"" is an alternative spelling of civvy, but E is absent.

I think we have to use ""civic"" or ""civvy"" despite the repeats.

Let's choose ""civic"" because it's more common.

So, next guess: ""civic""

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has I in position 2 or 5, and possibly V, we'll get feedback.

Alternatively, if the word has only one I, we might get feedback that the second I is absent or wrong position.

But it's acceptable.

Another word: ""bikie"" doesn't start with C.

Or ""ticky"" not with C.

Final decision: ""civic""

<guess>civic</guess> 

But let's double-check the letters: C, I, V, I, C. 
- Position 1: C (correct, fixed)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but not position 3, so it could be here)
- Position 3: V (new letter)
- Position 4: I (second I, might be present or not)
- Position 5: C (we don't know if there's another C)

This tests:
- If I is in position 2 or 4 (or both).
- If V is in the word.
- If there is a second C.

It uses only allowed letters (C, I, V) and no absent letters (R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S).

So, it's valid.
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → Confirms **C** is correct in position 1, and **R, A, N, E** are absent.
- **Guess 2 (cloud)**: C(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x) → Confirms **C** again, and **L, O, U, D** are absent.
- **Guess 3 (could)**: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(x) D(x) → Redundant but reinforces that **O, U, L, D** are absent.
- **Guess 4 (chips)**: C(✓) H(x) I(-) P(x) S(x) → Confirms **C**, **H, P, S** are absent, and **I** is present but not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1).
- **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S (cannot be used).
- **Possible letters for positions 2–5**: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since **I** is confirmed present, it must appear once in one of these positions).
- No feedback suggests duplicate letters yet, so prioritize distinct letters for maximum information.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **I** in a position that hasn't been ruled out (position 2, 4, or 5—not 3).
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., **T, M, B, F, G, K**) and **I**'s position.
- **""civic""** is chosen because:
  - Starts with **C**.
  - Places **I** in position 2 and 5 (testing if **I** is in either spot, or if duplicates exist).
  - Introduces **V** (a new, less common letter to test).
  - Valid English word (noun meaning ""relating to citizens"").
- Alternatives like ""civvy"" (informal) or ""ciggy"" (slang) are less ideal due to repeats or obscurity.

<guess>civic</guess>",civic,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - The first letter is C and correct.
   - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.

2. **cloud**: C(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x)
   - The first letter C is correct (as expected).
   - L, O, U, D are absent.

3. **could**: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(x) D(x) (same as above, redundant but confirms absence of O, U, L, D)

4. **chips**: C(✓) H(x) I(-) P(x) S(x)
   - C is correct (position 1).
   - H, P, S are absent.
   - I is present in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position).

Key deductions:
- **Correct position**: Only position 1 is confirmed as C.
- **Present but misplaced**: I is in the word, but not at position 3.
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S (from all feedback).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since I is present, it must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5).

Constraints for the next guess:
- Must start with C.
- Must include the letter I (since it's present), but not in position 3.
- Cannot use any absent letters: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S.
- Should test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible positions for I:
- Since I is not in position 3, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Given the absent letters, the word must be composed of:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5: Letters from B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, with I appearing exactly once (since no feedback suggests duplicates, and we haven't tested duplicates).

Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test the position of I and other new letters.
- Choose a word that places I in one of the possible positions (2, 4, or 5) and uses other untested common letters (e.g., T, M, B, F, G, K) to maximize information.

Good candidate words:
- **""civic""**: But it has two I's and two C's. C is already fixed at position 1, and we don't know if there's another C. Also, it uses I at positions 2 and 5, but we don't know if I appears twice. Moreover, V is untested. However, it repeats I and C, which might not be efficient. Also, ""civic"" is a valid word.
- **""brick""**: But B and K are allowed, but it has R which is absent -> invalid.
- **""click""**: Has L (absent) and repeats C -> invalid.
- **""chink""**: Has H (absent) -> invalid.
- **""crimp""**: Has R and P (absent) -> invalid.

Better options:
- **""cwtch""**: Not common, and W is less frequent.
- **""cynic""**: Has N (absent) -> invalid.
- **""comic""**: Has O and M? O is absent -> invalid.

After filtering, consider:
- **""big"" words? Must be 5 letters and start with C.

List of possible words with C, I in position 2, 4, or 5, and no absent letters:
- Position 2: C I _ _ _ 
  - Examples: ""ci**t**y"" (but Y is allowed, and T is new) -> ""city"" is 4 letters, not 5. 
  - 5-letter: ""ciggy"" (slang, not ideal), ""civic"" (as above, but double I and C).
  - ""civvy"" (informal, but valid: meaning civilian clothes) - letters: C, I, V, V, Y. But V is repeated? Not distinct, and we don't know about duplicates.

- Position 4: C _ _ I _
  - Examples: ""c**t**i**c"" -> ""cthic"" not a word. 
  - ""c**b**i**d**"" -> but D is absent. 
  - ""c**f**i**k**"" not a word.
  - Better: ""c**w**i**g**"" -> ""cwig"" not 5 letters. 
  - ""c**o**i**t**s"" has O (absent). 
  - Hard to find common words.

- Position 5: C _ _ _ I
  - Examples: ""c**b**i**t**i"" -> 5 letters? ""cbiti"" not a word. 
  - ""c**t**i**z**i"" not a word. 
  - ""c**k**i**t**i"" not a word. 
  - ""c**w**i**t**i"" not a word. 
  - ""c**v**i**t**i"" -> ""cviti"" not a word.

Alternatively, consider words with I in position 2:
- ""ciggy"" is 5 letters? It's informal for cigarette, but might be accepted. Letters: C, I, G, G, Y. But G repeated and Y is less common.
- ""civvy"": C, I, V, V, Y (repeated V).

But we need to test new letters. Let's think of words with I in position 4 or 5 that are valid.

Another idea: ""mitig"" not a word. ""cutis"" has U (absent). 

Focus on position 4 for I:
- ""antic"" has A and N (absent). 
- ""biotic"" is 6 letters. 
- ""conic"" has O and N (absent). 

Position 5 for I:
- ""ascii"" has A and S (absent). 
- ""kiwi"" not 5 letters. 
- ""taxi"" not 5 letters. 

Perhaps position 2 is easier. Let's list 5-letter words starting with C, with I in position 2, and no absent letters:
- ""chill"" has H and L (absent). 
- ""civic"": C, I, V, I, C -> I at positions 2 and 5, C at 1 and 5. We know C is at 1, but position 5 might be C? We don't know. Also, V is new. 
- ""civie"": but E is absent. 
- ""civvy"": as above.

Other letters: T, M, B, F, G, K, W, X, Y, Z are available.

How about ""city"" with an added letter? No.

Another word: ""cimex"" (a type of bug) - C, I, M, E, X. But E is absent -> invalid.

""cimic"" has E? No, C, I, M, I, C -> but E not present? ""cimic"" is not a common word, and it has two I's and two C's.

Perhaps we can try ""cwtch"" (Welsh word, accepted in some dictionaries): C, W, T, C, H -> but H is absent (from ""chips"" feedback: H(x)), and it has two C's. So invalid.

Let's use a word with I in position 4 or 5 and common letters.

Position 4: C _ _ I _
- ""busti"" not a word. 
- ""fusti"" not a word. 
- ""musti"" not a word. 
- ""tecti"" not a word. 
- ""vecti"" not a word. 
- ""wyted"" not with I.

Better: ""cutie"" has U and E (absent). 

Position 5: C _ _ _ I
- ""arki"" not 5. 
- ""bassi"" has A and S (absent). 
- ""benni"" has E and N (absent). 
- ""bi**t**i"" -> ""biti"" not 5. 
- ""cacti"": C, A, C, T, I -> A is absent -> invalid. 
- ""cesti"" not a word. 
- ""f**g**i"" -> ""cfgi"" not 5. 
- ""m**t**i"" -> ""cmti"" not a word. 
- ""t**b**i"" -> ""ctbi"" not a word. 
- ""v**t**i"" -> ""cvti"" not a word. 
- ""w**t**i"" -> ""cwti"" not a word. 
- ""x**t**i"" -> ""cxti"" not a word. 
- ""y**t**i"" -> ""cyti"" not a word. 
- ""z**t**i"" -> ""czti"" not a word.

This is difficult. Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: ""civic"" is valid, so let's use it despite the repeats. It tests I at positions 2 and 5, and V at position 3. We know position 1 is C, so if position 5 is also C, that would be new information. But it's a risk.

Alternatively, ""cyton"" has Y and T, but N is absent -> invalid.

""cymas"" has A and S -> invalid.

""cymol"" has O and L -> invalid.

Perhaps ""cysts"" has S (absent) -> invalid.

Let's think of words with I in position 2 and other allowed letters.

Word: ""ciggy"" (slang) - C, I, G, G, Y. But G is repeated, and Y is less common. But it tests G and Y.

Another: ""civvy"" - C, I, V, V, Y. Tests V and Y, but V repeated.

But we need to make progress. Let's choose ""civic"" as it's a standard word.

Or ""brick"" but R is absent.

Wait, we have I present, so we must include I in the guess.

Another common word: ""witch"" but doesn't start with C.

""pitch"" doesn't start with C.

Focus: Start with C, include I not in position 3, and use allowed letters.

Possible word: ""cabin"" has A and N (absent) -> invalid.

""cubic"" has U (absent) -> invalid.

""medic"" doesn't start with C.

""music"" has S and U (absent) -> invalid.

""toxic"" has O and X? O is absent -> invalid.

""logic"" has L and O (absent) -> invalid.

""magic"" has A and G? A is absent -> invalid.

""comic"" has O (absent) -> invalid.

""ionic"" has O and N (absent) -> invalid.

This is challenging. Let's consider less common letters.

Word: ""cyber"" has E and R (absent) -> invalid.

""cycad"" has A and D (absent) -> invalid.

""cycle"" has E and L (absent) -> invalid.

""cymar"" has A and M? A absent -> invalid.

""cymes"" has E and S (absent) -> invalid.

""cymol"" has O and L -> invalid.

""cyton"" has N and O -> invalid.

Perhaps ""cwtch"" is the only option? But H is absent.

Another idea: ""klick"" doesn't start with C.

We must use I. How about ""cinch"" has N and H (absent) -> invalid.

""cinct"" has N and T? N absent -> invalid.

""cines"" has E and S -> invalid.

""cions"" has O and S -> invalid.

Perhaps ""civie"" is an alternative spelling of civvy, but E is absent.

I think we have to use ""civic"" or ""civvy"" despite the repeats.

Let's choose ""civic"" because it's more common.

So, next guess: ""civic""

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has I in position 2 or 5, and possibly V, we'll get feedback.

Alternatively, if the word has only one I, we might get feedback that the second I is absent or wrong position.

But it's acceptable.

Another word: ""bikie"" doesn't start with C.

Or ""ticky"" not with C.

Final decision: ""civic""

<guess>civic</guess> 

But let's double-check the letters: C, I, V, I, C. 
- Position 1: C (correct, fixed)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but not position 3, so it could be here)
- Position 3: V (new letter)
- Position 4: I (second I, might be present or not)
- Position 5: C (we don't know if there's another C)

This tests:
- If I is in position 2 or 4 (or both).
- If V is in the word.
- If there is a second C.

It uses only allowed letters (C, I, V) and no absent letters (R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S).

So, it's valid.Based on the cumulative feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → Confirms **C** is correct in position 1, and **R, A, N, E** are absent.
- **Guess 2 (cloud)**: C(✓) L(x) O(x) U(x) D(x) → Confirms **C** again, and **L, O, U, D** are absent.
- **Guess 3 (could)**: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(x) D(x) → Redundant but reinforces that **O, U, L, D** are absent.
- **Guess 4 (chips)**: C(✓) H(x) I(-) P(x) S(x) → Confirms **C**, **H, P, S** are absent, and **I** is present but not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1).
- **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, P, S (cannot be used).
- **Possible letters for positions 2–5**: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since **I** is confirmed present, it must appear once in one of these positions).
- No feedback suggests duplicate letters yet, so prioritize distinct letters for maximum information.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **I** in a position that hasn't been ruled out (position 2, 4, or 5—not 3).
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., **T, M, B, F, G, K**) and **I**'s position.
- **""civic""** is chosen because:
  - Starts with **C**.
  - Places **I** in position 2 and 5 (testing if **I** is in either spot, or if duplicates exist).
  - Introduces **V** (a new, less common letter to test).
  - Valid English word (noun meaning ""relating to citizens"").
- Alternatives like ""civvy"" (informal) or ""ciggy"" (slang) are less ideal due to repeats or obscurity.",Guess 5: civic -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) I(✓) V(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
