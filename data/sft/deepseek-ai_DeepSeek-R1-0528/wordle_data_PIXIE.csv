We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

Alright, let's analyze this feedback step by step. From the first guess ""crane"":

1. **C(x)**: The letter C is not in the secret word at all.  
2. **R(x)**: The letter R is also not in the secret word.  
3. **A(x)**: The letter A is not present either.  
4. **N(x)**: The letter N is not in the word.  
5. **E(✓)**: The letter E is in the word and correctly placed in the last position (position 5).  

So the secret word ends with E, and doesn't contain C, R, A, or N. 

Given that E is confirmed in the fifth position, and the other letters from ""crane"" are entirely absent, I need to choose a new word that:  
- Ends with E  
- Avoids C, R, A, N  
- Includes other common letters to test more possibilities  

Good options might include letters like S, T, O, L, I, D, P, etc.  

A word like **""SLATE""** comes to mind but it contains A, which we know is not in the word. Similarly, ""SPITE"" has I and T which haven't been tested yet, and ends with E.  

Another option is **""STOLE""**:  
- S: New letter  
- T: New letter  
- O: New letter  
- L: New letter  
- E: Already confirmed  

This avoids all excluded letters and tests four new common consonants.  

Alternatively, **""SPIKE""** could work but K might be less common.  

I think ""STOLE"" is a strong choice because it uses entirely new letters and maximizes information.  

Final decision: **STOLE**

Based on the previous feedback:
- E is confirmed in the last position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

I'll choose a new word that:
- Ends with E
- Uses entirely new letters (avoiding C/R/A/N)
- Tests common vowels and consonants like O, L, S, T

A strong candidate is **STOLE**—it fits all criteria and maximizes information by introducing four untested letters.

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: stole -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (which we already knew).
- S, T, O, L are not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

The only letter we know is present is E, and it is at the end.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Ends with E (since E is in position 5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We have to consider what letters are still possible. The remaining consonants and vowels that haven't been tested.

Common vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are either absent or known; E is known but we can have another E? But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless they are in the word. However, since we only have one E in the guesses and it was marked correct, there might be another E? But we don't know. We should avoid repeating E unless necessary, but it's allowed if the word has two E's.

But let's see: the feedback for ""crane"" had E(✓) and the others absent, and ""stole"" had E(✓) and others absent. So the word must have an E at the end, and none of the other letters we've tried.

We have to use new letters to get more information.

List of absent letters: A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and E (but E is already in position 5, so we can use E again? Actually, we don't know if the word has more than one E. But to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using E in other positions for now, to get clear feedback on new letters.

So, for the next guess, we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are from the available set and not repeated from previous absent letters.

Possible words: Let's think of common words ending with E.

Examples: 
- ""BIKE"" - but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""PIQUE"" - but Q is less common and we have to consider it.

We need 5-letter words.

Some ideas:
- ""PIECE"" - but we have two E's. Also, P, I, C, E. But C is absent (from first guess), so we cannot use C. C is in the absent list.

We cannot use any of the absent letters.

So, let's try to form a word without A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Ending with E: _ _ _ _ E

Possible words:
- ""BIDDE"" - not a word.
- ""BIGGE"" - not a word.
- ""BIKE"" - too short.

Better to think of common words.

How about ""JUICE""? J, U, I, C, E. But C is absent, so no.

""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E. Letters: G, U, I, D are all not in the absent list. So that's possible.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E. But T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so we cannot use T.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. But R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so no.

""BRIBE"": B, R, I, B, E. R is absent.

We need to avoid R.

""ABIDE"": A is absent.

""ALIVE"": A and L are absent.

""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E. But O is absent (from second guess: O(x)).

""WEDGE"": W, E, D, G, E. But we have E in the first position? We don't know if that's allowed, but the word has two E's. However, we are avoiding absent letters: W, E, D, G, E. E is known, but W, D, G are new. But the first letter is W, which is new. However, we have E in position 1 and 5? The word is W-E-D-G-E. So positions: 1:W, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

But we know the 5th is E, so that's fine. But we are introducing E in position 2? We don't know if the word has an E in position 2. But it might, or might not. The problem is that if we use E in position 2, and the secret word has only one E (at the end), then we would get an 'x' for the E in position 2, which is information. But if it has two E's, we might get a '-' or '✓' for position 2.

But we are trying to get information about other letters, so maybe it's better to avoid using E in other positions to avoid confusion. However, we are limited because we have to end with E and avoid many letters.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E only at the end and new letters elsewhere.

Another word: ""DUVET"" - D, U, V, E, T. But T is absent (from second guess), so no.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E. Again, E in position 2 and 5. And we have to avoid absent letters: B, E, I, G, E. B, I, G are new. But E is used twice.

""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. C is absent.

""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E. Letters: F, U, D, G, E. None of these are in the absent list? Let's check: absent are A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T. So F, U, D, G are not in that list. So ""FUDGE"" is a valid word and uses all new letters except the E at the end.

Similarly, ""MIDGE"": M, I, D, G, E. Also good.

""BUDGE"": B, U, D, G, E.

We have several options.

We want to cover more common letters. Let's think about vowels: we haven't tested I or U. So including a vowel might be good.

""FUDGE"" has U, which is a vowel.

""MIDGE"" has I.

Both are good.

Another one: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E. But N is absent (from first guess: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E. But R is absent.

""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T. T is absent.

So, without absent letters, we have:

- FUDGE: F, U, D, G, E
- MIDGE: M, I, D, G, E
- BUDGE: B, U, D, G, E
- WEDGE: W, E, D, G, E (but has E in position 2)
- JUDGE: J, U, D, G, E

""Judge"" is a word: J, U, D, G, E.

We can choose one that has a vowel to test for vowels. U and I are both vowels we haven't tested.

Also, we might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

All these words have distinct letters except for the E at the end, but the first four are distinct.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G — all distinct and new.

Similarly for others.

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and a vowel.

But let's see if we can cover more vowels. ""MIDGE"" has I, which is another vowel.

We don't know if the word has a vowel in the middle, so testing I or U is good.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has both I and U? But that might be hard without using absent letters.

For example, ""GUIDE"" — but we have to avoid absent letters: G, U, I, D, E. All are allowed? Yes, because absent are A,C,L,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, D are not in that list. And E is at the end.

""GUIDE"" is a valid word: G-U-I-D-E.

This has two vowels: U and I, which is even better for information.

Similarly, ""QUIET"" is out because of T.

""GUIDE"" seems perfect: it uses G, U, I, D, E — all new letters except the known E, and it tests two vowels and two consonants.

So I'll go with ""GUIDE"".

But let's confirm: the word is G-U-I-D-E, so positions:
1: G
2: U
3: I
4: D
5: E (known)

And none of G, U, I, D are in the absent list.

Yes.

So the next guess is ""guide"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓).
- **C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L** are absent (x) and cannot be used.

The new guess must:
- End with **E**.
- Avoid the absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L).
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, **GUIDE** is chosen because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It uses entirely new letters (G, U, I, D), maximizing information potential.
- It tests two untested vowels (U and I) and two consonants (G and D).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: stole -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (which we already knew).
- S, T, O, L are not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

The only letter we know is present is E, and it is at the end.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Ends with E (since E is in position 5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We have to consider what letters are still possible. The remaining consonants and vowels that haven't been tested.

Common vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are either absent or known; E is known but we can have another E? But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless they are in the word. However, since we only have one E in the guesses and it was marked correct, there might be another E? But we don't know. We should avoid repeating E unless necessary, but it's allowed if the word has two E's.

But let's see: the feedback for ""crane"" had E(✓) and the others absent, and ""stole"" had E(✓) and others absent. So the word must have an E at the end, and none of the other letters we've tried.

We have to use new letters to get more information.

List of absent letters: A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and E (but E is already in position 5, so we can use E again? Actually, we don't know if the word has more than one E. But to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using E in other positions for now, to get clear feedback on new letters.

So, for the next guess, we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are from the available set and not repeated from previous absent letters.

Possible words: Let's think of common words ending with E.

Examples: 
- ""BIKE"" - but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- ""PIQUE"" - but Q is less common and we have to consider it.

We need 5-letter words.

Some ideas:
- ""PIECE"" - but we have two E's. Also, P, I, C, E. But C is absent (from first guess), so we cannot use C. C is in the absent list.

We cannot use any of the absent letters.

So, let's try to form a word without A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Ending with E: _ _ _ _ E

Possible words:
- ""BIDDE"" - not a word.
- ""BIGGE"" - not a word.
- ""BIKE"" - too short.

Better to think of common words.

How about ""JUICE""? J, U, I, C, E. But C is absent, so no.

""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E. Letters: G, U, I, D are all not in the absent list. So that's possible.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E. But T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so we cannot use T.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. But R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so no.

""BRIBE"": B, R, I, B, E. R is absent.

We need to avoid R.

""ABIDE"": A is absent.

""ALIVE"": A and L are absent.

""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E. But O is absent (from second guess: O(x)).

""WEDGE"": W, E, D, G, E. But we have E in the first position? We don't know if that's allowed, but the word has two E's. However, we are avoiding absent letters: W, E, D, G, E. E is known, but W, D, G are new. But the first letter is W, which is new. However, we have E in position 1 and 5? The word is W-E-D-G-E. So positions: 1:W, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

But we know the 5th is E, so that's fine. But we are introducing E in position 2? We don't know if the word has an E in position 2. But it might, or might not. The problem is that if we use E in position 2, and the secret word has only one E (at the end), then we would get an 'x' for the E in position 2, which is information. But if it has two E's, we might get a '-' or '✓' for position 2.

But we are trying to get information about other letters, so maybe it's better to avoid using E in other positions to avoid confusion. However, we are limited because we have to end with E and avoid many letters.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E only at the end and new letters elsewhere.

Another word: ""DUVET"" - D, U, V, E, T. But T is absent (from second guess), so no.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E. Again, E in position 2 and 5. And we have to avoid absent letters: B, E, I, G, E. B, I, G are new. But E is used twice.

""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. C is absent.

""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E. Letters: F, U, D, G, E. None of these are in the absent list? Let's check: absent are A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T. So F, U, D, G are not in that list. So ""FUDGE"" is a valid word and uses all new letters except the E at the end.

Similarly, ""MIDGE"": M, I, D, G, E. Also good.

""BUDGE"": B, U, D, G, E.

We have several options.

We want to cover more common letters. Let's think about vowels: we haven't tested I or U. So including a vowel might be good.

""FUDGE"" has U, which is a vowel.

""MIDGE"" has I.

Both are good.

Another one: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E. But N is absent (from first guess: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E. But R is absent.

""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T. T is absent.

So, without absent letters, we have:

- FUDGE: F, U, D, G, E
- MIDGE: M, I, D, G, E
- BUDGE: B, U, D, G, E
- WEDGE: W, E, D, G, E (but has E in position 2)
- JUDGE: J, U, D, G, E

""Judge"" is a word: J, U, D, G, E.

We can choose one that has a vowel to test for vowels. U and I are both vowels we haven't tested.

Also, we might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

All these words have distinct letters except for the E at the end, but the first four are distinct.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G — all distinct and new.

Similarly for others.

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and a vowel.

But let's see if we can cover more vowels. ""MIDGE"" has I, which is another vowel.

We don't know if the word has a vowel in the middle, so testing I or U is good.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has both I and U? But that might be hard without using absent letters.

For example, ""GUIDE"" — but we have to avoid absent letters: G, U, I, D, E. All are allowed? Yes, because absent are A,C,L,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, D are not in that list. And E is at the end.

""GUIDE"" is a valid word: G-U-I-D-E.

This has two vowels: U and I, which is even better for information.

Similarly, ""QUIET"" is out because of T.

""GUIDE"" seems perfect: it uses G, U, I, D, E — all new letters except the known E, and it tests two vowels and two consonants.

So I'll go with ""GUIDE"".

But let's confirm: the word is G-U-I-D-E, so positions:
1: G
2: U
3: I
4: D
5: E (known)

And none of G, U, I, D are in the absent list.

Yes.

So the next guess is ""guide"".Based on the previous feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓).
- **C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L** are absent (x) and cannot be used.

The new guess must:
- End with **E**.
- Avoid the absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L).
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, **GUIDE** is chosen because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It uses entirely new letters (G, U, I, D), maximizing information potential.
- It tests two untested vowels (U and I) and two consonants (G and D).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 3: guide -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PIXIE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's analyze this feedback step by step. From the first guess ""crane"":

1. **C(x)**: The letter C is not in the secret word at all.  
2. **R(x)**: The letter R is also not in the secret word.  
3. **A(x)**: The letter A is not present either.  
4. **N(x)**: The letter N is not in the word.  
5. **E(✓)**: The letter E is in the word and correctly placed in the last position (position 5).  

So the secret word ends with E, and doesn't contain C, R, A, or N. 

Given that E is confirmed in the fifth position, and the other letters from ""crane"" are entirely absent, I need to choose a new word that:  
- Ends with E  
- Avoids C, R, A, N  
- Includes other common letters to test more possibilities  

Good options might include letters like S, T, O, L, I, D, P, etc.  

A word like **""SLATE""** comes to mind but it contains A, which we know is not in the word. Similarly, ""SPITE"" has I and T which haven't been tested yet, and ends with E.  

Another option is **""STOLE""**:  
- S: New letter  
- T: New letter  
- O: New letter  
- L: New letter  
- E: Already confirmed  

This avoids all excluded letters and tests four new common consonants.  

Alternatively, **""SPIKE""** could work but K might be less common.  

I think ""STOLE"" is a strong choice because it uses entirely new letters and maximizes information.  

Final decision: **STOLE**Based on the previous feedback:
- E is confirmed in the last position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

I'll choose a new word that:
- Ends with E
- Uses entirely new letters (avoiding C/R/A/N)
- Tests common vowels and consonants like O, L, S, T

A strong candidate is **STOLE**—it fits all criteria and maximizes information by introducing four untested letters.

So the word must have an E at the end, and none of the other letters we\'ve tried.\n\nWe have to use new letters to get more information.\n\nList of absent letters: A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and E (but E is already in position 5, so we can use E again? Actually, we don\'t know if the word has more than one E. But to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using E in other positions for now, to get clear feedback on new letters.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are from the available set and not repeated from previous absent letters.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s think of common words ending with E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""BIKE"" - but that\'s 4 letters, we need 5.\n- ""PIQUE"" - but Q is less common and we have to consider it.\n\nWe need 5-letter words.\n\nSome ideas:\n- ""PIECE"" - but we have two E\'s. Also, P, I, C, E. But C is absent (from first guess), so we cannot use C. C is in the absent list.\n\nWe cannot use any of the absent letters.\n\nSo, let\'s try to form a word without A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T.\n\nEnding with E: _ _ _ _ E\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BIDDE"" - not a word.\n- ""BIGGE"" - not a word.\n- ""BIKE"" - too short.\n\nBetter to think of common words.\n\nHow about ""JUICE""? J, U, I, C, E. But C is absent, so no.\n\n""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E. Letters: G, U, I, D are all not in the absent list. So that\'s possible.\n\n""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E. But T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so we cannot use T.\n\n""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. But R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so no.\n\n""BRIBE"": B, R, I, B, E. R is absent.\n\nWe need to avoid R.\n\n""ABIDE"": A is absent.\n\n""ALIVE"": A and L are absent.\n\n""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E. But O is absent (from second guess: O(x)).\n\n""WEDGE"": W, E, D, G, E. But we have E in the first position? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed, but the word has two E\'s. However, we are avoiding absent letters: W, E, D, G, E. E is known, but W, D, G are new. But the first letter is W, which is new. However, we have E in position 1 and 5? The word is W-E-D-G-E. So positions: 1:W, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.\n\nBut we know the 5th is E, so that\'s fine. But we are introducing E in position 2? We don\'t know if the word has an E in position 2. But it might, or might not. The problem is that if we use E in position 2, and the secret word has only one E (at the end), then we would get an \'x\' for the E in position 2, which is information. But if it has two E\'s, we might get a \'-\' or \'✓\' for position 2.\n\nBut we are trying to get information about other letters, so maybe it\'s better to avoid using E in other positions to avoid confusion. However, we are limited because we have to end with E and avoid many letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has E only at the end and new letters elsewhere.\n\nAnother word: ""DUVET"" - D, U, V, E, T. But T is absent (from second guess), so no.\n\n""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E. Again, E in position 2 and 5. And we have to avoid absent letters: B, E, I, G, E. B, I, G are new. But E is used twice.\n\n""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. C is absent.\n\n""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E. Letters: F, U, D, G, E. None of these are in the absent list? Let\'s check: absent are A, C, L, N, O, R, S, T. So F, U, D, G are not in that list. So ""FUDGE"" is a valid word and uses all new letters except the E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""MIDGE"": M, I, D, G, E. Also good.\n\n""BUDGE"": B, U, D, G, E.\n\nWe have several options.\n\nWe want to cover more common letters. Let\'s think about vowels: we haven\'t tested I or U. So including a vowel might be good.\n\n""FUDGE"" has U, which is a vowel.\n\n""MIDGE"" has I.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nAnother one: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E. But N is absent (from first guess: N(x)), so we cannot use N.\n\n""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E. But R is absent.\n\n""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T. T is absent.\n\nSo, without absent letters, we have:\n\n- FUDGE: F, U, D, G, E\n- MIDGE: M, I, D, G, E\n- BUDGE: B, U, D, G, E\n- WEDGE: W, E, D, G, E (but has E in position 2)\n- JUDGE: J, U, D, G, E\n\n""Judge"" is a word: J, U, D, G, E.\n\nWe can choose one that has a vowel to test for vowels. U and I are both vowels we haven\'t tested.\n\nAlso, we might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.\n\nAll these words have distinct letters except for the E at the end, but the first four are distinct.\n\n""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G — all distinct and new.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can cover more vowels. ""MIDGE"" has I, which is another vowel.\n\nWe don\'t know if the word has a vowel in the middle, so testing I or U is good.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has both I and U? But that might be hard without using absent letters.\n\nFor example, ""GUIDE"" — but we have to avoid absent letters: G, U, I, D, E. All are allowed? Yes, because absent are A,C,L,N,O,R,S,T. So G, U, I, D are not in that list. And E is at the end.\n\n""GUIDE"" is a valid word: G-U-I-D-E.\n\nThis has two vowels: U and I, which is even better for information.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUIET"" is out because of T.\n\n""GUIDE"" seems perfect: it uses G, U, I, D, E — all new letters except the known E, and it tests two vowels and two consonants.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GUIDE"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word is G-U-I-D-E, so positions:\n1: G\n2: U\n3: I\n4: D\n5: E (known)\n\nAnd none of G, U, I, D are in the absent list.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the next guess is ""guide"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓).\n- **C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L** are absent (x) and cannot be used.\n\nThe new guess must:\n- End with **E**.\n- Avoid the absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L).\n- Introduce new letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, **GUIDE** is chosen because:\n- It ends with **E**.\n- It uses entirely new letters (G, U, I, D), maximizing information potential.\n- It tests two untested vowels (U and I) and two consonants (G and D).\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>guide</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: guide -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
- S, T, O, L are absent (confirming they are not in the word).

Guess 3: guide -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)
- E is still correctly placed at the end (5th letter).
- G, U, D are absent.
- I is present in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position).

So, current knowledge:
- **Known present:** E (position 5), I (somewhere, but not in position 3).
- **Known absent:** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D.
- **Position constraints:** E must be in position 5. I cannot be in position 3.

We need to find a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter I (since it's present), but not in position 3.
- Does not contain any absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D.

Remaining letters to consider: From the alphabet, excluding the absent letters and including E and I.

Absent letters: A, C, D, G, L, N, O, R, S, T, U

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and E (but E is fixed at end).

Note that I is already confirmed present, so we must include I in the word, in a position other than 3.

Also, since E is fixed at position 5, and I is present but not in position 3, the I can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to make a new guess that incorporates I in one of these positions and uses only available letters.

Let's think of possible words ending with E that contain I, avoiding absent letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E
- Position 4: _ _ _ I E

And not position 3.

We need to fill the other positions with letters from: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since E and I are used, but E is fixed).

But note that the word might have repeated letters, although we don't have evidence of that yet. For now, assume we can use distinct letters to maximize information.

Let's try to form words.

Option: Position 1 for I: I _ _ _ E
- Words like ""IMAGE"" but M is allowed? I-M-A-G-E -> A is absent? A is in the absent list. So no.
- ""ISSUE"" has S and S absent? S is absent.
- We need without absent letters: so I + available letters.

""I"" as first letter: examples:
- ""IDIOM"" but ends with M, not E. We need to end with E.
- ""INVITE"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:
- ""IMAGE"" -> I,M,A,G,E: A absent, G absent -> invalid.
- ""INLET"" -> I,N,L,E,T: N, L, T absent -> invalid.
- ""IMPEL"" -> I,M,P,E,L: L absent -> invalid.
- ""IVIED"" -> I,V,I,E,D: has D (absent) and repeated I? But D is absent.

Another: ""INANE"" -> has N and A absent.

Not many. Perhaps I in position 1 is hard.

Position 2: _ I _ _ E
Examples:
- ""TITLE"" has T absent -> invalid.
- ""GIVEN"" has G and N absent -> invalid.
- ""MINCE"" has M and N, but C absent -> invalid.

Better to look for words ending with E and containing I.

Common words: ""JUICE"" but J,U,I,C,E: C is absent and U absent? Wait, U is absent? From guess 3 U(x) -> absent. So no.

""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,C,E: C absent and also has E in position 4? Word: P,I,E,C,E? Actually ""PIECE"" is P-I-E-C-E, so positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> C absent and E position 3? But we don't know about E elsewhere.

But C is absent so invalid.

""LIVE"" -> 4 letters.

Better: 5-letter words ending with E: let's list some without absent letters.

Available: B,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and I (must include), E (fixed).

So words: 
- ""BIKE"" -> 4 letters, no.
- ""LIKE"" -> 4.
- ""PIKE"" -> 4.
- ""DIVE"" -> 4.

5-letter: 
- ""BRIDE"" -> B,R,I,D,E: R and D absent -> invalid.
- ""PRIDE"" -> P,R,I,D,E: R,D absent -> invalid.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E: U,T absent -> invalid.
- ""WHINE"" -> W,H,I,N,E: N absent -> invalid.
- ""SHINE"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""CHIME"" -> C,H,I,M,E: C absent -> invalid.

We need to avoid the absent letters strictly.

Another word: ""JIVE"" -> 4 letters.

Perhaps ""EMPIRE"" -> 6 letters.

How about ""MOVIE"" -> 5 letters? M-O-V-I-E -> O is absent? From guess 2 O(x) -> absent. No.

""WIPED"" -> W,I,P,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""VISED"" -> V,I,S,E,D: S,D absent -> invalid.

""KITHE"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E: U is absent -> invalid.

Another idea: ""BIBLE"" -> B,I,B,L,E: L absent -> invalid.

This is tricky. We need to avoid 11 absent letters: A,C,D,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,U.

Available consonants: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels: We have I (must include), and possible others: but A, E, O, U are either absent or fixed. E is fixed at end. So remaining vowels? Only I is confirmed, and Y can be vowel.

So words with I and ending with E.

Consider ""HYPE"" -> 4 letters.

""BIKE"" too short.

Perhaps ""PIKE"" is not 5. What about ""PIKED""? But past tense? And has D? D absent.

""MIKVE"" -> not English.

Valid words: let's think ""JUMPS"" but not end E.

How about ""HIJAB"" not E.

Perhaps we are missing words. Let's recall allowed letters.

Another word: ""WIPER"" but ends R, not E. And R absent.

""VIPER"" -> ends R.

""BITER"" ends R.

But we need end E.

""BITE"" 4 letters.

""MITRE"" -> M-I-T-R-E -> T,R absent -> invalid.

""FIBRE"" -> F-I-B-R-E -> R absent -> invalid.

Perhaps we need to consider that I can be in position 4: _ _ _ I E

Then the word would be X X X I E

Examples: 
- ""AUDIO"" doesn't end with E.
- ""RADIO"" same.
- 5-letter ending with IE? Actually ""IE"" at end, so position 4: I, position 5: E -> but E is fixed at 5, so position 4: I would be I then E.

Words ending with ""IE"" are often in 4 letters (like ""lie""), but 5-letter words?

Examples: ""MOVIE"" -> M-O-V-I-E, but O absent.
""BOWIE"" -> B-O-W-I-E: O absent? Also, B-O-W-I-E? Not standard.

""ZOWIE"" -> not common.

""TOWIE"" not common.

""COVIE"" not word.

Another: ""CUTIE"" -> C-U-T-I-E: C,U,T absent -> invalid.

""PYXIE"" -> P-Y-X-I-E: this is a word? Pyxie is a flower, I think. Letters: P,Y,X,I,E.

Check absent letters: P, Y, X, I, E. E is fixed. I is present. P, Y, X are not in absent list? Absent are A,C,D,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,U. So P,Y,X are all available.

Is ""PYXIE"" a valid word? Pyxie can refer to a type of grass or fairy, it's uncommon but acceptable. We need to be cautious.

To be safe, let's choose a more common word.

Perhaps ""HYPNE"" not word.

""WIVED"" -> W-I-V-E-D, but D absent -> invalid.

""MAZED"" -> M,A,Z,E,D: A,D absent -> invalid.

Perhaps ""JUICY"" not E.

Another idea: since I cannot be in position 3, and we can have it in position 2 or 4, let's try position 2.

_ I _ _ E

With available letters:

First position: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Third position: same set except cannot be I? We don't know.

Fourth position: same.

Word pattern: for example, ""W I _ _ E"" or ""H I _ _ E""

Words:
- ""WIDEN"" ends with N, not E -> invalid.
- ""WIDER"" ends R -> invalid.
- ""WOMEN"" has O and not E -> invalid.
- ""HIKED"" -> H,I,K,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""JINKS"" not E.

""KINDS"" not E.

Perhaps ""PIXEL"" -> P,I,X,E,L: L absent -> invalid. But L is absent.

""MINER"" ends R.

""TIGER"" ends R.

""VIPES"" not a word.

We need E at end.

""BIKES"" -> B,I,K,E,S: S absent -> invalid.

""MIKES"" -> M,I,K,E,S: S absent.

""PINES"" -> S absent.

All these have S which is absent.

But we have Q, V, etc.

""QUIFF"" not E.

Another word: ""PIED"" is 4.

Perhaps ""CHIVE"" -> C absent.

Wait, we have F available.

""FIFE"" -> 4 letters.

""HIKE"" -> 4.

Perhaps we concede that I might have to be in position 4 and use an uncommon word.

Or perhaps there is a word with I in position 1: let's think of ""ICED"" -> 4.

""IMAGE"" not allowed.

""IDEAL"" not E ending.

""IDEM"" not E ending.

""IDLED"" has D,L -> invalid.

Perhaps ""IXORA"" not E.

Let's consider ""VOGIE"" not word.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has I in position 4: _ _ _ I E

Examples: 
- ""BOOIE"" not word.
- ""JUILL"" not.
- ""FUSIE"" not.

But ""GENIE"" -> G,E,N,I,E: G and N absent -> invalid.

""TEPEE"" -> T,E,P,E,E: T absent -> invalid.

But E is used, and T absent.

Perhaps ""BOMBE"" -> B,O,M,B,E: O absent -> invalid.

This is difficult. Let's list actual English words.

Available letters set: B,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Must include I, end with E, and not use absent letters.

Perhaps ""JUISE"" not a word.

""QAJIQ"" not ending E.

Another idea: ""VIEW"" -> 4 letters.

""CREV"" not.

Perhaps we forgot that Y can be in the word.

Word ending with E: ""SHIRE"" -> S absent.

""WHILE"" -> W,H,I,L,E: L absent -> invalid.

""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E: A,S absent -> invalid.

""QUINE"" -> Q,U,I,N,E: U,N absent -> invalid.

""QUIRE"" -> Q,U,I,R,E: U,R absent -> invalid.

Perhaps ""WIMHY"" not E.

Actually, ""WIMPLE"" is 6 letters.

Or ""PIMPLE"" ends E? P,I,M,P,L,E -> L absent -> invalid.

We need to use Q without U? Like ""QIBLA"" not E.

But "" QIANA"" not E.

Another possibility: ""JIVEY"" not E.

Perhaps ""KIFFE"" not common word.

Let's try ""MIXED"" -> M,I,X,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""FIXED"" -> F,I,X,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""HEXED"" -> H,E,X,E,D: D absent, and E in position 2? But D is absent -> invalid.

Wait, ""HEXED"" has D, which is absent.

We have to avoid D.

""WAXED"" -> D absent.

""BOXED"" -> B,O,X,E,D: O,D absent -> invalid.

""BAKED"" -> B,A,K,E,D: A,D absent.

But all have D? No.

Word: ""VEXED"" -> V,E,X,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

Are there words ending with XE? Like ""RELAX"" but not E.

""FIX E""  not 5.

Perhaps ""EXILE"" -> E,X,I,L,E: L absent -> invalid.

We have Q: ""QUITE"" has U and T, both absent.

Perhaps we need to consider that the word might have a Y.

""JIBED"" J,I,B,E,D: D absent.

""KITED"" K,I,T,E,D: T,D absent -> invalid.

But we have V: ""VINED"" has N.

"" ZILCH"" not E.

Maybe ""HIZEN"" not a word.

Perhaps ""PIECE"" is not allowed because C is out.

But let's reconsider the constraint: I is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2, or 4.

And for position 4, a common word is ""MOVIE"", but O is absent.

""BEADY"" not E.

Another idea: ""OWRIE"" not common.

Perhaps we can use ""PIXIE"" again? Earlier I thought of ""PYXIE"", but let's confirm.

""PIXIE"": P-I-X-I-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:X, 4:I, 5:E? But we have two I's. And ""PIXIE"" is a word, but let's see available: P, I, X, E. I is used twice? and E. Absent checks: P, X are new, but I is used.

However, ""PIXIE"" has I in position 2 and 4? No, position 4 is I.

But in the word ""PIXIE"", the letters are P,I,X,I,E — so position 1:P, 2:I, 3:X, 4:I, 5:E. So there are two I's.

In our feedback from guess 3, for ""guide"", we have I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn't say there is only one I, so there could be multiple.

But in ""PIXIE"", if the secret word has only one I, then we might get a mix, but it's possible.

However, ""PIXIE"" uses P, I, X, E — and E is fixed. P and X are new.

Absent letters include none of these: P, I, X are not in absent list.

Is ""PIXIE"" valid? Yes, it is a term for a type of fairy or sprite.

Another common word: ""JIUMP"" not.

Perhaps "" QUIFT"" not.

""BEFOG"" not E ending.

But to be more standard, how about ""WIPER"" but ends R.

Another common word ending with E: ""PHONE"" -> P,H,O,N,E: O,N absent and A absent.

We have to choose something.

Perhaps ""KIOSK"" not E.

Let's search for words with available letters in the pattern.

Since I is in the word, not position 3, position 4 is a good candidate for I, so _ _ _ I E.

Fill the first three with available consonants.

For example, B F I E? Not.

"" BUMPH"" not E.

Perhaps ""HEMIC"" has C.

Not.

It might be that the onle common word is something like ""WHITE"" but H is available, but T is absent.

""BRIMS"" not E.

""CHIPS"" not E.

"" JIVES"" not E.

Perhaps we can use ""YIPES"" -> Y,I,P,E,S: S absent -> invalid.

""YIKES"" not E ending.

""MIMES"" M,I,M,E,S: S absent -> invalid.

With Q: ""PEQAN"" not E.

I think ""PIXIE"" is a reasonable choice, even if uncommon. Alternatively, ""JINKS"" not E.

Another word: ""VIBEX"" not ending E.

Or ""FIREF"" not.

Perhaps ""EXAM"" not E.

Let's consider that I can be in position 1: ""IFORM"" not E.

""I  E"" like ""IRE"" not 5.

The oher option: position 2.

For example, "" HI  E"" with something in between.

Like ""HIRE"" not E.

""MINCE"" has N and C.

""WINE"" not 5.

""TINE"" not.

""PINNE"" not word.

Perhaps ""BIKIE"" -> B,I,K,I,E: this is a word, variant of biker? But informal. Letters: B,I,K,I,E.
Ends with E. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:I, 5:E.

Check absent: B, I, K, E — B and K are new and not absent. I is present. Has two I's.

So ""BIKIE"" could be used.

Similarly, ""PIXIE"" as above.

Compare ""BIKIE"" and ""PIXIE"", both have repeated letters potentially.

To maximize new information, use a word with more new letters.

For ""BIKIE"": letters B, I, K

For ""PIXIE"": P, I, X

Both have three new letters except E and I present.

Also, both have I in position 2 and another in position 4? ""BIKIE"" has I in 2 and 4? B-I-K-I-E: position 2: I, position 4: I.

But we know I is present, but we don't know if there is one or two.

In ""guide"", we had I in position 3 and got (-) meaning I is in the word but not in 3, so there is at least one I. If the word has two I's, that's fine.

In ""BIKIE"" or ""PIXIE"", they both have I not in position 3, so it satisfies.

But let's avoid repetition if possible.

Is there a word with I in position 4 and no repetition? _ _ _ I E

With first three from available letters.

For example, "" JAMIE"" has A, not available.

"" BEMIX"" not ending E.

"" PER I E"" like ""PERCE"" not with I.

""PERI"" is 4.

"" CAMEL"" not E.

Another word: ""HAPPY"" not E.

Perhaps ""QUIPU"" not E.

I think we have to go with something like ""PIXIE"" or ""BIKIE"" or any other option.

Another common word: ""JUDGE"" but J,U,D,G,E: U and D absent -> invalid.

Previously, we have ""WEDGE"" but E in position 2 and it has D and G? D and G are absent from previous feedback? From guess 3: D(x) and G(x), so both absent. So we cannot use D or G.

In guess 3: guide -> G(x) U(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓), so G and D are absent.

So in available letters, we must exclude G and D.

I forgot that D is absent! From guess 3, D(x), so D is absent.

So update absent letters: from all guesses, absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D.

So additional G and D absent.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

And I must be in the word.

Ending with E.

But E is fixed at end.

So now, with D and G also absent, it's even harder.

Now ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, E — P, X new, I and E.

D and G are absent, so ok.

""BIKIE"": B,I,K,I,E — B,K new.

Both ar possible.

Another word: ""VITAMIN"" too long.

""LIKE"" too short.

""MINIM"" not E.

""VIXEN"" ending N? V,I,X,E,N -> N absent -> invalid.

""WAIVE"" W,A,I,V,E -> A absent -> invalid.

""QUERY"" not E.

""QUEST"" not E.

""QUICK"" not E.

""JUMBLE"" not 5.

Perhaps ""MIXUP"" not E.

I think ""PIXIE"" is acceptable.

Or ""BIKIE"".

But let's find a standard word: ""SHIRE"" has S.

""WHITE"" has T and H is available? But T is absent.

""CRYPT"" not E.

""MYRRH"" not E.

Another: ""BYSSI"" not E.

Perhaps ""HYDRO"" not E.

We go with ""PIXIE"" for now.

Or to include more common letters, how about ""JUMBO"" not E.

""FECES"" has C? F,E,C,E,S: C and S absent -> invalid.

"" BEECH"" has C,H -> C absent.

 I think ""PIXIE"" is as good as any.

Position I in position 1: ""IC   E"" no common words.

""IRATE"" has R,A,T absent.

So I'll choose ""PIXIE"".

So word: P-I-X-I-E

This has I in position 2 and 4, not 3, so satisfies the I constraint.

Ends with E.

No absent letters.

So guess: PIXIE

If we want to avoid two I's, but we don't know if it's single or double, so it's fine.

Other option: ""KIBBE"" -> K,I,B,B,E: but ""kibbe"" is a word, with two B's, but it ends with E? ""kibbe"" is K-I-B-B-E, 5 letters. And letters: K, I, B, E — B and K are available. As ""kibbe"" (a dish).

But less common than ""pixie"".

So I'll stick with ""pixie"".

In the word ""pixie"", the letters are P, I, X, I, E, so it has two I's, but we are introducing P and X.

For feedback, it will show for each position.

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓).
- **I** is present in the word but not in position 3 (as indicated by ""-"" in ""guide"").
- **Absent letters:** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D (all marked ""x"").
- Therefore, available letters include: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word ending in **E** (position 5).
- Must include **I** (since it is present), but not in position 3.
- Must avoid all absent letters.
- I can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

After evaluating possible words:
- ""PIXIE"" was selected as it satisfies all constraints:
  - Ends with **E**.
  - Contains **I** in positions 2 and 4 (avoiding position 3).
  - Uses only available letters: P, I, X, E (P and X are new, providing additional information).
  - It is a valid English word (referring to a type of fairy or sprite).

<guess>pixie</guess>",pixie,"We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
- S, T, O, L are absent (confirming they are not in the word).

Guess 3: guide -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)
- E is still correctly placed at the end (5th letter).
- G, U, D are absent.
- I is present in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position).

So, current knowledge:
- **Known present:** E (position 5), I (somewhere, but not in position 3).
- **Known absent:** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D.
- **Position constraints:** E must be in position 5. I cannot be in position 3.

We need to find a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter I (since it's present), but not in position 3.
- Does not contain any absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D.

Remaining letters to consider: From the alphabet, excluding the absent letters and including E and I.

Absent letters: A, C, D, G, L, N, O, R, S, T, U

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and E (but E is fixed at end).

Note that I is already confirmed present, so we must include I in the word, in a position other than 3.

Also, since E is fixed at position 5, and I is present but not in position 3, the I can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to make a new guess that incorporates I in one of these positions and uses only available letters.

Let's think of possible words ending with E that contain I, avoiding absent letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E
- Position 4: _ _ _ I E

And not position 3.

We need to fill the other positions with letters from: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since E and I are used, but E is fixed).

But note that the word might have repeated letters, although we don't have evidence of that yet. For now, assume we can use distinct letters to maximize information.

Let's try to form words.

Option: Position 1 for I: I _ _ _ E
- Words like ""IMAGE"" but M is allowed? I-M-A-G-E -> A is absent? A is in the absent list. So no.
- ""ISSUE"" has S and S absent? S is absent.
- We need without absent letters: so I + available letters.

""I"" as first letter: examples:
- ""IDIOM"" but ends with M, not E. We need to end with E.
- ""INVITE"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:
- ""IMAGE"" -> I,M,A,G,E: A absent, G absent -> invalid.
- ""INLET"" -> I,N,L,E,T: N, L, T absent -> invalid.
- ""IMPEL"" -> I,M,P,E,L: L absent -> invalid.
- ""IVIED"" -> I,V,I,E,D: has D (absent) and repeated I? But D is absent.

Another: ""INANE"" -> has N and A absent.

Not many. Perhaps I in position 1 is hard.

Position 2: _ I _ _ E
Examples:
- ""TITLE"" has T absent -> invalid.
- ""GIVEN"" has G and N absent -> invalid.
- ""MINCE"" has M and N, but C absent -> invalid.

Better to look for words ending with E and containing I.

Common words: ""JUICE"" but J,U,I,C,E: C is absent and U absent? Wait, U is absent? From guess 3 U(x) -> absent. So no.

""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,C,E: C absent and also has E in position 4? Word: P,I,E,C,E? Actually ""PIECE"" is P-I-E-C-E, so positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> C absent and E position 3? But we don't know about E elsewhere.

But C is absent so invalid.

""LIVE"" -> 4 letters.

Better: 5-letter words ending with E: let's list some without absent letters.

Available: B,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and I (must include), E (fixed).

So words: 
- ""BIKE"" -> 4 letters, no.
- ""LIKE"" -> 4.
- ""PIKE"" -> 4.
- ""DIVE"" -> 4.

5-letter: 
- ""BRIDE"" -> B,R,I,D,E: R and D absent -> invalid.
- ""PRIDE"" -> P,R,I,D,E: R,D absent -> invalid.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E: U,T absent -> invalid.
- ""WHINE"" -> W,H,I,N,E: N absent -> invalid.
- ""SHINE"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""CHIME"" -> C,H,I,M,E: C absent -> invalid.

We need to avoid the absent letters strictly.

Another word: ""JIVE"" -> 4 letters.

Perhaps ""EMPIRE"" -> 6 letters.

How about ""MOVIE"" -> 5 letters? M-O-V-I-E -> O is absent? From guess 2 O(x) -> absent. No.

""WIPED"" -> W,I,P,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""VISED"" -> V,I,S,E,D: S,D absent -> invalid.

""KITHE"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E: U is absent -> invalid.

Another idea: ""BIBLE"" -> B,I,B,L,E: L absent -> invalid.

This is tricky. We need to avoid 11 absent letters: A,C,D,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,U.

Available consonants: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels: We have I (must include), and possible others: but A, E, O, U are either absent or fixed. E is fixed at end. So remaining vowels? Only I is confirmed, and Y can be vowel.

So words with I and ending with E.

Consider ""HYPE"" -> 4 letters.

""BIKE"" too short.

Perhaps ""PIKE"" is not 5. What about ""PIKED""? But past tense? And has D? D absent.

""MIKVE"" -> not English.

Valid words: let's think ""JUMPS"" but not end E.

How about ""HIJAB"" not E.

Perhaps we are missing words. Let's recall allowed letters.

Another word: ""WIPER"" but ends R, not E. And R absent.

""VIPER"" -> ends R.

""BITER"" ends R.

But we need end E.

""BITE"" 4 letters.

""MITRE"" -> M-I-T-R-E -> T,R absent -> invalid.

""FIBRE"" -> F-I-B-R-E -> R absent -> invalid.

Perhaps we need to consider that I can be in position 4: _ _ _ I E

Then the word would be X X X I E

Examples: 
- ""AUDIO"" doesn't end with E.
- ""RADIO"" same.
- 5-letter ending with IE? Actually ""IE"" at end, so position 4: I, position 5: E -> but E is fixed at 5, so position 4: I would be I then E.

Words ending with ""IE"" are often in 4 letters (like ""lie""), but 5-letter words?

Examples: ""MOVIE"" -> M-O-V-I-E, but O absent.
""BOWIE"" -> B-O-W-I-E: O absent? Also, B-O-W-I-E? Not standard.

""ZOWIE"" -> not common.

""TOWIE"" not common.

""COVIE"" not word.

Another: ""CUTIE"" -> C-U-T-I-E: C,U,T absent -> invalid.

""PYXIE"" -> P-Y-X-I-E: this is a word? Pyxie is a flower, I think. Letters: P,Y,X,I,E.

Check absent letters: P, Y, X, I, E. E is fixed. I is present. P, Y, X are not in absent list? Absent are A,C,D,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,U. So P,Y,X are all available.

Is ""PYXIE"" a valid word? Pyxie can refer to a type of grass or fairy, it's uncommon but acceptable. We need to be cautious.

To be safe, let's choose a more common word.

Perhaps ""HYPNE"" not word.

""WIVED"" -> W-I-V-E-D, but D absent -> invalid.

""MAZED"" -> M,A,Z,E,D: A,D absent -> invalid.

Perhaps ""JUICY"" not E.

Another idea: since I cannot be in position 3, and we can have it in position 2 or 4, let's try position 2.

_ I _ _ E

With available letters:

First position: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Third position: same set except cannot be I? We don't know.

Fourth position: same.

Word pattern: for example, ""W I _ _ E"" or ""H I _ _ E""

Words:
- ""WIDEN"" ends with N, not E -> invalid.
- ""WIDER"" ends R -> invalid.
- ""WOMEN"" has O and not E -> invalid.
- ""HIKED"" -> H,I,K,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""JINKS"" not E.

""KINDS"" not E.

Perhaps ""PIXEL"" -> P,I,X,E,L: L absent -> invalid. But L is absent.

""MINER"" ends R.

""TIGER"" ends R.

""VIPES"" not a word.

We need E at end.

""BIKES"" -> B,I,K,E,S: S absent -> invalid.

""MIKES"" -> M,I,K,E,S: S absent.

""PINES"" -> S absent.

All these have S which is absent.

But we have Q, V, etc.

""QUIFF"" not E.

Another word: ""PIED"" is 4.

Perhaps ""CHIVE"" -> C absent.

Wait, we have F available.

""FIFE"" -> 4 letters.

""HIKE"" -> 4.

Perhaps we concede that I might have to be in position 4 and use an uncommon word.

Or perhaps there is a word with I in position 1: let's think of ""ICED"" -> 4.

""IMAGE"" not allowed.

""IDEAL"" not E ending.

""IDEM"" not E ending.

""IDLED"" has D,L -> invalid.

Perhaps ""IXORA"" not E.

Let's consider ""VOGIE"" not word.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has I in position 4: _ _ _ I E

Examples: 
- ""BOOIE"" not word.
- ""JUILL"" not.
- ""FUSIE"" not.

But ""GENIE"" -> G,E,N,I,E: G and N absent -> invalid.

""TEPEE"" -> T,E,P,E,E: T absent -> invalid.

But E is used, and T absent.

Perhaps ""BOMBE"" -> B,O,M,B,E: O absent -> invalid.

This is difficult. Let's list actual English words.

Available letters set: B,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Must include I, end with E, and not use absent letters.

Perhaps ""JUISE"" not a word.

""QAJIQ"" not ending E.

Another idea: ""VIEW"" -> 4 letters.

""CREV"" not.

Perhaps we forgot that Y can be in the word.

Word ending with E: ""SHIRE"" -> S absent.

""WHILE"" -> W,H,I,L,E: L absent -> invalid.

""PHASE"" -> P,H,A,S,E: A,S absent -> invalid.

""QUINE"" -> Q,U,I,N,E: U,N absent -> invalid.

""QUIRE"" -> Q,U,I,R,E: U,R absent -> invalid.

Perhaps ""WIMHY"" not E.

Actually, ""WIMPLE"" is 6 letters.

Or ""PIMPLE"" ends E? P,I,M,P,L,E -> L absent -> invalid.

We need to use Q without U? Like ""QIBLA"" not E.

But "" QIANA"" not E.

Another possibility: ""JIVEY"" not E.

Perhaps ""KIFFE"" not common word.

Let's try ""MIXED"" -> M,I,X,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""FIXED"" -> F,I,X,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

""HEXED"" -> H,E,X,E,D: D absent, and E in position 2? But D is absent -> invalid.

Wait, ""HEXED"" has D, which is absent.

We have to avoid D.

""WAXED"" -> D absent.

""BOXED"" -> B,O,X,E,D: O,D absent -> invalid.

""BAKED"" -> B,A,K,E,D: A,D absent.

But all have D? No.

Word: ""VEXED"" -> V,E,X,E,D: D absent -> invalid.

Are there words ending with XE? Like ""RELAX"" but not E.

""FIX E""  not 5.

Perhaps ""EXILE"" -> E,X,I,L,E: L absent -> invalid.

We have Q: ""QUITE"" has U and T, both absent.

Perhaps we need to consider that the word might have a Y.

""JIBED"" J,I,B,E,D: D absent.

""KITED"" K,I,T,E,D: T,D absent -> invalid.

But we have V: ""VINED"" has N.

"" ZILCH"" not E.

Maybe ""HIZEN"" not a word.

Perhaps ""PIECE"" is not allowed because C is out.

But let's reconsider the constraint: I is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2, or 4.

And for position 4, a common word is ""MOVIE"", but O is absent.

""BEADY"" not E.

Another idea: ""OWRIE"" not common.

Perhaps we can use ""PIXIE"" again? Earlier I thought of ""PYXIE"", but let's confirm.

""PIXIE"": P-I-X-I-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:X, 4:I, 5:E? But we have two I's. And ""PIXIE"" is a word, but let's see available: P, I, X, E. I is used twice? and E. Absent checks: P, X are new, but I is used.

However, ""PIXIE"" has I in position 2 and 4? No, position 4 is I.

But in the word ""PIXIE"", the letters are P,I,X,I,E — so position 1:P, 2:I, 3:X, 4:I, 5:E. So there are two I's.

In our feedback from guess 3, for ""guide"", we have I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn't say there is only one I, so there could be multiple.

But in ""PIXIE"", if the secret word has only one I, then we might get a mix, but it's possible.

However, ""PIXIE"" uses P, I, X, E — and E is fixed. P and X are new.

Absent letters include none of these: P, I, X are not in absent list.

Is ""PIXIE"" valid? Yes, it is a term for a type of fairy or sprite.

Another common word: ""JIUMP"" not.

Perhaps "" QUIFT"" not.

""BEFOG"" not E ending.

But to be more standard, how about ""WIPER"" but ends R.

Another common word ending with E: ""PHONE"" -> P,H,O,N,E: O,N absent and A absent.

We have to choose something.

Perhaps ""KIOSK"" not E.

Let's search for words with available letters in the pattern.

Since I is in the word, not position 3, position 4 is a good candidate for I, so _ _ _ I E.

Fill the first three with available consonants.

For example, B F I E? Not.

"" BUMPH"" not E.

Perhaps ""HEMIC"" has C.

Not.

It might be that the onle common word is something like ""WHITE"" but H is available, but T is absent.

""BRIMS"" not E.

""CHIPS"" not E.

"" JIVES"" not E.

Perhaps we can use ""YIPES"" -> Y,I,P,E,S: S absent -> invalid.

""YIKES"" not E ending.

""MIMES"" M,I,M,E,S: S absent -> invalid.

With Q: ""PEQAN"" not E.

I think ""PIXIE"" is a reasonable choice, even if uncommon. Alternatively, ""JINKS"" not E.

Another word: ""VIBEX"" not ending E.

Or ""FIREF"" not.

Perhaps ""EXAM"" not E.

Let's consider that I can be in position 1: ""IFORM"" not E.

""I  E"" like ""IRE"" not 5.

The oher option: position 2.

For example, "" HI  E"" with something in between.

Like ""HIRE"" not E.

""MINCE"" has N and C.

""WINE"" not 5.

""TINE"" not.

""PINNE"" not word.

Perhaps ""BIKIE"" -> B,I,K,I,E: this is a word, variant of biker? But informal. Letters: B,I,K,I,E.
Ends with E. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:I, 5:E.

Check absent: B, I, K, E — B and K are new and not absent. I is present. Has two I's.

So ""BIKIE"" could be used.

Similarly, ""PIXIE"" as above.

Compare ""BIKIE"" and ""PIXIE"", both have repeated letters potentially.

To maximize new information, use a word with more new letters.

For ""BIKIE"": letters B, I, K

For ""PIXIE"": P, I, X

Both have three new letters except E and I present.

Also, both have I in position 2 and another in position 4? ""BIKIE"" has I in 2 and 4? B-I-K-I-E: position 2: I, position 4: I.

But we know I is present, but we don't know if there is one or two.

In ""guide"", we had I in position 3 and got (-) meaning I is in the word but not in 3, so there is at least one I. If the word has two I's, that's fine.

In ""BIKIE"" or ""PIXIE"", they both have I not in position 3, so it satisfies.

But let's avoid repetition if possible.

Is there a word with I in position 4 and no repetition? _ _ _ I E

With first three from available letters.

For example, "" JAMIE"" has A, not available.

"" BEMIX"" not ending E.

"" PER I E"" like ""PERCE"" not with I.

""PERI"" is 4.

"" CAMEL"" not E.

Another word: ""HAPPY"" not E.

Perhaps ""QUIPU"" not E.

I think we have to go with something like ""PIXIE"" or ""BIKIE"" or any other option.

Another common word: ""JUDGE"" but J,U,D,G,E: U and D absent -> invalid.

Previously, we have ""WEDGE"" but E in position 2 and it has D and G? D and G are absent from previous feedback? From guess 3: D(x) and G(x), so both absent. So we cannot use D or G.

In guess 3: guide -> G(x) U(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓), so G and D are absent.

So in available letters, we must exclude G and D.

I forgot that D is absent! From guess 3, D(x), so D is absent.

So update absent letters: from all guesses, absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D.

So additional G and D absent.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

And I must be in the word.

Ending with E.

But E is fixed at end.

So now, with D and G also absent, it's even harder.

Now ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, E — P, X new, I and E.

D and G are absent, so ok.

""BIKIE"": B,I,K,I,E — B,K new.

Both ar possible.

Another word: ""VITAMIN"" too long.

""LIKE"" too short.

""MINIM"" not E.

""VIXEN"" ending N? V,I,X,E,N -> N absent -> invalid.

""WAIVE"" W,A,I,V,E -> A absent -> invalid.

""QUERY"" not E.

""QUEST"" not E.

""QUICK"" not E.

""JUMBLE"" not 5.

Perhaps ""MIXUP"" not E.

I think ""PIXIE"" is acceptable.

Or ""BIKIE"".

But let's find a standard word: ""SHIRE"" has S.

""WHITE"" has T and H is available? But T is absent.

""CRYPT"" not E.

""MYRRH"" not E.

Another: ""BYSSI"" not E.

Perhaps ""HYDRO"" not E.

We go with ""PIXIE"" for now.

Or to include more common letters, how about ""JUMBO"" not E.

""FECES"" has C? F,E,C,E,S: C and S absent -> invalid.

"" BEECH"" has C,H -> C absent.

 I think ""PIXIE"" is as good as any.

Position I in position 1: ""IC   E"" no common words.

""IRATE"" has R,A,T absent.

So I'll choose ""PIXIE"".

So word: P-I-X-I-E

This has I in position 2 and 4, not 3, so satisfies the I constraint.

Ends with E.

No absent letters.

So guess: PIXIE

If we want to avoid two I's, but we don't know if it's single or double, so it's fine.

Other option: ""KIBBE"" -> K,I,B,B,E: but ""kibbe"" is a word, with two B's, but it ends with E? ""kibbe"" is K-I-B-B-E, 5 letters. And letters: K, I, B, E — B and K are available. As ""kibbe"" (a dish).

But less common than ""pixie"".

So I'll stick with ""pixie"".

In the word ""pixie"", the letters are P, I, X, I, E, so it has two I's, but we are introducing P and X.

For feedback, it will show for each position.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position (✓).
- **I** is present in the word but not in position 3 (as indicated by ""-"" in ""guide"").
- **Absent letters:** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, U, D (all marked ""x"").
- Therefore, available letters include: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word ending in **E** (position 5).
- Must include **I** (since it is present), but not in position 3.
- Must avoid all absent letters.
- I can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

After evaluating possible words:
- ""PIXIE"" was selected as it satisfies all constraints:
  - Ends with **E**.
  - Contains **I** in positions 2 and 4 (avoiding position 3).
  - Uses only available letters: P, I, X, E (P and X are new, providing additional information).
  - It is a valid English word (referring to a type of fairy or sprite).",Guess 4: pixie -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) X(✓) I(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
