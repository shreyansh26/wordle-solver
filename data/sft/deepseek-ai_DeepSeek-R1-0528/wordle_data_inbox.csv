We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", ""SOARE"" are popular starting words because they contain common letters and have no duplicates.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E – all common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position it was in ""crane"" (which was the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that incorporates the known information.

 Important: The word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We know the secret word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, E.

 Let's think of words that contain 'N' and do not contain C, R, A, E.

 We also want to try to cover other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, O, I, L, U, D, G, H, etc.

 Since 'N' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. In ""crane"", 'N' was in the 4th position. So we can try positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback for 'N' was '-' meaning it is present but not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position again? Actually, we can put it in the 4th again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 But note: the feedback doesn't prevent us from putting it in the same position again, but we know it's wrong so we should avoid that.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'N' in one of the positions 1,2,3,5 and that doesn't use C, R, A, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Some good starting letters: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but we don't know if these letters are safe? We haven't tried them. Also, note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent (C, R, A, E).

 Let's check: 
   P: not tried -> safe
   O: not tried -> safe
   I: not tried -> safe
   N: we know is in the word -> good to include again, but in a different position (here in 4th? but wait, in ""crane"" it was in 4th and that was wrong. So we can try 4th again? Actually, we know it's not in 4th, so we should avoid 4th. In ""POINT"", N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""POINT"", the positions are:
      P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
   But we know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th position. So if we put N in the 4th again, we will get a '-' again? Actually, we might, but we already know that. However, it's better to put it in a new position to get new information.

 So we should avoid the 4th position for N.

 How about putting N in the 2nd position? For example: ""SNOWY""?
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
   But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 However, note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. So S, O, W, Y are okay.

 Another idea: ""LIONS"" -> L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But again, N is in the 4th position which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""UNLIT"": U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5). This puts N in the 2nd position.

 But let me think of a word that has N in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

 1st: ""NIGHT"" -> N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
 3rd: ""POINT"" has N in 4th (which we avoid) -> so not that. How about ""PAINT""? P(1), A(2) -> but A is absent! We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word.

 We must avoid A. So ""PAINT"" is invalid because of A.

 How about ""JOINT""? J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> again N in 4th, which we know is wrong.

 5th: ""LEMON"" -> L(1), E(2) -> but E is absent! So we cannot use E.

 Another 5th: ""HUMAN"" -> H(1), U(2), M(3), A(4) -> A is absent, and also we have A which is not allowed.

 How about ""WOMEN""? W(1), O(2), M(3), E(4) -> E is absent. Not allowed.

 Let's try for N in the 3rd position: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is absent. Not allowed.

 ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> no forbidden letters? 
   D: not tried
   I: not tried
   N: we know is in the word -> and we are putting it in 3rd (which is new)
   G: not tried
   Y: not tried

 This seems okay.

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A, E. D, I, G, Y are not in that set.

 So ""DINGY"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""SINEW"" -> S(1), I(2), N(3), E(4) -> E is absent! So not allowed.

 ""MINTS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> no forbidden letters? 
   M, I, T, S are not forbidden.

 So ""MINTS"" is also a candidate.

 We want to maximize the new letters we test. In ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> 5 new letters (except N which we know is present). In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> also 5 new letters.

 But note: we know N is present, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

 However, we also want to avoid the position we know is wrong for N. In ""crane"", N was in the 4th. In ""MINTS"", N is in the 3rd, which is different. In ""DINGY"", N is in the 3rd.

 Both are valid.

 Another candidate: ""NOISY"" -> N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N in 1st position. This is also good.

 But we have to choose one.

 Let me think about common letters: S, T, O, I, L are more common than D, G, Y. So maybe ""MINTS"" or ""NOISY"" is better.

 However, in ""NOISY"", we are putting N in the 1st position. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, in ""MINTS"" we put N in the 3rd.

 We can also consider ""STING"": S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4) -> but N in 4th? We know the secret word doesn't have N in 4th. So we must avoid that.

 How about ""STONY"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> again N in 4th? Avoid.

 So let's choose between ""DINGY"", ""MINTS"", and ""NOISY"".

 I think ""MINTS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, I, N, T, S.

 But note: we are also testing the position of N. We are putting it in the 3rd position. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's in the 3rd. If we get a '-', then we know it's in the word but not in 3rd (and not in 4th, so it must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th). If we get an 'x', that would be impossible because we know N is in the word.

 Actually, we know N is in the word, so we should get either ✓ or '-'.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. And we only know of one N so far.

 But we can try: for example, ""INNED"" -> but E is absent and D is new? Also, we have two N's. But we don't know if there are two. And we have E which is absent -> invalid.

 So let's stick with ""MINTS"".

 But wait, what about ""POINT""? We avoided it because of the 4th position, but we can try a word with N in 2nd? Like ""SNOUT"": S(1), N(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). This avoids the forbidden letters? 
   S, N, O, U, T -> no C, R, A, E. So that's valid.

 Now we have more options: ""SNOUT"", ""MINTS"", ""NOISY"", ""DINGY"".

 I recall that in Wordle, it's good to use words with common consonants and vowels. ""SNOUT"" has S, N, O, U, T -> which includes a vowel O and U.

 But we already know that the word has an N, so we are testing 4 new letters: S, O, U, T.

 Similarly, ""MINTS"" has M, I, N, T, S -> testing M, I, T, S (and N again).

 The vowel in ""MINTS"" is I, which is common.

 I think both are good. Let me choose ""SNOUT"" because it has two vowels (O and U) and we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are absent). So we need to test other vowels.

 But wait, we tested A and E and they are absent. So the vowels in the secret word must be among I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 

 We haven't tested I, O, U. So ""SNOUT"" tests O and U, while ""MINTS"" tests I.

 Since we have limited tries, testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

 So I choose ""SNOUT"".

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has I and O? But we don't have to force that.

 Let me decide: ""SNOUT"" is a valid word.

 So second guess: ""SNOUT""

 But note: we must avoid the 4th position for N? In ""SNOUT"", N is in the 2nd position, which is new.

 So we'll go with ""SNOUT"".

- Must **avoid** C, R, A, E.
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, U) to maximize information.

The word **""SNOUT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **2nd position** (new, avoiding 4th).
- Tests new common letters: S, O, U, T.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", ""SOARE"" are popular starting words because they contain common letters and have no duplicates.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E – all common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position it was in ""crane"" (which was the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that incorporates the known information.

 Important: The word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We know the secret word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position. Also, we must avoid C, R, A, E.

 Let's think of words that contain 'N' and do not contain C, R, A, E.

 We also want to try to cover other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, O, I, L, U, D, G, H, etc.

 Since 'N' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. In ""crane"", 'N' was in the 4th position. So we can try positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback for 'N' was '-' meaning it is present but not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position again? Actually, we can put it in the 4th again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 But note: the feedback doesn't prevent us from putting it in the same position again, but we know it's wrong so we should avoid that.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'N' in one of the positions 1,2,3,5 and that doesn't use C, R, A, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Some good starting letters: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but we don't know if these letters are safe? We haven't tried them. Also, note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent (C, R, A, E).

 Let's check: 
   P: not tried -> safe
   O: not tried -> safe
   I: not tried -> safe
   N: we know is in the word -> good to include again, but in a different position (here in 4th? but wait, in ""crane"" it was in 4th and that was wrong. So we can try 4th again? Actually, we know it's not in 4th, so we should avoid 4th. In ""POINT"", N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""POINT"", the positions are:
      P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
   But we know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th position. So if we put N in the 4th again, we will get a '-' again? Actually, we might, but we already know that. However, it's better to put it in a new position to get new information.

 So we should avoid the 4th position for N.

 How about putting N in the 2nd position? For example: ""SNOWY""?
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
   But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 However, note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. So S, O, W, Y are okay.

 Another idea: ""LIONS"" -> L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But again, N is in the 4th position which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""UNLIT"": U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5). This puts N in the 2nd position.

 But let me think of a word that has N in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

 1st: ""NIGHT"" -> N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
 3rd: ""POINT"" has N in 4th (which we avoid) -> so not that. How about ""PAINT""? P(1), A(2) -> but A is absent! We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word.

 We must avoid A. So ""PAINT"" is invalid because of A.

 How about ""JOINT""? J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> again N in 4th, which we know is wrong.

 5th: ""LEMON"" -> L(1), E(2) -> but E is absent! So we cannot use E.

 Another 5th: ""HUMAN"" -> H(1), U(2), M(3), A(4) -> A is absent, and also we have A which is not allowed.

 How about ""WOMEN""? W(1), O(2), M(3), E(4) -> E is absent. Not allowed.

 Let's try for N in the 3rd position: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is absent. Not allowed.

 ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> no forbidden letters? 
   D: not tried
   I: not tried
   N: we know is in the word -> and we are putting it in 3rd (which is new)
   G: not tried
   Y: not tried

 This seems okay.

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A, E. D, I, G, Y are not in that set.

 So ""DINGY"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""SINEW"" -> S(1), I(2), N(3), E(4) -> E is absent! So not allowed.

 ""MINTS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> no forbidden letters? 
   M, I, T, S are not forbidden.

 So ""MINTS"" is also a candidate.

 We want to maximize the new letters we test. In ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> 5 new letters (except N which we know is present). In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> also 5 new letters.

 But note: we know N is present, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

 However, we also want to avoid the position we know is wrong for N. In ""crane"", N was in the 4th. In ""MINTS"", N is in the 3rd, which is different. In ""DINGY"", N is in the 3rd.

 Both are valid.

 Another candidate: ""NOISY"" -> N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N in 1st position. This is also good.

 But we have to choose one.

 Let me think about common letters: S, T, O, I, L are more common than D, G, Y. So maybe ""MINTS"" or ""NOISY"" is better.

 However, in ""NOISY"", we are putting N in the 1st position. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, in ""MINTS"" we put N in the 3rd.

 We can also consider ""STING"": S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4) -> but N in 4th? We know the secret word doesn't have N in 4th. So we must avoid that.

 How about ""STONY"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> again N in 4th? Avoid.

 So let's choose between ""DINGY"", ""MINTS"", and ""NOISY"".

 I think ""MINTS"" is a good choice because it has common letters: M, I, N, T, S.

 But note: we are also testing the position of N. We are putting it in the 3rd position. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's in the 3rd. If we get a '-', then we know it's in the word but not in 3rd (and not in 4th, so it must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th). If we get an 'x', that would be impossible because we know N is in the word.

 Actually, we know N is in the word, so we should get either ✓ or '-'.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. And we only know of one N so far.

 But we can try: for example, ""INNED"" -> but E is absent and D is new? Also, we have two N's. But we don't know if there are two. And we have E which is absent -> invalid.

 So let's stick with ""MINTS"".

 But wait, what about ""POINT""? We avoided it because of the 4th position, but we can try a word with N in 2nd? Like ""SNOUT"": S(1), N(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). This avoids the forbidden letters? 
   S, N, O, U, T -> no C, R, A, E. So that's valid.

 Now we have more options: ""SNOUT"", ""MINTS"", ""NOISY"", ""DINGY"".

 I recall that in Wordle, it's good to use words with common consonants and vowels. ""SNOUT"" has S, N, O, U, T -> which includes a vowel O and U.

 But we already know that the word has an N, so we are testing 4 new letters: S, O, U, T.

 Similarly, ""MINTS"" has M, I, N, T, S -> testing M, I, T, S (and N again).

 The vowel in ""MINTS"" is I, which is common.

 I think both are good. Let me choose ""SNOUT"" because it has two vowels (O and U) and we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are absent). So we need to test other vowels.

 But wait, we tested A and E and they are absent. So the vowels in the secret word must be among I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 

 We haven't tested I, O, U. So ""SNOUT"" tests O and U, while ""MINTS"" tests I.

 Since we have limited tries, testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

 So I choose ""SNOUT"".

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has I and O? But we don't have to force that.

 Let me decide: ""SNOUT"" is a valid word.

 So second guess: ""SNOUT""

 But note: we must avoid the 4th position for N? In ""SNOUT"", N is in the 2nd position, which is new.

 So we'll go with ""SNOUT"".

<guess>snout</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **absent** from the secret word.
- N is **present** but **not in the 4th position**.

For the second guess:
- Must include **N** in a new position (not 4th) to test its location.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, E.
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, U) to maximize information.

The word **""SNOUT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **2nd position** (new, avoiding 4th).
- Tests new common letters: S, O, U, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct position of N and reveal new letters.

We are given feedback from the second guess ""snout"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (2nd position).
 O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position.
 U(x) -> U is not in the secret word.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has 'N' in the 2nd position.
 - The secret word has the letter 'O', but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it in ""snout"").
 - The letters S, U, T are not in the secret word.
 - Additionally, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, E are not in the word.

 Now, let's list all the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

 And the letters we know are present: N (in position 2) and O (somewhere, but not in position 3).

 We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to find (since we have N fixed in position 2 and O present but not fixed).

 We have 4 tries left.

 We need to form a word that:
   - Has 'N' in the 2nd position.
   - Contains the letter 'O' but not in the 3rd position.
   - Does not contain C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

 We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know O is present but not fixed).

 Since O is present and not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

 We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that fit:

 Pattern: _ N _ _ _

 And the word must contain an O in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

 Also, we cannot use the absent letters.

 Some ideas:

 - If O is in position 1: ""ON _ _ _"", but the second letter is N, so ""ON..."" words.
   Example: ""ONION"" -> but O in 1st and 4th? But we have two O's? We don't know if the word has two O's. Also, I and N: N is already in 2nd, so ""ONION"" would be O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) -> but we have two N's? We only know one N so far. Also, we have I and O: O is present, but we don't know about I. However, we must avoid the absent letters. I is not in the absent list. But let's check: 
        O(1): we are testing O in 1st -> if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get -.
        N(2): ✓ (we know)
        I(3): new letter -> we can test
        O(4): we are testing O again -> if the word has only one O, then one of the O's will be marked as present and the other might be absent? Actually, the feedback might mark the first O as present and the second as absent if there's only one. But we don't know. Also, we have two N's? We have N in 2nd and 5th. We know there's at least one N (in 2nd), but we don't know about a second N. So ""ONION"" might be a valid guess, but it uses two O's and two N's, which might be inefficient.

   Alternatively, ""ONLY"": O(1), N(2), L(3), Y(4). This has O in 1st, which we are testing, and L and Y are new. But note: we have only 4 letters? ""ONLY"" is 4 letters? No, it's 4. We need 5. So ""ONLY"" is invalid.

   ""ONSET"": but S is absent -> invalid.

   ""ONCET"": C is absent -> invalid.

   ""ONDAT"": not a word? and D and T: T is absent -> invalid.

   How about ""ONION"" as above? But it's 5 letters: O-N-I-O-N. But we have two N's and two O's. We know N is in 2nd, so the 5th N might be extra. Also, we are testing O in 1st and 4th. But we know O is present, so if the word has only one O, then one of the positions will be marked as absent. But we can use it.

   However, we have to avoid T, which is absent, and ""ONION"" doesn't have T. But it has I and O. But let's see if it's allowed: no C,R,A,E,S,U,T -> so it's okay.

   But we are using two O's and two N's, which might not be necessary. We might be better off with a word that has distinct letters to test more.

 - If O is in position 4: _ N _ O _
   Example: ""INBOX"": I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5). This tests I, B, O, X. But O is in 4th. Also, we avoid the absent letters? I, B, O, X are not in the absent list. So valid.

 - If O is in position 5: _ N _ _ O
   Example: ""UNFRO"": but U is absent -> invalid.
            ""ANCHO"": A is absent -> invalid.
            ""MINKO"": M(1), I(2) -> but I in 2nd? We have N in 2nd, so I cannot be in 2nd. The pattern is: 1st: M, 2nd: N, 3rd: K, 4th: O? Wait, ""MINKO"" is M-I-N-K-O? Then N is in 3rd? But we need N in 2nd. So we need a word with second letter N and last letter O.

   Example: ""PINTO"": P(1), I(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so I cannot be in 2nd. So the word must be: 1st: ?, 2nd: N, 3rd: ?, 4th: ?, 5th: O.

   So: ""?N??O"". Example: ""INVEO"" -> but E is absent. ""INKBO"" -> not a word. ""INGOT"": I(1), N(2), G(3), O(4), T(5) -> but T is absent. ""INGOT"" has T, which is absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""INDOL"": I(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), L(5) -> but O is in 4th, not 5th. We are considering O in 5th? So we need the 5th to be O.

   How about ""INDOW""? Not a standard word? ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.

   ""MINOO""? Not a word.

   It might be hard to find a word with O in 5th and N in 2nd without using forbidden letters.

 So, let's focus on O in 1st or 4th.

 We can also consider that O might be in 1st or 4th, and we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in 1st or 4th, but in a position we haven't tried? We have only tried O in 3rd (in ""snout"") and that was wrong. So O can be in 1st, 4th, or 5th. We haven't tried 1st or 4th or 5th.

 But we can only test one position at a time.

 Let's list possible words:

 Option 1: O in 1st: ""ON _ _ _""
   We need two more letters (besides the fixed N in 2nd and the O in 1st). And we have to fill positions 3,4,5.

   Example: ""ONION"" (as above) -> O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). But we are repeating O and N. We know N is in 2nd, so the 5th N might be absent? But we don't know if there is a second N. Also, we are testing O in 1st and 4th.

   Alternatively, ""ONELY"" -> not a word, and E is absent.
   ""ONIUM"" -> U is absent.
   ""ONLAY"" -> L(3), A(4) -> A is absent.
   ""ONCET"" -> C is absent.

   How about ""ONKOS""? Not a common word.

   ""ONNED""? Not a word.

   ""ONERY"" -> O(1), N(2), E(3) -> E is absent.

   It's difficult. Maybe ""ONION"" is acceptable? But let's see if there are better options.

 Option 2: O in 4th: _ N _ O _
   Example: ""INBOX"" -> I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5). This seems good.

   Other examples: 
     ""UNBOW"" -> U is absent.
     ""ANBOS"" -> A and S are absent.
     ""INCOG"" -> C is absent.
     ""INDOW"" -> not standard? But ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.
     ""INGOT"" -> T is absent.
     ""INKOS"" -> not a word.
     ""INJOG"" -> not common.
     ""INNED"" -> E is absent, and we have two N's? But we know N is in 2nd, so the 3rd N? ""INNED"" is I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> E is absent and we have two N's.

   ""INBOX"" seems a valid word and uses I, B, O, X which are not forbidden.

   Another: ""INDOX"" -> not a common word.

   ""INFLO"" -> not a word.

   So ""INBOX"" is a candidate.

 Option 3: O in 5th: _ N _ _ O
   We had trouble finding words. Let's try: 
     ""HINGO"" -> H(1), I(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so I cannot be in 2nd. The word must be: [letter] N [letter] [letter] O.
     ""PONGO"": P(1), O(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so O cannot be in 2nd. 
     ""CONGO"": C is absent.
     ""BONGO"": B(1), O(2) -> again, we need N in 2nd, so O in 2nd is not allowed.

   We need the second letter to be N, so the first letter can be any letter (not forbidden) and then the last letter O.

   Example: ""ANVHO"" -> not a word.

   It's very hard. Maybe ""KNOLL"" has O but not at the end? ""KNOLL"" is K(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). But we tried O in 3rd and it was wrong? In ""snout"", O was in 3rd and we got '-', meaning it's present but not in 3rd. So we cannot put O in 3rd again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not in 3rd, so it would be inefficient. We should avoid 3rd.

   So for O in 5th, we need a word like: [letter] N [letter] [letter] O.

   Example: ""PINTO"" -> P(1), I(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so I in 2nd is not allowed. The second letter is fixed as N, so the first letter is independent.

   How about ""GNOMO""? G(1), N(2), O(3) -> but O in 3rd is not allowed? We know O is not in 3rd. So we cannot put O in 3rd. And in ""GNOMO"", O is in 3rd and 5th? So we have to avoid 3rd.

   ""GNOWO""? Not a word.

   This is difficult. So maybe we skip O in 5th for now.

 Considering the above, ""INBOX"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we are putting O in 4th. We know O is present and not in 3rd, so 4th is a possibility.

 Also, ""INBOX"" tests:
   I in 1st: new letter.
   B in 3rd: new letter.
   O in 4th: we are testing if O is in 4th.
   X in 5th: new letter.

 And we avoid the absent letters.

 However, we are not covering the possibility of O in 1st. But we can only test one.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in 1st and also tests other letters. But we had trouble finding one without forbidden letters.

 Another idea: what about ""DOING""? D(1), O(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so O cannot be in 2nd. The second letter must be N.

 We must have the pattern: [letter] N [letter] [letter] [letter] and one of the non-second positions must be O.

 Since we know O is not in 3rd, we are left with 1st, 4th, 5th.

 We can try a word that has O in 1st and also tests other common letters.

 Example: ""OILED"" -> but E is absent and L is new? Also, the second letter is I, not N. We need the second letter to be N.

 So the word must start with O and then N: ""ON...""

 We already tried to find ""ON..."" words and found ""ONION"". Let me check if ""ONION"" is acceptable.

 ""ONION"": 
   O in 1st: we test if O is in 1st.
   N in 2nd: correct (we know).
   I in 3rd: new letter.
   O in 4th: we test if there is a second O? or if O is in 4th? But we know there is at least one O, so if the word has only one O, then the first O might be correct and the second O would be absent, or vice versa? Actually, the feedback will mark the first occurrence of O as present (if it is in the word) and then if there is a second O and it is in the word, it will be marked accordingly. But if the word has only one O, then the second O will be marked absent.

   N in 5th: we test if there is a second N? We know there is at least one N (in 2nd). So if the word has only one N, then the 5th N will be absent.

 So ""ONION"" tests:
   O in 1st and 4th (if one of them is correct, we get a ✓ for that position and a - or x for the other)
   I in 3rd
   and tests for a second N.

 But we are using two positions for O and two for N, which might not be efficient. We are only testing two new letters (I and the possibility of a second O or N) but we are using two slots for O and two for N.

 In ""INBOX"", we test four new letters: I, B, O (in 4th), and X. And we don't have duplicates.

 So ""INBOX"" might be better because it tests more new letters.

 But note: we are not testing the possibility of O in 1st. However, if we guess ""INBOX"" and O is actually in 1st, then we will get feedback that O is present but not in 4th, and then we know it must be in 1st or 5th. Then we can adjust.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""ONION"" and O is not in 1st, then we might get O marked as absent in 1st and present in 4th? But if the word has only one O and it is in 4th, then the first O (1st) would be marked absent and the fourth O (4th) would be marked present? But wait, the feedback marks the first occurrence of a letter that is in the word as present (if it's the first time it appears) and then if it appears again and is in the word, it gets marked accordingly. But if the word has only one O, then the first O (if not in the word at that position) would be marked as present but wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter independently? 

 Let me clarify the rules: In Wordle, each letter is marked independently. So if the word has one O and we have two O's in the guess, then the first O that matches the position of the O in the secret word would get a ✓, and the other O would get an x? Or if the O is not in the correct position, then the first occurrence of O in the guess (if the secret has one O) would get a '-' and the second O would get an x? Actually, the feedback is given per letter in the guess, and it doesn't prioritize the first occurrence. But the feedback is independent: for each letter, if it is in the correct position, it gets ✓; if it is in the word but not in that position, it gets '-'; if not in the word, it gets x. However, if the letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback might be affected by the frequency in the secret word.

 Example: if the secret word has one O, and we guess a word with two O's, then:
   - If one of the O's is in the correct position, that one gets ✓ and the other gets x.
   - If neither is in the correct position, then the first O (in the guess) that matches the O in the secret (but in a different position) gets a '-', and the second O gets an x (because the secret only has one O).

 So in ""ONION"", if the secret word has one O and it is in 1st, then:
   Position 1: O -> ✓
   Position 4: O -> x (because the secret has only one O)

 If the secret word has one O and it is in 4th, then:
   Position 1: O -> '-' (because the O is present but not in 1st)
   Position 4: O -> ✓

 If the secret word has two O's, then both could be marked accordingly.

 Similarly for N.

 But we don't know the frequency of O and N in the secret word.

 Given the complexity, and since we have limited tries, it might be better to avoid duplicates and test more new letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""INBOX"".

 But wait, is ""INBOX"" a valid word? Yes, it is a word (a container for incoming mail, or in computing).

 So let's go with ""INBOX"".

<guess>inbox</guess> 

 However, note: we are putting O in 4th. We know O is present and not in 3rd, so 4th is a possibility.

 We'll see the feedback.

 But let me double-check: the absent letters are C, R, A, E, S, U, T. ""INBOX"" has I, N, B, O, X -> none of these are absent. And N is in 2nd.

 So it's valid.

 Therefore, the third guess is ""INBOX"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `N` is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: SNOUT**  
  Feedback: `S(x) N(✓) O(-) U(x) T(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `S`, `U`, `T` are **absent**.  
  - `N` is **correct and in position 2**.  
  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - `N` is fixed in **position 2** (e.g., `_ N _ _ _`).  
   - `O` is present but **not in position 3** (possible positions: 1, 4, or 5).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T` (cannot be used).  
3. **Untested letters**: Focus on common consonants/vowels like `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words that:  
  - Place `N` in **position 2**.  
  - Include `O` in a **new position** (1, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
  - Use **new, common letters** to maximize information (e.g., `I`, `B`, `X`).  
  - Avoid absent letters.  

### Chosen Guess: **INBOX**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `N` is in **position 2** (required).  
  - `O` is tested in **position 4** (a valid possibility, since it can't be in position 3).  
  - Tests new letters: `I` (position 1), `B` (position 3), `X` (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (`C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T`).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If `O` is in position 4, it will get `✓`; otherwise, `-` or `x` will help narrow its position.  
  - Feedback on `I`, `B`, and `X` will reveal if they are present/absent.  

<guess>inbox</guess>",inbox,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""snout"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (2nd position).
 O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position.
 U(x) -> U is not in the secret word.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has 'N' in the 2nd position.
 - The secret word has the letter 'O', but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it in ""snout"").
 - The letters S, U, T are not in the secret word.
 - Additionally, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, E are not in the word.

 Now, let's list all the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

 And the letters we know are present: N (in position 2) and O (somewhere, but not in position 3).

 We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to find (since we have N fixed in position 2 and O present but not fixed).

 We have 4 tries left.

 We need to form a word that:
   - Has 'N' in the 2nd position.
   - Contains the letter 'O' but not in the 3rd position.
   - Does not contain C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

 We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know O is present but not fixed).

 Since O is present and not in position 3, it can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

 We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that fit:

 Pattern: _ N _ _ _

 And the word must contain an O in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

 Also, we cannot use the absent letters.

 Some ideas:

 - If O is in position 1: ""ON _ _ _"", but the second letter is N, so ""ON..."" words.
   Example: ""ONION"" -> but O in 1st and 4th? But we have two O's? We don't know if the word has two O's. Also, I and N: N is already in 2nd, so ""ONION"" would be O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) -> but we have two N's? We only know one N so far. Also, we have I and O: O is present, but we don't know about I. However, we must avoid the absent letters. I is not in the absent list. But let's check: 
        O(1): we are testing O in 1st -> if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get -.
        N(2): ✓ (we know)
        I(3): new letter -> we can test
        O(4): we are testing O again -> if the word has only one O, then one of the O's will be marked as present and the other might be absent? Actually, the feedback might mark the first O as present and the second as absent if there's only one. But we don't know. Also, we have two N's? We have N in 2nd and 5th. We know there's at least one N (in 2nd), but we don't know about a second N. So ""ONION"" might be a valid guess, but it uses two O's and two N's, which might be inefficient.

   Alternatively, ""ONLY"": O(1), N(2), L(3), Y(4). This has O in 1st, which we are testing, and L and Y are new. But note: we have only 4 letters? ""ONLY"" is 4 letters? No, it's 4. We need 5. So ""ONLY"" is invalid.

   ""ONSET"": but S is absent -> invalid.

   ""ONCET"": C is absent -> invalid.

   ""ONDAT"": not a word? and D and T: T is absent -> invalid.

   How about ""ONION"" as above? But it's 5 letters: O-N-I-O-N. But we have two N's and two O's. We know N is in 2nd, so the 5th N might be extra. Also, we are testing O in 1st and 4th. But we know O is present, so if the word has only one O, then one of the positions will be marked as absent. But we can use it.

   However, we have to avoid T, which is absent, and ""ONION"" doesn't have T. But it has I and O. But let's see if it's allowed: no C,R,A,E,S,U,T -> so it's okay.

   But we are using two O's and two N's, which might not be necessary. We might be better off with a word that has distinct letters to test more.

 - If O is in position 4: _ N _ O _
   Example: ""INBOX"": I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5). This tests I, B, O, X. But O is in 4th. Also, we avoid the absent letters? I, B, O, X are not in the absent list. So valid.

 - If O is in position 5: _ N _ _ O
   Example: ""UNFRO"": but U is absent -> invalid.
            ""ANCHO"": A is absent -> invalid.
            ""MINKO"": M(1), I(2) -> but I in 2nd? We have N in 2nd, so I cannot be in 2nd. The pattern is: 1st: M, 2nd: N, 3rd: K, 4th: O? Wait, ""MINKO"" is M-I-N-K-O? Then N is in 3rd? But we need N in 2nd. So we need a word with second letter N and last letter O.

   Example: ""PINTO"": P(1), I(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so I cannot be in 2nd. So the word must be: 1st: ?, 2nd: N, 3rd: ?, 4th: ?, 5th: O.

   So: ""?N??O"". Example: ""INVEO"" -> but E is absent. ""INKBO"" -> not a word. ""INGOT"": I(1), N(2), G(3), O(4), T(5) -> but T is absent. ""INGOT"" has T, which is absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""INDOL"": I(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), L(5) -> but O is in 4th, not 5th. We are considering O in 5th? So we need the 5th to be O.

   How about ""INDOW""? Not a standard word? ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.

   ""MINOO""? Not a word.

   It might be hard to find a word with O in 5th and N in 2nd without using forbidden letters.

 So, let's focus on O in 1st or 4th.

 We can also consider that O might be in 1st or 4th, and we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in 1st or 4th, but in a position we haven't tried? We have only tried O in 3rd (in ""snout"") and that was wrong. So O can be in 1st, 4th, or 5th. We haven't tried 1st or 4th or 5th.

 But we can only test one position at a time.

 Let's list possible words:

 Option 1: O in 1st: ""ON _ _ _""
   We need two more letters (besides the fixed N in 2nd and the O in 1st). And we have to fill positions 3,4,5.

   Example: ""ONION"" (as above) -> O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). But we are repeating O and N. We know N is in 2nd, so the 5th N might be absent? But we don't know if there is a second N. Also, we are testing O in 1st and 4th.

   Alternatively, ""ONELY"" -> not a word, and E is absent.
   ""ONIUM"" -> U is absent.
   ""ONLAY"" -> L(3), A(4) -> A is absent.
   ""ONCET"" -> C is absent.

   How about ""ONKOS""? Not a common word.

   ""ONNED""? Not a word.

   ""ONERY"" -> O(1), N(2), E(3) -> E is absent.

   It's difficult. Maybe ""ONION"" is acceptable? But let's see if there are better options.

 Option 2: O in 4th: _ N _ O _
   Example: ""INBOX"" -> I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5). This seems good.

   Other examples: 
     ""UNBOW"" -> U is absent.
     ""ANBOS"" -> A and S are absent.
     ""INCOG"" -> C is absent.
     ""INDOW"" -> not standard? But ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.
     ""INGOT"" -> T is absent.
     ""INKOS"" -> not a word.
     ""INJOG"" -> not common.
     ""INNED"" -> E is absent, and we have two N's? But we know N is in 2nd, so the 3rd N? ""INNED"" is I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> E is absent and we have two N's.

   ""INBOX"" seems a valid word and uses I, B, O, X which are not forbidden.

   Another: ""INDOX"" -> not a common word.

   ""INFLO"" -> not a word.

   So ""INBOX"" is a candidate.

 Option 3: O in 5th: _ N _ _ O
   We had trouble finding words. Let's try: 
     ""HINGO"" -> H(1), I(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so I cannot be in 2nd. The word must be: [letter] N [letter] [letter] O.
     ""PONGO"": P(1), O(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so O cannot be in 2nd. 
     ""CONGO"": C is absent.
     ""BONGO"": B(1), O(2) -> again, we need N in 2nd, so O in 2nd is not allowed.

   We need the second letter to be N, so the first letter can be any letter (not forbidden) and then the last letter O.

   Example: ""ANVHO"" -> not a word.

   It's very hard. Maybe ""KNOLL"" has O but not at the end? ""KNOLL"" is K(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). But we tried O in 3rd and it was wrong? In ""snout"", O was in 3rd and we got '-', meaning it's present but not in 3rd. So we cannot put O in 3rd again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not in 3rd, so it would be inefficient. We should avoid 3rd.

   So for O in 5th, we need a word like: [letter] N [letter] [letter] O.

   Example: ""PINTO"" -> P(1), I(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so I in 2nd is not allowed. The second letter is fixed as N, so the first letter is independent.

   How about ""GNOMO""? G(1), N(2), O(3) -> but O in 3rd is not allowed? We know O is not in 3rd. So we cannot put O in 3rd. And in ""GNOMO"", O is in 3rd and 5th? So we have to avoid 3rd.

   ""GNOWO""? Not a word.

   This is difficult. So maybe we skip O in 5th for now.

 Considering the above, ""INBOX"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we are putting O in 4th. We know O is present and not in 3rd, so 4th is a possibility.

 Also, ""INBOX"" tests:
   I in 1st: new letter.
   B in 3rd: new letter.
   O in 4th: we are testing if O is in 4th.
   X in 5th: new letter.

 And we avoid the absent letters.

 However, we are not covering the possibility of O in 1st. But we can only test one.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in 1st and also tests other letters. But we had trouble finding one without forbidden letters.

 Another idea: what about ""DOING""? D(1), O(2) -> but we need N in 2nd, so O cannot be in 2nd. The second letter must be N.

 We must have the pattern: [letter] N [letter] [letter] [letter] and one of the non-second positions must be O.

 Since we know O is not in 3rd, we are left with 1st, 4th, 5th.

 We can try a word that has O in 1st and also tests other common letters.

 Example: ""OILED"" -> but E is absent and L is new? Also, the second letter is I, not N. We need the second letter to be N.

 So the word must start with O and then N: ""ON...""

 We already tried to find ""ON..."" words and found ""ONION"". Let me check if ""ONION"" is acceptable.

 ""ONION"": 
   O in 1st: we test if O is in 1st.
   N in 2nd: correct (we know).
   I in 3rd: new letter.
   O in 4th: we test if there is a second O? or if O is in 4th? But we know there is at least one O, so if the word has only one O, then the first O might be correct and the second O would be absent, or vice versa? Actually, the feedback will mark the first occurrence of O as present (if it is in the word) and then if there is a second O and it is in the word, it will be marked accordingly. But if the word has only one O, then the second O will be marked absent.

   N in 5th: we test if there is a second N? We know there is at least one N (in 2nd). So if the word has only one N, then the 5th N will be absent.

 So ""ONION"" tests:
   O in 1st and 4th (if one of them is correct, we get a ✓ for that position and a - or x for the other)
   I in 3rd
   and tests for a second N.

 But we are using two positions for O and two for N, which might not be efficient. We are only testing two new letters (I and the possibility of a second O or N) but we are using two slots for O and two for N.

 In ""INBOX"", we test four new letters: I, B, O (in 4th), and X. And we don't have duplicates.

 So ""INBOX"" might be better because it tests more new letters.

 But note: we are not testing the possibility of O in 1st. However, if we guess ""INBOX"" and O is actually in 1st, then we will get feedback that O is present but not in 4th, and then we know it must be in 1st or 5th. Then we can adjust.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""ONION"" and O is not in 1st, then we might get O marked as absent in 1st and present in 4th? But if the word has only one O and it is in 4th, then the first O (1st) would be marked absent and the fourth O (4th) would be marked present? But wait, the feedback marks the first occurrence of a letter that is in the word as present (if it's the first time it appears) and then if it appears again and is in the word, it gets marked accordingly. But if the word has only one O, then the first O (if not in the word at that position) would be marked as present but wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter independently? 

 Let me clarify the rules: In Wordle, each letter is marked independently. So if the word has one O and we have two O's in the guess, then the first O that matches the position of the O in the secret word would get a ✓, and the other O would get an x? Or if the O is not in the correct position, then the first occurrence of O in the guess (if the secret has one O) would get a '-' and the second O would get an x? Actually, the feedback is given per letter in the guess, and it doesn't prioritize the first occurrence. But the feedback is independent: for each letter, if it is in the correct position, it gets ✓; if it is in the word but not in that position, it gets '-'; if not in the word, it gets x. However, if the letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback might be affected by the frequency in the secret word.

 Example: if the secret word has one O, and we guess a word with two O's, then:
   - If one of the O's is in the correct position, that one gets ✓ and the other gets x.
   - If neither is in the correct position, then the first O (in the guess) that matches the O in the secret (but in a different position) gets a '-', and the second O gets an x (because the secret only has one O).

 So in ""ONION"", if the secret word has one O and it is in 1st, then:
   Position 1: O -> ✓
   Position 4: O -> x (because the secret has only one O)

 If the secret word has one O and it is in 4th, then:
   Position 1: O -> '-' (because the O is present but not in 1st)
   Position 4: O -> ✓

 If the secret word has two O's, then both could be marked accordingly.

 Similarly for N.

 But we don't know the frequency of O and N in the secret word.

 Given the complexity, and since we have limited tries, it might be better to avoid duplicates and test more new letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""INBOX"".

 But wait, is ""INBOX"" a valid word? Yes, it is a word (a container for incoming mail, or in computing).

 So let's go with ""INBOX"".

<guess>inbox</guess> 

 However, note: we are putting O in 4th. We know O is present and not in 3rd, so 4th is a possibility.

 We'll see the feedback.

 But let me double-check: the absent letters are C, R, A, E, S, U, T. ""INBOX"" has I, N, B, O, X -> none of these are absent. And N is in 2nd.

 So it's valid.

 Therefore, the third guess is ""INBOX"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `N` is **present** but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: SNOUT**  
  Feedback: `S(x) N(✓) O(-) U(x) T(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `S`, `U`, `T` are **absent**.  
  - `N` is **correct and in position 2**.  
  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - `N` is fixed in **position 2** (e.g., `_ N _ _ _`).  
   - `O` is present but **not in position 3** (possible positions: 1, 4, or 5).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T` (cannot be used).  
3. **Untested letters**: Focus on common consonants/vowels like `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words that:  
  - Place `N` in **position 2**.  
  - Include `O` in a **new position** (1, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
  - Use **new, common letters** to maximize information (e.g., `I`, `B`, `X`).  
  - Avoid absent letters.  

### Chosen Guess: **INBOX**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `N` is in **position 2** (required).  
  - `O` is tested in **position 4** (a valid possibility, since it can't be in position 3).  
  - Tests new letters: `I` (position 1), `B` (position 3), `X` (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (`C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T`).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If `O` is in position 4, it will get `✓`; otherwise, `-` or `x` will help narrow its position.  
  - Feedback on `I`, `B`, and `X` will reveal if they are present/absent.",Guess 3: inbox -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) B(✓) O(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
