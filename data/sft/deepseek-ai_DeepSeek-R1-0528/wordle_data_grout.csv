We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 Also, it has no repeated letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good starting word (meaning a crowd or a large number) and has the common letters R, O, A, T, E.

 However, I recall that ""SOARE"" (a falcon) is also used but might be less common. Let's stick with a more common word.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it is a very common starting word and covers a good set of letters.

 But note: the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We don't want to use a word that might be the secret word? 
 Actually, we don't know, so we choose a word that gives maximum information.

 I decide to use ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is: CRANE
</think>
I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

After considering common starting words (e.g., ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST""), I select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It covers frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.

This guess will help me narrow down the secret word efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) for each position.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - Only R is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter).
 - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter R in the second position (position 2).
 And it does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word has R as the second letter, we can represent the word as: _ R _ _ _

 Also, we must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 For our next guess, we want to:
 1. Include the letter R in the second position again (to keep that known position).
 2. Use other letters that are common and not the ones we know are absent (so avoid C, A, N, E).
 3. Use new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet: we have tried C, R, A, N, E.
 So we can use letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have a fixed R at second position.

 We want to maximize information, so we can try a word that includes several of these new letters.

 Some candidate letters that are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can consider words that have the form: ? R ? ? ?

 We must avoid C, A, N, E in any position.

 Possible words that come to mind:
 - ""proud"": P R O U D -> but we don't know about P, O, U, D. However, O and U are vowels that we haven't tried. But note: we don't have a vowel yet? The word has at least one vowel? Probably, but not necessarily.

 However, let's consider if we can cover more common letters. We might try to include S and T, which are very common.

 Example: ""burst"" -> B U R S T -> but note: the word must have R in second position, so we are looking for: ? R ? ? ?.
 For ""burst"": the positions are: B (1st), R (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

 But note: we must avoid A, C, E, N? Our guess should not include these because they are absent. So ""burst"" uses B, U, R, S, T and none of C, A, N, E. This is acceptable.

 However, we must also consider: we have eliminated C, A, N, E, so we need to choose from the remaining letters.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has more than one common consonant and a vowel we haven't tried (like O or I).

 Another candidate: ""groom"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present. Also, it repeats O? We'd rather have distinct letters to maximize information.

 Another: ""truck"" -> but C is forbidden, we can't use C.

 Another: ""froth"" -> F R O T H -> letters: F, R, O, T, H. O is a vowel we haven't tried. This might be good.

 Or ""trout"": T R O U T -> but U is repeated? No, T is repeated? ""trout"" has two T's? Actually: positions: T (1st), R (2nd), O (3rd), U (4th), T (5th). So T appears twice. Repeating T might not be efficient because if one T is correct we know the position? But we lose a letter test.

 Better to avoid repeated letters at this stage.

 Let me list some words with R in the second position and no C, A, N, E, and distinct letters:

 Possible words:
 - ""proud"" : P R O U D
 - ""grips"" : G R I P S
 - ""trisp"" ? not a word.
 - ""drips"" : D R I P S
 - ""brisk"" : B R I S K -> but we don't know if we can use S and K? Why not? We haven't tried them.

 Actually, ""brisk"" is a common word. And in the example, the secret word was ""brisk"". But that doesn't mean it's the same now.

 However, note: we know the secret word has R in the second position and doesn't have A, C, E, N. ""brisk"" fits: B R I S K -> no C, A, N, E? Correct.

 But we don't know if we should guess ""brisk"" now? We don't have enough information to be sure. We are on the second guess, so we want to maximize information.

 Therefore, we might not want to guess a word that could be the solution without testing more letters? Actually, if we guess ""brisk"" and it's not the word, we get more information? Yes.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses as many common letters as possible from the set we haven't tried.

 Let me rank the remaining letters by frequency: E, A, ... but we can't use A or E. Then S, O, I, T, ... are common.

 We haven't tried: S, O, I, T, L, D, etc.

 We want to cover vowels: we haven't tried O, I, U? So including one or two vowels is good.

 Consider ""brisk"" uses I and two consonants (B, S, K). But note: I is a vowel.

 Another word: ""pithy"" : P I T H Y -> but R is in second position? So we need R at the second? Our guess must have R at the second position.

 So let's insist: the word must be ? R ? ? ?.

 Example: ""troll"" -> repeated L? and repeated L? Not good. Also, T at front? Actually: T R O L L -> repeated L? It's T in first, R second, O third, L fourth, and L fifth? That's repeated L.

 We want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters are allowed in the word? Yes, but in feedback if a letter appears twice in the guess and once in the secret, it might give less information. So preferably use distinct letters.

 But note: if a letter is repeated in the secret, we won't know until we see the feedback? So to maximize information, distinct letters are better for now.

 So words that fit:
 - ""growl"": G R O W L -> letters: G, R, O, W, L -> all distinct? Yes.
 - ""dross"": D R O S S -> repeated S? Not good.
 - ""brisk"": B R I S K -> distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K -> all distinct. Good.

 We can also consider ""probe"": P R O B E -> but E is forbidden (from feedback: E is absent). So we cannot use that.

 Similarly, ""price"": P R I C E -> C and E are forbidden.

 So ""brisk"" is acceptable: has distinct letters, and avoids C, A, N, E.

 Let me think of other words: ""wrist"": W R I S T -> distinct letters: W, R, I, S, T -> good.

 We have two candidates: ""brisk"" and ""wrist"".

 Which one to choose? Both use S and T? But ""wrist"" uses T at the end and ""brisk"" uses K at the end. We don't know which is better.

 But note: S is a very common letter, so it's good to test it. Also I is a common vowel.

 How about including O? A word that includes O: ""gross"" -> repeated S? Not good.

 ""frown"": F R O W N -> but we eliminated N? Yes, N is absent, so we cannot use N. Therefore, ""frown"" is banned.

 ""proud"": P R O U D -> distinct letters: P, R, O, U, D. We haven't tried O, U, D. This might be good too.

 But S is more common than O? Actually, S is one of the most common letters.

 According to English letter frequency, the most common letters (in order) are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... We have ruled out E, A, N. So remaining top ones: T, O, I, S.

 So T and O are more common than I and S? Wait: T is most common among non-vowels? Actually: order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (but we have R already).

 We need to test the vowels? We haven't tried any vowel except A and E? And we know A and E are not in the word. So the vowel must be either I, O, U? Or Y sometimes.

 Therefore, testing a vowel is important.

 Between ""brisk"" (using I) and ""proud"" (using O and U), we are testing a vowel in both.

 But in ""brisk"" we test I and in ""proud"" we test O and U? And ""proud"" tests two vowels? That might be better because we can get information on two vowels.

 However, if either O or U is present we get partial information, but if we test only one vowel and it's absent, we know we must consider I or Y? Actually, we haven't tested I either.

 Alternatively, using ""wrisp"" is not a word.

 Let me look for a word that has both I and O? But with R at second? For example, ""writ?"" is 4 letters. ""trion"" -> not word? ""briol"" - not common.

 Given the constraints, I think ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""proud"", ""grout"", ""guild"" (but U is at fourth? positions don't match: ? R ? ? ? must have R at second).

 ""brink"" -> B R I N K -> but N is forbidden? We cannot use N.

 So that's banned.

 ""brim?"" -> only 4 letters.

 Therefore, among the choices:
  ""brisk"" is a valid word: B R I S K -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""wrist"": W R I S T -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""proud"": P R O U D -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""tryst"": T R Y S T -> repeated T? Not good.

 Another one: ""droid"": D R O I D -> repeated D? Not good.

 How about ""frisk"": F R I S K -> distinct letters? F, R, I, S, K -> distinct? Yes.

 Now we have: ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""frisk"", ""proud"".

 We want to maximize new letters and common letters.

 ""brisk"": uses B, R, I, S, K. 
    - R we already know is present and in position.
    - We are testing B, I, S, K.

 ""wrist"": uses W, R, I, S, T.
    - testing W, I, S, T.

 ""frisk"": uses F, R, I, S, K.
    - testing F, I, S, K.

 ""proud"": uses P, R, O, U, D.
    - testing P, O, U, D.

 Which of these sets of letters are more common? 
 - In the remaining letters, S and T are very common. So ""wrist"" uses both S and T? 
   But note: T is more common than S? Actually, T is the next most common after E and A (which we removed). So T and S are both top.

 Also, I is a vowel we haven't tried.

 Comparing to ""proud"": O and U are vowels, but O is more common than I? Actually, according to frequency: O is more common than I? 
   But let me check: without E, A, N, the most common letters are T, then O, then I, then S? 
   From the frequency list: T is about 9%, A: 8%, then O: 7.5%, I: 7%, N: 7%, S: 6.5%? So without E, A, N, the top might be T, then O, then I, then S.

 Therefore, testing T, O, I, S would be beneficial.

 Now, ""wrist"" uses T, S and I? So it covers T (most common), S (common), and I? And avoids letters we know are bad.

 On the other hand, ""brisk"" tests S, I, B, K? B and K are less common than T? 

 Therefore, ""wrist"" might be a better choice because it tests T and S together. Also, we might rule out T and S if absent.

 But note: if the secret word has T but not in the last position? We have no information. Also, with ""wrist"", we have:
   W at first, R at second, I at third, S at fourth, T at fifth.

 We can then deduce:

 For ""wrist"":
   - If we get any ✓, that gives specific position.
   - If we get -, that means letter is present but in wrong position.
   - If x, then letter is absent.

 Similarly, for ""brisk"", we test similarly.

 But since T is very common, I lean toward ""wrist"".

 However, we should also consider that the secret word might not have T? But we don't know.

 Given that, I think ""wrist"" is a good candidate.

 Alternatively, we could use ""torus""? but that doesn't have R at second? T O R U S -> R is third? Not second.

 So I choose ""wrist"" as my next guess.

 Therefore, the guess is ""wrist"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The secret word has **R** in the *second position* (R✓).
- The letters **C**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are **not** in the word (Cx, Ax, Nx, Ex).

For the second guess:
- Must **retain R in the second position**.
- **Avoid C, A, N, E**.
- Use **new, common letters** like S, T, O, I to maximize information. 
- Ideal words have **distinct letters** and include untested vowels (e.g., I or O).

I selected **""wrist""** because:
- It keeps R in position 2: `W R I S T`.
- Uses new, high-frequency letters: S, T, I (common vowels/consonants not ruled out).
- All letters are distinct (W, R, I, S, T), avoiding repeats for clearer feedback.
- Tests multiple possibilities: I (vowel), S, T, and W.

This guess will efficiently narrow down the secret word based on feedback for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and letter presence.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has more than one common consonant and a vowel we haven't tried (like O or I).

 Another candidate: ""groom"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present. Also, it repeats O? We'd rather have distinct letters to maximize information.

 Another: ""truck"" -> but C is forbidden, we can't use C.

 Another: ""froth"" -> F R O T H -> letters: F, R, O, T, H. O is a vowel we haven't tried. This might be good.

 Or ""trout"": T R O U T -> but U is repeated? No, T is repeated? ""trout"" has two T's? Actually: positions: T (1st), R (2nd), O (3rd), U (4th), T (5th). So T appears twice. Repeating T might not be efficient because if one T is correct we know the position? But we lose a letter test.

 Better to avoid repeated letters at this stage.

 Let me list some words with R in the second position and no C, A, N, E, and distinct letters:

 Possible words:
 - ""proud"" : P R O U D
 - ""grips"" : G R I P S
 - ""trisp"" ? not a word.
 - ""drips"" : D R I P S
 - ""brisk"" : B R I S K -> but we don't know if we can use S and K? Why not? We haven't tried them.

 Actually, ""brisk"" is a common word. And in the example, the secret word was ""brisk"". But that doesn't mean it's the same now.

 However, note: we know the secret word has R in the second position and doesn't have A, C, E, N. ""brisk"" fits: B R I S K -> no C, A, N, E? Correct.

 But we don't know if we should guess ""brisk"" now? We don't have enough information to be sure. We are on the second guess, so we want to maximize information.

 Therefore, we might not want to guess a word that could be the solution without testing more letters? Actually, if we guess ""brisk"" and it's not the word, we get more information? Yes.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses as many common letters as possible from the set we haven't tried.

 Let me rank the remaining letters by frequency: E, A, ... but we can't use A or E. Then S, O, I, T, ... are common.

 We haven't tried: S, O, I, T, L, D, etc.

 We want to cover vowels: we haven't tried O, I, U? So including one or two vowels is good.

 Consider ""brisk"" uses I and two consonants (B, S, K). But note: I is a vowel.

 Another word: ""pithy"" : P I T H Y -> but R is in second position? So we need R at the second? Our guess must have R at the second position.

 So let's insist: the word must be ? R ? ? ?.

 Example: ""troll"" -> repeated L? and repeated L? Not good. Also, T at front? Actually: T R O L L -> repeated L? It's T in first, R second, O third, L fourth, and L fifth? That's repeated L.

 We want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters are allowed in the word? Yes, but in feedback if a letter appears twice in the guess and once in the secret, it might give less information. So preferably use distinct letters.

 But note: if a letter is repeated in the secret, we won't know until we see the feedback? So to maximize information, distinct letters are better for now.

 So words that fit:
 - ""growl"": G R O W L -> letters: G, R, O, W, L -> all distinct? Yes.
 - ""dross"": D R O S S -> repeated S? Not good.
 - ""brisk"": B R I S K -> distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K -> all distinct. Good.

 We can also consider ""probe"": P R O B E -> but E is forbidden (from feedback: E is absent). So we cannot use that.

 Similarly, ""price"": P R I C E -> C and E are forbidden.

 So ""brisk"" is acceptable: has distinct letters, and avoids C, A, N, E.

 Let me think of other words: ""wrist"": W R I S T -> distinct letters: W, R, I, S, T -> good.

 We have two candidates: ""brisk"" and ""wrist"".

 Which one to choose? Both use S and T? But ""wrist"" uses T at the end and ""brisk"" uses K at the end. We don't know which is better.

 But note: S is a very common letter, so it's good to test it. Also I is a common vowel.

 How about including O? A word that includes O: ""gross"" -> repeated S? Not good.

 ""frown"": F R O W N -> but we eliminated N? Yes, N is absent, so we cannot use N. Therefore, ""frown"" is banned.

 ""proud"": P R O U D -> distinct letters: P, R, O, U, D. We haven't tried O, U, D. This might be good too.

 But S is more common than O? Actually, S is one of the most common letters.

 According to English letter frequency, the most common letters (in order) are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... We have ruled out E, A, N. So remaining top ones: T, O, I, S.

 So T and O are more common than I and S? Wait: T is most common among non-vowels? Actually: order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (but we have R already).

 We need to test the vowels? We haven't tried any vowel except A and E? And we know A and E are not in the word. So the vowel must be either I, O, U? Or Y sometimes.

 Therefore, testing a vowel is important.

 Between ""brisk"" (using I) and ""proud"" (using O and U), we are testing a vowel in both.

 But in ""brisk"" we test I and in ""proud"" we test O and U? And ""proud"" tests two vowels? That might be better because we can get information on two vowels.

 However, if either O or U is present we get partial information, but if we test only one vowel and it's absent, we know we must consider I or Y? Actually, we haven't tested I either.

 Alternatively, using ""wrisp"" is not a word.

 Let me look for a word that has both I and O? But with R at second? For example, ""writ?"" is 4 letters. ""trion"" -> not word? ""briol"" - not common.

 Given the constraints, I think ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""proud"", ""grout"", ""guild"" (but U is at fourth? positions don't match: ? R ? ? ? must have R at second).

 ""brink"" -> B R I N K -> but N is forbidden? We cannot use N.

 So that's banned.

 ""brim?"" -> only 4 letters.

 Therefore, among the choices:
  ""brisk"" is a valid word: B R I S K -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""wrist"": W R I S T -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""proud"": P R O U D -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""tryst"": T R Y S T -> repeated T? Not good.

 Another one: ""droid"": D R O I D -> repeated D? Not good.

 How about ""frisk"": F R I S K -> distinct letters? F, R, I, S, K -> distinct? Yes.

 Now we have: ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""frisk"", ""proud"".

 We want to maximize new letters and common letters.

 ""brisk"": uses B, R, I, S, K. 
    - R we already know is present and in position.
    - We are testing B, I, S, K.

 ""wrist"": uses W, R, I, S, T.
    - testing W, I, S, T.

 ""frisk"": uses F, R, I, S, K.
    - testing F, I, S, K.

 ""proud"": uses P, R, O, U, D.
    - testing P, O, U, D.

 Which of these sets of letters are more common? 
 - In the remaining letters, S and T are very common. So ""wrist"" uses both S and T? 
   But note: T is more common than S? Actually, T is the next most common after E and A (which we removed). So T and S are both top.

 Also, I is a vowel we haven't tried.

 Comparing to ""proud"": O and U are vowels, but O is more common than I? Actually, according to frequency: O is more common than I? 
   But let me check: without E, A, N, the most common letters are T, then O, then I, then S? 
   From the frequency list: T is about 9%, A: 8%, then O: 7.5%, I: 7%, N: 7%, S: 6.5%? So without E, A, N, the top might be T, then O, then I, then S.

 Therefore, testing T, O, I, S would be beneficial.

 Now, ""wrist"" uses T, S and I? So it covers T (most common), S (common), and I? And avoids letters we know are bad.

 On the other hand, ""brisk"" tests S, I, B, K? B and K are less common than T? 

 Therefore, ""wrist"" might be a better choice because it tests T and S together. Also, we might rule out T and S if absent.

 But note: if the secret word has T but not in the last position? We have no information. Also, with ""wrist"", we have:
   W at first, R at second, I at third, S at fourth, T at fifth.

 We can then deduce:

 For ""wrist"":
   - If we get any ✓, that gives specific position.
   - If we get -, that means letter is present but in wrong position.
   - If x, then letter is absent.

 Similarly, for ""brisk"", we test similarly.

 But since T is very common, I lean toward ""wrist"".

 However, we should also consider that the secret word might not have T? But we don't know.

 Given that, I think ""wrist"" is a good candidate.

 Alternatively, we could use ""torus""? but that doesn't have R at second? T O R U S -> R is third? Not second.

 So I choose ""wrist"" as my next guess.

 Therefore, the guess is ""wrist"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The secret word has **R** in the *second position* (R✓).
- The letters **C**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are **not** in the word (Cx, Ax, Nx, Ex).

For the second guess:
- Must **retain R in the second position**.
- **Avoid C, A, N, E**.
- Use **new, common letters** like S, T, O, I to maximize information. 
- Ideal words have **distinct letters** and include untested vowels (e.g., I or O).

I selected **""wrist""** because:
- It keeps R in position 2: `W R I S T`.
- Uses new, high-frequency letters: S, T, I (common vowels/consonants not ruled out).
- All letters are distinct (W, R, I, S, T), avoiding repeats for clearer feedback.
- Tests multiple possibilities: I (vowel), S, T, and W.

This guess will efficiently narrow down the secret word based on feedback for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and letter presence.",Guess 2: wrist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 Also, it has no repeated letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good starting word (meaning a crowd or a large number) and has the common letters R, O, A, T, E.

 However, I recall that ""SOARE"" (a falcon) is also used but might be less common. Let's stick with a more common word.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it is a very common starting word and covers a good set of letters.

 But note: the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We don't want to use a word that might be the secret word? 
 Actually, we don't know, so we choose a word that gives maximum information.

 I decide to use ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is: CRANEI need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

After considering common starting words (e.g., ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST""), I select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It covers frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.

This guess will help me narrow down the secret word efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) for each position.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - Only R is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter).
 - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter R in the second position (position 2).
 And it does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word has R as the second letter, we can represent the word as: _ R _ _ _

 Also, we must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 For our next guess, we want to:
 1. Include the letter R in the second position again (to keep that known position).
 2. Use other letters that are common and not the ones we know are absent (so avoid C, A, N, E).
 3. Use new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet: we have tried C, R, A, N, E.
 So we can use letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have a fixed R at second position.

 We want to maximize information, so we can try a word that includes several of these new letters.

 Some candidate letters that are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can consider words that have the form: ? R ? ? ?

 We must avoid C, A, N, E in any position.

 Possible words that come to mind:
 - ""proud"": P R O U D -> but we don't know about P, O, U, D. However, O and U are vowels that we haven't tried. But note: we don't have a vowel yet? The word has at least one vowel? Probably, but not necessarily.

 However, let's consider if we can cover more common letters. We might try to include S and T, which are very common.

 Example: ""burst"" -> B U R S T -> but note: the word must have R in second position, so we are looking for: ? R ? ? ?.
 For ""burst"": the positions are: B (1st), R (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

 But note: we must avoid A, C, E, N? Our guess should not include these because they are absent. So ""burst"" uses B, U, R, S, T and none of C, A, N, E. This is acceptable.

 However, we must also consider: we have eliminated C, A, N, E, so we need to choose from the remaining letters.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has more than one common consonant and a vowel we haven't tried (like O or I).

 Another candidate: ""groom"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present. Also, it repeats O? We'd rather have distinct letters to maximize information.

 Another: ""truck"" -> but C is forbidden, we can't use C.

 Another: ""froth"" -> F R O T H -> letters: F, R, O, T, H. O is a vowel we haven't tried. This might be good.

 Or ""trout"": T R O U T -> but U is repeated? No, T is repeated? ""trout"" has two T's? Actually: positions: T (1st), R (2nd), O (3rd), U (4th), T (5th). So T appears twice. Repeating T might not be efficient because if one T is correct we know the position? But we lose a letter test.

 Better to avoid repeated letters at this stage.

 Let me list some words with R in the second position and no C, A, N, E, and distinct letters:

 Possible words:
 - ""proud"" : P R O U D
 - ""grips"" : G R I P S
 - ""trisp"" ? not a word.
 - ""drips"" : D R I P S
 - ""brisk"" : B R I S K -> but we don't know if we can use S and K? Why not? We haven't tried them.

 Actually, ""brisk"" is a common word. And in the example, the secret word was ""brisk"". But that doesn't mean it's the same now.

 However, note: we know the secret word has R in the second position and doesn't have A, C, E, N. ""brisk"" fits: B R I S K -> no C, A, N, E? Correct.

 But we don't know if we should guess ""brisk"" now? We don't have enough information to be sure. We are on the second guess, so we want to maximize information.

 Therefore, we might not want to guess a word that could be the solution without testing more letters? Actually, if we guess ""brisk"" and it's not the word, we get more information? Yes.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses as many common letters as possible from the set we haven't tried.

 Let me rank the remaining letters by frequency: E, A, ... but we can't use A or E. Then S, O, I, T, ... are common.

 We haven't tried: S, O, I, T, L, D, etc.

 We want to cover vowels: we haven't tried O, I, U? So including one or two vowels is good.

 Consider ""brisk"" uses I and two consonants (B, S, K). But note: I is a vowel.

 Another word: ""pithy"" : P I T H Y -> but R is in second position? So we need R at the second? Our guess must have R at the second position.

 So let's insist: the word must be ? R ? ? ?.

 Example: ""troll"" -> repeated L? and repeated L? Not good. Also, T at front? Actually: T R O L L -> repeated L? It's T in first, R second, O third, L fourth, and L fifth? That's repeated L.

 We want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters are allowed in the word? Yes, but in feedback if a letter appears twice in the guess and once in the secret, it might give less information. So preferably use distinct letters.

 But note: if a letter is repeated in the secret, we won't know until we see the feedback? So to maximize information, distinct letters are better for now.

 So words that fit:
 - ""growl"": G R O W L -> letters: G, R, O, W, L -> all distinct? Yes.
 - ""dross"": D R O S S -> repeated S? Not good.
 - ""brisk"": B R I S K -> distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K -> all distinct. Good.

 We can also consider ""probe"": P R O B E -> but E is forbidden (from feedback: E is absent). So we cannot use that.

 Similarly, ""price"": P R I C E -> C and E are forbidden.

 So ""brisk"" is acceptable: has distinct letters, and avoids C, A, N, E.

 Let me think of other words: ""wrist"": W R I S T -> distinct letters: W, R, I, S, T -> good.

 We have two candidates: ""brisk"" and ""wrist"".

 Which one to choose? Both use S and T? But ""wrist"" uses T at the end and ""brisk"" uses K at the end. We don't know which is better.

 But note: S is a very common letter, so it's good to test it. Also I is a common vowel.

 How about including O? A word that includes O: ""gross"" -> repeated S? Not good.

 ""frown"": F R O W N -> but we eliminated N? Yes, N is absent, so we cannot use N. Therefore, ""frown"" is banned.

 ""proud"": P R O U D -> distinct letters: P, R, O, U, D. We haven't tried O, U, D. This might be good too.

 But S is more common than O? Actually, S is one of the most common letters.

 According to English letter frequency, the most common letters (in order) are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... We have ruled out E, A, N. So remaining top ones: T, O, I, S.

 So T and O are more common than I and S? Wait: T is most common among non-vowels? Actually: order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (but we have R already).

 We need to test the vowels? We haven't tried any vowel except A and E? And we know A and E are not in the word. So the vowel must be either I, O, U? Or Y sometimes.

 Therefore, testing a vowel is important.

 Between ""brisk"" (using I) and ""proud"" (using O and U), we are testing a vowel in both.

 But in ""brisk"" we test I and in ""proud"" we test O and U? And ""proud"" tests two vowels? That might be better because we can get information on two vowels.

 However, if either O or U is present we get partial information, but if we test only one vowel and it's absent, we know we must consider I or Y? Actually, we haven't tested I either.

 Alternatively, using ""wrisp"" is not a word.

 Let me look for a word that has both I and O? But with R at second? For example, ""writ?"" is 4 letters. ""trion"" -> not word? ""briol"" - not common.

 Given the constraints, I think ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""proud"", ""grout"", ""guild"" (but U is at fourth? positions don't match: ? R ? ? ? must have R at second).

 ""brink"" -> B R I N K -> but N is forbidden? We cannot use N.

 So that's banned.

 ""brim?"" -> only 4 letters.

 Therefore, among the choices:
  ""brisk"" is a valid word: B R I S K -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""wrist"": W R I S T -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""proud"": P R O U D -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.
  ""tryst"": T R Y S T -> repeated T? Not good.

 Another one: ""droid"": D R O I D -> repeated D? Not good.

 How about ""frisk"": F R I S K -> distinct letters? F, R, I, S, K -> distinct? Yes.

 Now we have: ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""frisk"", ""proud"".

 We want to maximize new letters and common letters.

 ""brisk"": uses B, R, I, S, K. 
    - R we already know is present and in position.
    - We are testing B, I, S, K.

 ""wrist"": uses W, R, I, S, T.
    - testing W, I, S, T.

 ""frisk"": uses F, R, I, S, K.
    - testing F, I, S, K.

 ""proud"": uses P, R, O, U, D.
    - testing P, O, U, D.

 Which of these sets of letters are more common? 
 - In the remaining letters, S and T are very common. So ""wrist"" uses both S and T? 
   But note: T is more common than S? Actually, T is the next most common after E and A (which we removed). So T and S are both top.

 Also, I is a vowel we haven't tried.

 Comparing to ""proud"": O and U are vowels, but O is more common than I? Actually, according to frequency: O is more common than I? 
   But let me check: without E, A, N, the most common letters are T, then O, then I, then S? 
   From the frequency list: T is about 9%, A: 8%, then O: 7.5%, I: 7%, N: 7%, S: 6.5%? So without E, A, N, the top might be T, then O, then I, then S.

 Therefore, testing T, O, I, S would be beneficial.

 Now, ""wrist"" uses T, S and I? So it covers T (most common), S (common), and I? And avoids letters we know are bad.

 On the other hand, ""brisk"" tests S, I, B, K? B and K are less common than T? 

 Therefore, ""wrist"" might be a better choice because it tests T and S together. Also, we might rule out T and S if absent.

 But note: if the secret word has T but not in the last position? We have no information. Also, with ""wrist"", we have:
   W at first, R at second, I at third, S at fourth, T at fifth.

 We can then deduce:

 For ""wrist"":
   - If we get any ✓, that gives specific position.
   - If we get -, that means letter is present but in wrong position.
   - If x, then letter is absent.

 Similarly, for ""brisk"", we test similarly.

 But since T is very common, I lean toward ""wrist"".

 However, we should also consider that the secret word might not have T? But we don't know.

 Given that, I think ""wrist"" is a good candidate.

 Alternatively, we could use ""torus""? but that doesn't have R at second? T O R U S -> R is third? Not second.

 So I choose ""wrist"" as my next guess.

 Therefore, the guess is ""wrist"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The secret word has **R** in the *second position* (R✓).
- The letters **C**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are **not** in the word (Cx, Ax, Nx, Ex).

For the second guess:
- Must **retain R in the second position**.
- **Avoid C, A, N, E**.
- Use **new, common letters** like S, T, O, I to maximize information. 
- Ideal words have **distinct letters** and include untested vowels (e.g., I or O).

I selected **""wrist""** because:
- It keeps R in position 2: `W R I S T`.
- Uses new, high-frequency letters: S, T, I (common vowels/consonants not ruled out).
- All letters are distinct (W, R, I, S, T), avoiding repeats for clearer feedback.
- Tests multiple possibilities: I (vowel), S, T, and W.

This guess will efficiently narrow down the secret word based on feedback for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and letter presence.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.\n Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.\n\n One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). \n Another is ""SLATE"". However, let\'s consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\n According to various sources, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\n I will choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). \n Also, it has no repeated letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good starting word (meaning a crowd or a large number) and has the common letters R, O, A, T, E.\n\n However, I recall that ""SOARE"" (a falcon) is also used but might be less common. Let\'s stick with a more common word.\n\n After consideration, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it is a very common starting word and covers a good set of letters.\n\n But note: the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We don\'t want to use a word that might be the secret word? \n Actually, we don\'t know, so we choose a word that gives maximum information.\n\n I decide to use ""CRANE"".\n\n So, my first guess is: CRANEI need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. \n\nAfter considering common starting words (e.g., ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST""), I select ""CRANE"" because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).\n- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.\n- It covers frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.\n\nThis guess will help me narrow down the secret word efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) for each position.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)\n Interpretation:\n - Only R is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter).\n - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has the letter R in the second position (position 2).\n And it does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\n Since the secret word has R as the second letter, we can represent the word as: _ R _ _ _\n\n Also, we must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.\n\n For our next guess, we want to:\n 1. Include the letter R in the second position again (to keep that known position).\n 2. Use other letters that are common and not the ones we know are absent (so avoid C, A, N, E).\n 3. Use new letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet: we have tried C, R, A, N, E.\n So we can use letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have a fixed R at second position.\n\n We want to maximize information, so we can try a word that includes several of these new letters.\n\n Some candidate letters that are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n We can consider words that have the form: ? R ? ? ?\n\n We must avoid C, A, N, E in any position.\n\n Possible words that come to mind:\n - ""proud"": P R O U D -> but we don\'t know about P, O, U, D. However, O and U are vowels that we haven\'t tried. But note: we don\'t have a vowel yet? The word has at least one vowel? Probably, but not necessarily.\n\n However, let\'s consider if we can cover more common letters. We might try to include S and T, which are very common.\n\n Example: ""burst"" -> B U R S T -> but note: the word must have R in second position, so we are looking for: ? R ? ? ?.\n For ""burst"": the positions are: B (1st), R (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), T (5th). So that fits.\n\n But note: we must avoid A, C, E, N? Our guess should not include these because they are absent. So ""burst"" uses B, U, R, S, T and none of C, A, N, E. This is acceptable.\n\n However, we must also consider: we have eliminated C, A, N, E, so we need to choose from the remaining letters.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a word that has more than one common consonant and a vowel we haven\'t tried (like O or I).\n\n Another candidate: ""groom"" -> but that has two O\'s and we don\'t know if O is present. Also, it repeats O? We\'d rather have distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n Another: ""truck"" -> but C is forbidden, we can\'t use C.\n\n Another: ""froth"" -> F R O T H -> letters: F, R, O, T, H. O is a vowel we haven\'t tried. This might be good.\n\n Or ""trout"": T R O U T -> but U is repeated? No, T is repeated? ""trout"" has two T\'s? Actually: positions: T (1st), R (2nd), O (3rd), U (4th), T (5th). So T appears twice. Repeating T might not be efficient because if one T is correct we know the position? But we lose a letter test.\n\n Better to avoid repeated letters at this stage.\n\n Let me list some words with R in the second position and no C, A, N, E, and distinct letters:\n\n Possible words:\n - ""proud"" : P R O U D\n - ""grips"" : G R I P S\n - ""trisp"" ? not a word.\n - ""drips"" : D R I P S\n - ""brisk"" : B R I S K -> but we don\'t know if we can use S and K? Why not? We haven\'t tried them.\n\n Actually, ""brisk"" is a common word. And in the example, the secret word was ""brisk"". But that doesn\'t mean it\'s the same now.\n\n However, note: we know the secret word has R in the second position and doesn\'t have A, C, E, N. ""brisk"" fits: B R I S K -> no C, A, N, E? Correct.\n\n But we don\'t know if we should guess ""brisk"" now? We don\'t have enough information to be sure. We are on the second guess, so we want to maximize information.\n\n Therefore, we might not want to guess a word that could be the solution without testing more letters? Actually, if we guess ""brisk"" and it\'s not the word, we get more information? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses as many common letters as possible from the set we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me rank the remaining letters by frequency: E, A, ... but we can\'t use A or E. Then S, O, I, T, ... are common.\n\n We haven\'t tried: S, O, I, T, L, D, etc.\n\n We want to cover vowels: we haven\'t tried O, I, U? So including one or two vowels is good.\n\n Consider ""brisk"" uses I and two consonants (B, S, K). But note: I is a vowel.\n\n Another word: ""pithy"" : P I T H Y -> but R is in second position? So we need R at the second? Our guess must have R at the second position.\n\n So let\'s insist: the word must be ? R ? ? ?.\n\n Example: ""troll"" -> repeated L? and repeated L? Not good. Also, T at front? Actually: T R O L L -> repeated L? It\'s T in first, R second, O third, L fourth, and L fifth? That\'s repeated L.\n\n We want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters are allowed in the word? Yes, but in feedback if a letter appears twice in the guess and once in the secret, it might give less information. So preferably use distinct letters.\n\n But note: if a letter is repeated in the secret, we won\'t know until we see the feedback? So to maximize information, distinct letters are better for now.\n\n So words that fit:\n - ""growl"": G R O W L -> letters: G, R, O, W, L -> all distinct? Yes.\n - ""dross"": D R O S S -> repeated S? Not good.\n - ""brisk"": B R I S K -> distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K -> all distinct. Good.\n\n We can also consider ""probe"": P R O B E -> but E is forbidden (from feedback: E is absent). So we cannot use that.\n\n Similarly, ""price"": P R I C E -> C and E are forbidden.\n\n So ""brisk"" is acceptable: has distinct letters, and avoids C, A, N, E.\n\n Let me think of other words: ""wrist"": W R I S T -> distinct letters: W, R, I, S, T -> good.\n\n We have two candidates: ""brisk"" and ""wrist"".\n\n Which one to choose? Both use S and T? But ""wrist"" uses T at the end and ""brisk"" uses K at the end. We don\'t know which is better.\n\n But note: S is a very common letter, so it\'s good to test it. Also I is a common vowel.\n\n How about including O? A word that includes O: ""gross"" -> repeated S? Not good.\n\n ""frown"": F R O W N -> but we eliminated N? Yes, N is absent, so we cannot use N. Therefore, ""frown"" is banned.\n\n ""proud"": P R O U D -> distinct letters: P, R, O, U, D. We haven\'t tried O, U, D. This might be good too.\n\n But S is more common than O? Actually, S is one of the most common letters.\n\n According to English letter frequency, the most common letters (in order) are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... We have ruled out E, A, N. So remaining top ones: T, O, I, S.\n\n So T and O are more common than I and S? Wait: T is most common among non-vowels? Actually: order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (but we have R already).\n\n We need to test the vowels? We haven\'t tried any vowel except A and E? And we know A and E are not in the word. So the vowel must be either I, O, U? Or Y sometimes.\n\n Therefore, testing a vowel is important.\n\n Between ""brisk"" (using I) and ""proud"" (using O and U), we are testing a vowel in both.\n\n But in ""brisk"" we test I and in ""proud"" we test O and U? And ""proud"" tests two vowels? That might be better because we can get information on two vowels.\n\n However, if either O or U is present we get partial information, but if we test only one vowel and it\'s absent, we know we must consider I or Y? Actually, we haven\'t tested I either.\n\n Alternatively, using ""wrisp"" is not a word.\n\n Let me look for a word that has both I and O? But with R at second? For example, ""writ?"" is 4 letters. ""trion"" -> not word? ""briol"" - not common.\n\n Given the constraints, I think ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""proud"", ""grout"", ""guild"" (but U is at fourth? positions don\'t match: ? R ? ? ? must have R at second).\n\n ""brink"" -> B R I N K -> but N is forbidden? We cannot use N.\n\n So that\'s banned.\n\n ""brim?"" -> only 4 letters.\n\n Therefore, among the choices:\n  ""brisk"" is a valid word: B R I S K -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.\n  ""wrist"": W R I S T -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.\n  ""proud"": P R O U D -> avoids C,A,N,E? Yes.\n  ""tryst"": T R Y S T -> repeated T? Not good.\n\n Another one: ""droid"": D R O I D -> repeated D? Not good.\n\n How about ""frisk"": F R I S K -> distinct letters? F, R, I, S, K -> distinct? Yes.\n\n Now we have: ""brisk"", ""wrist"", ""frisk"", ""proud"".\n\n We want to maximize new letters and common letters.\n\n ""brisk"": uses B, R, I, S, K. \n    - R we already know is present and in position.\n    - We are testing B, I, S, K.\n\n ""wrist"": uses W, R, I, S, T.\n    - testing W, I, S, T.\n\n ""frisk"": uses F, R, I, S, K.\n    - testing F, I, S, K.\n\n ""proud"": uses P, R, O, U, D.\n    - testing P, O, U, D.\n\n Which of these sets of letters are more common? \n - In the remaining letters, S and T are very common. So ""wrist"" uses both S and T? \n   But note: T is more common than S? Actually, T is the next most common after E and A (which we removed). So T and S are both top.\n\n Also, I is a vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\n Comparing to ""proud"": O and U are vowels, but O is more common than I? Actually, according to frequency: O is more common than I? \n   But let me check: without E, A, N, the most common letters are T, then O, then I, then S? \n   From the frequency list: T is about 9%, A: 8%, then O: 7.5%, I: 7%, N: 7%, S: 6.5%? So without E, A, N, the top might be T, then O, then I, then S.\n\n Therefore, testing T, O, I, S would be beneficial.\n\n Now, ""wrist"" uses T, S and I? So it covers T (most common), S (common), and I? And avoids letters we know are bad.\n\n On the other hand, ""brisk"" tests S, I, B, K? B and K are less common than T? \n\n Therefore, ""wrist"" might be a better choice because it tests T and S together. Also, we might rule out T and S if absent.\n\n But note: if the secret word has T but not in the last position? We have no information. Also, with ""wrist"", we have:\n   W at first, R at second, I at third, S at fourth, T at fifth.\n\n We can then deduce:\n\n For ""wrist"":\n   - If we get any ✓, that gives specific position.\n   - If we get -, that means letter is present but in wrong position.\n   - If x, then letter is absent.\n\n Similarly, for ""brisk"", we test similarly.\n\n But since T is very common, I lean toward ""wrist"".\n\n However, we should also consider that the secret word might not have T? But we don\'t know.\n\n Given that, I think ""wrist"" is a good candidate.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""torus""? but that doesn\'t have R at second? T O R U S -> R is third? Not second.\n\n So I choose ""wrist"" as my next guess.\n\n Therefore, the guess is ""wrist"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The secret word has **R** in the *second position* (R✓).\n- The letters **C**, **A**, **N**, and **E** are **not** in the word (Cx, Ax, Nx, Ex).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must **retain R in the second position**.\n- **Avoid C, A, N, E**.\n- Use **new, common letters** like S, T, O, I to maximize information. \n- Ideal words have **distinct letters** and include untested vowels (e.g., I or O).\n\nI selected **""wrist""** because:\n- It keeps R in position 2: `W R I S T`.\n- Uses new, high-frequency letters: S, T, I (common vowels/consonants not ruled out).\n- All letters are distinct (W, R, I, S, T), avoiding repeats for clearer feedback.\n- Tests multiple possibilities: I (vowel), S, T, and W.\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down the secret word based on feedback for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and letter presence.\n\n<guess>wrist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: wrist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) -> so the secret word has R as the second letter.
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: absent (x)

2. ""wrist"":
   - W: absent (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) -> confirmed again, R is the second letter.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: correct position (✓) -> so the secret word has T as the fifth letter.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ T
- The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, W, I, S.

We must avoid using these absent letters in future guesses.

Now, the known positions:
- Position 2: R
- Position 5: T

We need to guess the first, third, and fourth letters.

The absent letters are: C, A, N, E, W, I, S.

So, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we are looking for a 5-letter word that is in the dictionary.

The word pattern: [1] R [3] [4] T

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.

We also want to maximize information for the unknown positions (1, 3, 4). So we should try to use common letters and distinct ones.

Common letters from the available set: O, U, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can consider including a vowel because we haven't found one yet (since A, E, I are absent, so the vowel must be O or U or sometimes Y).

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Some candidates:

- ""draft"": D R A F T -> but A is absent? We cannot use A. So invalid.
- ""graft"": G R A F T -> A is absent.
- ""craft"": C is absent.
- ""droit"": D R O I T -> I is absent? We cannot use I. So invalid.
- ""fruit"": F R U I T -> I is absent? Invalid.
- ""frost"": F R O S T -> S is absent? We cannot use S. Invalid.
- ""groat"": G R O A T -> A is absent? Invalid.
- ""trout"": T R O U T -> but T is at the beginning? We have T at the end, but the first letter is T? That's allowed? But note: the pattern is [1] R [3] [4] T. So if we use ""trout"", it would be T R O U T -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. But we know T is at the fifth position, but we don't know if T can be at the first? The feedback for ""wrist"" had T at the fifth as correct, but it doesn't say anything about T in other positions? Actually, the feedback for ""wrist"" only said T at the fifth is correct. It didn't say anything about T in other positions because we didn't put T elsewhere. But we know from the absence of T in other words? Actually, we don't. We only know that in ""crane"" and ""wrist"", we didn't have T in other positions. But we can have T in the first position? It's possible.

However, in ""wrist"", we had T at the fifth and it was correct, but if the word has T at the first and fifth, then in ""wrist"" we only tested T at the fifth, so we don't know about the first. But we haven't tested the first position with T? So it's possible.

But note: in ""wrist"", we had W at first and it was absent. So the first letter is not W. But it could be T? Yes.

But let's check the feedback: for ""wrist"", W was absent (x). So the first letter is not W. But it could be T? We don't know because we haven't placed T at first in any guess.

So we can try a word that has T at first? But we know T is at fifth, so if we put T at first and it is also present, then the word has two T's? That's possible.

But we are not sure. So we need to test.

However, for our next guess, we want to get information about the first, third, and fourth positions.

We know the fifth is T and second is R.

So let's think of words that fit: [1] R [3] [4] T, and [1], [3], [4] are from the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, and we must avoid C, A, N, E, W, I, S.

We also want to use common letters to increase the chance of hitting.

Possible words:

- ""fort"": only 4 letters? We need 5: so not.
- ""bruit"": B R U I T -> I is absent? Invalid.
- ""brunt"": B R U N T -> N is absent? Invalid.
- ""druid"": D R U I D -> I is absent? Invalid.
- ""fruit"": F R U I T -> I absent? Invalid.
- ""grist"": G R I S T -> I and S absent? Invalid.
- ""grout"": G R O U T -> letters: G, R, O, U, T. 
  - Check: G, O, U, T are not in the absent list? 
    - Absent: C, A, N, E, W, I, S. So G, O, U, T are allowed.
  - Pattern: G (1), R (2), O (3), U (4), T (5). So it fits: [1] R [3] [4] T.

So ""grout"" is a candidate.

- ""proud"": P R O U D -> but the fifth letter is D, not T? We need T at fifth. So invalid.

- ""trout"": T R O U T -> 
  - T at first and fifth? 
  - Letters: T, R, O, U, T -> but T is repeated? 
  - Pattern: T (1), R (2), O (3), U (4), T (5). 
  - We know T is at fifth, but we don't know about first. 
  - Also, the letters: T, O, U are not absent? 
  - But we have two T's? That might be acceptable if the word has two T's? 
  - However, we are trying to get information. If we use ""trout"", and if the first T is absent, we know T is only at fifth? But if it's present, then we know there are two T's? 
  - But we are on the third guess, and we want to cover more letters. ""trout"" uses O and U, which are vowels we haven't tested.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, W, I, S. ""trout"" uses T, R, O, U. R and T we already know are present? We know R is present and in position, T is present and in position. But we don't know about O and U.

But we are testing O and U? Yes.

However, ""trout"" has repeated T? So we are testing T twice? That might not be efficient because we already know T is at fifth. If we put T at first and it is correct, then we get a double T? But if it's not, then we know T is only at fifth.

But we could use a word without repeating T to test more letters.

""grout"" uses G, O, U, which are all new.

Another candidate: ""broke"" -> B R O K E -> E is absent? Invalid.

""frock"" -> F R O C K -> C is absent? Invalid.

""growl"" -> G R O W L -> W is absent? We cannot use W. Invalid.

""droll"" -> D R O L L -> repeated L? and fifth is L, not T? Invalid.

""troll"" -> T R O L L -> fifth is L? Not T. Invalid.

""broom"" -> B R O O M -> repeated O? and fifth is M, not T. Invalid.

""groat"" -> G R O A T -> A absent? Invalid.

""front"" -> F R O N T -> N absent? Invalid.

""frost"" -> F R O S T -> S absent? Invalid.

""pivot"" -> P I V O T -> I absent? and also the pattern: P(1), I(2) but we need R at second? So invalid.

So we have limited options.

Another possibility: ""doubt"" -> D O U B T -> pattern: D(1), O(2) but we need R at second? So no.

We must have R at second.

So back to ""grout"" and ""trout"".

Also, ""brute"": B R U T E -> E absent? Invalid.

""fruit"" is invalid.

""gouty"": G O U T Y -> pattern: G(1), O(2) but we need R at second? No.

So we have:

- ""grout"": G R O U T -> tests G, O, U (all new) and confirms R and T.
- ""trout"": T R O U T -> tests T at first (which we don't know) and O, U, and confirms R and T at fifth.

Which one to choose?

If we choose ""grout"", we test three new letters: G, O, U.

If we choose ""trout"", we test O and U, but also test T at first. Since we know T is at fifth, if we get a ✓ for T at first, then we know there are two T's? But if we get x for T at first, then we know T is only at fifth.

But we are not sure if the word has one T or two.

Given that we have limited vowels, testing O and U is important.

I think ""grout"" is better because it tests three new letters without repeating T. Also, if the word has only one T, then ""trout"" would have an extra T that is not present? But we don't know.

But note: in ""trout"", if the secret word has only one T (at fifth), then the first T in ""trout"" would be marked as absent? So we get that information.

But we are trying to cover more new letters. ""grout"" uses G, O, U, all new. ""trout"" uses O, U, and T (which we already know is present, but at a different position).

So ""grout"" might be better for information.

Another word: ""bruit"" is invalid because of I.

""druid"" invalid.

""fugue"" -> F U G U E -> E absent? and pattern not matching.

So I think ""grout"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""grout"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a thin mortar.

So I'll go with ""grout"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""grout"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).  
  - C, A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: wrist** → Feedback: W(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), T(✓)  
  - R (2nd) and T (5th) are confirmed correct and in position.  
  - W, I, S are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R _ _ T` (R in position 2, T in position 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, W, I, S (cannot appear in any position).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 4.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since C, A, N, E, W, I, S are ruled out).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Retain R in position 2 and T in position 5.  
  - Test new, high-frequency letters from the available set (e.g., O, U, G) to maximize information.  
  - Prioritize distinct letters to cover more possibilities.  
  - Focus on untested vowels (O or U) since A, E, I are absent.  

### Why ""grout""?
- **Fits the pattern**: `G R O U T` (position 1: G, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: U, position 5: T).  
- **Tests key letters**:  
  - **G**: Common consonant, not yet tested.  
  - **O and U**: Untested vowels (critical since A, E, I are absent).  
  - All letters are distinct, avoiding repeats for clearer feedback.  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, A, N, E, W, I, S.  
- **Information gain**: Feedback will reveal if G, O, or U are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down the secret word significantly.  

<guess>grout</guess>",grout,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) -> so the secret word has R as the second letter.
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: absent (x)

2. ""wrist"":
   - W: absent (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) -> confirmed again, R is the second letter.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: correct position (✓) -> so the secret word has T as the fifth letter.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ T
- The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, W, I, S.

We must avoid using these absent letters in future guesses.

Now, the known positions:
- Position 2: R
- Position 5: T

We need to guess the first, third, and fourth letters.

The absent letters are: C, A, N, E, W, I, S.

So, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we are looking for a 5-letter word that is in the dictionary.

The word pattern: [1] R [3] [4] T

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.

We also want to maximize information for the unknown positions (1, 3, 4). So we should try to use common letters and distinct ones.

Common letters from the available set: O, U, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can consider including a vowel because we haven't found one yet (since A, E, I are absent, so the vowel must be O or U or sometimes Y).

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Some candidates:

- ""draft"": D R A F T -> but A is absent? We cannot use A. So invalid.
- ""graft"": G R A F T -> A is absent.
- ""craft"": C is absent.
- ""droit"": D R O I T -> I is absent? We cannot use I. So invalid.
- ""fruit"": F R U I T -> I is absent? Invalid.
- ""frost"": F R O S T -> S is absent? We cannot use S. Invalid.
- ""groat"": G R O A T -> A is absent? Invalid.
- ""trout"": T R O U T -> but T is at the beginning? We have T at the end, but the first letter is T? That's allowed? But note: the pattern is [1] R [3] [4] T. So if we use ""trout"", it would be T R O U T -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T. But we know T is at the fifth position, but we don't know if T can be at the first? The feedback for ""wrist"" had T at the fifth as correct, but it doesn't say anything about T in other positions? Actually, the feedback for ""wrist"" only said T at the fifth is correct. It didn't say anything about T in other positions because we didn't put T elsewhere. But we know from the absence of T in other words? Actually, we don't. We only know that in ""crane"" and ""wrist"", we didn't have T in other positions. But we can have T in the first position? It's possible.

However, in ""wrist"", we had T at the fifth and it was correct, but if the word has T at the first and fifth, then in ""wrist"" we only tested T at the fifth, so we don't know about the first. But we haven't tested the first position with T? So it's possible.

But note: in ""wrist"", we had W at first and it was absent. So the first letter is not W. But it could be T? Yes.

But let's check the feedback: for ""wrist"", W was absent (x). So the first letter is not W. But it could be T? We don't know because we haven't placed T at first in any guess.

So we can try a word that has T at first? But we know T is at fifth, so if we put T at first and it is also present, then the word has two T's? That's possible.

But we are not sure. So we need to test.

However, for our next guess, we want to get information about the first, third, and fourth positions.

We know the fifth is T and second is R.

So let's think of words that fit: [1] R [3] [4] T, and [1], [3], [4] are from the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, and we must avoid C, A, N, E, W, I, S.

We also want to use common letters to increase the chance of hitting.

Possible words:

- ""fort"": only 4 letters? We need 5: so not.
- ""bruit"": B R U I T -> I is absent? Invalid.
- ""brunt"": B R U N T -> N is absent? Invalid.
- ""druid"": D R U I D -> I is absent? Invalid.
- ""fruit"": F R U I T -> I absent? Invalid.
- ""grist"": G R I S T -> I and S absent? Invalid.
- ""grout"": G R O U T -> letters: G, R, O, U, T. 
  - Check: G, O, U, T are not in the absent list? 
    - Absent: C, A, N, E, W, I, S. So G, O, U, T are allowed.
  - Pattern: G (1), R (2), O (3), U (4), T (5). So it fits: [1] R [3] [4] T.

So ""grout"" is a candidate.

- ""proud"": P R O U D -> but the fifth letter is D, not T? We need T at fifth. So invalid.

- ""trout"": T R O U T -> 
  - T at first and fifth? 
  - Letters: T, R, O, U, T -> but T is repeated? 
  - Pattern: T (1), R (2), O (3), U (4), T (5). 
  - We know T is at fifth, but we don't know about first. 
  - Also, the letters: T, O, U are not absent? 
  - But we have two T's? That might be acceptable if the word has two T's? 
  - However, we are trying to get information. If we use ""trout"", and if the first T is absent, we know T is only at fifth? But if it's present, then we know there are two T's? 
  - But we are on the third guess, and we want to cover more letters. ""trout"" uses O and U, which are vowels we haven't tested.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, W, I, S. ""trout"" uses T, R, O, U. R and T we already know are present? We know R is present and in position, T is present and in position. But we don't know about O and U.

But we are testing O and U? Yes.

However, ""trout"" has repeated T? So we are testing T twice? That might not be efficient because we already know T is at fifth. If we put T at first and it is correct, then we get a double T? But if it's not, then we know T is only at fifth.

But we could use a word without repeating T to test more letters.

""grout"" uses G, O, U, which are all new.

Another candidate: ""broke"" -> B R O K E -> E is absent? Invalid.

""frock"" -> F R O C K -> C is absent? Invalid.

""growl"" -> G R O W L -> W is absent? We cannot use W. Invalid.

""droll"" -> D R O L L -> repeated L? and fifth is L, not T? Invalid.

""troll"" -> T R O L L -> fifth is L? Not T. Invalid.

""broom"" -> B R O O M -> repeated O? and fifth is M, not T. Invalid.

""groat"" -> G R O A T -> A absent? Invalid.

""front"" -> F R O N T -> N absent? Invalid.

""frost"" -> F R O S T -> S absent? Invalid.

""pivot"" -> P I V O T -> I absent? and also the pattern: P(1), I(2) but we need R at second? So invalid.

So we have limited options.

Another possibility: ""doubt"" -> D O U B T -> pattern: D(1), O(2) but we need R at second? So no.

We must have R at second.

So back to ""grout"" and ""trout"".

Also, ""brute"": B R U T E -> E absent? Invalid.

""fruit"" is invalid.

""gouty"": G O U T Y -> pattern: G(1), O(2) but we need R at second? No.

So we have:

- ""grout"": G R O U T -> tests G, O, U (all new) and confirms R and T.
- ""trout"": T R O U T -> tests T at first (which we don't know) and O, U, and confirms R and T at fifth.

Which one to choose?

If we choose ""grout"", we test three new letters: G, O, U.

If we choose ""trout"", we test O and U, but also test T at first. Since we know T is at fifth, if we get a ✓ for T at first, then we know there are two T's? But if we get x for T at first, then we know T is only at fifth.

But we are not sure if the word has one T or two.

Given that we have limited vowels, testing O and U is important.

I think ""grout"" is better because it tests three new letters without repeating T. Also, if the word has only one T, then ""trout"" would have an extra T that is not present? But we don't know.

But note: in ""trout"", if the secret word has only one T (at fifth), then the first T in ""trout"" would be marked as absent? So we get that information.

But we are trying to cover more new letters. ""grout"" uses G, O, U, all new. ""trout"" uses O, U, and T (which we already know is present, but at a different position).

So ""grout"" might be better for information.

Another word: ""bruit"" is invalid because of I.

""druid"" invalid.

""fugue"" -> F U G U E -> E absent? and pattern not matching.

So I think ""grout"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""grout"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a thin mortar.

So I'll go with ""grout"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""grout"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).  
  - C, A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: wrist** → Feedback: W(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), T(✓)  
  - R (2nd) and T (5th) are confirmed correct and in position.  
  - W, I, S are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R _ _ T` (R in position 2, T in position 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, W, I, S (cannot appear in any position).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 4.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since C, A, N, E, W, I, S are ruled out).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Retain R in position 2 and T in position 5.  
  - Test new, high-frequency letters from the available set (e.g., O, U, G) to maximize information.  
  - Prioritize distinct letters to cover more possibilities.  
  - Focus on untested vowels (O or U) since A, E, I are absent.  

### Why ""grout""?
- **Fits the pattern**: `G R O U T` (position 1: G, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: U, position 5: T).  
- **Tests key letters**:  
  - **G**: Common consonant, not yet tested.  
  - **O and U**: Untested vowels (critical since A, E, I are absent).  
  - All letters are distinct, avoiding repeats for clearer feedback.  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, A, N, E, W, I, S.  
- **Information gain**: Feedback will reveal if G, O, or U are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down the secret word significantly.",Guess 3: grout -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
