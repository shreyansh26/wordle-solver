We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, from this:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

Since the word starts with C, our next guess should start with C.

We know R is in the word, but not in the second position, so R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we must avoid letters A, N, E.

We have to guess a 5-letter word starting with C and containing R, and not containing A, N, E.

Possible letters: We can use other vowels (O, U, I) and consonants.

Common English words starting with C: think of words like CRUST, CRUMB, etc., but note we must avoid E and A, and R cannot be second.

Our first guess had R in second position, so now we must put R in a different position: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words starting with C and having R in position 3,4, or 5.

Options:
- Position 3: e.g., C_R?? (like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don't have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??
- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)
- Position 5: e.g., C???R

Also, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.

So, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses some of these.

One strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.

For example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??
Words: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don't know about S.

Alternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.

But let's check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)

Example: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.

Words with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.

Another: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.

Perhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.

Words: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.

Having difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.

Let me list possible words: 

- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? 

Possible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.

Example words: 
- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.

But note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.

In CHORD: R is at position 4.

Similarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.

That might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.

Similarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.

We also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.

A good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

C is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.

But is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.

In the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.

But also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.

Another option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.

Therefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.

Let me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.

Possible words:

- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4
- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5
- CHORD: as above, R at 4
- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? 

Wait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn't help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.

So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.

Hence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.

Now, among the options:

CHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.

CHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.

To gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.

Also, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.

But note: in the first word, we had 'C','R','A','N','E'. We now know A,N,E are absent.

Another idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)

This tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.

Or CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.

CHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.

Both seem okay.

But note: we must use only English words.

CHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.

Another option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.

CURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.

I think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.

But CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven't tested.

We should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.

Similarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it's wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.

We can try that.

Another common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.

So I'll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.

Introduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).

But CHIRP has R at position 4? Let's count: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: I
Position 4: R
Position 5: P

Yes.

We are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.

R is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.

Similarly for others.

Also note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.

So let's guess ""CHIRP"".

But we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.

CHIRP tests H,I,P.

Both are valid.

I can choose CHIRP.

Wait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn't have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.

But actually, at this stage, we are testing.

Perhaps a word with more vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

CHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.

If the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.

That might be good.

Similarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.

Also, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it's present, we'll know.

But in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.

I think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.

But CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.

Both are acceptable.

I'll pick CHOIR because it's another common starting word and tests O.

So guess: CHOIR

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is in the correct position (position 1).  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A, N, and E are not in the word.  

For the next guess:  
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  
- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  
- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  
- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  
- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  
  - Starts with ""C"".  
  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  
  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  
  - Avoids A, N, E.  

This guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.

<guess>choir</guess>",choir,"We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, from this:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

Since the word starts with C, our next guess should start with C.

We know R is in the word, but not in the second position, so R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we must avoid letters A, N, E.

We have to guess a 5-letter word starting with C and containing R, and not containing A, N, E.

Possible letters: We can use other vowels (O, U, I) and consonants.

Common English words starting with C: think of words like CRUST, CRUMB, etc., but note we must avoid E and A, and R cannot be second.

Our first guess had R in second position, so now we must put R in a different position: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words starting with C and having R in position 3,4, or 5.

Options:
- Position 3: e.g., C_R?? (like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don't have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??
- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)
- Position 5: e.g., C???R

Also, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.

So, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses some of these.

One strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.

For example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??
Words: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don't know about S.

Alternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.

But let's check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)

Example: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.

Words with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.

Another: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.

Perhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.

Words: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.

Having difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.

Let me list possible words: 

- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? 

Possible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.

Example words: 
- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.

But note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.

In CHORD: R is at position 4.

Similarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.

That might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.

Similarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.

We also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.

A good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

C is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.

But is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.

In the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.

But also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.

Another option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.

Therefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.

Let me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.

Possible words:

- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4
- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5
- CHORD: as above, R at 4
- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? 

Wait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn't help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.

So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.

Hence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.

Now, among the options:

CHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.

CHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.

To gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.

Also, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.

But note: in the first word, we had 'C','R','A','N','E'. We now know A,N,E are absent.

Another idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)

This tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.

Or CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.

CHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.

Both seem okay.

But note: we must use only English words.

CHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.

Another option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.

CURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.

I think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.

But CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven't tested.

We should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.

Similarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it's wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.

We can try that.

Another common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.

So I'll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.

Introduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).

But CHIRP has R at position 4? Let's count: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: I
Position 4: R
Position 5: P

Yes.

We are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.

R is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.

Similarly for others.

Also note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.

So let's guess ""CHIRP"".

But we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.

CHIRP tests H,I,P.

Both are valid.

I can choose CHIRP.

Wait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn't have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.

But actually, at this stage, we are testing.

Perhaps a word with more vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

CHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.

If the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.

That might be good.

Similarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.

Also, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it's present, we'll know.

But in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.

I think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.

But CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.

Both are acceptable.

I'll pick CHOIR because it's another common starting word and tests O.

So guess: CHOIR

Format: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is in the correct position (position 1).  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A, N, and E are not in the word.  

For the next guess:  
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  
- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  
- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  
- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  
- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  
  - Starts with ""C"".  
  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  
  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  
  - Avoids A, N, E.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, from this:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

Since the word starts with C, our next guess should start with C.

We know R is in the word, but not in the second position, so R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we must avoid letters A, N, E.

We have to guess a 5-letter word starting with C and containing R, and not containing A, N, E.

Possible letters: We can use other vowels (O, U, I) and consonants.

Common English words starting with C: think of words like CRUST, CRUMB, etc., but note we must avoid E and A, and R cannot be second.

Our first guess had R in second position, so now we must put R in a different position: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words starting with C and having R in position 3,4, or 5.

Options:
- Position 3: e.g., C_R?? (like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don't have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??
- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)
- Position 5: e.g., C???R

Also, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.

So, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses some of these.

One strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.

For example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??
Words: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don't know about S.

Alternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.

But let's check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)

Example: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.

Words with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.

Another: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.

Perhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.

Words: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.

Having difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.

Let me list possible words: 

- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? 

Possible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.

Example words: 
- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.

But note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.

In CHORD: R is at position 4.

Similarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.

That might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.

Similarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.

We also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.

A good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

C is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.

But is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.

In the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.

But also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.

Another option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.

Therefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.

Let me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.

Possible words:

- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4
- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5
- CHORD: as above, R at 4
- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? 

Wait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn't help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.

So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.

Hence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.

Now, among the options:

CHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.

CHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.

To gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.

Also, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.

But note: in the first word, we had 'C','R','A','N','E'. We now know A,N,E are absent.

Another idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)

This tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.

Or CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.

CHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.

Both seem okay.

But note: we must use only English words.

CHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.

Another option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.

CURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.

I think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.

But CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven't tested.

We should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.

Similarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it's wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.

We can try that.

Another common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.

So I'll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.

Introduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).

But CHIRP has R at position 4? Let's count: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: I
Position 4: R
Position 5: P

Yes.

We are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.

R is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.

Similarly for others.

Also note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.

So let's guess ""CHIRP"".

But we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.

CHIRP tests H,I,P.

Both are valid.

I can choose CHIRP.

Wait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn't have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.

But actually, at this stage, we are testing.

Perhaps a word with more vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

CHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.

If the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.

That might be good.

Similarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.

Also, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it's present, we'll know.

But in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.

I think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.

But CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.

Both are acceptable.

I'll pick CHOIR because it's another common starting word and tests O.

So guess: CHOIR

Let\'s count: \nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: P\n\nYes.\n\nWe are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.\n\nR is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CHIRP"".\n\nBut we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.\n\nCHIRP tests H,I,P.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI can choose CHIRP.\n\nWait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn\'t have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.\n\nBut actually, at this stage, we are testing.\n\nPerhaps a word with more vowels? We haven\'t tested O or U.\n\nCHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.\n\nThat might be good.\n\nSimilarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.\n\nAlso, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it\'s present, we\'ll know.\n\nBut in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.\n\nI think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.\n\nBut CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll pick CHOIR because it\'s another common starting word and tests O.\n\nSo guess: CHOIR\n\nFormat: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C is in the correct position (position 1).  \n- R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n- A, N, and E are not in the word.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  \n- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  \n- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  \n- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  \n- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  \n  - Starts with ""C"".  \n  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  \n  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  \n  - Avoids A, N, E.  \n\nThis guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>choir</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Meaning:
- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. So we must avoid these.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

We know the word has 5 letters, starts with C, contains R (in position 3 or 4), and does not contain A, N, E, H, O, I.

Now, we need to think of words that fit:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be a letter not in {A, N, E, H, O, I} and not R (because R is not in position 2). Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.
- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).
- Similarly for position 4 and 5.

Since R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.

But we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.

We also want to test new letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Note: U is still available (not tested yet). We haven't used U.

Common letters: S, T, L, U, etc.

We must include R in position 3 or 4.

Let's think of possible words:

Case 1: R in position 3.
Then the word is: C, ?, R, ?, ?
Where ? are letters from the available set, and not the absent ones.

Case 2: R in position 4.
Then: C, ?, ?, R, ?

We need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible and helps us narrow down.

Since we have many letters to avoid, the list of possible words might be limited.

Let me try to list some words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and avoid A,N,E,H,O,I.

First, R in position 3:

- CUR?Y: but we need 5 letters. CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) 
- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.

But we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven't tested U, L, Y.

But in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.

But we don't know yet.

Another word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.

But let's see if we can use it.

But we are going to guess now, so we can.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

CURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it's valid.

Similarly, CURRY? But double R? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don't have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don't know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.

CURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.

But we have many options.

Now, case with R in position 4:

Words: C, ?, ?, R, ?

For example: C??R? 

Like: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.

CUTER? E absent.

CYBER? E absent.

So avoid E.

What about: CULPR? Not a word.

CUTER is invalid.

Another: CUMAR? Not a word.

Perhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.

CUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.

Possible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.

For example: CUTER is out.

CATER? But A is absent.

Cider? But I is absent.

So hard.

Another: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.

5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.

CURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.

Perhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.

CRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.

So, R in position 4 might be harder.

Let me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.

Examples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.

CLERK? E absent.

CLASP? A absent.

So not many.

Perhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.

I think R in position 3 is more promising.

So let's focus on R in position 3.

Words: C?R??

With ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common: U, S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:

- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.
- CURFS? Not common.
- CURLY: as above.
- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y
- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)
- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S
- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S
- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)

Also, with other vowels? But we have U available.

We haven't tested U, so it's good to test U.

Similarly, we can test other consonants.

But we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.

In the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.

So for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.

Now, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.

But note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

If U is in the word, we'll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.

But we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.

But if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.

Recall the feedback rules:

- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -
- If the letter is not in the word: x

In this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.

If the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets '-'.

But if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as '-'.

For example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as '-'.

Similarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be '-'.

But in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 2.

In the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 5.

So if we put R at 3 in the next guess:

- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.
- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be '-' (because present but wrong position).
- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.

Similarly for position 4.

So in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.

Another word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.

But CURLY is a common word.

We could also test S or T.

But let's see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.

But we might be able to get it.

Another idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.

But we need to choose.

I think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.

If R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

If R is not at 3, we get R as '-' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

So either way, we get information.

Moreover, CURLY is a valid word.

So I'll go with CURLY.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.

So it's valid.

Therefore, guess: CURLY

But in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

So we are good.

We could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.

So I choose CURLY.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  
  - C is still correct in position 1.  
  - H, O, I are absent.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  
- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  

The word **CURLY** fits:  
- Starts with **C** (position 1).  
- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  
- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  
- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  

This guess will help confirm R's position and test new letters efficiently.

- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  
- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  

This guess will help confirm R's position and test new letters efficiently.",Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,curvy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, from this:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

Since the word starts with C, our next guess should start with C.

We know R is in the word, but not in the second position, so R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we must avoid letters A, N, E.

We have to guess a 5-letter word starting with C and containing R, and not containing A, N, E.

Possible letters: We can use other vowels (O, U, I) and consonants.

Common English words starting with C: think of words like CRUST, CRUMB, etc., but note we must avoid E and A, and R cannot be second.

Our first guess had R in second position, so now we must put R in a different position: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words starting with C and having R in position 3,4, or 5.

Options:
- Position 3: e.g., C_R?? (like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don't have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??
- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)
- Position 5: e.g., C???R

Also, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.

So, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses some of these.

One strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.

For example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??
Words: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don't know about S.

Alternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.

But let's check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)

Example: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.

Words with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.

Another: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.

Perhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.

Words: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.

Having difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.

Let me list possible words: 

- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? 

Possible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.

Example words: 
- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.

But note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.

In CHORD: R is at position 4.

Similarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.

That might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.

Similarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.

We also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.

A good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

C is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.

But is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.

In the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.

But also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.

Another option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.

Therefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.

Let me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.

Possible words:

- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4
- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5
- CHORD: as above, R at 4
- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? 

Wait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn't help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.

So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.

Hence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.

Now, among the options:

CHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.

CHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.

To gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.

Also, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.

But note: in the first word, we had 'C','R','A','N','E'. We now know A,N,E are absent.

Another idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)

This tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.

Or CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.

CHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.

Both seem okay.

But note: we must use only English words.

CHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.

Another option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.

CURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.

I think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.

But CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven't tested.

We should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.

Similarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it's wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.

We can try that.

Another common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.

So I'll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.

Introduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).

But CHIRP has R at position 4? Let's count: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: I
Position 4: R
Position 5: P

Yes.

We are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.

R is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.

Similarly for others.

Also note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.

So let's guess ""CHIRP"".

But we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.

CHIRP tests H,I,P.

Both are valid.

I can choose CHIRP.

Wait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn't have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.

But actually, at this stage, we are testing.

Perhaps a word with more vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

CHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.

If the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.

That might be good.

Similarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.

Also, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it's present, we'll know.

But in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.

I think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.

But CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.

Both are acceptable.

I'll pick CHOIR because it's another common starting word and tests O.

So guess: CHOIR

Format: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is in the correct position (position 1).  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A, N, and E are not in the word.  

For the next guess:  
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  
- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  
- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  
- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  
- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  
  - Starts with ""C"".  
  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  
  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  
  - Avoids A, N, E.  

This guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.

<guess>choir</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Meaning:
- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. So we must avoid these.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

We know the word has 5 letters, starts with C, contains R (in position 3 or 4), and does not contain A, N, E, H, O, I.

Now, we need to think of words that fit:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be a letter not in {A, N, E, H, O, I} and not R (because R is not in position 2). Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.
- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).
- Similarly for position 4 and 5.

Since R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.

But we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.

We also want to test new letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Note: U is still available (not tested yet). We haven't used U.

Common letters: S, T, L, U, etc.

We must include R in position 3 or 4.

Let's think of possible words:

Case 1: R in position 3.
Then the word is: C, ?, R, ?, ?
Where ? are letters from the available set, and not the absent ones.

Case 2: R in position 4.
Then: C, ?, ?, R, ?

We need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible and helps us narrow down.

Since we have many letters to avoid, the list of possible words might be limited.

Let me try to list some words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and avoid A,N,E,H,O,I.

First, R in position 3:

- CUR?Y: but we need 5 letters. CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) 
- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.

But we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven't tested U, L, Y.

But in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.

But we don't know yet.

Another word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.

But let's see if we can use it.

But we are going to guess now, so we can.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

CURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it's valid.

Similarly, CURRY? But double R? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don't have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don't know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.

CURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.

But we have many options.

Now, case with R in position 4:

Words: C, ?, ?, R, ?

For example: C??R? 

Like: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.

CUTER? E absent.

CYBER? E absent.

So avoid E.

What about: CULPR? Not a word.

CUTER is invalid.

Another: CUMAR? Not a word.

Perhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.

CUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.

Possible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.

For example: CUTER is out.

CATER? But A is absent.

Cider? But I is absent.

So hard.

Another: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.

5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.

CURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.

Perhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.

CRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.

So, R in position 4 might be harder.

Let me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.

Examples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.

CLERK? E absent.

CLASP? A absent.

So not many.

Perhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.

I think R in position 3 is more promising.

So let's focus on R in position 3.

Words: C?R??

With ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common: U, S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:

- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.
- CURFS? Not common.
- CURLY: as above.
- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y
- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)
- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S
- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S
- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)

Also, with other vowels? But we have U available.

We haven't tested U, so it's good to test U.

Similarly, we can test other consonants.

But we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.

In the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.

So for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.

Now, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.

But note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

If U is in the word, we'll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.

But we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.

But if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.

Recall the feedback rules:

- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -
- If the letter is not in the word: x

In this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.

If the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets '-'.

But if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as '-'.

For example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as '-'.

Similarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be '-'.

But in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 2.

In the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 5.

So if we put R at 3 in the next guess:

- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.
- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be '-' (because present but wrong position).
- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.

Similarly for position 4.

So in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.

Another word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.

But CURLY is a common word.

We could also test S or T.

But let's see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.

But we might be able to get it.

Another idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.

But we need to choose.

I think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.

If R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

If R is not at 3, we get R as '-' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

So either way, we get information.

Moreover, CURLY is a valid word.

So I'll go with CURLY.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.

So it's valid.

Therefore, guess: CURLY

But in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

So we are good.

We could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.

So I choose CURLY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  
  - C is still correct in position 1.  
  - H, O, I are absent.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  
- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  

The word **CURLY** fits:  
- Starts with **C** (position 1).  
- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  
- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  
- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  

This guess will help confirm R's position and test new letters efficiently.

(like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don\'t have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??\n- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)\n- Position 5: e.g., C???R\n\nAlso, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSo, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try a word that uses some of these.\n\nOne strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.\n\nFor example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??\nWords: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don\'t know about S.\n\nAlternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.\n\nBut let\'s check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)\n\nExample: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.\n\nWords with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.\n\nAnother: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.\n\nPerhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.\n\nWords: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.\n\nHaving difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.\n\nLet me list possible words: \n\n- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? \n\nPossible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.\n\nExample words: \n- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.\n\nBut note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.\n\nIn CHORD: R is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.\n\nCURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.\n\nThat might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.\n\nSimilarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don\'t know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.\n\nWe also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.\n\nA good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nC is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.\n\nBut is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.\n\nIn the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.\n\nBut also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.\n\nAnother option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.\n\nLet me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)\n- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4\n- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5\n- CHORD: as above, R at 4\n- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? \n\nWait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn\'t help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.\n\nSo we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.\n\nHence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nNow, among the options:\n\nCHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.\n\nCHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.\n\nCURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.\n\nTo gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.\n\nAlso, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.\n\nBut note: in the first word, we had \'C\',\'R\',\'A\',\'N\',\'E\'. We now know A,N,E are absent.\n\nAnother idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)\n\nThis tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.\n\nOr CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.\n\nCHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.\n\nBoth seem okay.\n\nBut note: we must use only English words.\n\nCHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.\n\nAnother option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.\n\nCURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don\'t know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.\n\nI think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.\n\nBut CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.\n\nSimilarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it\'s wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.\n\nWe can try that.\n\nAnother common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.\n\nIntroduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).\n\nBut CHIRP has R at position 4? Let\'s count: \nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: P\n\nYes.\n\nWe are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.\n\nR is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CHIRP"".\n\nBut we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.\n\nCHIRP tests H,I,P.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI can choose CHIRP.\n\nWait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn\'t have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.\n\nBut actually, at this stage, we are testing.\n\nPerhaps a word with more vowels? We haven\'t tested O or U.\n\nCHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.\n\nThat might be good.\n\nSimilarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.\n\nAlso, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it\'s present, we\'ll know.\n\nBut in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.\n\nI think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.\n\nBut CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll pick CHOIR because it\'s another common starting word and tests O.\n\nSo guess: CHOIR\n\nFormat: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C is in the correct position (position 1).  \n- R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n- A, N, and E are not in the word.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  \n- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  \n- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  \n- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  \n- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  \n  - Starts with ""C"".  \n  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  \n  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  \n  - Avoids A, N, E.  \n\nThis guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>choir</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C is correct and in position 1.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nMeaning:\n- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).\n- H is not in the word (x).\n- O is not in the word (x).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it\'s marked as wrong position, meaning it\'s present but not at the end).\n\nSo, combining the feedback:\n\n- The secret word starts with C.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.\n- Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. So we must avoid these.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters, starts with C, contains R (in position 3 or 4), and does not contain A, N, E, H, O, I.\n\nNow, we need to think of words that fit:\n\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- Position 2: must be a letter not in {A, N, E, H, O, I} and not R (because R is not in position 2). Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.\n- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).\n- Similarly for position 4 and 5.\n\nSince R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNote: U is still available (not tested yet). We haven\'t used U.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, U, etc.\n\nWe must include R in position 3 or 4.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nCase 1: R in position 3.\nThen the word is: C, ?, R, ?, ?\nWhere ? are letters from the available set, and not the absent ones.\n\nCase 2: R in position 4.\nThen: C, ?, ?, R, ?\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible and helps us narrow down.\n\nSince we have many letters to avoid, the list of possible words might be limited.\n\nLet me try to list some words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and avoid A,N,E,H,O,I.\n\nFirst, R in position 3:\n\n- CUR?Y: but we need 5 letters. CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) \n- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.\n\nBut we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven\'t tested U, L, Y.\n\nBut in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know yet.\n\nAnother word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can use it.\n\nBut we are going to guess now, so we can.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nCURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, CURRY? But double R? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don\'t have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don\'t know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.\n\nCURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.\n\nBut we have many options.\n\nNow, case with R in position 4:\n\nWords: C, ?, ?, R, ?\n\nFor example: C??R? \n\nLike: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.\n\nCUTER? E absent.\n\nCYBER? E absent.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nWhat about: CULPR? Not a word.\n\nCUTER is invalid.\n\nAnother: CUMAR? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.\n\nCUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.\n\nPossible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.\n\nFor example: CUTER is out.\n\nCATER? But A is absent.\n\nCider? But I is absent.\n\nSo hard.\n\nAnother: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.\n\n5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.\n\nCURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.\n\nPerhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.\n\nCRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.\n\nSo, R in position 4 might be harder.\n\nLet me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.\n\nExamples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.\n\nCLERK? E absent.\n\nCLASP? A absent.\n\nSo not many.\n\nPerhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.\n\nI think R in position 3 is more promising.\n\nSo let\'s focus on R in position 3.\n\nWords: C?R??\n\nWith ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon: U, S, T, L, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.\n- CURFS? Not common.\n- CURLY: as above.\n- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y\n- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)\n- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S\n- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S\n- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)\n\nAlso, with other vowels? But we have U available.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U, so it\'s good to test U.\n\nSimilarly, we can test other consonants.\n\nBut we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.\n\nIn the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.\n\nSo for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.\n\nNow, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.\n\nBut note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf U is in the word, we\'ll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.\n\nBut we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.\n\nBut if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.\n\nRecall the feedback rules:\n\n- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -\n- If the letter is not in the word: x\n\nIn this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.\n\nIf the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets \'-\'.\n\nBut if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as \'-\'.\n\nFor example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be \'-\'.\n\nBut in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was \'-\', meaning R is present but not at 2.\n\nIn the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was \'-\', meaning R is present but not at 5.\n\nSo if we put R at 3 in the next guess:\n\n- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.\n- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be \'-\' (because present but wrong position).\n- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.\n\nSimilarly for position 4.\n\nSo in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R\'s position.\n\nSimilarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nNow, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.\n\nAnother word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.\n\nBut CURLY is a common word.\n\nWe could also test S or T.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.\n\nBut we might be able to get it.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.\n\nBut we need to choose.\n\nI think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.\n\nIf R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.\n\nIf R is not at 3, we get R as \'-\' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.\n\nSo either way, we get information.\n\nMoreover, CURLY is a valid word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with CURLY.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nAbsent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, guess: CURLY\n\nBut in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nWe could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.\n\nSo I choose CURLY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - A, N, E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  \n  - C is still correct in position 1.  \n  - H, O, I are absent.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  \n- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  \n- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  \n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  \n\nThe word **CURLY** fits:  \n- Starts with **C** (position 1).  \n- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  \n- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  \n- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  \n\nThis guess will help confirm R\'s position and test new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>curly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nGuess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>

- R is correct and in position 3 (so R is fixed at position 3).
- L is not in the word (x).
- Y is correct and in position 5 (new information).

So, from this:
- The secret word has positions: 
  - 1: C
  - 2: U
  - 3: R
  - 5: Y
- And position 4 is missing, but we know L is not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that A, N, E, H, O, I are absent.

Now, the secret word is of the form: C U R _ Y

We need to find a letter for the 4th position that is not in the absent list and not L.

Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I, L (from this guess, L is absent).

So absent: A, E, H, I, L, N, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word: C U R ? Y

The ? must be one of the available letters, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:

- CURDY? C U R D Y -> but is CURDY a word? It means resembling curd, and it is accepted in some dictionaries. But let's check.
- CURFY? Not common.
- CURVY? C U R V Y -> meaning curved or attractive. Yes, common word.
- CURLY? But we just guessed that, and L is absent, so not.
- CURRY? But R is repeated? And we have R at 3, and if we put R at 4, but we know from feedback that in the first guess R was not at 2, and in second not at 5, but we now have R at 3 correct. But CURRY has R at 3 and 4? But in CURRY, position 4 is R. But we have position 4 missing, and we know L is absent, but R is already in the word? We don't know if the word has two R's. But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", R was present (but wrong position) and we had only one R. Similarly, ""choir"" had one R and it was present. ""curly"" had one R and it was correct. So it's possible that the word has only one R, or multiple? But we haven't tested.

But in this case, for CURRY, if we put R at position 4, but we already have R at position 3, and if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 4 would be incorrect? But the secret word has R at 3, so if we put R at 4, it might be marked as absent if there's no second R? Or if there is a second R, it might be marked as present.

But we don't know. However, in our pattern, we have C U R _ Y, so the fourth letter is not R in the secret word? Not necessarily, it could be R.

But let's see possible words:

Common words: CURVY, CURDY, CURRY, etc.

But we need to see which are valid.

CURVY: adjective, meaning having curves or voluptuous. It's a common word.

CURDY: less common, but might be accepted.

CURRY: a spice or dish, very common.

But in CURRY, the letters are C,U,R,R,Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y.

But in our feedback from ""curly"", we have position 2: U(✓) and position 3: R(✓), and position 5: Y(✓). So if the secret word is CURRY, then position 4 would be R.

But we have L absent, which is fine.

However, in the first guess ""crane"", we had R in the word (marked as present but wrong position). In ""crane"", R was at position 2, and the secret word has R at position 3 and 4? Then when we put R at position 2 in ""crane"", it should have been marked as present (since R is in the word) but wrong position, which it was. Similarly, in ""choir"", we put R at position 5, which is wrong, so marked as present but wrong position. In ""curly"", we put R at 3 and it was correct.

But if the secret word is CURRY, then it has two R's. So when we guessed ""crane"", which had one R at position 2, the feedback would show that R is present (because there is at least one R) but not at position 2. Similarly for ""choir"", one R at 5, present but not at 5. And in ""curly"", one R at 3, correct.

So it doesn't tell us if there is a second R.

Therefore, CURRY is a possibility.

Similarly, CURVY is a possibility with one R.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses an available letter for position 4.

But we have only one position to determine, so we can guess CURVY or CURRY or CURDY, etc.

But we have to make a guess.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we might need to choose one.

But note: we have only a few letters left to test.

Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.

But not all form valid words.

Common words:

- CURVY (V)
- CURDY (D)
- CURRY (R) - but R is already used, but it might be allowed if the word has two R's.

But R is not in the absent list, so it can be used again? But in the pattern, we are putting a letter at position 4, and R is a candidate.

But we don't know if it's in the word or not.

To be safe, we can guess CURVY, which is a common word.

If it's not CURVY, then we can try others.

But we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess.

We can also think: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" with R at 2, and it was present. If the secret word has two R's, then when we put one R, it should be marked present. But we don't have information about the count.

Similarly, in ""curly"", we had one R and it was correct, but that doesn't tell about a second R.

So we must consider both.

But let's list all possible words that fit C U R _ Y and are English words:

- CURDY (with D)
- CURFY (rare)
- CURVY (with V)
- CURRY (with R)
- CURLY (but L is absent, so not)
- CURPY? Not a word.
- CURY? Not 5 letters.

So the main candidates are CURDY, CURVY, CURRY.

CURRY is very common, CURVY is common, CURDY is less common.

We can also check CURBY? Not common.

CURNY? Not a word.

So probably CURRY or CURVY.

Now, to decide: we can guess CURVY because it uses a new letter V, which we haven't tested, and if it's not the word, we get information about V.

But if we guess CURVY and it's wrong, we know V is not in the word, and then we can guess CURRY next.

Similarly, if we guess CURRY, and it's correct, we win. If not, then we know there is no second R? But if we guess CURRY and the secret word is CURVY, then the feedback for position 4 would be: if we put R and the secret has V, then R would be marked as absent (if there's no other R) or present if there is, but we know there is one R at 3.

In CURRY guess: positions: 1:C(✓), 2:U(✓), 3:R(✓), 4:R, 5:Y(✓)

If the secret word is CURVY, then:
- Position 4: we put R, but secret has V. Since there is only one R in the secret (at position 3), and we put R at 4, which is not present elsewhere, so R at 4 would be marked as absent (x). But we also have the R at position 3, which is correct.

But the feedback for the R at position 4: since the secret has only one R and it's at 3, the R at 4 is not in the word? Or is it? The secret has one R, so if we put an extra R, it should be marked as absent? But in Wordle, if the letter is not in the word, it's x, even if it's repeated.

But in this case, the secret has one R, and we put two R's: one at 3 (correct) and one at 4. The R at 3 is correct, so it gets ✓. The R at 4: since there is no second R, it should be marked as absent (x).

Similarly, in the secret CURVY, the V is not tested in this guess.

But if we guess CURVY and the secret is CURRY, then:
- Position 4: we put V, but secret has R. Since there is no V in the secret, V would be marked absent (x). And the R at 3 is correct, and Y at 5 correct.

So in either case, we get one letter wrong.

But we can use this to our advantage.

Since we have only one position left, we can guess one of them.

But note: we have only 3 possibilities: CURDY, CURVY, CURRY. But CURDY is less common, so maybe not.

CURDY might not be in the word list.

So between CURVY and CURRY.

I think CURRY is more common, so perhaps guess that.

But let's see the feedback.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had ""crane"" with R at 2, and it was present. If the secret word has two R's, then it would have been present regardless. But we don't know.

Another idea: we have not tested the letter S, T, etc. But in this pattern, we are filling the last position.

Perhaps we should guess CURRY because it's a common word.

But to be safe, let's guess CURVY to test V.

But I think we can guess CURRY.

But note: in the third guess, we guessed ""curly"" and got C,U,R,Y correct, and L absent. So the secret word is C U R ? Y.

If we guess CURRY, and it is correct, we win.

If not, then we know the fourth letter is not R, and we can try another.

But we have two more guesses after this.

So I'll guess CURRY.

But let's confirm: CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y.

Position 4 is R.

So guess: CURRY

But in the output, we need to put it in <guess> tags.

But we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn't.

So I think it's fine.

Alternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.

But since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I'll go with that.

But let's see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.

If it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.

But we have only one position, so we can try.

I think it's acceptable.

- U is correct and in position 2 (new information).
- R is correct and in position 3 (so R is fixed at position 3).

- And position 4 is missing, but we know L is not in the word.

We need to find a letter for the 4th position that is not in the absent list and not L.

Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I, L (from this guess, L is absent).

But in our feedback from ""curly"", we have position 2: U(✓) and position 3: R(✓), and position 5: Y(✓). So if the secret word is CURRY, then position 4 would be R.

If it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.

But we have only one position, so we can try.

I think it's acceptable.

So guess: CURRY
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): A, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: choir**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - H(x), O(x), I(x): H, O, I are absent.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 3: curly**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - U(✓): Correct and in position 2.  
  - R(✓): Correct and in position 3.  
  - L(x): L is absent.  
  - Y(✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:  
  - Position 1: **C**  
  - Position 2: **U**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- Only position 4 is unknown.  
- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  
- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  
- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  

### Possible Words:
Common words fitting the pattern:  
- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  
- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  
- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  

### Strategy:
- **CURRY** is a strong candidate because:  
  - It is a very common word.  
  - It tests the possibility of a double R (if the secret word has two R's, position 4 could be R).  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if R can appear again (e.g., if position 4 is marked ""x"", R is not repeated) and narrow options to **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess.  
- Given only one position is unknown, this guess could solve the puzzle immediately if correct.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, from this:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

Since the word starts with C, our next guess should start with C.

We know R is in the word, but not in the second position, so R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we must avoid letters A, N, E.

We have to guess a 5-letter word starting with C and containing R, and not containing A, N, E.

Possible letters: We can use other vowels (O, U, I) and consonants.

Common English words starting with C: think of words like CRUST, CRUMB, etc., but note we must avoid E and A, and R cannot be second.

Our first guess had R in second position, so now we must put R in a different position: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words starting with C and having R in position 3,4, or 5.

Options:
- Position 3: e.g., C_R?? (like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don't have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??
- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)
- Position 5: e.g., C???R

Also, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.

So, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses some of these.

One strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.

For example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??
Words: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don't know about S.

Alternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.

But let's check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)

Example: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.

Words with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.

Another: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.

Perhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.

Words: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.

Having difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.

Let me list possible words: 

- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? 

Possible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.

Example words: 
- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.

But note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.

In CHORD: R is at position 4.

Similarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.

That might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.

Similarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.

We also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.

A good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

C is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.

But is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.

In the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.

But also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.

Another option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.

Therefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.

Let me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.

Possible words:

- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4
- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5
- CHORD: as above, R at 4
- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? 

Wait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn't help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.

So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.

Hence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.

Now, among the options:

CHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.

CHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.

To gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.

Also, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.

But note: in the first word, we had 'C','R','A','N','E'. We now know A,N,E are absent.

Another idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)

This tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.

Or CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.

CHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.

Both seem okay.

But note: we must use only English words.

CHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.

Another option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.

CURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.

I think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.

But CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven't tested.

We should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.

Similarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it's wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.

We can try that.

Another common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.

So I'll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.

Introduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).

But CHIRP has R at position 4? Let's count: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: I
Position 4: R
Position 5: P

Yes.

We are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.

R is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.

Similarly for others.

Also note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.

So let's guess ""CHIRP"".

But we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.

CHIRP tests H,I,P.

Both are valid.

I can choose CHIRP.

Wait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn't have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.

But actually, at this stage, we are testing.

Perhaps a word with more vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

CHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.

If the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.

That might be good.

Similarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.

Also, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it's present, we'll know.

But in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.

I think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.

But CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.

Both are acceptable.

I'll pick CHOIR because it's another common starting word and tests O.

So guess: CHOIR

Format: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is in the correct position (position 1).  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A, N, and E are not in the word.  

For the next guess:  
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  
- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  
- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  
- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  
- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  
  - Starts with ""C"".  
  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  
  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  
  - Avoids A, N, E.  

This guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.

<guess>choir</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Meaning:
- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. So we must avoid these.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

We know the word has 5 letters, starts with C, contains R (in position 3 or 4), and does not contain A, N, E, H, O, I.

Now, we need to think of words that fit:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be a letter not in {A, N, E, H, O, I} and not R (because R is not in position 2). Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.
- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).
- Similarly for position 4 and 5.

Since R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.

But we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.

We also want to test new letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Note: U is still available (not tested yet). We haven't used U.

Common letters: S, T, L, U, etc.

We must include R in position 3 or 4.

Let's think of possible words:

Case 1: R in position 3.
Then the word is: C, ?, R, ?, ?
Where ? are letters from the available set, and not the absent ones.

Case 2: R in position 4.
Then: C, ?, ?, R, ?

We need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible and helps us narrow down.

Since we have many letters to avoid, the list of possible words might be limited.

Let me try to list some words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and avoid A,N,E,H,O,I.

First, R in position 3:

- CUR?Y: but we need 5 letters. CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) 
- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.

But we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven't tested U, L, Y.

But in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.

But we don't know yet.

Another word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.

But let's see if we can use it.

But we are going to guess now, so we can.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

CURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it's valid.

Similarly, CURRY? But double R? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don't have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don't know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.

CURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.

But we have many options.

Now, case with R in position 4:

Words: C, ?, ?, R, ?

For example: C??R? 

Like: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.

CUTER? E absent.

CYBER? E absent.

So avoid E.

What about: CULPR? Not a word.

CUTER is invalid.

Another: CUMAR? Not a word.

Perhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.

CUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.

Possible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.

For example: CUTER is out.

CATER? But A is absent.

Cider? But I is absent.

So hard.

Another: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.

5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.

CURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.

Perhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.

CRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.

So, R in position 4 might be harder.

Let me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.

Examples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.

CLERK? E absent.

CLASP? A absent.

So not many.

Perhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.

I think R in position 3 is more promising.

So let's focus on R in position 3.

Words: C?R??

With ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common: U, S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:

- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.
- CURFS? Not common.
- CURLY: as above.
- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y
- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)
- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S
- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S
- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)

Also, with other vowels? But we have U available.

We haven't tested U, so it's good to test U.

Similarly, we can test other consonants.

But we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.

In the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.

So for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.

Now, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.

But note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

If U is in the word, we'll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.

But we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.

But if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.

Recall the feedback rules:

- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -
- If the letter is not in the word: x

In this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.

If the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets '-'.

But if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as '-'.

For example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as '-'.

Similarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be '-'.

But in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 2.

In the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 5.

So if we put R at 3 in the next guess:

- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.
- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be '-' (because present but wrong position).
- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.

Similarly for position 4.

So in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.

Another word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.

But CURLY is a common word.

We could also test S or T.

But let's see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.

But we might be able to get it.

Another idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.

But we need to choose.

I think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.

If R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

If R is not at 3, we get R as '-' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

So either way, we get information.

Moreover, CURLY is a valid word.

So I'll go with CURLY.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.

So it's valid.

Therefore, guess: CURLY

But in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

So we are good.

We could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.

So I choose CURLY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  
  - C is still correct in position 1.  
  - H, O, I are absent.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  
- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  

The word **CURLY** fits:  
- Starts with **C** (position 1).  
- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  
- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  
- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  

This guess will help confirm R's position and test new letters efficiently.

<｜Assistant｜>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): A, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: choir**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - H(x), O(x), I(x): H, O, I are absent.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 3: curly**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - U(✓): Correct and in position 2.  
  - R(✓): Correct and in position 3.  
  - L(x): L is absent.  
  - Y(✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:  
  - Position 1: **C**  
  - Position 2: **U**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- Only position 4 is unknown.  
- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  
- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  
- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  

### Possible Words:
Common words fitting the pattern:  
- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  
- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  
- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  

### Strategy:
- **CURRY** is a strong candidate because:  
  - It is a very common word.  
  - It tests the possibility of a double R (if the secret word has two R's, position 4 could be R).  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if R can appear again (e.g., if position 4 is marked ""x"", R is not repeated) and narrow options to **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess.  
- Given only one position is unknown, this guess could solve the puzzle immediately if correct.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

Guess 4: tags.

But we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn't.

So I think it's fine.

Alternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.

But since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I'll go with that.

But let's see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.

If it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.

But we have only one position, so we can try.

I think it's acceptable.

So guess: CURRY

(like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don\'t have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??\n- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)\n- Position 5: e.g., C???R\n\nAlso, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSo, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try a word that uses some of these.\n\nOne strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.\n\nFor example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??\nWords: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don\'t know about S.\n\nAlternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.\n\nBut let\'s check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)\n\nExample: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.\n\nWords with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.\n\nAnother: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.\n\nPerhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.\n\nWords: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.\n\nHaving difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.\n\nLet me list possible words: \n\n- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? \n\nPossible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.\n\nExample words: \n- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.\n\nBut note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.\n\nIn CHORD: R is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.\n\nCURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.\n\nThat might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.\n\nSimilarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don\'t know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.\n\nWe also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.\n\nA good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nC is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.\n\nBut is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.\n\nIn the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.\n\nBut also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.\n\nAnother option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.\n\nLet me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)\n- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4\n- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5\n- CHORD: as above, R at 4\n- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? \n\nWait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn\'t help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.\n\nSo we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.\n\nHence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nNow, among the options:\n\nCHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.\n\nCHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.\n\nCURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.\n\nTo gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.\n\nAlso, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.\n\nBut note: in the first word, we had \'C\',\'R\',\'A\',\'N\',\'E\'. We now know A,N,E are absent.\n\nAnother idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)\n\nThis tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.\n\nOr CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.\n\nCHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.\n\nBoth seem okay.\n\nBut note: we must use only English words.\n\nCHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.\n\nAnother option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.\n\nCURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don\'t know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.\n\nI think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.\n\nBut CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.\n\nSimilarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it\'s wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.\n\nWe can try that.\n\nAnother common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.\n\nIntroduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).\n\nBut CHIRP has R at position 4? Let\'s count: \nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: P\n\nYes.\n\nWe are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.\n\nR is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CHIRP"".\n\nBut we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.\n\nCHIRP tests H,I,P.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI can choose CHIRP.\n\nWait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn\'t have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.\n\nBut actually, at this stage, we are testing.\n\nPerhaps a word with more vowels? We haven\'t tested O or U.\n\nCHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.\n\nThat might be good.\n\nSimilarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.\n\nAlso, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it\'s present, we\'ll know.\n\nBut in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.\n\nI think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.\n\nBut CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll pick CHOIR because it\'s another common starting word and tests O.\n\nSo guess: CHOIR\n\nFormat: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C is in the correct position (position 1).  \n- R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n- A, N, and E are not in the word.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  \n- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  \n- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  \n- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  \n- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  \n  - Starts with ""C"".  \n  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  \n  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  \n  - Avoids A, N, E.  \n\nThis guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>choir</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C is correct and in position 1.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nMeaning:\n- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).\n- H is not in the word (x).\n- O is not in the word (x).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it\'s marked as wrong position, meaning it\'s present but not at the end).\n\nSo, combining the feedback:\n\n- The secret word starts with C.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess).

Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.\n- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).\n- Similarly for position 4 and 5.\n\nSince R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNote: U is still available (not tested yet).

CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) \n- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.\n\nBut we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven\'t tested U, L, Y.\n\nBut in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know yet.\n\nAnother word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can use it.\n\nBut we are going to guess now, so we can.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nCURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, CURRY? But double R? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don\'t have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don\'t know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.\n\nCURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.\n\nBut we have many options.\n\nNow, case with R in position 4:\n\nWords: C, ?, ?, R, ?\n\nFor example: C??R? \n\nLike: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.\n\nCUTER? E absent.\n\nCYBER? E absent.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nWhat about: CULPR? Not a word.\n\nCUTER is invalid.\n\nAnother: CUMAR? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.\n\nCUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.\n\nPossible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.\n\nFor example: CUTER is out.\n\nCATER? But A is absent.\n\nCider? But I is absent.\n\nSo hard.\n\nAnother: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.\n\n5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.\n\nCURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.\n\nPerhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.\n\nCRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.\n\nSo, R in position 4 might be harder.\n\nLet me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.\n\nExamples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.\n\nCLERK? E absent.\n\nCLASP? A absent.\n\nSo not many.\n\nPerhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.\n\nI think R in position 3 is more promising.\n\nSo let\'s focus on R in position 3.\n\nWords: C?R??\n\nWith ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon: U, S, T, L, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.\n- CURFS? Not common.\n- CURLY: as above.\n- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y\n- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)\n- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S\n- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S\n- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)\n\nAlso, with other vowels? But we have U available.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U, so it\'s good to test U.\n\nSimilarly, we can test other consonants.\n\nBut we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.\n\nIn the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.\n\nSo for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.\n\nNow, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.\n\nBut note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf U is in the word, we\'ll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.\n\nBut we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.\n\nBut if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.\n\nRecall the feedback rules:\n\n- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -\n- If the letter is not in the word: x\n\nIn this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.\n\nIf the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets \'-\'.\n\nBut if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as \'-\'.\n\nFor example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be \'-\'.\n\nBut in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was \'-\', meaning R is present but not at 2.\n\nIn the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was \'-\', meaning R is present but not at 5.\n\nSo if we put R at 3 in the next guess:\n\n- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.\n- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be \'-\' (because present but wrong position).\n- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.\n\nSimilarly for position 4.\n\nSo in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R\'s position.\n\nSimilarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nNow, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.\n\nAnother word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.\n\nBut CURLY is a common word.\n\nWe could also test S or T.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.\n\nBut we might be able to get it.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.\n\nBut we need to choose.\n\nI think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.\n\nIf R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.\n\nIf R is not at 3, we get R as \'-\' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.\n\nSo either way, we get information.\n\nMoreover, CURLY is a valid word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with CURLY.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nAbsent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, guess: CURLY\n\nBut in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nWe could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.\n\nSo I choose CURLY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - A, N, E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  \n  - C is still correct in position 1.  \n  - H, O, I are absent.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  \n- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  \n- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  \n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  \n\nThe word **CURLY** fits:  \n- Starts with **C** (position 1).  \n- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  \n- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  \n- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  \n\nThis guess will help confirm R\'s position and test new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>curly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nGuess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess: curly -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).\n- U is correct and in position 2 (new information).\n- R is correct and in position 3 (so R is fixed at position 3).\n- L is not in the word (x).\n- Y is correct and in position 5 (new information).\n\nSo, from this:\n- The secret word has positions: \n  - 1: C\n  - 2: U\n  - 3: R\n  - 5: Y\n- And position 4 is missing, but we know L is not in the word.\n\nAlso, from previous feedback, we know that A, N, E, H, O, I are absent.\n\nNow, the secret word is of the form: C U R _ Y\n\nWe need to find a letter for the 4th position that is not in the absent list and not L.\n\nAbsent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I, L (from this guess, L is absent).\n\nSo absent: A, E, H, I, L, N, O.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word: C U R ? Y\n\nThe ? must be one of the available letters, and the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURDY? C U R D Y -> but is CURDY a word? It means resembling curd, and it is accepted in some dictionaries. But let\'s check.\n- CURFY? Not common.\n- CURVY? C U R V Y -> meaning curved or attractive. Yes, common word.\n- CURLY? But we just guessed that, and L is absent, so not.\n- CURRY? But R is repeated? And we have R at 3, and if we put R at 4, but we know from feedback that in the first guess R was not at 2, and in second not at 5, but we now have R at 3 correct. But CURRY has R at 3 and 4? But in CURRY, position 4 is R. But we have position 4 missing, and we know L is absent, but R is already in the word? We don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", R was present (but wrong position) and we had only one R. Similarly, ""choir"" had one R and it was present. ""curly"" had one R and it was correct. So it\'s possible that the word has only one R, or multiple? But we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut in this case, for CURRY, if we put R at position 4, but we already have R at position 3, and if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 4 would be incorrect? But the secret word has R at 3, so if we put R at 4, it might be marked as absent if there\'s no second R? Or if there is a second R, it might be marked as present.\n\nBut we don\'t know. However, in our pattern, we have C U R _ Y, so the fourth letter is not R in the secret word? Not necessarily, it could be R.\n\nBut let\'s see possible words:\n\nCommon words: CURVY, CURDY, CURRY, etc.\n\nBut we need to see which are valid.\n\nCURVY: adjective, meaning having curves or voluptuous. It\'s a common word.\n\nCURDY: less common, but might be accepted.\n\nCURRY: a spice or dish, very common.\n\nBut in CURRY, the letters are C,U,R,R,Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y.\n\nBut in our feedback from ""curly"", we have position 2: U(✓) and position 3: R(✓), and position 5: Y(✓). So if the secret word is CURRY, then position 4 would be R.\n\nBut we have L absent, which is fine.\n\nHowever, in the first guess ""crane"", we had R in the word (marked as present but wrong position). In ""crane"", R was at position 2, and the secret word has R at position 3 and 4? Then when we put R at position 2 in ""crane"", it should have been marked as present (since R is in the word) but wrong position, which it was. Similarly, in ""choir"", we put R at position 5, which is wrong, so marked as present but wrong position. In ""curly"", we put R at 3 and it was correct.\n\nBut if the secret word is CURRY, then it has two R\'s. So when we guessed ""crane"", which had one R at position 2, the feedback would show that R is present (because there is at least one R) but not at position 2. Similarly for ""choir"", one R at 5, present but not at 5. And in ""curly"", one R at 3, correct.\n\nSo it doesn\'t tell us if there is a second R.\n\nTherefore, CURRY is a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, CURVY is a possibility with one R.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses an available letter for position 4.\n\nBut we have only one position to determine, so we can guess CURVY or CURRY or CURDY, etc.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nSince we have multiple possibilities, we might need to choose one.\n\nBut note: we have only a few letters left to test.\n\nAvailable letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut not all form valid words.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- CURVY (V)\n- CURDY (D)\n- CURRY (R) - but R is already used, but it might be allowed if the word has two R\'s.\n\nBut R is not in the absent list, so it can be used again? But in the pattern, we are putting a letter at position 4, and R is a candidate.\n\nBut we don\'t know if it\'s in the word or not.\n\nTo be safe, we can guess CURVY, which is a common word.\n\nIf it\'s not CURVY, then we can try others.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess.\n\nWe can also think: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" with R at 2, and it was present. If the secret word has two R\'s, then when we put one R, it should be marked present. But we don\'t have information about the count.\n\nSimilarly, in ""curly"", we had one R and it was correct, but that doesn\'t tell about a second R.\n\nSo we must consider both.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit C U R _ Y and are English words:\n\n- CURDY (with D)\n- CURFY (rare)\n- CURVY (with V)\n- CURRY (with R)\n- CURLY (but L is absent, so not)\n- CURPY? Not a word.\n- CURY? Not 5 letters.\n\nSo the main candidates are CURDY, CURVY, CURRY.\n\nCURRY is very common, CURVY is common, CURDY is less common.\n\nWe can also check CURBY? Not common.\n\nCURNY? Not a word.\n\nSo probably CURRY or CURVY.\n\nNow, to decide: we can guess CURVY because it uses a new letter V, which we haven\'t tested, and if it\'s not the word, we get information about V.\n\nBut if we guess CURVY and it\'s wrong, we know V is not in the word, and then we can guess CURRY next.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess CURRY, and it\'s correct, we win. If not, then we know there is no second R? But if we guess CURRY and the secret word is CURVY, then the feedback for position 4 would be: if we put R and the secret has V, then R would be marked as absent (if there\'s no other R) or present if there is, but we know there is one R at 3.\n\nIn CURRY guess: positions: 1:C(✓), 2:U(✓), 3:R(✓), 4:R, 5:Y(✓)\n\nIf the secret word is CURVY, then:\n- Position 4: we put R, but secret has V. Since there is only one R in the secret (at position 3), and we put R at 4, which is not present elsewhere, so R at 4 would be marked as absent (x). But we also have the R at position 3, which is correct.\n\nBut the feedback for the R at position 4: since the secret has only one R and it\'s at 3, the R at 4 is not in the word? Or is it? The secret has one R, so if we put an extra R, it should be marked as absent? But in Wordle, if the letter is not in the word, it\'s x, even if it\'s repeated.\n\nBut in this case, the secret has one R, and we put two R\'s: one at 3 (correct) and one at 4. The R at 3 is correct, so it gets ✓. The R at 4: since there is no second R, it should be marked as absent (x).\n\nSimilarly, in the secret CURVY, the V is not tested in this guess.\n\nBut if we guess CURVY and the secret is CURRY, then:\n- Position 4: we put V, but secret has R. Since there is no V in the secret, V would be marked absent (x). And the R at 3 is correct, and Y at 5 correct.\n\nSo in either case, we get one letter wrong.\n\nBut we can use this to our advantage.\n\nSince we have only one position left, we can guess one of them.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 possibilities: CURDY, CURVY, CURRY. But CURDY is less common, so maybe not.\n\nCURDY might not be in the word list.\n\nSo between CURVY and CURRY.\n\nI think CURRY is more common, so perhaps guess that.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had ""crane"" with R at 2, and it was present. If the secret word has two R\'s, then it would have been present regardless. But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: we have not tested the letter S, T, etc. But in this pattern, we are filling the last position.\n\nPerhaps we should guess CURRY because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s guess CURVY to test V.\n\nBut I think we can guess CURRY.\n\nBut note: in the third guess, we guessed ""curly"" and got C,U,R,Y correct, and L absent. So the secret word is C U R ? Y.\n\nIf we guess CURRY, and it is correct, we win.\n\nIf not, then we know the fourth letter is not R, and we can try another.\n\nBut we have two more guesses after this.\n\nSo I\'ll guess CURRY.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y.\n\nPosition 4 is R.\n\nSo guess: CURRY\n\nBut in the output, we need to put it in <guess> tags.\n\nBut we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn\'t.\n\nSo I think it\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.\n\nBut since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.\n\nIf it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.\n\nBut we have only one position, so we can try.\n\nI think it\'s acceptable.\n\nSo guess: CURRY### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - A(x), N(x), E(x): A, N, E are absent.  \n- **Guess 2: choir**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - H(x), O(x), I(x): H, O, I are absent.  \n  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.  \n- **Guess 3: curly**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - U(✓): Correct and in position 2.  \n  - R(✓): Correct and in position 3.  \n  - L(x): L is absent.  \n  - Y(✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the following fixed positions:  \n  - Position 1: **C**  \n  - Position 2: **U**  \n  - Position 3: **R**  \n  - Position 5: **Y**  \n- Only position 4 is unknown.  \n- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  \n- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  \n- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  \n\n### Possible Words:\nCommon words fitting the pattern:  \n- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  \n- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  \n- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  \n\n### Strategy:\n- **CURRY** is a strong candidate because:  \n  - It is a very common word.  \n  - It tests the possibility of a double R (if the secret word has two R\'s, position 4 could be R).  \n  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if R can appear again (e.g., if position 4 is marked ""x"", R is not repeated) and narrow options to **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess.  \n- Given only one position is unknown, this guess could solve the puzzle immediately if correct.\n\n<guess>tags.\n\nBut we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn\'t.\n\nSo I think it\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.\n\nBut since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.\n\nIf it is, we win.

We are given the previous feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Guess 3: curly -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

From this, we can deduce:
- Position 1: C is correct (so secret word starts with C).
- Position 2: U is correct (so second letter is U).
- Position 3: R is correct (so third letter is R).
- Position 5: Y is correct (so fifth letter is Y).
- The letter L is absent (so not in the word).
- Additionally, from previous guesses: A, N, E, H, O, I are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C U R ? Y

Only the fourth position is unknown.

We must guess a word that fits: C U R ? Y, and where the missing letter is not one of the absent letters (A, E, H, I, L, N, O). Also, it must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the fourth position: any letter not in the absent list and not already confirmed (but confirmed letters can repeat if allowed). However, since we don't have any duplicates yet, but R is already in position 3, it is possible that the word has another R? But note that in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""choir"", R was marked as present but wrong position. In ""curly"", R was marked correct in position 3. But if the word had two R's, the feedback might not show duplicates unless present.

But in ""curry"", we are going to test if position 4 is R.

Common words of the form C U R ? Y:
- curry (with double R)
- curvy (V in fourth position)
- curdy (D in fourth position, less common)

We tried ""curry"" in the fourth guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after Guess 3, and we haven't had Guess 4 yet. The feedback only shows Guess 1 to 3.

Wait, the user says: ""Guess 4: tags."" but that seems like a placeholder or error? Because it says ""Guess 4: tags."" but no feedback? Actually, looking back: ""Guess 4: tags."" might be incomplete.

Reading the user input: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: ... Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 4: tags.""

No, the user says: ""Guess 4: tags."" but it doesn't show feedback? Actually, probably a typo? Because it says ""Guess 4: tags."" and then nothing. Perhaps it's meant to be feedback? Or perhaps it's aborted.

But in the context, the previous feedback ends at Guess 3, and we need to make Guess 4? But then the user might be saying that we made Guess 4: curry? But it says ""tags"", which doesn't make sense because ""tags"" doesn't start with CUR? Let's parse.

The user input: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: ... Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 4: tags.""

This must be a continuation? Perhaps ""tags"" is the feedback for Guess 4? But format doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake and we are still at Guess 4? Or after Guess 3 we are making Guess 4.

Clarifying: the feedback for Guess 3 is given, and we are to make a new guess (which would be Guess 4).

In my last response, I guess ""curry"", but now the user input seems to have a glitch.

But in the system, we have only completed Guess 1-3. We are to make Guess 4.

So based on Guess 1-3, the word is CUR?Y, with missing letter in fourth position.

Possible guesses: we need to fill CUR?Y.

To solve, we should guess one of the possibilities. ""curry"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""curvy"" or ""curdy"".

Since we have limited tries, we can guess ""curry"" as it's a common word.

But note: we have not used any letter for position 4, so if we guess ""curry"", it will test whether position 4 is R.

If it is, we win. If not, we get feedback: R might be marked absent (if no double R) or wrong position? But since R is already at position 3, if we put R at position 4 and the secret has, say, V there, then the additional R would be absent.

But that's fine.

Alternatively, we could guess ""curvy"" to test V.

But ""curry"" is more common.

Given the feedback, we know the secret word begins with CUR and ends with Y, so CUR?Y.

Let me list possible words:

- CURRY (double R)
- CURVY
- CURDY (meaning full of curds, like in dairy)
- CURFY (not common, meaning resembling surf or scurf? Rare)
- CURGY? Not a word.
- CURLY? But L is absent, so no.
- CURNY? Not a word.

So the most common are CURRY and CURVY.

We'll guess CURRY because it might be the solution.

If incorrect, we know position 4 must be V or D or other rare letter.

For Guess 4, I'll say CURRY.

But in Response Format, think through and then output.

Thought process from above.

### Final Thoughts Based on Feedback  
From the previous guesses:  
- The secret word has **C** at position 1, **U** at position 2, **R** at position 3, and **Y** at position 5.  
- Position 4 is the only unknown letter.  
- Absent letters include **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (as confirmed by feedback).  
- Possible candidates for position 4 are letters not absent and not yet confirmed (e.g., **B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z**).  
- The most common English words fitting the pattern **C U R ? Y** are **CURRY** (with a double R) or **CURVY** (with V).  
- **CURRY** is chosen as the guess because:  
  - It is a high-frequency word.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on the fourth letter will confirm/eliminate **R** (allowing **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess).  

<guess>curry</guess>",curry,"We are given the previous feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Guess 3: curly -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

From this, we can deduce:
- Position 1: C is correct (so secret word starts with C).
- Position 2: U is correct (so second letter is U).
- Position 3: R is correct (so third letter is R).
- Position 5: Y is correct (so fifth letter is Y).
- The letter L is absent (so not in the word).
- Additionally, from previous guesses: A, N, E, H, O, I are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C U R ? Y

Only the fourth position is unknown.

We must guess a word that fits: C U R ? Y, and where the missing letter is not one of the absent letters (A, E, H, I, L, N, O). Also, it must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the fourth position: any letter not in the absent list and not already confirmed (but confirmed letters can repeat if allowed). However, since we don't have any duplicates yet, but R is already in position 3, it is possible that the word has another R? But note that in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""choir"", R was marked as present but wrong position. In ""curly"", R was marked correct in position 3. But if the word had two R's, the feedback might not show duplicates unless present.

But in ""curry"", we are going to test if position 4 is R.

Common words of the form C U R ? Y:
- curry (with double R)
- curvy (V in fourth position)
- curdy (D in fourth position, less common)

We tried ""curry"" in the fourth guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after Guess 3, and we haven't had Guess 4 yet. The feedback only shows Guess 1 to 3.

Wait, the user says: ""Guess 4: tags."" but that seems like a placeholder or error? Because it says ""Guess 4: tags."" but no feedback? Actually, looking back: ""Guess 4: tags."" might be incomplete.

Reading the user input: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: ... Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 4: tags.""

No, the user says: ""Guess 4: tags."" but it doesn't show feedback? Actually, probably a typo? Because it says ""Guess 4: tags."" and then nothing. Perhaps it's meant to be feedback? Or perhaps it's aborted.

But in the context, the previous feedback ends at Guess 3, and we need to make Guess 4? But then the user might be saying that we made Guess 4: curry? But it says ""tags"", which doesn't make sense because ""tags"" doesn't start with CUR? Let's parse.

This must be a continuation? Perhaps ""tags"" is the feedback for Guess 4? But format doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake and we are still at Guess 4? Or after Guess 3 we are making Guess 4.

Clarifying: the feedback for Guess 3 is given, and we are to make a new guess (which would be Guess 4).

In my last response, I guess ""curry"", but now the user input seems to have a glitch.

But in the system, we have only completed Guess 1-3. We are to make Guess 4.

So based on Guess 1-3, the word is CUR?Y, with missing letter in fourth position.

Another candidate: ""curvy"" or ""curdy"".

Since we have limited tries, we can guess ""curry"" as it's a common word.

But note: we have not used any letter for position 4, so if we guess ""curry"", it will test whether position 4 is R.

If it is, we win. If not, we get feedback: R might be marked absent (if no double R) or wrong position? But since R is already at position 3, if we put R at position 4 and the secret has, say, V there, then the additional R would be absent.

But that's fine.

Alternatively, we could guess ""curvy"" to test V.

But ""curry"" is more common.

Given the feedback, we know the secret word begins with CUR and ends with Y, so CUR?Y.

- CURFY (not common, meaning resembling surf or scurf? Rare)
- CURGY? Not a word.
- CURLY? But L is absent, so no.
- CURNY? Not a word.

So the most common are CURRY and CURVY.

We'll guess CURRY because it might be the solution.

If incorrect, we know position 4 must be V or D or other rare letter.

For Guess 4, I'll say CURRY.

But in Response Format, think through and then output.

From the previous guesses:  
- The secret word has **C** at position 1, **U** at position 2, **R** at position 3, and **Y** at position 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, from this:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

Since the word starts with C, our next guess should start with C.

We know R is in the word, but not in the second position, so R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we must avoid letters A, N, E.

We have to guess a 5-letter word starting with C and containing R, and not containing A, N, E.

Possible letters: We can use other vowels (O, U, I) and consonants.

Common English words starting with C: think of words like CRUST, CRUMB, etc., but note we must avoid E and A, and R cannot be second.

Our first guess had R in second position, so now we must put R in a different position: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words starting with C and having R in position 3,4, or 5.

Options:
- Position 3: e.g., C_R?? (like CAR? but we cannot have A, so avoid A). We don't have A. So words like COR??, CUR??, CIR??
- Position 4: e.g., C?_R? (like C_R? but with R at 4)
- Position 5: e.g., C???R

Also, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R but it was wrong, so in our next guess we must avoid putting R in position 2.

So, our guess must start with C and not have R in position 2, and contain R, and exclude A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a word that maximizes information. We want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's consider common consonants and vowels left: vowels O, U, I; consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses some of these.

One strategy is to use a word that has the known letter R in a different position and introduce new common letters.

For example, we can try a word with R in position 3: COR??
Words: CORD, CORKS, but we need 5 letters. 5-letter words: CORAL? But A is disallowed. CORKS? K and S are new, but we need 5 letters: CORKY? or CROSS? But CROSS has two S, and we don't know about S.

Alternatively, R in position 4: e.g., C_R_? Like CURDS? CURDS: C U R D S.

But let's check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)

Example: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.

Words with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.

Another: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.

Perhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.

Words: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.

Having difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.

Let me list possible words: 

- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? 

Possible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.

Example words: 
- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.

But note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.

In CHORD: R is at position 4.

Similarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.

That might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.

Similarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.

We also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.

A good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

C is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.

But is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.

In the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.

But also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.

Another option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.

Therefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.

Let me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.

Possible words:

- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4
- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5
- CHORD: as above, R at 4
- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? 

Wait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn't help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.

So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.

Hence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.

Now, among the options:

CHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.

CHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.

CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.

To gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.

Also, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.

But note: in the first word, we had 'C','R','A','N','E'. We now know A,N,E are absent.

Another idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)

This tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.

Or CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.

CHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.

Both seem okay.

But note: we must use only English words.

CHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.

Another option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.

CURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don't know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.

I think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.

But CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven't tested.

We should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.

Similarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it's wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.

We can try that.

Another common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.

So I'll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.

Introduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).

But CHIRP has R at position 4? Let's count: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: I
Position 4: R
Position 5: P

Yes.

We are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.

R is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.

Similarly for others.

Also note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.

So let's guess ""CHIRP"".

But we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.

CHIRP tests H,I,P.

Both are valid.

I can choose CHIRP.

Wait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn't have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.

But actually, at this stage, we are testing.

Perhaps a word with more vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

CHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.

If the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.

That might be good.

Similarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.

Also, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it's present, we'll know.

But in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.

I think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.

But CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.

Both are acceptable.

I'll pick CHOIR because it's another common starting word and tests O.

So guess: CHOIR

Format: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is in the correct position (position 1).  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A, N, and E are not in the word.  

For the next guess:  
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  
- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  
- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  
- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  
- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  
  - Starts with ""C"".  
  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  
  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  
  - Avoids A, N, E.  

This guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.

<guess>choir</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Meaning:
- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it's marked as wrong position, meaning it's present but not at the end).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. So we must avoid these.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

We know the word has 5 letters, starts with C, contains R (in position 3 or 4), and does not contain A, N, E, H, O, I.

Now, we need to think of words that fit:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be a letter not in {A, N, E, H, O, I} and not R (because R is not in position 2). Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.
- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).
- Similarly for position 4 and 5.

Since R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.

But we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.

We also want to test new letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Note: U is still available (not tested yet). We haven't used U.

Common letters: S, T, L, U, etc.

We must include R in position 3 or 4.

Let's think of possible words:

Case 1: R in position 3.
Then the word is: C, ?, R, ?, ?
Where ? are letters from the available set, and not the absent ones.

Case 2: R in position 4.
Then: C, ?, ?, R, ?

We need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible and helps us narrow down.

Since we have many letters to avoid, the list of possible words might be limited.

Let me try to list some words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and avoid A,N,E,H,O,I.

First, R in position 3:

- CUR?Y: but we need 5 letters. CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) 
- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.

But we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven't tested U, L, Y.

But in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.

But we don't know yet.

Another word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.

But let's see if we can use it.

But we are going to guess now, so we can.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

CURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it's valid.

Similarly, CURRY? But double R? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don't have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don't know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.

CURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.

But we have many options.

Now, case with R in position 4:

Words: C, ?, ?, R, ?

For example: C??R? 

Like: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.

CUTER? E absent.

CYBER? E absent.

So avoid E.

What about: CULPR? Not a word.

CUTER is invalid.

Another: CUMAR? Not a word.

Perhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.

CUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.

Possible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.

For example: CUTER is out.

CATER? But A is absent.

Cider? But I is absent.

So hard.

Another: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.

5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.

CURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.

Perhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.

CRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.

So, R in position 4 might be harder.

Let me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.

Examples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.

CLERK? E absent.

CLASP? A absent.

So not many.

Perhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.

I think R in position 3 is more promising.

So let's focus on R in position 3.

Words: C?R??

With ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common: U, S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:

- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.
- CURFS? Not common.
- CURLY: as above.
- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y
- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)
- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S
- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S
- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)

Also, with other vowels? But we have U available.

We haven't tested U, so it's good to test U.

Similarly, we can test other consonants.

But we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.

In the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.

So for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.

Now, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.

But note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

If U is in the word, we'll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.

But we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.

But if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.

Recall the feedback rules:

- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -
- If the letter is not in the word: x

In this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.

If the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets '-'.

But if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as '-'.

For example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as '-'.

Similarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be '-'.

But in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 2.

In the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was '-', meaning R is present but not at 5.

So if we put R at 3 in the next guess:

- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.
- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be '-' (because present but wrong position).
- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.

Similarly for position 4.

So in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.

Another word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.

But CURLY is a common word.

We could also test S or T.

But let's see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.

But we might be able to get it.

Another idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.

But we need to choose.

I think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.

If R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

If R is not at 3, we get R as '-' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.

So either way, we get information.

Moreover, CURLY is a valid word.

So I'll go with CURLY.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.

Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.

So it's valid.

Therefore, guess: CURLY

But in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.

So we are good.

We could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.

So I choose CURLY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  
  - C is still correct in position 1.  
  - H, O, I are absent.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  
- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  

The word **CURLY** fits:  
- Starts with **C** (position 1).  
- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  
- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  
- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  

This guess will help confirm R's position and test new letters efficiently.

<｜Assistant｜>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): A, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: choir**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - H(x), O(x), I(x): H, O, I are absent.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 3: curly**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - U(✓): Correct and in position 2.  
  - R(✓): Correct and in position 3.  
  - L(x): L is absent.  
  - Y(✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:  
  - Position 1: **C**  
  - Position 2: **U**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- Only position 4 is unknown.  
- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  
- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  
- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  

### Possible Words:
Common words fitting the pattern:  
- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  
- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  
- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  

### Strategy:
- **CURRY** is a strong candidate because:  
  - It is a very common word.  
  - It tests the possibility of a double R (if the secret word has two R's, position 4 could be R).  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if R can appear again (e.g., if position 4 is marked ""x"", R is not repeated) and narrow options to **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess.  
- Given only one position is unknown, this guess could solve the puzzle immediately if correct.

Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: tags.

But we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn't.

So I think it's fine.

Alternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.

But since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I'll go with that.

But let's see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.

If it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.

But we have only one position, so we can try.

I think it's acceptable.

So guess: CURRY

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:  
  - Position 1: **C**  
  - Position 2: **U**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- Only position 4 is unknown.  
- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  
- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  
- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  

### Possible Words:
Common words fitting the pattern:  
- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  
- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  
- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  

### Strategy:
- **CURRY** is a strong candidate because:  
  - It is a very common word.  
  - It tests the possibility of a double R (if the secret word has two R's, position 4 could be R).

<guess>curry -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the previous feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)
Guess 3: curly -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

From this, we can deduce:
- Position 1: C is correct (so secret word starts with C).
- Position 2: U is correct (so second letter is U).
- Position 3: R is correct (so third letter is R).
- Position 5: Y is correct (so fifth letter is Y).
- The letter L is absent (so not in the word).
- Additionally, from previous guesses: A, N, E, H, O, I are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C U R ? Y

Only the fourth position is unknown.

We must guess a word that fits: C U R ? Y, and where the missing letter is not one of the absent letters (A, E, H, I, L, N, O). Also, it must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the fourth position: any letter not in the absent list and not already confirmed (but confirmed letters can repeat if allowed). However, since we don't have any duplicates yet, but R is already in position 3, it is possible that the word has another R? But note that in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""choir"", R was marked as present but wrong position. In ""curly"", R was marked correct in position 3. But if the word had two R's, the feedback might not show duplicates unless present.

But in ""curry"", we are going to test if position 4 is R.

Common words of the form C U R ? Y:
- curry (with double R)
- curvy (V in fourth position)
- curdy (D in fourth position, less common)

We tried ""curry"" in the fourth guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after Guess 3, and we haven't had Guess 4 yet. The feedback only shows Guess 1 to 3.

Wait, the user says: ""Guess 4: tags."" but that seems like a placeholder or error? Because it says ""Guess 4: tags."" but no feedback? Actually, looking back: ""Guess 4: tags."" might be incomplete.

Reading the user input: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: ... Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 4: tags.""

No, the user says: ""Guess 4: tags."" but it doesn't show feedback? Actually, probably a typo? Because it says ""Guess 4: tags."" and then nothing. Perhaps it's meant to be feedback? Or perhaps it's aborted.

But in the context, the previous feedback ends at Guess 3, and we need to make Guess 4? But then the user might be saying that we made Guess 4: curry? But it says ""tags"", which doesn't make sense because ""tags"" doesn't start with CUR? Let's parse.

The user input: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: ... Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: ... Guess 4: tags.""

This must be a continuation? Perhaps ""tags"" is the feedback for Guess 4? But format doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake and we are still at Guess 4? Or after Guess 3 we are making Guess 4.

Clarifying: the feedback for Guess 3 is given, and we are to make a new guess (which would be Guess 4).

In my last response, I guess ""curry"", but now the user input seems to have a glitch.

But in the system, we have only completed Guess 1-3. We are to make Guess 4.

So based on Guess 1-3, the word is CUR?Y, with missing letter in fourth position.

Possible guesses: we need to fill CUR?Y.

To solve, we should guess one of the possibilities. ""curry"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""curvy"" or ""curdy"".

Since we have limited tries, we can guess ""curry"" as it's a common word.

But note: we have not used any letter for position 4, so if we guess ""curry"", it will test whether position 4 is R.

If it is, we win. If not, we get feedback: R might be marked absent (if no double R) or wrong position? But since R is already at position 3, if we put R at position 4 and the secret has, say, V there, then the additional R would be absent.

But that's fine.

Alternatively, we could guess ""curvy"" to test V.

But ""curry"" is more common.

Given the feedback, we know the secret word begins with CUR and ends with Y, so CUR?Y.

Let me list possible words:

- CURRY (double R)
- CURVY
- CURDY (meaning full of curds, like in dairy)
- CURFY (not common, meaning resembling surf or scurf? Rare)
- CURGY? Not a word.
- CURLY? But L is absent, so no.
- CURNY? Not a word.

So the most common are CURRY and CURVY.

We'll guess CURRY because it might be the solution.

If incorrect, we know position 4 must be V or D or other rare letter.

For Guess 4, I'll say CURRY.

But in Response Format, think through and then output.

Thought process from above.### Final Thoughts Based on Feedback  
From the previous guesses:  
- The secret word has **C** at position 1, **U** at position 2, **R** at position 3, and **Y** at position 5.  
- Position 4 is the only unknown letter.  
- Absent letters include **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (as confirmed by feedback).  
- Possible candidates for position 4 are letters not absent and not yet confirmed (e.g., **B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z**).  
- The most common English words fitting the pattern **C U R ? Y** are **CURRY** (with a double R) or **CURVY** (with V).  
- **CURRY** is chosen as the guess because:  
  - It is a high-frequency word.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on the fourth letter will confirm/eliminate **R** (allowing **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess).

<guess>curry</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

Guess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

But we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn't.

So I think it's fine.

Alternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.

But since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I'll go with that.

But let's see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.

If it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.

But we have only one position, so we can try.

I think it's acceptable.

  - Position 1: **C**  
  - Position 2: **U**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- Only position 4 is unknown.  
- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  
- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  
- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  

### Possible Words:
Common words fitting the pattern:  
- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  
- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  
- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  

### Strategy:

CURDS: C U R D S.\n\nBut let\'s check: CURDS: C(1st), U(2nd), R(3rd)? No, if we put R in 4th, then positions: C(1), ?(2), ?(3), R(4), ?(5)\n\nExample: CHIRK? CHIRK is not common; CHURN? But U in second and R in fourth? C? ?(2) can be H, then U in 3? CHURN: C,H,U,R,N -> but N is disallowed (from feedback: N is not in word). So no.\n\nWords with R in position 4: C_T?R? Actually ""CUTER""? but E is disallowed and A,N,E are out. Also, ""CUTER"" has E.\n\nAnother: ""CIVOR""? not a word. ""CYBER""? But E is invalid.\n\nPerhaps R in position 5: C???R. Words like ACTOR? but we start with C, so CACTI? CACTI: C(1), A(2) but A is disallowed. So avoid A.\n\nWords: ""COVER""? But E is disallowed.\n\nHaving difficulty. Maybe put R in position 3.\n\nLet me list possible words: \n\n- Position 3: e.g., C?R?? \n\nPossible: With ?2: must be a letter not A,N,E, and not R (since R is not in position 2). So any vowel except A,E? O, U, I? or consonant.\n\nExample words: \n- CHORD: C,H,O,R,D -> positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) -> but R is at position 4? We want R in a different position. In this case, R is at position 4, which is fine.\n\nBut note the feedback: in guess1, R was in position 2 and it was wrong position. So R could be in 1? But position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So R in 3,4,5.\n\nIn CHORD: R is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can try CHORE, but E is disallowed.\n\nCURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> but here R is at position 3: C(1),U(2),R(3),L(4),Y(5). So U at 2 and R at 3.\n\nThat might be good because we introduce U, L, Y.\n\nSimilarly, CURRY? But repeated R? We don\'t know if there are repeats, so better to avoid for now.\n\nWe also have the constraint that A,N,E are out.\n\nA good guess would be ""CURLY"": but let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nC is fixed at 1, U at 2? But U was not tested before. We must avoid putting R at 2, which we are: R is at 3.\n\nBut is there any conflict? We know from feedback that A,N,E are not present, and U,L,Y have not been tested.\n\nIn the first guess, position 3 was A? But A is not in the word, and in CURLY, position 3 is R which is known to be present.\n\nBut also, the feedback tells us that R is not at position 2 in the secret word. In CURLY, we are putting U at position 2 and R at 3.\n\nAnother option: ""CRUMB""? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2? We must avoid that because we know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use words with R in second position.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use CRUMB because it has R at position 2.\n\nLet me think of words starting with C, not having R at position 2, containing R, and without A,N,E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURLY: C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)\n- CHIRP: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5) -> R at position 4\n- CHOIR: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5) -> R at position 5\n- CHORD: as above, R at 4\n- CROWD: C(1), R(2)... no, R at 2 -> avoid because R cannot be at 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put R at 2 in our guess? \n\nWait: the feedback says in the first guess, the R was at position 2 and it was wrong, meaning the secret word has R but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our next guess, it would be marked as wrong position again? And that doesn\'t help us. To get new information, we should put R in a different position in our guess.\n\nSo we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should have R not at position 2.\n\nHence, choose a word starting with C, and R at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nNow, among the options:\n\nCHOIR: C,H,O,I,R -> letters: C,H,O,I,R. H,O,I are new. Position: R at 5.\n\nCHIRP: C,H,I,R,P -> R at 4? H,I,R are new? H,I new.\n\nCURLY: C,U,R,L,Y -> U,R,L,Y. R at 3? U new.\n\nTo gather more information, it might be good to test more vowels? We know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U.\n\nAlso, common consonants: S,T,L, etc.\n\nBut note: in the first word, we had \'C\',\'R\',\'A\',\'N\',\'E\'. We now know A,N,E are absent.\n\nAnother idea: since the word has C at start and R somewhere, another common word is ""CRISP"", but we cannot because R is at position 2. Similarly ""CRUSH"" — R at 2.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo, let me select CHIRP: it has H,I,R,P. R at position 4? Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), P(5)\n\nThis tests H at position 2, I at 3, R at 4, P at 5.\n\nOr CHORI: not a word? CHOIR is valid.\n\nCHOIR: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5) -> R at position 5.\n\nBoth seem okay.\n\nBut note: we must use only English words.\n\nCHIRP is a word, meaning to make a sound like a bird.\n\nAnother option: CROWD? C R O W D — but R at position 2? Avoid.\n\nCURRY: C U R R Y — R at position 3, but repeated R? We don\'t know if there are repeats, so it might be okay but possibly inefficient because if one R is correct position, the other might be redundant.\n\nI think CHIRP or CHOIR is good.\n\nBut CHOIR has O which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe should also consider that the feedback for position 3 in first guess was A, which is absent. So in CHIRP, putting I at position 3 might be informative.\n\nSimilarly, for position 2: in first guess, R was at 2 and it\'s wrong. In CHIRP, we put H at 2. If H is correct, it will show ✓. If not, then absent or wrong position.\n\nWe can try that.\n\nAnother common strategy: we can fix the known correct C and use a word that tests multiple new letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with CHIRP: letters C, H, I, R, P.\n\nIntroduces H, I, P; and R at a new position (position 4).\n\nBut CHIRP has R at position 4? Let\'s count: \nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: P\n\nYes.\n\nWe are hoping to get feedback on H, I, R, P.\n\nR is known to be in the word, so we expect R to be either in the correct position (if secret word has R at 4) or wrong position if not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso note: we must avoid A,N,E, which CHIRP does.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CHIRP"".\n\nBut we have another possibility: ""CURLY"" which tests U and L,Y.\n\nCHIRP tests H,I,P.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI can choose CHIRP.\n\nWait: the secret word starts with C and has R, and doesn\'t have A,N,E. We need to guess a word that might be the answer.\n\nBut actually, at this stage, we are testing.\n\nPerhaps a word with more vowels? We haven\'t tested O or U.\n\nCHOIR: starts with C, H at 2, O at 3, I at 4, R at 5. That tests H,O,I,R? R at position 5? Positions: C(1),H(2),O(3),I(4),R(5). So this tests H, O, I? And R is at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at 5, it will be marked correct in position for R. If not, then wrong position.\n\nThat might be good.\n\nSimilarly, CHOIR avoids A,N,E.\n\nAlso, note: position 3 was A in first guess and it was absent. So if we put O at position 3 and it\'s present, we\'ll know.\n\nBut in CHIRP, we put I at position 3.\n\nI think CHOIR is slightly better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and H.\n\nBut CHIRP tests I as a vowel and H,P consonants.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll pick CHOIR because it\'s another common starting word and tests O.\n\nSo guess: CHOIR\n\nFormat: make sure output is <guess>choir</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C is in the correct position (position 1).  \n- R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n- A, N, and E are not in the word.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is correct).  \n- It must include ""R"" (as R is confirmed present) but not in position 2 (since that position is incorrect).  \n- It should avoid the letters A, N, and E (as they are absent).  \n- To maximize information, introduce new untested letters, targeting vowels (like O, U, I) and common consonants.  \n- A good choice is ""CHOIR"":  \n  - Starts with ""C"".  \n  - Places ""R"" in position 5 (new position to test).  \n  - Introduces new potential vowels (O, I) and consonant (H).  \n  - Avoids A, N, E.  \n\nThis guess helps test multiple new positions and letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>choir</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C is correct and in position 1.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: choir -> C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nMeaning:\n- C is still correct in position 1 (as expected).\n- H is not in the word (x).\n- O is not in the word (x).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 5 (since it\'s marked as wrong position, meaning it\'s present but not at the end).\n\nSo, combining the feedback:\n\n- The secret word starts with C.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.\n- Absent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. So we must avoid these.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters, starts with C, contains R (in position 3 or 4), and does not contain A, N, E, H, O, I.\n\nNow, we need to think of words that fit:\n\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- Position 2: must be a letter not in {A, N, E, H, O, I} and not R (because R is not in position 2). Also, it must be a letter that can form a word.\n- Position 3: either R (if R is in position 3) or another letter (if R is in position 4).\n- Similarly for position 4 and 5.\n\nSince R is in either position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that can help us distinguish.\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNote: U is still available (not tested yet). We haven\'t used U.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, U, etc.\n\nWe must include R in position 3 or 4.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nCase 1: R in position 3.\nThen the word is: C, ?, R, ?, ?\nWhere ? are letters from the available set, and not the absent ones.\n\nCase 2: R in position 4.\nThen: C, ?, ?, R, ?\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible and helps us narrow down.\n\nSince we have many letters to avoid, the list of possible words might be limited.\n\nLet me try to list some words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and avoid A,N,E,H,O,I.\n\nFirst, R in position 3:\n\n- CUR?Y: but we need 5 letters. CURDY? D is available, but CURDY has U and Y. But CURDY is a word? (meaning: resembling curd) \n- CURLY: but we have L and Y. But in guess 1, we had N and E absent, and in guess 2, H,O,I absent. So CURLY: C,U,R,L,Y. But U, L, Y are available. However, in guess 2, we tested O and I, but not U. So CURLY is a candidate? But wait, in the first guess, we had A absent, so U is fine.\n\nBut we must check: in CURLY, R is at position 3. Also, we haven\'t tested U, L, Y.\n\nBut in the feedback of guess 2, we have R marked as wrong position. Since in guess 2, R was at position 5, and it was wrong, so R is not at 5. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the first guess, R was at 2 and wrong, so R at 3 might be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know yet.\n\nAnother word: CURVY? C,U,R,V,Y. V is available.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can use it.\n\nBut we are going to guess now, so we can.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nCURLY: letters C, U, R, L, Y. None of A,N,E,H,O,I. So it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, CURRY? But double R? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle, words can have double letters. However, we don\'t have evidence, so it might be less likely. Also, CURRY has R at 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y. So R at 3 and 4. But we know R is present, but it might be only one R? Or two? We don\'t know. But to avoid complexity, maybe avoid double letters for now.\n\nCURDS? But D and S. But S is common. However, CURDS: C,U,R,D,S. But in this, R is at position 3? C(1),U(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). But we have to avoid E, which we are. But in guess 1, E is absent, so S is fine.\n\nBut we have many options.\n\nNow, case with R in position 4:\n\nWords: C, ?, ?, R, ?\n\nFor example: C??R? \n\nLike: CUBER? But E is absent. Not allowed.\n\nCUTER? E absent.\n\nCYBER? E absent.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nWhat about: CULPR? Not a word.\n\nCUTER is invalid.\n\nAnother: CUMAR? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: CUTER is not allowed, so what about CUTTER? But 6 letters? No, 5 letters.\n\nCUTTER is 6 letters. 5-letter words.\n\nPossible: C_T_R_? With no A,N,E,H,O,I.\n\nFor example: CUTER is out.\n\nCATER? But A is absent.\n\nCider? But I is absent.\n\nSo hard.\n\nAnother: S words? Like CUSP? But 4 letters.\n\n5-letter: CUSPY? Not common.\n\nCURRY? But that has R at 3 and 4, which we considered.\n\nPerhaps: CRAFT? But A is absent.\n\nCRUMB? But U and M? But in CRUMB, R is at position 2, which we cannot use because we know R is not at 2. So avoid.\n\nSo, R in position 4 might be harder.\n\nLet me think of common words: after C, with R in position 4.\n\nExamples: ""L"" words? Like CLEAR? But E and A absent.\n\nCLERK? E absent.\n\nCLASP? A absent.\n\nSo not many.\n\nPerhaps: CUBER is not valid. How about ""CYBER""? But E.\n\nI think R in position 3 is more promising.\n\nSo let\'s focus on R in position 3.\n\nWords: C?R??\n\nWith ?2: must be a letter not absent and not R. Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon: U, S, T, L, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURED? But E absent -> invalid.\n- CURFS? Not common.\n- CURLY: as above.\n- CURVY: C,U,R,V,Y\n- CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y (double R)\n- CURDS: C,U,R,D,S\n- CURBS: C,U,R,B,S\n- CURST: C,U,R,S,T (archaic for cursed, but might be accepted)\n\nAlso, with other vowels? But we have U available.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U, so it\'s good to test U.\n\nSimilarly, we can test other consonants.\n\nBut we also need to consider position 2 and 4,5.\n\nIn the second guess, we tested H at position 2 and it was absent, so position 2 cannot be H. Similarly, O and I absent.\n\nSo for position 2, we can use U, or other available letters.\n\nNow, to choose a word: we want to test U if possible, and also other common letters.\n\nBut note: if we use CURLY, we test U at position 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf U is in the word, we\'ll get feedback. Similarly for L and Y.\n\nBut we know R is present, so we expect R to be correct if in position 3, or wrong if not.\n\nBut if we put R at 3 and it is actually at 4, then R will be marked as wrong position? No: if R is in the word but not at position 3, and we put it at 3, it will be marked as absent? No.\n\nRecall the feedback rules:\n\n- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: -\n- If the letter is not in the word: x\n\nIn this case, for R: if the secret word has R at position 3, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be ✓.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then in CURLY, R at 3 will be x? Because R is not at position 3, but it is in the word? Then it should be marked as wrong position? No.\n\nIf the letter is present but not in the correct position, it gets \'-\'.\n\nBut if we put R in a position where it is not, but it is present elsewhere, it should be marked as \'-\'.\n\nFor example, if secret word has R at 4, and we put R at 3, then R is present but not at 3, so it should be marked as \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, if we put R at 3 and it is at 4, then R at 3 is not correct, but R is in the word, so it should be \'-\'.\n\nBut in the first guess, we put R at 2 and it was \'-\', meaning R is present but not at 2.\n\nIn the second guess, we put R at 5 and it was \'-\', meaning R is present but not at 5.\n\nSo if we put R at 3 in the next guess:\n\n- If R is at 3 in secret, it will be ✓.\n- If R is at 4 in secret, it will be \'-\' (because present but wrong position).\n- If R is at 3, then we get it correct.\n\nSimilarly for position 4.\n\nSo in CURLY, if we put R at 3, we can get information about R\'s position.\n\nSimilarly, we test U at 2, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nNow, we have to avoid the absent letters, which we are.\n\nAnother word: CURST, which has S and T, common letters.\n\nBut CURLY is a common word.\n\nWe could also test S or T.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have 6 tries, so we can try to guess.\n\nBut we might be able to get it.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in 3 or 4, we can try a word that has R in 3 and then another that has R in 4, but we can do one guess.\n\nBut we need to choose.\n\nI think CURLY is a good choice because it tests U, L, Y, and R at 3.\n\nIf R is at 3, we get it correct, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.\n\nIf R is not at 3, we get R as \'-\' (since it must be at 4) and then we know R is at 4, and we get feedback on U, L, Y.\n\nSo either way, we get information.\n\nMoreover, CURLY is a valid word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with CURLY.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nAbsent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I. None of these are in CURLY.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, guess: CURLY\n\nBut in the second guess, we had R at 5 and it was wrong position. In CURLY, R is at 3, which is a new position.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nWe could also consider CURDY or CURVY, but CURLY is more common.\n\nSo I choose CURLY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - A, N, E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: choir** → C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)  \n  - C is still correct in position 1.  \n  - H, O, I are absent.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  \n- **R** is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.  \n- Absent letters: **A, N, E, H, O, I** (cannot be used).  \n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n- Strategy: Test R in position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are eliminated) and introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, Y) to gather more information.  \n\nThe word **CURLY** fits:  \n- Starts with **C** (position 1).  \n- Places **R** in position 3 (testing if it is correct or wrong position).  \n- Introduces **U** (vowel not tested), **L** (common consonant), and **Y** (common ending letter).  \n- Avoids all absent letters (A, N, E, H, O, I).  \n\nThis guess will help confirm R\'s position and test new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>curly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nGuess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess: curly -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).\n- U is correct and in position 2 (new information).\n- R is correct and in position 3 (so R is fixed at position 3).\n- L is not in the word (x).\n- Y is correct and in position 5 (new information).\n\nSo, from this:\n- The secret word has positions: \n  - 1: C\n  - 2: U\n  - 3: R\n  - 5: Y\n- And position 4 is missing, but we know L is not in the word.\n\nAlso, from previous feedback, we know that A, N, E, H, O, I are absent.\n\nNow, the secret word is of the form: C U R _ Y\n\nWe need to find a letter for the 4th position that is not in the absent list and not L.\n\nAbsent letters: A, N, E, H, O, I, L (from this guess, L is absent).\n\nSo absent: A, E, H, I, L, N, O.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word: C U R ? Y\n\nThe ? must be one of the available letters, and the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CURDY? C U R D Y -> but is CURDY a word? It means resembling curd, and it is accepted in some dictionaries. But let\'s check.\n- CURFY? Not common.\n- CURVY? C U R V Y -> meaning curved or attractive. Yes, common word.\n- CURLY? But we just guessed that, and L is absent, so not.\n- CURRY? But R is repeated? And we have R at 3, and if we put R at 4, but we know from feedback that in the first guess R was not at 2, and in second not at 5, but we now have R at 3 correct. But CURRY has R at 3 and 4? But in CURRY, position 4 is R. But we have position 4 missing, and we know L is absent, but R is already in the word? We don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", R was present (but wrong position) and we had only one R. Similarly, ""choir"" had one R and it was present. ""curly"" had one R and it was correct. So it\'s possible that the word has only one R, or multiple? But we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut in this case, for CURRY, if we put R at position 4, but we already have R at position 3, and if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 4 would be incorrect? But the secret word has R at 3, so if we put R at 4, it might be marked as absent if there\'s no second R? Or if there is a second R, it might be marked as present.\n\nBut we don\'t know. However, in our pattern, we have C U R _ Y, so the fourth letter is not R in the secret word? Not necessarily, it could be R.\n\nBut let\'s see possible words:\n\nCommon words: CURVY, CURDY, CURRY, etc.\n\nBut we need to see which are valid.\n\nCURVY: adjective, meaning having curves or voluptuous. It\'s a common word.\n\nCURDY: less common, but might be accepted.\n\nCURRY: a spice or dish, very common.\n\nBut in CURRY, the letters are C,U,R,R,Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y.\n\nBut in our feedback from ""curly"", we have position 2: U(✓) and position 3: R(✓), and position 5: Y(✓). So if the secret word is CURRY, then position 4 would be R.\n\nBut we have L absent, which is fine.\n\nHowever, in the first guess ""crane"", we had R in the word (marked as present but wrong position). In ""crane"", R was at position 2, and the secret word has R at position 3 and 4? Then when we put R at position 2 in ""crane"", it should have been marked as present (since R is in the word) but wrong position, which it was. Similarly, in ""choir"", we put R at position 5, which is wrong, so marked as present but wrong position. In ""curly"", we put R at 3 and it was correct.\n\nBut if the secret word is CURRY, then it has two R\'s. So when we guessed ""crane"", which had one R at position 2, the feedback would show that R is present (because there is at least one R) but not at position 2. Similarly for ""choir"", one R at 5, present but not at 5. And in ""curly"", one R at 3, correct.\n\nSo it doesn\'t tell us if there is a second R.\n\nTherefore, CURRY is a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, CURVY is a possibility with one R.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses an available letter for position 4.\n\nBut we have only one position to determine, so we can guess CURVY or CURRY or CURDY, etc.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nSince we have multiple possibilities, we might need to choose one.\n\nBut note: we have only a few letters left to test.\n\nAvailable letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut not all form valid words.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- CURVY (V)\n- CURDY (D)\n- CURRY (R) - but R is already used, but it might be allowed if the word has two R\'s.\n\nBut R is not in the absent list, so it can be used again? But in the pattern, we are putting a letter at position 4, and R is a candidate.\n\nBut we don\'t know if it\'s in the word or not.\n\nTo be safe, we can guess CURVY, which is a common word.\n\nIf it\'s not CURVY, then we can try others.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess.\n\nWe can also think: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" with R at 2, and it was present. If the secret word has two R\'s, then when we put one R, it should be marked present. But we don\'t have information about the count.\n\nSimilarly, in ""curly"", we had one R and it was correct, but that doesn\'t tell about a second R.\n\nSo we must consider both.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit C U R _ Y and are English words:\n\n- CURDY (with D)\n- CURFY (rare)\n- CURVY (with V)\n- CURRY (with R)\n- CURLY (but L is absent, so not)\n- CURPY? Not a word.\n- CURY? Not 5 letters.\n\nSo the main candidates are CURDY, CURVY, CURRY.\n\nCURRY is very common, CURVY is common, CURDY is less common.\n\nWe can also check CURBY? Not common.\n\nCURNY? Not a word.\n\nSo probably CURRY or CURVY.\n\nNow, to decide: we can guess CURVY because it uses a new letter V, which we haven\'t tested, and if it\'s not the word, we get information about V.\n\nBut if we guess CURVY and it\'s wrong, we know V is not in the word, and then we can guess CURRY next.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess CURRY, and it\'s correct, we win. If not, then we know there is no second R? But if we guess CURRY and the secret word is CURVY, then the feedback for position 4 would be: if we put R and the secret has V, then R would be marked as absent (if there\'s no other R) or present if there is, but we know there is one R at 3.\n\nIn CURRY guess: positions: 1:C(✓), 2:U(✓), 3:R(✓), 4:R, 5:Y(✓)\n\nIf the secret word is CURVY, then:\n- Position 4: we put R, but secret has V. Since there is only one R in the secret (at position 3), and we put R at 4, which is not present elsewhere, so R at 4 would be marked as absent (x). But we also have the R at position 3, which is correct.\n\nBut the feedback for the R at position 4: since the secret has only one R and it\'s at 3, the R at 4 is not in the word? Or is it? The secret has one R, so if we put an extra R, it should be marked as absent? But in Wordle, if the letter is not in the word, it\'s x, even if it\'s repeated.\n\nBut in this case, the secret has one R, and we put two R\'s: one at 3 (correct) and one at 4. The R at 3 is correct, so it gets ✓. The R at 4: since there is no second R, it should be marked as absent (x).\n\nSimilarly, in the secret CURVY, the V is not tested in this guess.\n\nBut if we guess CURVY and the secret is CURRY, then:\n- Position 4: we put V, but secret has R. Since there is no V in the secret, V would be marked absent (x). And the R at 3 is correct, and Y at 5 correct.\n\nSo in either case, we get one letter wrong.\n\nBut we can use this to our advantage.\n\nSince we have only one position left, we can guess one of them.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 possibilities: CURDY, CURVY, CURRY. But CURDY is less common, so maybe not.\n\nCURDY might not be in the word list.\n\nSo between CURVY and CURRY.\n\nI think CURRY is more common, so perhaps guess that.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had ""crane"" with R at 2, and it was present. If the secret word has two R\'s, then it would have been present regardless. But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: we have not tested the letter S, T, etc. But in this pattern, we are filling the last position.\n\nPerhaps we should guess CURRY because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s guess CURVY to test V.\n\nBut I think we can guess CURRY.\n\nBut note: in the third guess, we guessed ""curly"" and got C,U,R,Y correct, and L absent. So the secret word is C U R ? Y.\n\nIf we guess CURRY, and it is correct, we win.\n\nIf not, then we know the fourth letter is not R, and we can try another.\n\nBut we have two more guesses after this.\n\nSo I\'ll guess CURRY.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: CURRY is C-U-R-R-Y.\n\nPosition 4 is R.\n\nSo guess: CURRY\n\nBut in the output, we need to put it in <guess> tags.\n\nBut we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn\'t.\n\nSo I think it\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.\n\nBut since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.\n\nIf it is, we win. If not, then we know it must be one of the other letters, like V or D.\n\nBut we have only one position, so we can try.\n\nI think it\'s acceptable.\n\nSo guess: CURRY### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - A(x), N(x), E(x): A, N, E are absent.  \n- **Guess 2: choir**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - H(x), O(x), I(x): H, O, I are absent.  \n  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.  \n- **Guess 3: curly**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - U(✓): Correct and in position 2.  \n  - R(✓): Correct and in position 3.  \n  - L(x): L is absent.  \n  - Y(✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the following fixed positions:  \n  - Position 1: **C**  \n  - Position 2: **U**  \n  - Position 3: **R**  \n  - Position 5: **Y**  \n- Only position 4 is unknown.  \n- Absent letters (cannot be used): **A, E, H, I, L, N, O** (from all feedback).  \n- Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  \n- The secret word must be a valid English word of the form **C U R _ Y**.  \n\n### Possible Words:\nCommon words fitting the pattern:  \n- **CURVY**: Uses V (a common letter, not tested yet).  \n- **CURDY**: Uses D (less common, but valid).  \n- **CURRY**: Uses R (possible if the word has a double R, but R is already confirmed at position 3).  \n\n### Strategy:\n- **CURRY** is a strong candidate because:  \n  - It is a very common word.  \n  - It tests the possibility of a double R (if the secret word has two R\'s, position 4 could be R).  \n  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if R can appear again (e.g., if position 4 is marked ""x"", R is not repeated) and narrow options to **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess.  \n- Given only one position is unknown, this guess could solve the puzzle immediately if correct.\n\n<guess>tags.\n\nBut we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn\'t.\n\nSo I think it\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.\n\nBut since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.\n\nIf it is, we win.

Y** are **CURRY** (with a double R) or **CURVY** (with V).  \n- **CURRY** is chosen as the guess because:  \n  - It is a high-frequency word.  \n  - If correct, it solves the puzzle.  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on the fourth letter will confirm/eliminate **R** (allowing **CURVY** or **CURDY** for the next guess).\n\n<guess>curry</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: choir -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(x) I(x) R(-)\nGuess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: tags.\n\nBut we must ensure that R is not in the absent list, which it isn\'t.\n\nSo I think it\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test a new letter, we can guess a word that has a new letter for position 4, like CURVY.\n\nBut since CURRY is a possibility, and common, I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see: the feedback from ""curly"" showed that L is absent, so if we guess CURRY, we are testing if the fourth letter is R.\n\nIf it is, we win.

We are given the feedback for Guess 5: curry -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
 This means:
   - C at position 1 is correct (✓)
   - U at position 2 is correct (✓)
   - The first R (position 3) is correct (✓)
   - The second R (position 4) is in the word but in the wrong position? Because it's marked as wrong position (-). However, note that the secret word already has R at position 3. Since the second R at position 4 is marked as '-', it indicates that there is no additional R in the word (so the secret word has only one R) and therefore the R at position 4 is not correct and also cannot be placed elsewhere because the secret word already has R at position 3 and doesn't have a second R.

 Alternatively, the '-' for the second R means that the letter R is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have a correct R at position 3, and if the word had another R, then it should have been marked as '-' only if there isn't another R? But the feedback symbol for the second R is '-', meaning the letter is in the word but not here. However, because position 3 already accounts for the R, the feedback for the second R must mean that there is no additional R in the word? 

 But wait: consider Wordle rules: 
   - Each letter is matched independently. 
   - If a letter appears multiple times in the guess, each occurrence is treated separately.

 Scenario: 
   Secret word: CURVY (which has one R at position 3).
   Guess: CURRY (positions: C1, U2, R3, R4, Y5)
   Feedback:
     C1: ✓
     U2: ✓
     R3: ✓ (correct)
     R4: this R is in the word? Well, the secret has one R at position 3, but that R is already accounted for by the first R. Since there is no second R, the second R in the guess should be marked as absent (x). However, the feedback we have is for the second R marked as wrong position ('-'). 

 This is inconsistent unless the secret word has an extra R? 

 Alternatively, let's interpret the feedback literally: 
   - The secret word has the letter R, but it cannot be placed at position 4 (because it's already correctly placed at position 3). But the feedback mark for R4 is '-', which by definition means the letter R is in the word and wrongly positioned. This suggests that the secret word does contain a second R? 

 But wait, the secret word form is CUR_Y, and we now know:
   - The letters must be C, U, R, ?, Y.
   - And we have feedback that the second R (position 4) is present but not at position 4? 

 How can that be? Because position 4 is the only unknown, and if we put R there, it was marked '-', meaning R is in the word but not at 4. But we already know R is at position 3. So the secret word must have two R's? But then where? 

 Alternatively, consider the feedback: 
   C(✓), U(✓), R (at 3)(✓), R (at 4)(-), Y(✓)

 Since position 3 is correct for R, if the secret word has two R's, then the R at position 4 would be marked as '-' only if there is an occurrence of R that isn't at position 3 or 4? 

 But the secret word is CUR_Y: 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: ? 
   Position 5: Y

 The only positions available are 1,2,3,4,5. We have R at 3. So any other R would have to be at position 4? But we tried and got '-', meaning R is present elsewhere? There is no other position! This is a contradiction.

 Therefore, the interpretation should be: the secret word does not have a second R. So the R at position 4 in the guess is not in the word at all? Why then was it marked as '-' (which means present but wrong position) and not 'x'? 

 This suggests a common Wordle feedback rule when there are duplicate letters: 
   - The secret word ""curvy"" has one R at position 3.
   - When we guess ""curry"", the first R (at 3) is matched with the secret R at 3 → ✓.
   - The second R (at 4) has no matching R in the secret word → It should be marked as absent (x). 

 However, the feedback we got for the second R was '-'! 

 There must be an error in the feedback provided? Or in my reasoning.

 But note: the user input: ""Guess 5: curry -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)""

 This suggests that the secret word must have an extra R? 

 Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""curry"", but then both R's would be correct? Then we should have gotten ✓ for both? 

 However, if the secret word is ""curry"", then:
   Position 4: R would match. So we would get ✓ for that too.

 Hence, the secret word is not ""curry"".

 Now, if the secret word is ""curry"", we should have gotten:
   C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

 But we got R(-) for the second R. Therefore, the secret word has R at position 3 but does not have a second R. So the feedback for the second R should be 'x' (absent). 

 The fact that the feedback shows '-' for the second R indicates a potential misunderstanding? Or perhaps the secret word has an R in a different context? 

 But our word is fixed: CUR?Y. The only positions are 1-5.

 Therefore, I suspect there might be an error in the feedback provided by the user? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the '-' for the second R indicates that there is another R in the word but not at position 4? But there is no other position since position 1 is C, 2 is U, 3 is R, 5 is Y. So position 4 is the only unknown. Hence, if the secret word had two R's, then position 4 would have to be R? But we tried and it was marked '-' meaning no? 

 This is confusing.

 But let's assume the feedback is accurate and proceed logically.

 Interpretation of the feedback ""curry"": 
   - C at 1: ✓
   - U at 2: ✓
   - R at 3: ✓ → so the secret word has R at position 3.
   - R at 4: marked as '-' -> this means the secret word contains the letter R, but it is not at position 4. 
   - Y at 5: ✓

 Since the secret word already has R at position 3, the only way for the secret word to contain R (and hence mark the second R as present) is if there is another R elsewhere? But the secret word form is ""C U R ? Y"", so the only other position is position 4. But we tried R and it was not there. 

 How can this be reconciled? 

 Two possibilities:
   1. The secret word has more than one R? But then the other R must be at position 4? But that can't be because we put R at 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That doesn't make sense because if position 4 is R it should be ✓.

   2. Or, there is a misunderstanding of the rules for duplicate letters. 

 In Wordle, for duplicate letters:
   - The first R at position 3 matches the R in the secret word at position 3 → so ✓.
   - Then, the second R at position 4: 
        - If the secret word does not have a second R, then it should be marked absent (x).
        - But if the secret word does have a second R, then if it is at position 4, it would be ✓; if not, then it would be marked as '-' if the secret has a second R elsewhere.

 However, in our case, the secret word form is CUR_Y and we know it has exactly the letters C, U, R, ?, Y. The ? is only one letter. Therefore, the word has only one R? 

 Therefore, the second R in the guess (position 4) should be marked as absent (x).

 But the feedback says R(-). This suggests that the secret word has a second R? But that's impossible because position 4 is the only unknown and we know it couldn't be R? 

 This contradiction implies that the secret word must have a second R? But where? Position 4 cannot be R because if it were, it would have been marked correctly. 

 Unless the secret word is not CUR?Y? But the feedback from Guess 3: curly → C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓) confirms CUR_Y.

 Conclusion: There is an error in the feedback provided. 

 Since we must proceed with the given feedback, we'll accept that the feedback for Guess 5 is as stated: C(✓), U(✓), R(✓), R(-), Y(✓).

 This means:
   - The secret word has an extra R in a position that we haven't seen? But there is no other position. 

 This suggests that the secret word is not CUR?Y? But the feedback from Guess 3 says otherwise.

 Alternatively, perhaps the ""R(-)"" for position 4 means that the letter at position 4 is not R and that the secret word contains an additional R elsewhere? But that cannot be because the secret word has only five letters.

 This is unsolvable without more information.

 However, let's consider the only logical explanation: 
   The secret word has two R's: one at position 3 and one at position 4? But then position 4 would be R, so in the guess ""curry"", we put R at position 4 and the secret also has R at position 4 → should be ✓, but we got R(-), which is a contradiction.

 Therefore, I suspect the feedback for position 4 should have been 'x', not '-'. 

 Given the confusion, we must assume the feedback is as provided and proceed. 

 The feedback for the second R is '-', which by the rules means the letter R is in the word but not here. But we already have an R at position 3. So the secret word must have at least two R's? But where could the second R be? The only possibility is position 4? But it is not? 

 We must conclude that the secret word has an R at position 4? Or not? 

 This is very confusing.

 Perhaps there's an alternate scenario: the secret word is ""curvy"", which has only one R. In the guess ""curry"", the R at position 3 matches → gets ✓. The R at position 4 does not match (since secret has V at 4) and there is no extra R → so it should be marked as 'x' (absent). But the feedback given was '-' for the second R. 

 So strictly following the provided feedback, we have to deduce that there is a second R in the secret word, just not at position 4. 

 But our secret word is CUR_Y. So the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1: C, 2: U, 3: R, 5: Y. So the only place for an additional R would be position 4? 

 Which we tried and it was marked as '-' meaning it is there but not at this position? That is a contradiction.

 Therefore, I will assume the feedback for the second R is a mistake and it should be 'x'. 

 Given that, we try to move forward and make Guess 5 in this new turn? But wait, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after providing feedback for Guess 5? 

 Actually, the user said: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then listed feedback ending with Guess 5: curry -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

 So we have already made Guess 5, and now we are to make Guess 6 (the last guess).

 Now, based on the feedback for Guess 5, we know:
   - C, U, R, Y are all in their correct positions (1,2,3,5).
   - The second R at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position? but logically, it should be absent because there's no other R. 

 Given the fixed pattern CUR_Y, and knowing position 4 cannot be R (because we got '-' but that is of no help), we must try a different letter for position 4.

 Possible candidates: 
   - CURVY (V at position 4)
   - CURDY (D at position 4)
   - Other rare words like CURFY, CURGY (though rare)

 Since CURVY is the most common word, it is the best candidate.

 We are on the 6th guess, so we should make the best guess.

 Therefore, for Guess 6, I guess ""curvy"". 

 If the secret word is ""curvy"", we win. If not, then it must be a less common word like ""curdy"", but we have to try.

 But note: the feedback for Guess 5 said the second R was present but wrong position? Then it would imply the secret word has a second R? So our guess ""curvy"" doesn't have an R at position 4? 

 Let's reconcile: 
   - The secret word must contain a second R that is not at position 4. 
   - But the secret word is CUR_Y, with fixed letters CUR and Y, and one wildcard. 
   - It can only be one letter at position 4. So if it has two R's, position 4 must be R? 

 This is a circular mistake.

 I am forced to ignore the inconsistent feedback and assume that the '-' for the second R was meant to be 'x'. Therefore, position 4 is not R and there is exactly one R in the secret word. 

 Hence, the guess for position 4 should be a letter that isn't R and also not in the absent list.

 Therefore, guess ""curvy"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C(✓): Position 1 is **C**.  
  - R(-): **R** is in the word but *not in position 2*.  
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): **A, N, E** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: choir**  
  - C(✓): Position 1 is **C** (reconfirmed).  
  - H(x), O(x), I(x): **H, O, I** are absent.  
  - R(-): **R** is in the word but *not in position 5*.  
- **Guess 3: curly**  
  - C(✓): Position 1 is **C**.  
  - U(✓): Position 2 is **U**.  
  - R(✓): Position 3 is **R**.  
  - L(x): **L** is absent.  
  - Y(✓): Position 5 is **Y**.  
- **Guess 5: curry**  
  - C(✓), U(✓), R(✓), Y(✓): Positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed.  
  - R(-): The second **R** (at position 4) is in the word but *not in position 4*. This is conflicting since the secret word is **C U R _ Y**, and the only unknown is position 4. Given this:
    - The feedback implies the secret word contains **an additional R** somewhere, but position 4 is *not R*.  
    - Positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are fixed (C, U, R, Y), leaving position 4 as the only unknown.  
    - If position 4 isn’t R, but the word contains another R, it would require a sixth position (impossible). Thus, this feedback must be inconsistent.  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **C U R _ Y**.  
- Position 4 must be a letter that is **not R** and not absent (**A, E, H, I, L, N, O**).  
- Available letters for position 4: **B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z**.  
- Given the feedback inconsistency for Guess 5, the only logical explanation is the secret word **does not have a second R**, so the guess’s fourth R should be marked **absent (x)**. We proceed assuming position 4 is **not R**.  

### Final Candidates:  
- **CURVY** (most common): Uses **V** (untested).  
- **CURDY**: Uses **D** (less common).  

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Attempt):  
- **CURVY** is the best guess because:  
  1. It adheres to the fixed pattern (**C U R _ Y**).  
  2. **V** is a common letter for position 4 in English words.  
  3. If incorrect, it leaves **CURDY** as the only practical alternative.  

<guess>curvy</guess>",curvy,"We are given the feedback for Guess 5: curry -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
 This means:
   - C at position 1 is correct (✓)
   - U at position 2 is correct (✓)
   - The first R (position 3) is correct (✓)
   - The second R (position 4) is in the word but in the wrong position? Because it's marked as wrong position (-). However, note that the secret word already has R at position 3. Since the second R at position 4 is marked as '-', it indicates that there is no additional R in the word (so the secret word has only one R) and therefore the R at position 4 is not correct and also cannot be placed elsewhere because the secret word already has R at position 3 and doesn't have a second R.

 Alternatively, the '-' for the second R means that the letter R is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have a correct R at position 3, and if the word had another R, then it should have been marked as '-' only if there isn't another R? But the feedback symbol for the second R is '-', meaning the letter is in the word but not here. However, because position 3 already accounts for the R, the feedback for the second R must mean that there is no additional R in the word? 

 But wait: consider Wordle rules: 
   - Each letter is matched independently. 
   - If a letter appears multiple times in the guess, each occurrence is treated separately.

 Scenario: 
   Secret word: CURVY (which has one R at position 3).
   Guess: CURRY (positions: C1, U2, R3, R4, Y5)
   Feedback:
     C1: ✓
     U2: ✓
     R3: ✓ (correct)
     R4: this R is in the word? Well, the secret has one R at position 3, but that R is already accounted for by the first R. Since there is no second R, the second R in the guess should be marked as absent (x). However, the feedback we have is for the second R marked as wrong position ('-'). 

 This is inconsistent unless the secret word has an extra R? 

 Alternatively, let's interpret the feedback literally: 
   - The secret word has the letter R, but it cannot be placed at position 4 (because it's already correctly placed at position 3). But the feedback mark for R4 is '-', which by definition means the letter R is in the word and wrongly positioned. This suggests that the secret word does contain a second R? 

 But wait, the secret word form is CUR_Y, and we now know:
   - The letters must be C, U, R, ?, Y.
   - And we have feedback that the second R (position 4) is present but not at position 4? 

 How can that be? Because position 4 is the only unknown, and if we put R there, it was marked '-', meaning R is in the word but not at 4. But we already know R is at position 3. So the secret word must have two R's? But then where? 

 Alternatively, consider the feedback: 
   C(✓), U(✓), R (at 3)(✓), R (at 4)(-), Y(✓)

 Since position 3 is correct for R, if the secret word has two R's, then the R at position 4 would be marked as '-' only if there is an occurrence of R that isn't at position 3 or 4? 

 But the secret word is CUR_Y: 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: ? 
   Position 5: Y

 The only positions available are 1,2,3,4,5. We have R at 3. So any other R would have to be at position 4? But we tried and got '-', meaning R is present elsewhere? There is no other position! This is a contradiction.

 Therefore, the interpretation should be: the secret word does not have a second R. So the R at position 4 in the guess is not in the word at all? Why then was it marked as '-' (which means present but wrong position) and not 'x'?

 However, the feedback we got for the second R was '-'! 

 There must be an error in the feedback provided? Or in my reasoning.

 However, if the secret word is ""curry"", then:

 Hence, the secret word is not ""curry"".

 Now, if the secret word is ""curry"", we should have gotten:
   C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

 But we got R(-) for the second R. Therefore, the secret word has R at position 3 but does not have a second R. So the feedback for the second R should be 'x' (absent).
