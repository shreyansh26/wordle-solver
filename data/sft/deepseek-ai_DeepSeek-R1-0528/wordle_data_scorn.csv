First, I'm starting my first guess in Wordle. I have no prior information since it's the first try. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities.

I recall that good starting words often have a mix of vowels and consonants, with letters that frequently appear in English words. Some popular starting words are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" because they cover multiple common letters.

Let me list out the most common letters in English 5-letter words. According to frequency analysis, the top letters are often E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc. For Wordle, it's better to have no repeated letters to cover more ground.

A good starting word should have:
- At least two vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)

One common recommendation is to use ""ADIEU"" because it has four vowels, but that might not be efficient since it has only one consonant and repeated vowels aren't an issue, but ""ADIEU"" has unique letters: A, D, I, E, U – all vowels except D, which might not be ideal because consonants are important too.

Better options: ""CRANE"" – C, R, A, N, E. That includes common consonants R, N, and vowels A and E.

""SLATE"" – S, L, A, T, E. S and T are very common, plus A and E vowels.

""ROAST"" – R, O, A, S, T. Good coverage.

I can look for words that include E, A, and R since they are highly frequent.

Another one is ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"", which have A, R, I, S, E – that's five common letters.

Let me check ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E. All are high-frequency letters. A and E are vowels, R, S, I (I is a vowel too but often considered a consonant in word games).

Letters: A, R, I, S, E – and all unique.

Frequency: S is very common, E is the most common vowel, A is common, R and I are also common.

Based on Wordle strategies, ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"" are often suggested.

I think I'll go with ""ARISE"" for the first guess.

But let me confirm: the feedback will tell me correct positions, wrong positions, or absence.

Since it's the first guess, any word is fine as long as it's valid.

I should ensure the word is a valid English word. ""ARISE"" is definitely a word.

Another good one is ""OUIJA"", but that has duplicate letters or is less common. No, ""OUIJA"" might not be standard; stick with common words.

So, ""ARISE"" seems solid.

I could start with ""TRACE"" or ""CRATE"".

But ""ARISE"" includes I, which might help distinguish vowels.

I think ""ARISE"" is a good choice.

So, for my first guess, I'll use ""ARISE"".

Now, I need to output it in the specified response format.

First, I have to think step by step within <think> </think> tags.

Then, provide the guess in <guess> guessed-word </guess> format.

So, my reasoning:

- As the first guess, I select a word with high-frequency and unique letters to maximize information gain.

- Chose ""ARISE"" because it contains common vowels A, E, I and common consonants R, S, which can help identify positions or presence in the secret word.

- This should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.
</think>
For the first guess, I need a 5-letter English word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A strong starting word should include multiple vowels and common consonants to cover frequent letters and positions. This helps narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, or x).

I chose ""ARISE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)—all high-frequency letters in English words.
- All letters are unique, allowing me to test five different characters at once.
- Common starting words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are good alternatives, but ""ARISE"" includes I and S, which can help identify vowel placements and common endings.

This guess should provide informative feedback on letter presence and positions, setting up efficient guesses for the next attempts.

We are at the beginning of the game. I need to make the first guess.
 Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback. I should choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 I should avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Some popular starting words are:
 - SLATE: contains S, L, A, T, E (common letters, two vowels)
 - CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T
 - ARISE: A, R, I, S, E (covers three vowels and two common consonants)

 I choose ""ARISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 This should give good feedback on the presence of these common letters.

 However, the previous feedback says: ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""
 This seems like an error message because the model's answer wasn't five letters? But in the context, it's the first guess.

 Actually, looking back: the user said ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then in the feedback, it says ""Model answer is not five letters."" 
 This might be referring to a previous interaction that I don't have. But in this new session, I need to make the first guess.

 Since the instruction says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and mentions previous feedback, but the feedback says the model's answer wasn't five letters, 
 I think I must have made an error in a previous response? But this is the first one.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is simulating and the previous feedback is for a guess that was invalid.

 To clarify: I must provide a valid 5-letter word.

 I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it is a valid 5-letter word.

 But to be safe, let me double-check: ""ARISE"" has 5 letters: A-R-I-S-E.

 So, I'll use that.

 However, the feedback provided says: ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters."" 
 This suggests that in a previous attempt, the model's response was invalid. So now I must make a new guess that is five letters.

 Therefore, I will make sure my guess is exactly five letters.

 Let me choose ""ARISE"".

 If the user meant that the previous guess (which I don't see) was invalid, then I need to make a new one. But since this is the first one in the conversation, I'll proceed.

 So, I'll use that.

 However, the feedback provided says: ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters."" 
 This suggests that in a previous attempt, the model's response was invalid. So now I must make a new guess that is five letters.

 Therefore, I will make sure my guess is exactly five letters.

 Let me choose ""ARISE"".

 If the user meant that the previous guess (which I don't see) was invalid, then I need to make a new one. But since this is the first one in the conversation, I'll proceed.

 Step-by-step:
 1. I need a 5-letter word.
 2. I choose ""ARISE"" because it is 5 letters and a good starter.

We are given feedback from two previous guesses:
- Guess 1: invalid (not five letters), so no useful feedback.
- Guess 2: ""arise"" -> Feedback: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)

Interpretation of feedback for ""arise"":
- A(x): A is not in the secret word at all.
- R(-): R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
- I(x): I is not in the secret word.
- S(-): S is in the secret word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, from Guess 2 (""arise""):
- Letters not present: A, I, E
- Letters present: R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

The secret word does not contain A, I, or E. It does contain R and S.

R is in the word but not in position 2 (the second letter). S is in the word but not in position 4 (the fourth letter).

We have not yet used any other letters, so the secret word has R and S, and avoids A, I, E.

Since we know the word has R and S, and it's a 5-letter word, we need to guess a word that includes R and S and excludes A, I, E.

Also, from the positions:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that can give us more information about the positions of R and S, as well as other letters.

Common letters we can try: since E and A are out, we can try other vowels or common consonants. Remaining vowels: O, U (and some Y). Consonants: many available, e.g., T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word: A, I, E.

So, for the next guess, I should:
1. Include R and S (since they are known to be present).
2. Avoid A, I, E.
3. Use other letters to maximize information.

Moreover, since R and S are misplaced, we can try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since not position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S: not position 4, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note that in the word, R and S have specific positions, and we don't know yet.

To get more information, I could choose a word that places R and S in positions that are possible and test other common letters.

I must also consider that the word must exist.

Common words that have R and S and exclude A, I, E:
For example, words like ""rusts"" but that has duplicate S, which might not help. We should avoid duplicates initially to cover more letters.

Better to have unique letters where possible.

Consider ""curs"" but that is 4 letters. Not 5.

5-letter words: try ""TORUS"", but T, O, R, U, S. Includes O and U (vowels), and T common consonant.

""TORUS"": T, O, R, U, S.

But we don't know if O or U are present.

Another option: ""CURST"" or just ""CURBS""? ""CURBS"" has B and S.

List some words:
- ""forms""
- ""storm""
- ""corns""
- ""ports""
- etc.

But they might include E? ""forms"" is F,O,R,M,S - no A,I,E - good.

Similarly, ""storm"": S,T,O,R,M.

""storm"" has S at position 1, which is possible, and R at position 4? Position: S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5).

But from feedback: S cannot be in position 4? No, in ""arise"", S was in position 4 and it was marked wrong position, meaning S is in the word but not at 4. But S can be at other positions.

In ""storm"", S is at position 1, which hasn't been tested yet. So that could be a good guess.

Also, R is at position 4; note that we only know R was wrong in position 2, but it could be at 4? Yes.

Similarly, we don't have information on T,O,M.

Therefore, guessing ""storm"" might give good feedback.

Alternatives: ""curds"", ""durst"", ""fours"", etc.

I think ""storm"" is a good candidate because:
- It includes S and R (required)
- Avoids A,I,E
- Letters S and R are placed in new positions: S at 1, R at 4 (previously S was tried at 4, now at 1; R was tried at 2, now at 4)
- New common letters: T, O, M.

Thus, ""storm"" would reveal:
- If S is at position 1? If correct, we get ✓ for S at position 1.
- Similarly for R at position 4? If correct, ✓.
- Or if not, we get other clues.

Moreover, it tests T, O, M.

So, I'll go with ""storm"".

But wait: in ""storm"", S is at position 1. Previous feedback said S cannot be at position 4, but it can be at position 1.

Similarly, R was wrong at position 2, so position 4 is fresh.

Therefore, let's choose ""storm"".

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1 was invalid (not five letters), so it provides no useful information.
- Guess 2 (""arise"") received feedback: A(x), R(-), I(x), S(-), E(x). This means:
  - A, I, and E are **not** in the secret word at all.
  - R **is** in the word but not in the second position.
  - S **is** in the word but not in the fourth position.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R and S, but avoids A, I, E.
- R cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.
- We need to maximize information by testing R and S in new positions while adding new, common consonants and vowels not yet tested (e.g., O, U, T, N, L, etc.).

For the next guess, I chose ""storm"":
- It includes R and S (required to confirm positions or mispositions).
- It avoids A, I, E.
- It introduces T, O, and M, which are common letters.
- Positions: 
  - S at position 1 (fresh position for testing, since previous S was in position 4).
  - R at position 4 (fresh position for testing, since previous R was in position 2).

This guess will help:
- Reveal if S is correctly placed at position 1 or if it's misplaced.
- Reveal if R is correctly placed at position 4 or if it's misplaced.
- Test whether T, O, or M are in the word and in what positions.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I'm starting my first guess in Wordle. I have no prior information since it's the first try. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities.

I recall that good starting words often have a mix of vowels and consonants, with letters that frequently appear in English words. Some popular starting words are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" because they cover multiple common letters.

Let me list out the most common letters in English 5-letter words. According to frequency analysis, the top letters are often E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc. For Wordle, it's better to have no repeated letters to cover more ground.

A good starting word should have:
- At least two vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)

One common recommendation is to use ""ADIEU"" because it has four vowels, but that might not be efficient since it has only one consonant and repeated vowels aren't an issue, but ""ADIEU"" has unique letters: A, D, I, E, U – all vowels except D, which might not be ideal because consonants are important too.

Better options: ""CRANE"" – C, R, A, N, E. That includes common consonants R, N, and vowels A and E.

""SLATE"" – S, L, A, T, E. S and T are very common, plus A and E vowels.

""ROAST"" – R, O, A, S, T. Good coverage.

I can look for words that include E, A, and R since they are highly frequent.

Another one is ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"", which have A, R, I, S, E – that's five common letters.

Let me check ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E. All are high-frequency letters. A and E are vowels, R, S, I (I is a vowel too but often considered a consonant in word games).

Letters: A, R, I, S, E – and all unique.

Frequency: S is very common, E is the most common vowel, A is common, R and I are also common.

Based on Wordle strategies, ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"" are often suggested.

I think I'll go with ""ARISE"" for the first guess.

But let me confirm: the feedback will tell me correct positions, wrong positions, or absence.

Since it's the first guess, any word is fine as long as it's valid.

I should ensure the word is a valid English word. ""ARISE"" is definitely a word.

Another good one is ""OUIJA"", but that has duplicate letters or is less common. No, ""OUIJA"" might not be standard; stick with common words.

So, ""ARISE"" seems solid.

I could start with ""TRACE"" or ""CRATE"".

But ""ARISE"" includes I, which might help distinguish vowels.

I think ""ARISE"" is a good choice.

So, for my first guess, I'll use ""ARISE"".

Now, I need to output it in the specified response format.

First, I have to think step by step within <think>tags.

Then, provide the guess in

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. I need to make the first guess.
 Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback. I should choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 I should avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Some popular starting words are:
 - SLATE: contains S, L, A, T, E (common letters, two vowels)
 - CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T
 - ARISE: A, R, I, S, E (covers three vowels and two common consonants)

 I choose ""ARISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 This should give good feedback on the presence of these common letters.

 However, the previous feedback says: ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""
 This seems like an error message because the model's answer wasn't five letters? But in the context, it's the first guess.

 Actually, looking back: the user said ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then in the feedback, it says ""Model answer is not five letters."" 
 This might be referring to a previous interaction that I don't have. But in this new session, I need to make the first guess.

 Since the instruction says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and mentions previous feedback, but the feedback says the model's answer wasn't five letters, 
 I think I must have made an error in a previous response? But this is the first one.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is simulating and the previous feedback is for a guess that was invalid.

 To clarify: I must provide a valid 5-letter word.

 I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it is a valid 5-letter word.

 But to be safe, let me double-check: ""ARISE"" has 5 letters: A-R-I-S-E.

 So, I'll use that.

 However, the feedback provided says: ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters."" 
 This suggests that in a previous attempt, the model's response was invalid. So now I must make a new guess that is five letters.

 Therefore, I will make sure my guess is exactly five letters.

 Let me choose ""ARISE"".

 If the user meant that the previous guess (which I don't see) was invalid, then I need to make a new one. But since this is the first one in the conversation, I'll proceed.

 Step-by-step:
 1. I need a 5-letter word.
 2. I choose ""ARISE"" because it is 5 letters and a good starter.

We have not yet used any other letters, so the secret word has R and S, and avoids A, I, E.

Since we know the word has R and S, and it's a 5-letter word, we need to guess a word that includes R and S and excludes A, I, E.

Also, from the positions:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that can give us more information about the positions of R and S, as well as other letters.

Common letters we can try: since E and A are out, we can try other vowels or common consonants. Remaining vowels: O, U (and some Y). Consonants: many available, e.g., T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word: A, I, E.

So, for the next guess, I should:
1. Include R and S (since they are known to be present).
2. Avoid A, I, E.
3. Use other letters to maximize information.

Moreover, since R and S are misplaced, we can try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since not position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S: not position 4, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note that in the word, R and S have specific positions, and we don't know yet.

To get more information, I could choose a word that places R and S in positions that are possible and test other common letters.

I must also consider that the word must exist.

Common words that have R and S and exclude A, I, E:
For example, words like ""rusts"" but that has duplicate S, which might not help. We should avoid duplicates initially to cover more letters.

Better to have unique letters where possible.

Consider ""curs"" but that is 4 letters. Not 5.

5-letter words: try ""TORUS"", but T, O, R, U, S. Includes O and U (vowels), and T common consonant.

""TORUS"": T, O, R, U, S.

But we don't know if O or U are present.

Another option: ""CURST"" or just ""CURBS""? ""CURBS"" has B and S.

List some words:
- ""forms""
- ""storm""
- ""corns""
- ""ports""
- etc.

But they might include E? ""forms"" is F,O,R,M,S - no A,I,E - good.

Similarly, ""storm"": S,T,O,R,M.

""storm"" has S at position 1, which is possible, and R at position 4? Position: S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5).

But from feedback: S cannot be in position 4? No, in ""arise"", S was in position 4 and it was marked wrong position, meaning S is in the word but not at 4. But S can be at other positions.

In ""storm"", S is at position 1, which hasn't been tested yet. So that could be a good guess.

Also, R is at position 4; note that we only know R was wrong in position 2, but it could be at 4? Yes.

Similarly, we don't have information on T,O,M.

Therefore, guessing ""storm"" might give good feedback.

Alternatives: ""curds"", ""durst"", ""fours"", etc.

I think ""storm"" is a good candidate because:
- It includes S and R (required)
- Avoids A,I,E
- Letters S and R are placed in new positions: S at 1, R at 4 (previously S was tried at 4, now at 1; R was tried at 2, now at 4)
- New common letters: T, O, M.

Thus, ""storm"" would reveal:
- If S is at position 1? If correct, we get ✓ for S at position 1.
- Similarly for R at position 4? If correct, ✓.
- Or if not, we get other clues.

Moreover, it tests T, O, M.

So, I'll go with ""storm"".

But wait: in ""storm"", S is at position 1. Previous feedback said S cannot be at position 4, but it can be at position 1.

Similarly, R was wrong at position 2, so position 4 is fresh.

Therefore, let's choose ""storm"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1 was invalid (not five letters), so it provides no useful information.
- Guess 2 (""arise"") received feedback: A(x), R(-), I(x), S(-), E(x). This means:
  - A, I, and E are **not** in the secret word at all.
  - R **is** in the word but not in the second position.
  - S **is** in the word but not in the fourth position.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R and S, but avoids A, I, E.
- R cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.
- We need to maximize information by testing R and S in new positions while adding new, common consonants and vowels not yet tested (e.g., O, U, T, N, L, etc.).

For the next guess, I chose ""storm"":
- It includes R and S (required to confirm positions or mispositions).
- It avoids A, I, E.
- It introduces T, O, and M, which are common letters.
- Positions: 
  - S at position 1 (fresh position for testing, since previous S was in position 4).
  - R at position 4 (fresh position for testing, since previous R was in position 2).

This guess will help:
- Reveal if S is correctly placed at position 1 or if it's misplaced.
- Reveal if R is correctly placed at position 4 or if it's misplaced.
- Test whether T, O, or M are in the word and in what positions.

Some popular starting words are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" because they cover multiple common letters.\n\nLet me list out the most common letters in English 5-letter words. According to frequency analysis, the top letters are often E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc. For Wordle, it\'s better to have no repeated letters to cover more ground.\n\nA good starting word should have:\n- At least two vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)\n- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)\n\nOne common recommendation is to use ""ADIEU"" because it has four vowels, but that might not be efficient since it has only one consonant and repeated vowels aren\'t an issue, but ""ADIEU"" has unique letters: A, D, I, E, U – all vowels except D, which might not be ideal because consonants are important too.\n\nBetter options: ""CRANE"" – C, R, A, N, E. That includes common consonants R, N, and vowels A and E.\n\n""SLATE"" – S, L, A, T, E. S and T are very common, plus A and E vowels.\n\n""ROAST"" – R, O, A, S, T. Good coverage.\n\nI can look for words that include E, A, and R since they are highly frequent.\n\nAnother one is ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"", which have A, R, I, S, E – that\'s five common letters.\n\nLet me check ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E. All are high-frequency letters. A and E are vowels, R, S, I (I is a vowel too but often considered a consonant in word games).\n\nLetters: A, R, I, S, E – and all unique.\n\nFrequency: S is very common, E is the most common vowel, A is common, R and I are also common.\n\nBased on Wordle strategies, ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"" are often suggested.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""ARISE"" for the first guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: the feedback will tell me correct positions, wrong positions, or absence.\n\nSince it\'s the first guess, any word is fine as long as it\'s valid.\n\nI should ensure the word is a valid English word.

We are given feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters), so no useful information.
- Guess 2: ""arise"" -> A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x) 
  Meaning: 
    - A, I, E are not in the word.
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.
    - S is in the word but not in position 4.
- Guess 3: ""storm"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)
  Meaning:
    - S is correct and in position 1 (since ✓).
    - T is not in the word at all (x).
    - O is correct and in position 3 (✓).
    - R is correct and in position 4 (✓).
    - M is not in the word at all (x).

From Guess 3:
- S(✓) at position 1: So the secret word starts with S.
- O(✓) at position 3: So the third letter is O.
- R(✓) at position 4: So the fourth letter is R.
- T(x) and M(x): T and M are not in the word.

From Guess 2, we also know:
- A, I, E are not in the word.
- R is not in position 2 (but now we know it's in position 4, which matches).
- S is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 1).

Therefore, the secret word we have so far: 
Position 1: S
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 2 and 5 are unknown.

We know letters that are NOT in the word: A, E, I, T, M.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has O as the third letter, R as the fourth letter, and avoids A, E, I, T, M.

So the pattern is: S _ O R _

We need to fill position 2 and position 5.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except A,E,I,T,M. Also exclude letters we already know (S,O,R are in the word, but positions are fixed, so we can reuse only if not already placed? No, since S,O,R are fixed in their positions and may not appear elsewhere? But we don't know for sure. From the feedback:

In ""arise"", R was marked ""wrong position"" and since R is in position 4 now, which wasn't position 2, so R might not be duplicated. Similarly, S is at position 1, and was not at position 4, so no duplication.

However, we should consider that the word might not have duplicates unless indicated. Since we haven't found duplicates, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

Common letters remaining: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But vowels: only O is confirmed; since A,E,I are out, vowels could be O,U,Y.

But we have O in position 3, so position 2 and 5 could be consonants or other vowels.

The word must be English, common.

Possible words: S _ O R _

Options:
- SCORN? C and N: both not excluded.
  Pattern: S C O R N -> positions: S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- SHORN? S H O R N
- SPORT? But O is already at position 3, and T is excluded. T is not allowed.
- SCOUR? S C O U R: but R is already at position 4? Position 5 would be blank? Not: S(1), C(2), O(3), U(4), R(5)? But we need R at position 4, so U cannot be at position 4 with R at 4? Only one letter per position.

Word must be S _ O R _ so five letters: positions 1=S, 2=?, 3=O, 4=R, 5=?

So for SCOUR: if S,C,O,U,R - this would be position 1=S, 2=C, 3=O, 4=U, 5=R -> this doesn't have R at position 4; position 4 is U. So not matching.

Therefore, we need S, ?, O, R, ? with fourth position R.

Possible words:
- SCORN: S C O R N
- SHORN: S H O R N
- SWORN: S W O R N
- SNORE: But E is excluded; SNORE has E? S N O R E -> E is at end, but E is excluded. So not.
- SHORT: Has T? T is excluded. No.
- SPORE: Has E and E is excluded. No.
- SHORL: Mineral, but rare? Might not be accepted.
- SHORL is not common.

Common words: also ""SORRY"" but has double R? But R is already at position 4, and position 2 could be O? No: S O (but position 2 is O? but position 3 is O? duplicate O possible?) Let's see pattern: position 1=S, position 2=?, position 3=O, position 4=R, position 5=? 

If SORRY: S O R R Y -> position 1=S, position 2=O, position 3=R, position 4=R, position 5=Y. But position 3 is supposed to be O? Instead it has R at position 3? Not matching; we have O at position 3.

So SORRY doesn't fit.

Another word: ""SNORT"" but T is excluded.

So without T, M, etc.

Options: SCORN, SHORN, SWORN, and perhaps ""SHOR?"" but not.

""BOORS"" not matching pattern.

""DOORS"" has O at position 3? D O O R S -> position 3=O, position 4=R? D O O R S: 1=D, 2=O, 3=O, 4=R, 5=S? But not S at position 1. We need S at 1.

So let's list words matching S?OR? 

Common ones: SCORN, SHORN, SWORN.

Also: ""SPOOR"" but double O; S P O O R -> positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=O, 4=O, 5=R? But we need R at position 4? Here position 4 and 5 are O and R? No: S P O O R = S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), R(5). Position 4 should be R but it's O? Not matching.

Other options: ""STORE"" but E excluded and T excluded.

Therefore, likely candidates: SCORN, SHORN, SWORN.

Now, we need to guess which one. We have no information on position 2 and 5 yet, so we can guess one of them.

To maximize information, since we have three possibilities, we can guess SCORN for example, which includes C and N.

But we know that C and N might be in or not; in ""storm"" we tested N? No, ""storm"" had T,O,M,S,R. We haven't tested C,N,H,W, etc.

Perhaps guessing SCORN would test C and N.

If we guess SHORN, it tests H and N.

Similarly, SWORN tests W and N.

Let's note that in all cases, N is at position 5.

So N is common. Position 2 varies: C for SCORN, H for SHORN, W for SWORN.

We don't know which letter is correct for position 2.

Since O and R are confirmed at positions 3 and 4, and S at 1, position 5 must be a valid letter.

A guess that uses a different set might help.

We have only 3 guesses left? Let's count: previously guess 1,2,3, and now guess 4. We have 6 tries total, so this is guess 4.

Perhaps we can check if position 5 has N.

But in any case, I think SCORN, SHORN, SWORN are the main options.

Another word: ""SHOED"" not due to E and D.

Or ""SCORE"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""SNORE"" E excluded.

So not many options.

""SHOWN"": S H O W N? Positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=O, 4=W, 5=N? But we need position 4 to be R? Here it's W, so not. Must have R at position 4.

Therefore, only words like S?ORN where the fourth letter is R, third letter O.

So: S-?-O-R-? with last letter N? SCORN, SHORN, SWORN all end with N.

Are there words that do not end with N? For example, ""SHOR?"" not really.

""SOARS"" but S at position 1 and 5? Also O at position 3, but position 4 should be R? Here position 4 is R? S O A R S - position 3 is A? Not O. ""SOURS"": S O U R S - position 3 is U, not O. We have position 3 must be O.

Only S?ORN words seem to fit.

Unless I'm missing: ""BOORS"" again not.

""SOFAR"" not due to F and A excluded.

Therefore, the word is likely SCORN, SHORN, or SWORN.

We can test one of them. Since N is common in position 5, let's guess SHORN for example, to test H.

But to be thorough, we guess a word that helps distinguish.

We have no more clues, so I'll pick SCORN as it uses C, which is common.

If we guess SCORN and it's correct, it shows.

If not, feedback will tell.

But since the pattern is tight, let's go with SCORN.

But earlier ""storm"" feedback showed S,O,R correct, so if SCORN has S,C,O,R,N and positions: 
- Position 1: S (correct as per previous)
- Position 2: C (unknown)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 4: R (correct)
- Position 5: N (unknown)

The feedback for position 2 and 5 will reveal.

Similarly for any.

To save guesses, we can assume N is present since all common words end with N.

But let's proceed with SCORN.

Perhaps we can try a word that tests a different vowel or something, but no vowel needed? The word has O already.

Other constraints: letters left must not include T,M,A,E,I, and must be valid.

So I go with ""scorn"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- Guess 2 (""arise"") eliminated A, I, and E from being in the word (all marked as absent). However, it confirmed that R and S are present but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively (since R was misplaced at position 2, and S was misplaced at position 4).
- Guess 3 (""storm"") built on this:
  - S is correct and in position 1 (✓ for S).
  - T is absent from the word (x).
  - O is correct and in position 3 (✓).
  - R is correct and in position 4 (✓).
  - M is absent from the word (x).

**Key Deductions from All Feedback:**
- The secret word has the first letter S, third letter O, and fourth letter R (fixed positions from Guess 3).
- The second and fifth letters are unknown.
- Eliminated letters: A, E, I, T, M (from all feedback).
- Letters that must be avoided: Any word containing A, E, I, T, or M is impossible.
- Known pattern: The secret word must be of the form `S _ O R _`, where `_` represents the unknown second and fifth positions.
- Possible letters for the second and fifth positions: Common consonants or vowels not yet eliminated (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, W, Y).
- Common English words fitting this pattern and avoiding eliminated letters include SCORN, SHORN, and SWORN (all ending with N), with variations in positions 2 and 5.

**Strategy for This Guess:**
- Since only positions 2 and 5 are unknown, I need to test likely candidates while maximizing information gain about the remaining letters.
- ""SCORN"" is chosen because:
  - It tests C and N (common, untested letters).
  - If correct, it wins the game immediately.
  - If incorrect, feedback on C (position 2) and N (position 5) will narrow down the possibilities—e.g., between SHORN (H instead of C) or SWORN (W instead of C).
- This guess also respects the feedback constraints: Avoids A, E, I, T, M, and adheres to the fixed positions for S, O, and R.

Thus, the guess is ""scorn"".

<guess>scorn</guess>",scorn,"We are given feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters), so no useful information.
- Guess 2: ""arise"" -> A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(x) 
  Meaning: 
    - A, I, E are not in the word.
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.
    - S is in the word but not in position 4.
- Guess 3: ""storm"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)
  Meaning:
    - S is correct and in position 1 (since ✓).
    - T is not in the word at all (x).
    - O is correct and in position 3 (✓).
    - R is correct and in position 4 (✓).
    - M is not in the word at all (x).

From Guess 3:
- S(✓) at position 1: So the secret word starts with S.
- O(✓) at position 3: So the third letter is O.
- R(✓) at position 4: So the fourth letter is R.
- T(x) and M(x): T and M are not in the word.

From Guess 2, we also know:
- A, I, E are not in the word.
- R is not in position 2 (but now we know it's in position 4, which matches).
- S is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 1).

Therefore, the secret word we have so far: 
Position 1: S
Position 3: O
Position 4: R
Position 2 and 5 are unknown.

We know letters that are NOT in the word: A, E, I, T, M.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has O as the third letter, R as the fourth letter, and avoids A, E, I, T, M.

So the pattern is: S _ O R _

We need to fill position 2 and position 5.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except A,E,I,T,M. Also exclude letters we already know (S,O,R are in the word, but positions are fixed, so we can reuse only if not already placed? No, since S,O,R are fixed in their positions and may not appear elsewhere? But we don't know for sure. From the feedback:

In ""arise"", R was marked ""wrong position"" and since R is in position 4 now, which wasn't position 2, so R might not be duplicated. Similarly, S is at position 1, and was not at position 4, so no duplication.

However, we should consider that the word might not have duplicates unless indicated. Since we haven't found duplicates, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

Common letters remaining: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But vowels: only O is confirmed; since A,E,I are out, vowels could be O,U,Y.

But we have O in position 3, so position 2 and 5 could be consonants or other vowels.

The word must be English, common.

Possible words: S _ O R _

Options:
- SCORN? C and N: both not excluded.
  Pattern: S C O R N -> positions: S(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
- SHORN? S H O R N
- SPORT? But O is already at position 3, and T is excluded. T is not allowed.
- SCOUR? S C O U R: but R is already at position 4? Position 5 would be blank? Not: S(1), C(2), O(3), U(4), R(5)? But we need R at position 4, so U cannot be at position 4 with R at 4? Only one letter per position.

Word must be S _ O R _ so five letters: positions 1=S, 2=?, 3=O, 4=R, 5=?

So for SCOUR: if S,C,O,U,R - this would be position 1=S, 2=C, 3=O, 4=U, 5=R -> this doesn't have R at position 4; position 4 is U. So not matching.

Therefore, we need S, ?, O, R, ? with fourth position R.

Possible words:
- SCORN: S C O R N
- SHORN: S H O R N
- SWORN: S W O R N
- SNORE: But E is excluded; SNORE has E? S N O R E -> E is at end, but E is excluded. So not.
- SHORT: Has T? T is excluded. No.
- SPORE: Has E and E is excluded. No.
- SHORL: Mineral, but rare? Might not be accepted.
- SHORL is not common.

Common words: also ""SORRY"" but has double R? But R is already at position 4, and position 2 could be O? No: S O (but position 2 is O? but position 3 is O? duplicate O possible?) Let's see pattern: position 1=S, position 2=?, position 3=O, position 4=R, position 5=? 

If SORRY: S O R R Y -> position 1=S, position 2=O, position 3=R, position 4=R, position 5=Y. But position 3 is supposed to be O? Instead it has R at position 3? Not matching; we have O at position 3.

So SORRY doesn't fit.

Another word: ""SNORT"" but T is excluded.

So without T, M, etc.

Options: SCORN, SHORN, SWORN, and perhaps ""SHOR?"" but not.

""BOORS"" not matching pattern.

""DOORS"" has O at position 3? D O O R S -> position 3=O, position 4=R? D O O R S: 1=D, 2=O, 3=O, 4=R, 5=S? But not S at position 1. We need S at 1.

So let's list words matching S?OR? 

Common ones: SCORN, SHORN, SWORN.

Also: ""SPOOR"" but double O; S P O O R -> positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=O, 4=O, 5=R? But we need R at position 4? Here position 4 and 5 are O and R? No: S P O O R = S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), R(5). Position 4 should be R but it's O? Not matching.

Other options: ""STORE"" but E excluded and T excluded.

Therefore, likely candidates: SCORN, SHORN, SWORN.

Now, we need to guess which one. We have no information on position 2 and 5 yet, so we can guess one of them.

To maximize information, since we have three possibilities, we can guess SCORN for example, which includes C and N.

But we know that C and N might be in or not; in ""storm"" we tested N? No, ""storm"" had T,O,M,S,R. We haven't tested C,N,H,W, etc.

Perhaps guessing SCORN would test C and N.

If we guess SHORN, it tests H and N.

Similarly, SWORN tests W and N.

Let's note that in all cases, N is at position 5.

So N is common. Position 2 varies: C for SCORN, H for SHORN, W for SWORN.

We don't know which letter is correct for position 2.

Since O and R are confirmed at positions 3 and 4, and S at 1, position 5 must be a valid letter.

A guess that uses a different set might help.

We have only 3 guesses left? Let's count: previously guess 1,2,3, and now guess 4. We have 6 tries total, so this is guess 4.

Perhaps we can check if position 5 has N.

But in any case, I think SCORN, SHORN, SWORN are the main options.

Another word: ""SHOED"" not due to E and D.

Or ""SCORE"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""SNORE"" E excluded.

So not many options.

""SHOWN"": S H O W N? Positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=O, 4=W, 5=N? But we need position 4 to be R? Here it's W, so not. Must have R at position 4.

Therefore, only words like S?ORN where the fourth letter is R, third letter O.

So: S-?-O-R-? with last letter N? SCORN, SHORN, SWORN all end with N.

Are there words that do not end with N? For example, ""SHOR?"" not really.

""SOARS"" but S at position 1 and 5? Also O at position 3, but position 4 should be R? Here position 4 is R? S O A R S - position 3 is A? Not O. ""SOURS"": S O U R S - position 3 is U, not O. We have position 3 must be O.

Only S?ORN words seem to fit.

Unless I'm missing: ""BOORS"" again not.

""SOFAR"" not due to F and A excluded.

Therefore, the word is likely SCORN, SHORN, or SWORN.

We can test one of them. Since N is common in position 5, let's guess SHORN for example, to test H.

But to be thorough, we guess a word that helps distinguish.

We have no more clues, so I'll pick SCORN as it uses C, which is common.

If we guess SCORN and it's correct, it shows.

If not, feedback will tell.

But since the pattern is tight, let's go with SCORN.

But earlier ""storm"" feedback showed S,O,R correct, so if SCORN has S,C,O,R,N and positions: 
- Position 1: S (correct as per previous)
- Position 2: C (unknown)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 4: R (correct)
- Position 5: N (unknown)

The feedback for position 2 and 5 will reveal.

Similarly for any.

To save guesses, we can assume N is present since all common words end with N.

But let's proceed with SCORN.

Perhaps we can try a word that tests a different vowel or something, but no vowel needed? The word has O already.

Other constraints: letters left must not include T,M,A,E,I, and must be valid.

So I go with ""scorn"".Based on the previous feedback:

- Guess 2 (""arise"") eliminated A, I, and E from being in the word (all marked as absent). However, it confirmed that R and S are present but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively (since R was misplaced at position 2, and S was misplaced at position 4).
- Guess 3 (""storm"") built on this:
  - S is correct and in position 1 (✓ for S).
  - T is absent from the word (x).
  - O is correct and in position 3 (✓).
  - R is correct and in position 4 (✓).
  - M is absent from the word (x).

**Key Deductions from All Feedback:**
- The secret word has the first letter S, third letter O, and fourth letter R (fixed positions from Guess 3).
- The second and fifth letters are unknown.
- Eliminated letters: A, E, I, T, M (from all feedback).
- Letters that must be avoided: Any word containing A, E, I, T, or M is impossible.
- Known pattern: The secret word must be of the form `S _ O R _`, where `_` represents the unknown second and fifth positions.
- Possible letters for the second and fifth positions: Common consonants or vowels not yet eliminated (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, W, Y).
- Common English words fitting this pattern and avoiding eliminated letters include SCORN, SHORN, and SWORN (all ending with N), with variations in positions 2 and 5.

**Strategy for This Guess:**
- Since only positions 2 and 5 are unknown, I need to test likely candidates while maximizing information gain about the remaining letters.
- ""SCORN"" is chosen because:
  - It tests C and N (common, untested letters).
  - If correct, it wins the game immediately.
  - If incorrect, feedback on C (position 2) and N (position 5) will narrow down the possibilities—e.g., between SHORN (H instead of C) or SWORN (W instead of C).
- This guess also respects the feedback constraints: Avoids A, E, I, T, M, and adheres to the fixed positions for S, O, and R.

Thus, the guess is ""scorn"".",Guess 4: scorn -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
