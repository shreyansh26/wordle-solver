Alright, let's tackle this Wordle-like game. I'm starting with my first guess. Since it's the first attempt, I want a word that uses common letters and provides a broad range of feedback. After considering common vowels and consonants, I think ""CRANE"" fits well. 

It includes common vowels 'A' and 'E', and consonants 'C', 'R', 'N' which are frequently used in English. This distribution should give me useful clues about which letters are present and their positions. For instance, if the secret word contains any of these letters, I'll get either a ✓ for correct position or a - for wrong position. If any are missing, I know to exclude them from future guesses. This strategy maximizes initial information gain with minimal bias toward specific word patterns.

For the first guess, I'll start with a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it uses letters that frequently appear in English words: C, R, A, N, E. This will help identify the presence and positions of several key letters quickly. 

The feedback after this guess will indicate:
- If any of these letters are in the secret word (✓ or - symbols)
- If none appear (x symbols)
- Which positions might be correct

This sets a solid foundation for narrowing down the word in subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- The first letter is C (correct position).
- The second letter is R (correct position).
- The letters A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with ""CR"" and does not contain A, N, or E.

We know:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- The first two letters are C and R.
- The remaining three letters (positions 3, 4, and 5) are to be guessed, and they cannot be A, N, or E.

We need to think of a word that starts with ""CR"" and uses other letters (avoiding A, N, E). Also, we have 6 tries total, so we can use this guess to test possible letters for the remaining positions.

Common letters that might appear after ""CR"" include: I, O, U, S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the remaining three positions to get more information.

Possible words starting with ""CR"":
- CRISP
- CRUMB
- CRUST
- CROWD
- CROWN
- CRYPT

But note: we must avoid A, N, E. So words like ""CRANE"" (already tried) or ""CRANE"" are out.

We also know that the word does not contain A, N, E, so we can eliminate any word with those letters.

Let's think of a word that uses common letters we haven't tried yet. We have 3 positions to fill (3rd, 4th, 5th). We can try to include vowels that are still possible (like I, O, U) and common consonants.

Since we have two letters fixed (C and R) and three unknown, we can try a word that has a variety of letters to test.

I am considering ""CRISP"":
- C (already known correct) -> ✓
- R (already known correct) -> ✓
- I: if it's in the word, we'll know (and if in the right position, we get ✓, else -)
- S: same
- P: same

But note: we don't know if the word has I, S, or P. This guess will help us find out.

Alternatively, we could try ""CROUP"" or ""CRUSH"", but let's see.

Another idea: since we have two fixed, we might try to use a word that has letters that are common in the third, fourth, and fifth positions.

But without more information, we need to test multiple possibilities.

I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses I (a common vowel) and S, P (common consonants).
- It avoids A, N, E.

Alternatively, ""CRUSH"" or ""CRUST"" might be good too.

But note: we have to avoid E, so ""CREST"" is out because it has E.

Let me list some words starting with ""CR"" without A, N, E:
- CRISP
- CRUMB
- CRUST
- CROWD
- CROWN
- CRYPT
- CRUSH
- CROUP
- CROOK
- CROON

We can choose one that has letters that are common and we haven't tested.

I think ""CRISP"" is a solid choice because it tests I, S, and P.

So I'll go with ""CRISP"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that the third, fourth, and fifth letters are not A, N, or E. So in ""CRISP"", we are testing I in the third position, S in the fourth, and P in the fifth.

If we get feedback, we can then adjust.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different vowel, like O or U. But I think I is a good vowel to test.

Another common word is ""CRONY"", but that has Y and we don't know about Y.

But ""CRISP"" is more common.

I'll go with ""CRISP"".

So the next guess is ""CRISP"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** and **R** are correct and in the right positions (1st and 2nd letters).
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word at all.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""CR"".
- The remaining letters (positions 3, 4, and 5) are not A, N, or E, and must be different letters.
- I need to test common letters for positions 3–5 to gather more clues.

For the next guess:
- I'll choose a word starting with ""CR"" that avoids A, N, E and tests new vowels/consonants.
- ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because:
  - It uses **I** (a common vowel not yet tested) and **S**/**P** (common consonants).
  - This maximizes information gain for positions 3, 4, and 5.
