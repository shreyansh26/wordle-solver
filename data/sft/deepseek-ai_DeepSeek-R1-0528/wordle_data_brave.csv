 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

We previously guessed ""crane"" and received feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - E is in the secret word, but note: in ""crane"", E is at position 5, and we have E(✓), meaning it's also in the correct position? Let me clarify the feedback format.

 The feedback was given as:
   C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

 So for each position:
   Position 1: C -> x (not in the word)
   Position 2: R -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
   Position 3: A -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
   Position 4: N -> x (not in the word)
   Position 5: E -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)

 Therefore, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:
   _ R A _ E

 So the word is of the form: ? R A ? E

 We also know that C and N are not in the word.

 Our next guess should:
   1. Have the form: second letter R, third letter A, fifth letter E.
   2. Avoid using C and N because they are not in the word.
   3. Include new letters to test for the missing positions (1 and 4).

 We need to find valid 5-letter English words of the form [letter1] R A [letter4] E.

 Some possibilities:
   Let me think of common words: 
     ""GRACE"" - but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).
     ""TRACE"" - T is new? But T is okay, and C is not allowed? Wait, in ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C is at position 4, but we know C is absent? Feedback said C(x) meaning C is not in the word. So ""trace"" has C which is ruled out.

   How about ""BRAVE""? -> B R A V E. Structure: B (new), R, A, V (new), E. This fits the pattern.

   Other words:
     ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E: G and D are new.
     ""GRATE"" -> G R A T E: G and T are new.
     ""CRATE"" -> but C is ruled out.

   Also note that we cannot use letters we know are absent: C and N.

 Let's consider the letters we can use. We should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but we don't have any duplicates in our pattern.

 Since the positions are fixed for R, A, and E, we can generate a word.

 Possible words: 
   ""BRAVE"" (B and V)
   ""GRADE"" (G and D)
   ""GRATE"" (G and T)
   ""PRASE"" (P and S) - but is it common?
   ""TRADE"" (T and D) - T and D
   ""FRAME"" (F and M) - but M is new, and we have A and E fixed? Frame: F R A M E -> yes.

 However, note: the word ""FRAME"" has M at position 4. But we don't have any information about M yet.

 Let's choose a word that uses common letters so we can get more information.

 I think ""GRADE"" is a reasonable choice because G and D are common.

 But note: we also have the opportunity to test as many new letters as possible.

 In ""GRADE"": letters are G, R, A, D, E. We already know R, A, E are present. We test G and D.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat known letters? Well, we know R, A, E must be present and in those positions.

 Another idea: what about ""TRADE""? T and D.

 But ""GRATE"" has T and E (but E is repeated? The E is fixed at the end so it's okay).

 Since we are limited by the pattern, let's choose one that has common unused letters.

 Since we know nothing about the first and fourth letters, we should try to include as many common consonants as possible that are not ruled out.

 What are common consonants? T, L, S, P, D, M, etc.

 Let me think of some words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E:

   BRACE - but B is new? and C is ruled out -> invalid because of C.
   BRAKE - K is new -> B, R, A, K, E
   BRAVE - V is new -> B, R, A, V, E
   CRANE - we already tried, and it had N and C ruled out.

   DRAPE -> D, R, A, P, E
   FRAPE -> not common? skip.
   GRACE -> C ruled out -> invalid.
   GRAPE -> G, R, A, P, E -> P is new.
   GRATE -> G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.

   PRATE -> P, R, A, T, E -> same as above.
   TRADE -> T, R, A, D, E -> D and T.

 We can consider:

   ""GRACE"" is out (C).
   ""GRADE"" -> G, R, A, D, E -> D is tested.
   ""BRAKE"" -> B, R, A, K, E -> K is tested.

 How about ""TRACE""? But C is ruled out -> invalid.

 Let me choose ""GRADE"" because it uses two common consonants (G and D) and might help reveal more.

 However, note that we don't have any information on the missing positions. We have positions 1 and 4 missing.

 Another word: ""PRIDE"" -> checks: P R I D E -> but the pattern requires third letter A? No, we have fixed A at third? Our pattern is ? R A ? E, so third must be A. So ""PRIDE"" has I at position 3? -> No, not matching.

 Therefore, we stick with the pattern.

 I think ""TRADE"" is also good because it uses T and D.

 But ""GRADE"" has G and D. 

 Alternatively, we might try to get information about other vowels? But the word must have R at 2, A at 3, E at 5.

 The unknown letters are position 1 and 4. These are consonants typically? Or vowels? There could be a vowel at position 1? Like ""URAE_"" .. but not common.

 We are limited to common words.

 After thinking, I'll go with ""GRADE"".

 But wait: we know that E is at position 5. We also have R and A fixed. So in ""GRADE"", we have:
   G at 1, D at 4.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't include letters we already know so we can test more new letters? But we cannot avoid R, A, E because they are fixed.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us if G and D are in the word and if they are in the correct positions.

 So let's choose ""GRADE"".

<guess>grade</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A correct position, N not in word, E correct position), the secret word must match the pattern `_ R A _ E`. For my next guess, I want to test common letters for the first and fourth positions while avoiding C and N.

I chose **GRADE** because:
- It fits the required pattern (`G R A D E`)
- It tests two new common consonants (G and D)
- Avoids the excluded letters C and N

 But wait: we know that E is at position 5. We also have R and A fixed. So in ""GRADE"", we have:
   G at 1, D at 4.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't include letters we already know so we can test more new letters? But we cannot avoid R, A, E because they are fixed.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us if G and D are in the word and if they are in the correct positions.

 So let's choose ""GRADE"".

<guess>grade</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A correct position, N not in word, E correct position), the secret word must match the pattern `_ R A _ E`. For my next guess, I want to test common letters for the first and fourth positions while avoiding C and N.

I chose **GRADE** because:
- It fits the required pattern (`G R A D E`)
- It tests two new common consonants (G and D)
- Avoids the excluded letters C and N

We have the following feedback from two guesses:

From guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (position 2) (✓)
- A: correct position (position 3) (✓)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (position 5) (✓)

From guess 2 (""grade""):
- G: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (position 2) (✓) -> confirmed again
- A: correct position (position 3) (✓) -> confirmed again
- D: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (position 5) (✓) -> confirmed again

So, the secret word has fixed positions:
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 5: E
And the word pattern is: _ R A _ E

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C (from crane), N (from crane), G (from grade), D (from grade).

Therefore, the word must be of the form: [first letter] R A [fourth letter] E

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and avoids the letters we know are absent: C, N, G, D.

Our next guess should help identify the first and fourth letters.

We must choose a word that has the known letters in their fixed positions: R at position 2, A at position 3, E at position 5.

We also need to avoid choosing letters that have been eliminated: C, N, G, D.

Possible letters for the first position: any vowel or consonant except C, N, G, D.
Similarly for the fourth position.

We'll try to think of common words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E.

Let's list some possibilities that do not use C, N, G, D:

Common words:
- BRAVE: B at first, V at fourth -> B and V are new
- BRIBE: B at first, B at fourth? But note that we don't know about B, and repeated letters? However, ""bribe"" has two B's, so we need to be cautious.
- BRAKE: B at first, K at fourth -> K is new
- FRAME: F at first, M at fourth -> F and M are new
- PRATE: P at first, T at fourth -> P and T are new
- TRACE: but C is eliminated -> invalid
- TRADE: but D is eliminated -> invalid
- WRITE: W R I T E -> but position 3 is I, not A -> doesn't match because we require A at position 3.

Other words:
- BEHAVE: not 5 letters? How about ""BRAVE"", ""BRACE"" (but C), ""BREVE"", ""BRINE"" (but N eliminated), etc.

After eliminating words with forbidden letters:

Possible words:
- BRAVE (B and V)
- BRAKE (B and K)
- FRAME (F and M)
- GRAPE: G is eliminated -> invalid
- PRATE (P and T)
- TRAPE: not common? Or ""TRIPE"" but position 3 is I not A.

Also:
- ORATE: O R A T E -> O at first, T at fourth -> O and T are new.

So ""ORATE"" fits and uses O and T.

We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to maximize information.

Another word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) -> P R A S E -> S at fourth.

But let's choose more common words to be safe.

Options:
1. BRAVE: tests B and V
2. BRAKE: tests B and K
3. FRAME: tests F and M
4. PRATE: tests P and T
5. ORATE: tests O and T

How about ""TRAME""? Not common.

Another common word: ""PEACE"" -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

So, I'll list above.

We need to decide which one to pick.

Since we don't have any letters besides R, A, E fixed, and we know the first and fourth are consonants or vowels? The pattern R A _ E suggests the fourth letter might be a consonant.

We want to test letters that are frequent.

Common consonants: T, L, S, R, P, M, etc. But note R is already used in fixed position. We can reuse? But in secret word, if R is only once? We don't know.

But from feedback: In ""crane"", we had R? And it was correct at position 2. But we don't know if R appears elsewhere? But let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Similarly, for our guess, we can try a word that reuses a letter? For example, if we test with two B's? That might be messy.

Thus, preferred words without duplicated letters.

BRAVE: B, R, A, V, E -> all distinct? R, A, E already fixed, and B and V are new -> distinct.

BRAKE: distinct.

FRAME: distinct.

PRATE: distinct.

ORATE: distinct.

Now, which letters are more common?

In word games, common letters for position 4 after A: L, S, T, etc.

But let's choose ""PRATE"" because P and T are common letters.

Also, note: our pattern is _ R A _ E. The fourth letter must be such that the word is English.

We can also consider ""WRITE"" -> but position 3 is I? Not A.

Another word: ""ARISE"" -> A at first? Then A at first? And S at fourth? Structure: A R I S E -> position 3 is I? No, we must have A at position 3? Then the first letter can't be A? Because we have A at position 3? Wait, unless A appears twice? But we don't know about double A.

Wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven't encountered any.

But in ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we guessed ""grade"", which had A at position 3? So we don't know if A appears elsewhere?

Similarly, E? We haven't seen any duplicate.

So, we can consider words that start with A? But the pattern requires A at position 3? So the first letter could be A? Then the word would be A R A ? E -> that's two A's? Is that possible? Yes.

Is there a word like ""ARARE""? That might be obscure.

""ARACE"" -> but C is eliminated.

""AROSE"" -> A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? Not A -> doesn't match.

""AREAD"" -> but D is gone.

So words starting with A don't seem to fit well? Not many common words.

Therefore, sticking to words where the first letter is different.

I think ""PRATE"" is a reasonable choice because P and T are common.

Another word: ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> structure: S H A R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:E -> fails because position 2 must be R? This word has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R? So position 2 must be R.

This word ""share"" has position 2 H? So not.

Word must: position 2 R always? Yes.

Therefore, pattern forces: [1] R [3] A [4] [5] E -> [3] is A? Actually, position 3 must be A? So we can't have a word where R is at 2 and A at 3? Then change? It's fixed.

So, let's pick ""PRATE"": P R A T E -> letter 1: P, letter 4: T.

We haven't tried P and T yet.

Similarly, ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> letter 1: B, letter 4: V.

But P and T are more common than V? Statistically.

To test more frequent letters, ""TRAPE"" is not very common? But ""PRATE"" is a word meaning to talk at length.

Alternatively, ""BRAKE"" uses B and K.

I think I'll go with ""PRATE"".

But let me think: after ""crane"" and ""grade"", we have eliminated C, N, G, D.

So, a word like ""BRAVE"" uses B and V? We don't know about them.

But P and T: if we use ""PRATE"", we can test P and T.

We might also consider ""FRAME"": F and M? F is less common than P or T.

Similarly, V is less common.

So let's choose ""PRATE"".

But note: another common pattern: ""WRATE"" -> not a word.

Therefore, I select ""PRATE"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:  
- From ""crane"": R, A, and E are in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, and 5), while C and N are not in the word.  
- From ""grade"": R, A, and E are confirmed in the correct positions, and G and D are not in the word.  

Thus, the secret word follows the pattern: `_ R A _ E`, and the absent letters are C, N, G, D. For my next guess, I need:  
- Position 1: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  
- Position 4: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  
- Positions 2, 3, and 5: Fixed as R, A, E respectively.  

I chose **PRATE** because:  
- It fits the pattern (`P R A T E`), testing common letters P (position 1) and T (position 4).  
- P and T are high-frequency consonants not yet evaluated, which may help uncover more of the word.  
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, G, D).

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We previously guessed ""crane"" and received feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - E is in the secret word, but note: in ""crane"", E is at position 5, and we have E(✓), meaning it's also in the correct position? Let me clarify the feedback format.

 The feedback was given as:
   C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

 So for each position:
   Position 1: C -> x (not in the word)
   Position 2: R -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
   Position 3: A -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
   Position 4: N -> x (not in the word)
   Position 5: E -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)

 Therefore, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:
   _ R A _ E

 So the word is of the form: ? R A ? E

 We also know that C and N are not in the word.

 Our next guess should:
   1. Have the form: second letter R, third letter A, fifth letter E.
   2. Avoid using C and N because they are not in the word.
   3. Include new letters to test for the missing positions (1 and 4).

 We need to find valid 5-letter English words of the form [letter1] R A [letter4] E.

 Some possibilities:
   Let me think of common words: 
     ""GRACE"" - but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).
     ""TRACE"" - T is new? But T is okay, and C is not allowed? Wait, in ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C is at position 4, but we know C is absent? Feedback said C(x) meaning C is not in the word. So ""trace"" has C which is ruled out.

   How about ""BRAVE""? -> B R A V E. Structure: B (new), R, A, V (new), E. This fits the pattern.

   Other words:
     ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E: G and D are new.
     ""GRATE"" -> G R A T E: G and T are new.
     ""CRATE"" -> but C is ruled out.

   Also note that we cannot use letters we know are absent: C and N.

 Let's consider the letters we can use. We should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but we don't have any duplicates in our pattern.

 Since the positions are fixed for R, A, and E, we can generate a word.

 Possible words: 
   ""BRAVE"" (B and V)
   ""GRADE"" (G and D)
   ""GRATE"" (G and T)
   ""PRASE"" (P and S) - but is it common?
   ""TRADE"" (T and D) - T and D
   ""FRAME"" (F and M) - but M is new, and we have A and E fixed? Frame: F R A M E -> yes.

 However, note: the word ""FRAME"" has M at position 4. But we don't have any information about M yet.

 Let's choose a word that uses common letters so we can get more information.

 I think ""GRADE"" is a reasonable choice because G and D are common.

 But note: we also have the opportunity to test as many new letters as possible.

 In ""GRADE"": letters are G, R, A, D, E. We already know R, A, E are present. We test G and D.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat known letters? Well, we know R, A, E must be present and in those positions.

 Another idea: what about ""TRADE""? T and D.

 But ""GRATE"" has T and E (but E is repeated? The E is fixed at the end so it's okay).

 Since we are limited by the pattern, let's choose one that has common unused letters.

 Since we know nothing about the first and fourth letters, we should try to include as many common consonants as possible that are not ruled out.

 What are common consonants? T, L, S, P, D, M, etc.

 Let me think of some words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E:

   BRACE - but B is new? and C is ruled out -> invalid because of C.
   BRAKE - K is new -> B, R, A, K, E
   BRAVE - V is new -> B, R, A, V, E
   CRANE - we already tried, and it had N and C ruled out.

   DRAPE -> D, R, A, P, E
   FRAPE -> not common? skip.
   GRACE -> C ruled out -> invalid.
   GRAPE -> G, R, A, P, E -> P is new.
   GRATE -> G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.

   PRATE -> P, R, A, T, E -> same as above.
   TRADE -> T, R, A, D, E -> D and T.

 We can consider:

   ""GRACE"" is out (C).
   ""GRADE"" -> G, R, A, D, E -> D is tested.
   ""BRAKE"" -> B, R, A, K, E -> K is tested.

 How about ""TRACE""? But C is ruled out -> invalid.

 Let me choose ""GRADE"" because it uses two common consonants (G and D) and might help reveal more.

 However, note that we don't have any information on the missing positions. We have positions 1 and 4 missing.

 Another word: ""PRIDE"" -> checks: P R I D E -> but the pattern requires third letter A? No, we have fixed A at third? Our pattern is ? R A ? E, so third must be A. So ""PRIDE"" has I at position 3? -> No, not matching.

 Therefore, we stick with the pattern.

 I think ""TRADE"" is also good because it uses T and D.

 But ""GRADE"" has G and D. 

 Alternatively, we might try to get information about other vowels? But the word must have R at 2, A at 3, E at 5.

 The unknown letters are position 1 and 4. These are consonants typically? Or vowels? There could be a vowel at position 1? Like ""URAE_"" .. but not common.

 We are limited to common words.

 After thinking, I'll go with ""GRADE"".

 But wait: we know that E is at position 5. We also have R and A fixed. So in ""GRADE"", we have:
   G at 1, D at 4.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't include letters we already know so we can test more new letters? But we cannot avoid R, A, E because they are fixed.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us if G and D are in the word and if they are in the correct positions.

 So let's choose ""GRADE"".

<guess>grade</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A correct position, N not in word, E correct position), the secret word must match the pattern `_ R A _ E`. For my next guess, I want to test common letters for the first and fourth positions while avoiding C and N.

I chose **GRADE** because:
- It fits the required pattern (`G R A D E`)
- It tests two new common consonants (G and D)
- Avoids the excluded letters C and N

<guess>grade</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

From guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (position 2) (✓)
- A: correct position (position 3) (✓)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (position 5) (✓)

From guess 2 (""grade""):
- G: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (position 2) (✓) -> confirmed again
- A: correct position (position 3) (✓) -> confirmed again
- D: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (position 5) (✓) -> confirmed again

So, the secret word has fixed positions:
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 5: E
And the word pattern is: _ R A _ E

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C (from crane), N (from crane), G (from grade), D (from grade).

Therefore, the word must be of the form: [first letter] R A [fourth letter] E

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and avoids the letters we know are absent: C, N, G, D.

Our next guess should help identify the first and fourth letters.

We must choose a word that has the known letters in their fixed positions: R at position 2, A at position 3, E at position 5.

We also need to avoid choosing letters that have been eliminated: C, N, G, D.

Possible letters for the first position: any vowel or consonant except C, N, G, D.
Similarly for the fourth position.

We'll try to think of common words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E.

Let's list some possibilities that do not use C, N, G, D:

Common words:
- BRAVE: B at first, V at fourth -> B and V are new
- BRIBE: B at first, B at fourth? But note that we don't know about B, and repeated letters? However, ""bribe"" has two B's, so we need to be cautious.
- BRAKE: B at first, K at fourth -> K is new
- FRAME: F at first, M at fourth -> F and M are new
- PRATE: P at first, T at fourth -> P and T are new
- TRACE: but C is eliminated -> invalid
- TRADE: but D is eliminated -> invalid
- WRITE: W R I T E -> but position 3 is I, not A -> doesn't match because we require A at position 3.

Other words:
- BEHAVE: not 5 letters? How about ""BRAVE"", ""BRACE"" (but C), ""BREVE"", ""BRINE"" (but N eliminated), etc.

After eliminating words with forbidden letters:

Possible words:
- BRAVE (B and V)
- BRAKE (B and K)
- FRAME (F and M)
- GRAPE: G is eliminated -> invalid
- PRATE (P and T)
- TRAPE: not common? Or ""TRIPE"" but position 3 is I not A.

Also:
- ORATE: O R A T E -> O at first, T at fourth -> O and T are new.

So ""ORATE"" fits and uses O and T.

We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to maximize information.

Another word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) -> P R A S E -> S at fourth.

But let's choose more common words to be safe.

Options:
1. BRAVE: tests B and V
2. BRAKE: tests B and K
3. FRAME: tests F and M
4. PRATE: tests P and T
5. ORATE: tests O and T

How about ""TRAME""? Not common.

Another common word: ""PEACE"" -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

So, I'll list above.

We need to decide which one to pick.

Since we don't have any letters besides R, A, E fixed, and we know the first and fourth are consonants or vowels? The pattern R A _ E suggests the fourth letter might be a consonant.

We want to test letters that are frequent.

Common consonants: T, L, S, R, P, M, etc. But note R is already used in fixed position. We can reuse? But in secret word, if R is only once? We don't know.

But from feedback: In ""crane"", we had R? And it was correct at position 2. But we don't know if R appears elsewhere? But let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Similarly, for our guess, we can try a word that reuses a letter? For example, if we test with two B's? That might be messy.

Thus, preferred words without duplicated letters.

BRAVE: B, R, A, V, E -> all distinct? R, A, E already fixed, and B and V are new -> distinct.

BRAKE: distinct.

FRAME: distinct.

PRATE: distinct.

ORATE: distinct.

Now, which letters are more common?

In word games, common letters for position 4 after A: L, S, T, etc.

But let's choose ""PRATE"" because P and T are common letters.

Also, note: our pattern is _ R A _ E. The fourth letter must be such that the word is English.

We can also consider ""WRITE"" -> but position 3 is I? Not A.

Another word: ""ARISE"" -> A at first? Then A at first? And S at fourth? Structure: A R I S E -> position 3 is I? No, we must have A at position 3? Then the first letter can't be A? Because we have A at position 3? Wait, unless A appears twice? But we don't know about double A.

Wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven't encountered any.

But in ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we guessed ""grade"", which had A at position 3? So we don't know if A appears elsewhere?

Similarly, E? We haven't seen any duplicate.

So, we can consider words that start with A? But the pattern requires A at position 3? So the first letter could be A? Then the word would be A R A ? E -> that's two A's? Is that possible? Yes.

Is there a word like ""ARARE""? That might be obscure.

""ARACE"" -> but C is eliminated.

""AROSE"" -> A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? Not A -> doesn't match.

""AREAD"" -> but D is gone.

So words starting with A don't seem to fit well? Not many common words.

Therefore, sticking to words where the first letter is different.

I think ""PRATE"" is a reasonable choice because P and T are common.

Another word: ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> structure: S H A R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:E -> fails because position 2 must be R? This word has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R? So position 2 must be R.

This word ""share"" has position 2 H? So not.

Word must: position 2 R always? Yes.

Therefore, pattern forces: [1] R [3] A [4] [5] E -> [3] is A? Actually, position 3 must be A? So we can't have a word where R is at 2 and A at 3? Then change? It's fixed.

So, let's pick ""PRATE"": P R A T E -> letter 1: P, letter 4: T.

We haven't tried P and T yet.

Similarly, ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> letter 1: B, letter 4: V.

But P and T are more common than V? Statistically.

To test more frequent letters, ""TRAPE"" is not very common? But ""PRATE"" is a word meaning to talk at length.

Alternatively, ""BRAKE"" uses B and K.

I think I'll go with ""PRATE"".

But let me think: after ""crane"" and ""grade"", we have eliminated C, N, G, D.

So, a word like ""BRAVE"" uses B and V? We don't know about them.

But P and T: if we use ""PRATE"", we can test P and T.

We might also consider ""FRAME"": F and M? F is less common than P or T.

Similarly, V is less common.

So let's choose ""PRATE"".

But note: another common pattern: ""WRATE"" -> not a word.

Therefore, I select ""PRATE"".Based on the previous feedback:  
- From ""crane"": R, A, and E are in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, and 5), while C and N are not in the word.  
- From ""grade"": R, A, and E are confirmed in the correct positions, and G and D are not in the word.  

Thus, the secret word follows the pattern: `_ R A _ E`, and the absent letters are C, N, G, D. For my next guess, I need:  
- Position 1: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  
- Position 4: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  
- Positions 2, 3, and 5: Fixed as R, A, E respectively.  

I chose **PRATE** because:  
- It fits the pattern (`P R A T E`), testing common letters P (position 1) and T (position 4).  
- P and T are high-frequency consonants not yet evaluated, which may help uncover more of the word.  
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, G, D).

However, ""bribe"" has two B\'s, so we need to be cautious.\n- BRAKE: B at first, K at fourth -> K is new\n- FRAME: F at first, M at fourth -> F and M are new\n- PRATE: P at first, T at fourth -> P and T are new\n- TRACE: but C is eliminated -> invalid\n- TRADE: but D is eliminated -> invalid\n- WRITE: W R I T E -> but position 3 is I, not A -> doesn\'t match because we require A at position 3.\n\nOther words:\n- BEHAVE: not 5 letters? How about ""BRAVE"", ""BRACE"" (but C), ""BREVE"", ""BRINE"" (but N eliminated), etc.\n\nAfter eliminating words with forbidden letters:\n\nPossible words:\n- BRAVE (B and V)\n- BRAKE (B and K)\n- FRAME (F and M)\n- GRAPE: G is eliminated -> invalid\n- PRATE (P and T)\n- TRAPE: not common? Or ""TRIPE"" but position 3 is I not A.\n\nAlso:\n- ORATE: O R A T E -> O at first, T at fourth -> O and T are new.\n\nSo ""ORATE"" fits and uses O and T.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses new, common letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) -> P R A S E -> S at fourth.\n\nBut let\'s choose more common words to be safe.\n\nOptions:\n1. BRAVE: tests B and V\n2. BRAKE: tests B and K\n3. FRAME: tests F and M\n4. PRATE: tests P and T\n5. ORATE: tests O and T\n\nHow about ""TRAME""? Not common.\n\nAnother common word: ""PEACE"" -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSo, I\'ll list above.\n\nWe need to decide which one to pick.\n\nSince we don\'t have any letters besides R, A, E fixed, and we know the first and fourth are consonants or vowels? The pattern R A _ E suggests the fourth letter might be a consonant.\n\nWe want to test letters that are frequent.\n\nCommon consonants: T, L, S, R, P, M, etc. But note R is already used in fixed position. We can reuse? But in secret word, if R is only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut from feedback: In ""crane"", we had R? And it was correct at position 2. But we don\'t know if R appears elsewhere? But let\'s avoid duplicates unless necessary.\n\nSimilarly, for our guess, we can try a word that reuses a letter? For example, if we test with two B\'s? That might be messy.\n\nThus, preferred words without duplicated letters.\n\nBRAVE: B, R, A, V, E -> all distinct? R, A, E already fixed, and B and V are new -> distinct.\n\nBRAKE: distinct.\n\nFRAME: distinct.\n\nPRATE: distinct.\n\nORATE: distinct.\n\nNow, which letters are more common?\n\nIn word games, common letters for position 4 after A: L, S, T, etc.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""PRATE"" because P and T are common letters.\n\nAlso, note: our pattern is _ R A _ E. The fourth letter must be such that the word is English.\n\nWe can also consider ""WRITE"" -> but position 3 is I? Not A.\n\nAnother word: ""ARISE"" -> A at first? Then A at first? And S at fourth? Structure: A R I S E -> position 3 is I? No, we must have A at position 3? Then the first letter can\'t be A? Because we have A at position 3? Wait, unless A appears twice? But we don\'t know about double A.\n\nWait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven\'t encountered any.\n\nBut in ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we guessed ""grade"", which had A at position 3? So we don\'t know if A appears elsewhere?\n\nSimilarly, E? We haven\'t seen any duplicate.\n\nSo, we can consider words that start with A? But the pattern requires A at position 3? So the first letter could be A? Then the word would be A R A ? E -> that\'s two A\'s? Is that possible? Yes.\n\nIs there a word like ""ARARE""? That might be obscure.\n\n""ARACE"" -> but C is eliminated.\n\n""AROSE"" -> A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? Not A -> doesn\'t match.\n\n""AREAD"" -> but D is gone.\n\nSo words starting with A don\'t seem to fit well? Not many common words.\n\nTherefore, sticking to words where the first letter is different.\n\nI think ""PRATE"" is a reasonable choice because P and T are common.\n\nAnother word: ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> structure: S H A R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:E -> fails because position 2 must be R? This word has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R? So position 2 must be R.\n\nThis word ""share"" has position 2 H? So not.\n\nWord must: position 2 R always? Yes.\n\nTherefore, pattern forces: [1] R [3] A [4] [5] E -> [3] is A? Actually, position 3 must be A? So we can\'t have a word where R is at 2 and A at 3? Then change? It\'s fixed.\n\nSo, let\'s pick ""PRATE"": P R A T E -> letter 1: P, letter 4: T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried P and T yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> letter 1: B, letter 4: V.\n\nBut P and T are more common than V? Statistically.\n\nTo test more frequent letters, ""TRAPE"" is not very common? But ""PRATE"" is a word meaning to talk at length.\n\nAlternatively, ""BRAKE"" uses B and K.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PRATE"".\n\nBut let me think: after ""crane"" and ""grade"", we have eliminated C, N, G, D.\n\nSo, a word like ""BRAVE"" uses B and V? We don\'t know about them.\n\nBut P and T: if we use ""PRATE"", we can test P and T.\n\nWe might also consider ""FRAME"": F and M? F is less common than P or T.\n\nSimilarly, V is less common.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""PRATE"".\n\nBut note: another common pattern: ""WRATE"" -> not a word.\n\nTherefore, I select ""PRATE"".Based on the previous feedback:  \n- From ""crane"": R, A, and E are in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, and 5), while C and N are not in the word.  \n- From ""grade"": R, A, and E are confirmed in the correct positions, and G and D are not in the word.  \n\nThus, the secret word follows the pattern: `_ R A _ E`, and the absent letters are C, N, G, D. For my next guess, I need:  \n- Position 1: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  \n- Position 4: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  \n- Positions 2, 3, and 5: Fixed as R, A, E respectively.  \n\nI chose **PRATE** because:  \n- It fits the pattern (`P R A T E`), testing common letters P (position 1) and T (position 4).  \n- P and T are high-frequency consonants not yet evaluated, which may help uncover more of the word.  \n- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, G, D).\n\n<guess>prate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: prate -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
  Meaning: 
    - C and N are not in the word.
    - R, A, E are in the word and in the correct positions (2, 3, 5).

Guess 2: ""grade"" -> G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
  Meaning:
    - G and D are not in the word.
    - R, A, E are confirmed again in positions 2, 3, 5.

Guess 3: ""prate"" -> P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
  Meaning:
    - P and T are not in the word.
    - R, A, E are confirmed again.

So, the secret word is of the form: _ R A _ E

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, G, D, P, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

The pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E

Eliminated letters: C, N, G, D, P, T.

Possible letters for the first and fourth positions: any letter except A, R, E (which are already in the word, but could potentially be duplicated? We don't know) and the eliminated ones.

But note: we don't have information about duplicate letters. However, since we have three fixed letters and two unknowns, and we haven't seen duplicates so far, we can assume no duplicates for now, but we must consider the possibility.

We must avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, G, D, P, T.

Also, we have used: R, A, E, and the eliminated ones.

So, what letters are left? Let's list the alphabet:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Eliminated: C, N, G, D, P, T.

So available: A, B, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A, R, E are in the word, but we don't know if they can be duplicated. We should avoid using them again if possible to test new letters? But we have to form a valid word.

The pattern requires the first letter and the fourth letter to be filled.

We need to find words that match: [1] R A [4] E, with [1] and [4] being from the available letters.

Possible words:

- BRAVE: B at 1, V at 4 -> B and V are available? Yes. Word: B R A V E -> valid.
- BRAKE: B at 1, K at 4 -> B R A K E -> valid.
- FRAME: F at 1, M at 4 -> F R A M E -> valid.
- ORATE: O at 1, T at 4 -> but T is eliminated? From guess 3, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T. So ORATE is invalid because of T.
- PRATE: we already tried and P and T are out.
- Other: what about ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> but position 2 is H? We need position 2 to be R? So no.

Let me think of more:

- ""WRATE"" -> not a word.
- ""CRATE"" -> C is out.
- ""TRADE"" -> T and D are out.
- ""GRACE"" -> G and C out.

So, let's consider:

- ""BRAVE"": B R A V E
- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E
- ""FRAME"": F R A M E
- ""AROSE"": A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? No, we need position 3 to be A? So this has A at position 1 and O at position 3? Not matching pattern.

But what about ""ARISE""? A R I S E -> position 3 is I? Not A.

Another: ""URAE_"" ... not common.

""OZONE"" -> doesn't fit.

So, let's stick to the ones we have: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

Also, ""CRANE"" we tried, ""GRADE"" we tried, ""PRATE"" we tried.

Another possibility: ""BEARE"" -> not a word? Or ""BEAKE"" -> not common.

""BLARE"": B L A R E -> but position 2 is L? We need position 2 to be R? So no.

""BRINE"": B R I N E -> but N is eliminated? And position 3 is I? Not A.

""BRACE"": C is out.

""BROME"": B R O M E -> position 3 is O? Not A.

""BRUME"": B R U M E -> position 3 is U? Not A.

So, we have limited options: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

Also, ""FRAZE"" -> not a word.

""FLAKE"": F L A K E -> but position 2 is L? Not R.

We must have R at position 2? So the word must start with ? R A ? E.

So, let's list:

- BRAVE: B R A V E
- BRAKE: B R A K E
- FRAME: F R A M E
- Maybe ""GRACE"" but G and C out.
- ""PRASE"": P is out? And we tried P? So no.

Another: ""WRACK"" -> W R A C K -> C is out.

""WRAKE"": W R A K E -> is that a word? It means something, but rare. But we can consider? But we have BRAKE which is more common.

Similarly, ""WRAST"" -> not 5 letters? Or ""WRATH"" -> W R A T H -> T is out? T is eliminated? From guess 3, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.

So, ""WRATH"" is invalid.

Therefore, we have three main candidates: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

We need to choose one to guess.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess? Let me count: guess 1,2,3 done, so next is guess 4.

We can choose any of these, but we want to maximize information? But we are running out of options? Actually, we have three possibilities? So we can guess one and if wrong, we have two left? But we have two more guesses? 6 total, so after this we have two more.

But we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that uses more available letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We don't know about the fourth letter? We can try to test multiple possibilities? But we have to form a word.

Another idea: what about ""RAISE""? But position 2 is A? We need position 2 to be R? So no.

""RASPE"" -> not a word.

I think we have to choose among BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

Let's see which one to pick.

We can consider the frequency of letters.

For position 1: B, F are both common? B is more common? Or F?

For position 4: V, K, M.

K is more common than V and M? In English words.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that we haven't tested B, F, V, K, M.

If we guess ""BRAVE"", we test B and V.

If we guess ""BRAKE"", we test B and K.

If we guess ""FRAME"", we test F and M.

But note: if we guess ""BRAVE"" and it's wrong, we know B and V are not in the word? But we don't know about the fourth letter? Actually, if we guess ""BRAVE"" and it's not the word, then:

- If B is correct at position 1? Then we know? But if the word is ""BRAKE"", then B would be correct? But we are guessing one of them.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that might be shared? But we don't have such.

I think we have to choose one.

Let me pick ""BRAKE"" because K is a common letter? Or ""FRAME"" because M is common? But let's see.

Another word: ""FRAUD"" -> F R A U D -> but D is eliminated? From guess 2, D is not in the word? So invalid.

""FRAIL"" -> F R A I L -> position 4 is I? But we need the fifth letter to be E? This has L at position 5? Not E.

So, no.

I think we have to choose from the three.

I'll go with ""BRAKE"" because it's a common word.

So, guess: BRAKE

But let's confirm: B R A K E -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E.

Pattern matches, and no eliminated letters.

So, <guess>brake</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word pattern is `_ R A _ E` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as R, A, E).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, N, G, D, P, T (from Guesses 1-3).
- Remaining possible words include **BRAVE** (B at position 1, V at 4), **BRAKE** (B at position 1, K at 4), and **FRAME** (F at position 1, M at 4).

I chose **BRAKE** for this guess because:
- It tests two new common consonants (B and K) for the unknown positions.
- It fits the required pattern and avoids all eliminated letters.
- If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., confirming or ruling out B and K).

Eliminated: C, N, G, D, P, T.

So available: A, B, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A, R, E are in the word, but we don't know if they can be duplicated. We should avoid using them again if possible to test new letters? But we have to form a valid word.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,brave,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We previously guessed ""crane"" and received feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - E is in the secret word, but note: in ""crane"", E is at position 5, and we have E(✓), meaning it's also in the correct position? Let me clarify the feedback format.

 The feedback was given as:
   C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

 So for each position:
   Position 1: C -> x (not in the word)
   Position 2: R -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
   Position 3: A -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
   Position 4: N -> x (not in the word)
   Position 5: E -> ✓ (correct letter in correct position)

 Therefore, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:
   _ R A _ E

 So the word is of the form: ? R A ? E

 We also know that C and N are not in the word.

 Our next guess should:
   1. Have the form: second letter R, third letter A, fifth letter E.
   2. Avoid using C and N because they are not in the word.
   3. Include new letters to test for the missing positions (1 and 4).

 We need to find valid 5-letter English words of the form [letter1] R A [letter4] E.

 Some possibilities:
   Let me think of common words: 
     ""GRACE"" - but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).
     ""TRACE"" - T is new? But T is okay, and C is not allowed? Wait, in ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C is at position 4, but we know C is absent? Feedback said C(x) meaning C is not in the word. So ""trace"" has C which is ruled out.

   How about ""BRAVE""? -> B R A V E. Structure: B (new), R, A, V (new), E. This fits the pattern.

   Other words:
     ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E: G and D are new.
     ""GRATE"" -> G R A T E: G and T are new.
     ""CRATE"" -> but C is ruled out.

   Also note that we cannot use letters we know are absent: C and N.

 Let's consider the letters we can use. We should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but we don't have any duplicates in our pattern.

 Since the positions are fixed for R, A, and E, we can generate a word.

 Possible words: 
   ""BRAVE"" (B and V)
   ""GRADE"" (G and D)
   ""GRATE"" (G and T)
   ""PRASE"" (P and S) - but is it common?
   ""TRADE"" (T and D) - T and D
   ""FRAME"" (F and M) - but M is new, and we have A and E fixed? Frame: F R A M E -> yes.

 However, note: the word ""FRAME"" has M at position 4. But we don't have any information about M yet.

 Let's choose a word that uses common letters so we can get more information.

 I think ""GRADE"" is a reasonable choice because G and D are common.

 But note: we also have the opportunity to test as many new letters as possible.

 In ""GRADE"": letters are G, R, A, D, E. We already know R, A, E are present. We test G and D.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat known letters? Well, we know R, A, E must be present and in those positions.

 Another idea: what about ""TRADE""? T and D.

 But ""GRATE"" has T and E (but E is repeated? The E is fixed at the end so it's okay).

 Since we are limited by the pattern, let's choose one that has common unused letters.

 Since we know nothing about the first and fourth letters, we should try to include as many common consonants as possible that are not ruled out.

 What are common consonants? T, L, S, P, D, M, etc.

 Let me think of some words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E:

   BRACE - but B is new? and C is ruled out -> invalid because of C.
   BRAKE - K is new -> B, R, A, K, E
   BRAVE - V is new -> B, R, A, V, E
   CRANE - we already tried, and it had N and C ruled out.

   DRAPE -> D, R, A, P, E
   FRAPE -> not common? skip.
   GRACE -> C ruled out -> invalid.
   GRAPE -> G, R, A, P, E -> P is new.
   GRATE -> G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.

   PRATE -> P, R, A, T, E -> same as above.
   TRADE -> T, R, A, D, E -> D and T.

 We can consider:

   ""GRACE"" is out (C).
   ""GRADE"" -> G, R, A, D, E -> D is tested.
   ""BRAKE"" -> B, R, A, K, E -> K is tested.

 How about ""TRACE""? But C is ruled out -> invalid.

 Let me choose ""GRADE"" because it uses two common consonants (G and D) and might help reveal more.

 However, note that we don't have any information on the missing positions. We have positions 1 and 4 missing.

 Another word: ""PRIDE"" -> checks: P R I D E -> but the pattern requires third letter A? No, we have fixed A at third? Our pattern is ? R A ? E, so third must be A. So ""PRIDE"" has I at position 3? -> No, not matching.

 Therefore, we stick with the pattern.

 I think ""TRADE"" is also good because it uses T and D.

 But ""GRADE"" has G and D. 

 Alternatively, we might try to get information about other vowels? But the word must have R at 2, A at 3, E at 5.

 The unknown letters are position 1 and 4. These are consonants typically? Or vowels? There could be a vowel at position 1? Like ""URAE_"" .. but not common.

 We are limited to common words.

 After thinking, I'll go with ""GRADE"".

 But wait: we know that E is at position 5. We also have R and A fixed. So in ""GRADE"", we have:
   G at 1, D at 4.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't include letters we already know so we can test more new letters? But we cannot avoid R, A, E because they are fixed.

 However, note: the feedback will tell us if G and D are in the word and if they are in the correct positions.

 So let's choose ""GRADE"".

<guess>grade</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A correct position, N not in word, E correct position), the secret word must match the pattern `_ R A _ E`. For my next guess, I want to test common letters for the first and fourth positions while avoiding C and N.

I chose **GRADE** because:
- It fits the required pattern (`G R A D E`)
- It tests two new common consonants (G and D)
- Avoids the excluded letters C and N

<guess>grade</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

From guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (position 2) (✓)
- A: correct position (position 3) (✓)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (position 5) (✓)

From guess 2 (""grade""):
- G: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (position 2) (✓) -> confirmed again
- A: correct position (position 3) (✓) -> confirmed again
- D: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (position 5) (✓) -> confirmed again

So, the secret word has fixed positions:
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 5: E
And the word pattern is: _ R A _ E

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C (from crane), N (from crane), G (from grade), D (from grade).

Therefore, the word must be of the form: [first letter] R A [fourth letter] E

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and avoids the letters we know are absent: C, N, G, D.

Our next guess should help identify the first and fourth letters.

We must choose a word that has the known letters in their fixed positions: R at position 2, A at position 3, E at position 5.

We also need to avoid choosing letters that have been eliminated: C, N, G, D.

Possible letters for the first position: any vowel or consonant except C, N, G, D.
Similarly for the fourth position.

We'll try to think of common words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E.

Let's list some possibilities that do not use C, N, G, D:

Common words:
- BRAVE: B at first, V at fourth -> B and V are new
- BRIBE: B at first, B at fourth? But note that we don't know about B, and repeated letters? However, ""bribe"" has two B's, so we need to be cautious.
- BRAKE: B at first, K at fourth -> K is new
- FRAME: F at first, M at fourth -> F and M are new
- PRATE: P at first, T at fourth -> P and T are new
- TRACE: but C is eliminated -> invalid
- TRADE: but D is eliminated -> invalid
- WRITE: W R I T E -> but position 3 is I, not A -> doesn't match because we require A at position 3.

Other words:
- BEHAVE: not 5 letters? How about ""BRAVE"", ""BRACE"" (but C), ""BREVE"", ""BRINE"" (but N eliminated), etc.

After eliminating words with forbidden letters:

Possible words:
- BRAVE (B and V)
- BRAKE (B and K)
- FRAME (F and M)
- GRAPE: G is eliminated -> invalid
- PRATE (P and T)
- TRAPE: not common? Or ""TRIPE"" but position 3 is I not A.

Also:
- ORATE: O R A T E -> O at first, T at fourth -> O and T are new.

So ""ORATE"" fits and uses O and T.

We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to maximize information.

Another word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) -> P R A S E -> S at fourth.

But let's choose more common words to be safe.

Options:
1. BRAVE: tests B and V
2. BRAKE: tests B and K
3. FRAME: tests F and M
4. PRATE: tests P and T
5. ORATE: tests O and T

How about ""TRAME""? Not common.

Another common word: ""PEACE"" -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

So, I'll list above.

We need to decide which one to pick.

Since we don't have any letters besides R, A, E fixed, and we know the first and fourth are consonants or vowels? The pattern R A _ E suggests the fourth letter might be a consonant.

We want to test letters that are frequent.

Common consonants: T, L, S, R, P, M, etc. But note R is already used in fixed position. We can reuse? But in secret word, if R is only once? We don't know.

But from feedback: In ""crane"", we had R? And it was correct at position 2. But we don't know if R appears elsewhere? But let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Similarly, for our guess, we can try a word that reuses a letter? For example, if we test with two B's? That might be messy.

Thus, preferred words without duplicated letters.

BRAVE: B, R, A, V, E -> all distinct? R, A, E already fixed, and B and V are new -> distinct.

BRAKE: distinct.

FRAME: distinct.

PRATE: distinct.

ORATE: distinct.

Now, which letters are more common?

In word games, common letters for position 4 after A: L, S, T, etc.

But let's choose ""PRATE"" because P and T are common letters.

Also, note: our pattern is _ R A _ E. The fourth letter must be such that the word is English.

We can also consider ""WRITE"" -> but position 3 is I? Not A.

Another word: ""ARISE"" -> A at first? Then A at first? And S at fourth? Structure: A R I S E -> position 3 is I? No, we must have A at position 3? Then the first letter can't be A? Because we have A at position 3? Wait, unless A appears twice? But we don't know about double A.

Wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven't encountered any.

But in ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we guessed ""grade"", which had A at position 3? So we don't know if A appears elsewhere?

Similarly, E? We haven't seen any duplicate.

So, we can consider words that start with A? But the pattern requires A at position 3? So the first letter could be A? Then the word would be A R A ? E -> that's two A's? Is that possible? Yes.

Is there a word like ""ARARE""? That might be obscure.

""ARACE"" -> but C is eliminated.

""AROSE"" -> A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? Not A -> doesn't match.

""AREAD"" -> but D is gone.

So words starting with A don't seem to fit well? Not many common words.

Therefore, sticking to words where the first letter is different.

I think ""PRATE"" is a reasonable choice because P and T are common.

Another word: ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> structure: S H A R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:E -> fails because position 2 must be R? This word has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R? So position 2 must be R.

This word ""share"" has position 2 H? So not.

Word must: position 2 R always? Yes.

Therefore, pattern forces: [1] R [3] A [4] [5] E -> [3] is A? Actually, position 3 must be A? So we can't have a word where R is at 2 and A at 3? Then change? It's fixed.

So, let's pick ""PRATE"": P R A T E -> letter 1: P, letter 4: T.

We haven't tried P and T yet.

Similarly, ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> letter 1: B, letter 4: V.

But P and T are more common than V? Statistically.

To test more frequent letters, ""TRAPE"" is not very common? But ""PRATE"" is a word meaning to talk at length.

Alternatively, ""BRAKE"" uses B and K.

I think I'll go with ""PRATE"".

But let me think: after ""crane"" and ""grade"", we have eliminated C, N, G, D.

So, a word like ""BRAVE"" uses B and V? We don't know about them.

But P and T: if we use ""PRATE"", we can test P and T.

We might also consider ""FRAME"": F and M? F is less common than P or T.

Similarly, V is less common.

So let's choose ""PRATE"".

But note: another common pattern: ""WRATE"" -> not a word.

Therefore, I select ""PRATE"".Based on the previous feedback:  
- From ""crane"": R, A, and E are in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, and 5), while C and N are not in the word.  
- From ""grade"": R, A, and E are confirmed in the correct positions, and G and D are not in the word.  

Thus, the secret word follows the pattern: `_ R A _ E`, and the absent letters are C, N, G, D. For my next guess, I need:  
- Position 1: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  
- Position 4: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  
- Positions 2, 3, and 5: Fixed as R, A, E respectively.  

I chose **PRATE** because:  
- It fits the pattern (`P R A T E`), testing common letters P (position 1) and T (position 4).  
- P and T are high-frequency consonants not yet evaluated, which may help uncover more of the word.  
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, G, D).

<guess>prate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: prate -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
  Meaning: 
    - C and N are not in the word.
    - R, A, E are in the word and in the correct positions (2, 3, 5).

Guess 2: ""grade"" -> G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
  Meaning:
    - G and D are not in the word.
    - R, A, E are confirmed again in positions 2, 3, 5.

Guess 3: ""prate"" -> P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
  Meaning:
    - P and T are not in the word.
    - R, A, E are confirmed again.

So, the secret word is of the form: _ R A _ E

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, G, D, P, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

The pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E

Eliminated letters: C, N, G, D, P, T.

Possible letters for the first and fourth positions: any letter except A, R, E (which are already in the word, but could potentially be duplicated? We don't know) and the eliminated ones.

But note: we don't have information about duplicate letters. However, since we have three fixed letters and two unknowns, and we haven't seen duplicates so far, we can assume no duplicates for now, but we must consider the possibility.

We must avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, G, D, P, T.

Also, we have used: R, A, E, and the eliminated ones.

So, what letters are left? Let's list the alphabet:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Eliminated: C, N, G, D, P, T.

So available: A, B, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A, R, E are in the word, but we don't know if they can be duplicated. We should avoid using them again if possible to test new letters? But we have to form a valid word.

The pattern requires the first letter and the fourth letter to be filled.

We need to find words that match: [1] R A [4] E, with [1] and [4] being from the available letters.

Possible words:

- BRAVE: B at 1, V at 4 -> B and V are available? Yes. Word: B R A V E -> valid.
- BRAKE: B at 1, K at 4 -> B R A K E -> valid.
- FRAME: F at 1, M at 4 -> F R A M E -> valid.
- ORATE: O at 1, T at 4 -> but T is eliminated? From guess 3, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T. So ORATE is invalid because of T.
- PRATE: we already tried and P and T are out.
- Other: what about ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> but position 2 is H? We need position 2 to be R? So no.

Let me think of more:

- ""WRATE"" -> not a word.
- ""CRATE"" -> C is out.
- ""TRADE"" -> T and D are out.
- ""GRACE"" -> G and C out.

So, let's consider:

- ""BRAVE"": B R A V E
- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E
- ""FRAME"": F R A M E
- ""AROSE"": A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? No, we need position 3 to be A? So this has A at position 1 and O at position 3? Not matching pattern.

But what about ""ARISE""? A R I S E -> position 3 is I? Not A.

Another: ""URAE_"" ... not common.

""OZONE"" -> doesn't fit.

So, let's stick to the ones we have: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

Also, ""CRANE"" we tried, ""GRADE"" we tried, ""PRATE"" we tried.

Another possibility: ""BEARE"" -> not a word? Or ""BEAKE"" -> not common.

""BLARE"": B L A R E -> but position 2 is L? We need position 2 to be R? So no.

""BRINE"": B R I N E -> but N is eliminated? And position 3 is I? Not A.

""BRACE"": C is out.

""BROME"": B R O M E -> position 3 is O? Not A.

""BRUME"": B R U M E -> position 3 is U? Not A.

So, we have limited options: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

Also, ""FRAZE"" -> not a word.

""FLAKE"": F L A K E -> but position 2 is L? Not R.

We must have R at position 2? So the word must start with ? R A ? E.

So, let's list:

- BRAVE: B R A V E
- BRAKE: B R A K E
- FRAME: F R A M E
- Maybe ""GRACE"" but G and C out.
- ""PRASE"": P is out? And we tried P? So no.

Another: ""WRACK"" -> W R A C K -> C is out.

""WRAKE"": W R A K E -> is that a word? It means something, but rare. But we can consider? But we have BRAKE which is more common.

Similarly, ""WRAST"" -> not 5 letters? Or ""WRATH"" -> W R A T H -> T is out? T is eliminated? From guess 3, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.

So, ""WRATH"" is invalid.

Therefore, we have three main candidates: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

We need to choose one to guess.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess? Let me count: guess 1,2,3 done, so next is guess 4.

We can choose any of these, but we want to maximize information? But we are running out of options? Actually, we have three possibilities? So we can guess one and if wrong, we have two left? But we have two more guesses? 6 total, so after this we have two more.

But we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that uses more available letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We don't know about the fourth letter? We can try to test multiple possibilities? But we have to form a word.

Another idea: what about ""RAISE""? But position 2 is A? We need position 2 to be R? So no.

""RASPE"" -> not a word.

I think we have to choose among BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.

Let's see which one to pick.

We can consider the frequency of letters.

For position 1: B, F are both common? B is more common? Or F?

For position 4: V, K, M.

K is more common than V and M? In English words.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that we haven't tested B, F, V, K, M.

If we guess ""BRAVE"", we test B and V.

If we guess ""BRAKE"", we test B and K.

If we guess ""FRAME"", we test F and M.

But note: if we guess ""BRAVE"" and it's wrong, we know B and V are not in the word? But we don't know about the fourth letter? Actually, if we guess ""BRAVE"" and it's not the word, then:

- If B is correct at position 1? Then we know? But if the word is ""BRAKE"", then B would be correct? But we are guessing one of them.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that might be shared? But we don't have such.

I think we have to choose one.

Let me pick ""BRAKE"" because K is a common letter? Or ""FRAME"" because M is common? But let's see.

Another word: ""FRAUD"" -> F R A U D -> but D is eliminated? From guess 2, D is not in the word? So invalid.

""FRAIL"" -> F R A I L -> position 4 is I? But we need the fifth letter to be E? This has L at position 5? Not E.

So, no.

I think we have to choose from the three.

I'll go with ""BRAKE"" because it's a common word.

So, guess: BRAKE

But let's confirm: B R A K E -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E.

Pattern matches, and no eliminated letters.

So, <guess>brake</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word pattern is `_ R A _ E` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as R, A, E).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, N, G, D, P, T (from Guesses 1-3).
- Remaining possible words include **BRAVE** (B at position 1, V at 4), **BRAKE** (B at position 1, K at 4), and **FRAME** (F at position 1, M at 4).

I chose **BRAKE** for this guess because:
- It tests two new common consonants (B and K) for the unknown positions.
- It fits the required pattern and avoids all eliminated letters.
- If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., confirming or ruling out B and K).

We should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but we don\'t have any duplicates in our pattern.\n\n Since the positions are fixed for R, A, and E, we can generate a word.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""BRAVE"" (B and V)\n   ""GRADE"" (G and D)\n   ""GRATE"" (G and T)\n   ""PRASE"" (P and S) - but is it common?\n   ""TRADE"" (T and D) - T and D\n   ""FRAME"" (F and M) - but M is new, and we have A and E fixed? Frame: F R A M E -> yes.\n\n However, note: the word ""FRAME"" has M at position 4. But we don\'t have any information about M yet.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that uses common letters so we can get more information.\n\n I think ""GRADE"" is a reasonable choice because G and D are common.\n\n But note: we also have the opportunity to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n In ""GRADE"": letters are G, R, A, D, E. We already know R, A, E are present. We test G and D.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t repeat known letters? Well, we know R, A, E must be present and in those positions.\n\n Another idea: what about ""TRADE""? T and D.\n\n But ""GRATE"" has T and E (but E is repeated? The E is fixed at the end so it\'s okay).\n\n Since we are limited by the pattern, let\'s choose one that has common unused letters.\n\n Since we know nothing about the first and fourth letters, we should try to include as many common consonants as possible that are not ruled out.\n\n What are common consonants? T, L, S, P, D, M, etc.\n\n Let me think of some words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E:\n\n   BRACE - but B is new? and C is ruled out -> invalid because of C.\n   BRAKE - K is new -> B, R, A, K, E\n   BRAVE - V is new -> B, R, A, V, E\n   CRANE - we already tried, and it had N and C ruled out.\n\n   DRAPE -> D, R, A, P, E\n   FRAPE -> not common? skip.\n   GRACE -> C ruled out -> invalid.\n   GRAPE -> G, R, A, P, E -> P is new.\n   GRATE -> G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.\n\n   PRATE -> P, R, A, T, E -> same as above.\n   TRADE -> T, R, A, D, E -> D and T.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   ""GRACE"" is out (C).\n   ""GRADE"" -> G, R, A, D, E -> D is tested.\n   ""BRAKE"" -> B, R, A, K, E -> K is tested.\n\n How about ""TRACE""? But C is ruled out -> invalid.\n\n Let me choose ""GRADE"" because it uses two common consonants (G and D) and might help reveal more.\n\n However, note that we don\'t have any information on the missing positions. We have positions 1 and 4 missing.\n\n Another word: ""PRIDE"" -> checks: P R I D E -> but the pattern requires third letter A? No, we have fixed A at third? Our pattern is ? R A ? E, so third must be A. So ""PRIDE"" has I at position 3? -> No, not matching.\n\n Therefore, we stick with the pattern.\n\n I think ""TRADE"" is also good because it uses T and D.\n\n But ""GRADE"" has G and D. \n\n Alternatively, we might try to get information about other vowels? But the word must have R at 2, A at 3, E at 5.\n\n The unknown letters are position 1 and 4. These are consonants typically? Or vowels? There could be a vowel at position 1? Like ""URAE_"" .. but not common.\n\n We are limited to common words.\n\n After thinking, I\'ll go with ""GRADE"".\n\n But wait: we know that E is at position 5. We also have R and A fixed. So in ""GRADE"", we have:\n   G at 1, D at 4.\n\n If we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t include letters we already know so we can test more new letters? But we cannot avoid R, A, E because they are fixed.\n\n However, note: the feedback will tell us if G and D are in the word and if they are in the correct positions.\n\n So let\'s choose ""GRADE"".\n\n<guess>grade</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A correct position, N not in word, E correct position), the secret word must match the pattern `_ R A _ E`. For my next guess, I want to test common letters for the first and fourth positions while avoiding C and N.\n\nI chose **GRADE** because:\n- It fits the required pattern (`G R A D E`)\n- It tests two new common consonants (G and D)\n- Avoids the excluded letters C and N\n\n<guess>grade</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: correct position (position 2) (✓)\n- A: correct position (position 3) (✓)\n- N: not in the word (x)\n- E: correct position (position 5) (✓)\n\nFrom guess 2 (""grade""):\n- G: not in the word (x)\n- R: correct position (position 2) (✓) -> confirmed again\n- A: correct position (position 3) (✓) -> confirmed again\n- D: not in the word (x)\n- E: correct position (position 5) (✓) -> confirmed again\n\nSo, the secret word has fixed positions:\n  Position 2: R\n  Position 3: A\n  Position 5: E\nAnd the word pattern is: _ R A _ E\n\nWe also know the following letters are not in the word: C (from crane), N (from crane), G (from grade), D (from grade).\n\nTherefore, the word must be of the form: [first letter] R A [fourth letter] E\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits this pattern and avoids the letters we know are absent: C, N, G, D.\n\nOur next guess should help identify the first and fourth letters.\n\nWe must choose a word that has the known letters in their fixed positions: R at position 2, A at position 3, E at position 5.\n\nWe also need to avoid choosing letters that have been eliminated: C, N, G, D.\n\nPossible letters for the first position: any vowel or consonant except C, N, G, D.\nSimilarly for the fourth position.\n\nWe\'ll try to think of common words that fit the pattern ? R A ? E.\n\nLet\'s list some possibilities that do not use C, N, G, D:\n\nCommon words:\n- BRAVE: B at first, V at fourth -> B and V are new\n- BRIBE: B at first, B at fourth? But note that we don\'t know about B, and repeated letters? However, ""bribe"" has two B\'s, so we need to be cautious.\n- BRAKE: B at first, K at fourth -> K is new\n- FRAME: F at first, M at fourth -> F and M are new\n- PRATE: P at first, T at fourth -> P and T are new\n- TRACE: but C is eliminated -> invalid\n- TRADE: but D is eliminated -> invalid\n- WRITE: W R I T E -> but position 3 is I, not A -> doesn\'t match because we require A at position 3.\n\nOther words:\n- BEHAVE: not 5 letters? How about ""BRAVE"", ""BRACE"" (but C), ""BREVE"", ""BRINE"" (but N eliminated), etc.\n\nAfter eliminating words with forbidden letters:\n\nPossible words:\n- BRAVE (B and V)\n- BRAKE (B and K)\n- FRAME (F and M)\n- GRAPE: G is eliminated -> invalid\n- PRATE (P and T)\n- TRAPE: not common? Or ""TRIPE"" but position 3 is I not A.\n\nAlso:\n- ORATE: O R A T E -> O at first, T at fourth -> O and T are new.\n\nSo ""ORATE"" fits and uses O and T.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses new, common letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) -> P R A S E -> S at fourth.\n\nBut let\'s choose more common words to be safe.\n\nOptions:\n1. BRAVE: tests B and V\n2. BRAKE: tests B and K\n3. FRAME: tests F and M\n4. PRATE: tests P and T\n5. ORATE: tests O and T\n\nHow about ""TRAME""? Not common.\n\nAnother common word: ""PEACE"" -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSo, I\'ll list above.\n\nWe need to decide which one to pick.\n\nSince we don\'t have any letters besides R, A, E fixed, and we know the first and fourth are consonants or vowels? The pattern R A _ E suggests the fourth letter might be a consonant.\n\nWe want to test letters that are frequent.\n\nCommon consonants: T, L, S, R, P, M, etc. But note R is already used in fixed position. We can reuse? But in secret word, if R is only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut from feedback: In ""crane"", we had R? And it was correct at position 2. But we don\'t know if R appears elsewhere? But let\'s avoid duplicates unless necessary.\n\nSimilarly, for our guess, we can try a word that reuses a letter? For example, if we test with two B\'s? That might be messy.\n\nThus, preferred words without duplicated letters.\n\nBRAVE: B, R, A, V, E -> all distinct? R, A, E already fixed, and B and V are new -> distinct.\n\nBRAKE: distinct.\n\nFRAME: distinct.\n\nPRATE: distinct.\n\nORATE: distinct.\n\nNow, which letters are more common?\n\nIn word games, common letters for position 4 after A: L, S, T, etc.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""PRATE"" because P and T are common letters.\n\nAlso, note: our pattern is _ R A _ E. The fourth letter must be such that the word is English.\n\nWe can also consider ""WRITE"" -> but position 3 is I? Not A.\n\nAnother word: ""ARISE"" -> A at first? Then A at first? And S at fourth? Structure: A R I S E -> position 3 is I? No, we must have A at position 3? Then the first letter can\'t be A? Because we have A at position 3? Wait, unless A appears twice? But we don\'t know about double A.\n\nWait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven\'t encountered any.\n\nBut in ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we guessed ""grade"", which had A at position 3? So we don\'t know if A appears elsewhere?\n\nSimilarly, E? We haven\'t seen any duplicate.\n\nSo, we can consider words that start with A? But the pattern requires A at position 3? So the first letter could be A? Then the word would be A R A ? E -> that\'s two A\'s? Is that possible? Yes.\n\nIs there a word like ""ARARE""? That might be obscure.\n\n""ARACE"" -> but C is eliminated.\n\n""AROSE"" -> A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? Not A -> doesn\'t match.\n\n""AREAD"" -> but D is gone.\n\nSo words starting with A don\'t seem to fit well? Not many common words.\n\nTherefore, sticking to words where the first letter is different.\n\nI think ""PRATE"" is a reasonable choice because P and T are common.\n\nAnother word: ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> structure: S H A R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:E -> fails because position 2 must be R? This word has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R? So position 2 must be R.\n\nThis word ""share"" has position 2 H? So not.\n\nWord must: position 2 R always? Yes.\n\nTherefore, pattern forces: [1] R [3] A [4] [5] E -> [3] is A? Actually, position 3 must be A? So we can\'t have a word where R is at 2 and A at 3? Then change? It\'s fixed.\n\nSo, let\'s pick ""PRATE"": P R A T E -> letter 1: P, letter 4: T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried P and T yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> letter 1: B, letter 4: V.\n\nBut P and T are more common than V? Statistically.\n\nTo test more frequent letters, ""TRAPE"" is not very common? But ""PRATE"" is a word meaning to talk at length.\n\nAlternatively, ""BRAKE"" uses B and K.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PRATE"".\n\nBut let me think: after ""crane"" and ""grade"", we have eliminated C, N, G, D.\n\nSo, a word like ""BRAVE"" uses B and V? We don\'t know about them.\n\nBut P and T: if we use ""PRATE"", we can test P and T.\n\nWe might also consider ""FRAME"": F and M? F is less common than P or T.\n\nSimilarly, V is less common.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""PRATE"".\n\nBut note: another common pattern: ""WRATE"" -> not a word.\n\nTherefore, I select ""PRATE"".Based on the previous feedback:  \n- From ""crane"": R, A, and E are in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, and 5), while C and N are not in the word.  \n- From ""grade"": R, A, and E are confirmed in the correct positions, and G and D are not in the word.  \n\nThus, the secret word follows the pattern: `_ R A _ E`, and the absent letters are C, N, G, D. For my next guess, I need:  \n- Position 1: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  \n- Position 4: A new letter not previously eliminated (avoid C, N, G, D).  \n- Positions 2, 3, and 5: Fixed as R, A, E respectively.  \n\nI chose **PRATE** because:  \n- It fits the pattern (`P R A T E`), testing common letters P (position 1) and T (position 4).  \n- P and T are high-frequency consonants not yet evaluated, which may help uncover more of the word.  \n- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, G, D).\n\n<guess>prate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: prate -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n  Meaning: \n    - C and N are not in the word.\n    - R, A, E are in the word and in the correct positions (2, 3, 5).\n\nGuess 2: ""grade"" -> G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n  Meaning:\n    - G and D are not in the word.\n    - R, A, E are confirmed again in positions 2, 3, 5.\n\nGuess 3: ""prate"" -> P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n  Meaning:\n    - P and T are not in the word.\n    - R, A, E are confirmed again.\n\nSo, the secret word is of the form: _ R A _ E\n\nWe know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, G, D, P, T.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nThe pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E\n\nEliminated letters: C, N, G, D, P, T.\n\nPossible letters for the first and fourth positions: any letter except A, R, E (which are already in the word, but could potentially be duplicated? We don\'t know) and the eliminated ones.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have information about duplicate letters. However, since we have three fixed letters and two unknowns, and we haven\'t seen duplicates so far, we can assume no duplicates for now, but we must consider the possibility.\n\nWe must avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, G, D, P, T.\n\nAlso, we have used: R, A, E, and the eliminated ones.\n\nSo, what letters are left? Let\'s list the alphabet:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nEliminated: C, N, G, D, P, T.\n\nSo available: A, B, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: A, R, E are in the word, but we don\'t know if they can be duplicated. We should avoid using them again if possible to test new letters? But we have to form a valid word.\n\nThe pattern requires the first letter and the fourth letter to be filled.\n\nWe need to find words that match: [1] R A [4] E, with [1] and [4] being from the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- BRAVE: B at 1, V at 4 -> B and V are available? Yes. Word: B R A V E -> valid.\n- BRAKE: B at 1, K at 4 -> B R A K E -> valid.\n- FRAME: F at 1, M at 4 -> F R A M E -> valid.\n- ORATE: O at 1, T at 4 -> but T is eliminated? From guess 3, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T. So ORATE is invalid because of T.\n- PRATE: we already tried and P and T are out.\n- Other: what about ""SHRAP""? Not 5 letters? Or ""SHARE"" -> S H A R E -> but position 2 is H? We need position 2 to be R? So no.\n\nLet me think of more:\n\n- ""WRATE"" -> not a word.\n- ""CRATE"" -> C is out.\n- ""TRADE"" -> T and D are out.\n- ""GRACE"" -> G and C out.\n\nSo, let\'s consider:\n\n- ""BRAVE"": B R A V E\n- ""BRAKE"": B R A K E\n- ""FRAME"": F R A M E\n- ""AROSE"": A R O S E -> but position 3 is O? No, we need position 3 to be A? So this has A at position 1 and O at position 3? Not matching pattern.\n\nBut what about ""ARISE""? A R I S E -> position 3 is I? Not A.\n\nAnother: ""URAE_"" ... not common.\n\n""OZONE"" -> doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo, let\'s stick to the ones we have: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.\n\nAlso, ""CRANE"" we tried, ""GRADE"" we tried, ""PRATE"" we tried.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BEARE"" -> not a word? Or ""BEAKE"" -> not common.\n\n""BLARE"": B L A R E -> but position 2 is L? We need position 2 to be R? So no.\n\n""BRINE"": B R I N E -> but N is eliminated? And position 3 is I? Not A.\n\n""BRACE"": C is out.\n\n""BROME"": B R O M E -> position 3 is O? Not A.\n\n""BRUME"": B R U M E -> position 3 is U? Not A.\n\nSo, we have limited options: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.\n\nAlso, ""FRAZE"" -> not a word.\n\n""FLAKE"": F L A K E -> but position 2 is L? Not R.\n\nWe must have R at position 2? So the word must start with ? R A ? E.\n\nSo, let\'s list:\n\n- BRAVE: B R A V E\n- BRAKE: B R A K E\n- FRAME: F R A M E\n- Maybe ""GRACE"" but G and C out.\n- ""PRASE"": P is out? And we tried P? So no.\n\nAnother: ""WRACK"" -> W R A C K -> C is out.\n\n""WRAKE"": W R A K E -> is that a word? It means something, but rare. But we can consider? But we have BRAKE which is more common.\n\nSimilarly, ""WRAST"" -> not 5 letters? Or ""WRATH"" -> W R A T H -> T is out? T is eliminated? From guess 3, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.\n\nSo, ""WRATH"" is invalid.\n\nTherefore, we have three main candidates: BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess? Let me count: guess 1,2,3 done, so next is guess 4.\n\nWe can choose any of these, but we want to maximize information? But we are running out of options? Actually, we have three possibilities? So we can guess one and if wrong, we have two left? But we have two more guesses? 6 total, so after this we have two more.\n\nBut we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to think of a word that uses more available letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe don\'t know about the fourth letter? We can try to test multiple possibilities? But we have to form a word.\n\nAnother idea: what about ""RAISE""? But position 2 is A? We need position 2 to be R? So no.\n\n""RASPE"" -> not a word.\n\nI think we have to choose among BRAVE, BRAKE, FRAME.\n\nLet\'s see which one to pick.\n\nWe can consider the frequency of letters.\n\nFor position 1: B, F are both common? B is more common? Or F?\n\nFor position 4: V, K, M.\n\nK is more common than V and M? In English words.\n\nBut we are not sure.\n\nWe can also consider that we haven\'t tested B, F, V, K, M.\n\nIf we guess ""BRAVE"", we test B and V.\n\nIf we guess ""BRAKE"", we test B and K.\n\nIf we guess ""FRAME"", we test F and M.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""BRAVE"" and it\'s wrong, we know B and V are not in the word? But we don\'t know about the fourth letter? Actually, if we guess ""BRAVE"" and it\'s not the word, then:\n\n- If B is correct at position 1? Then we know? But if the word is ""BRAKE"", then B would be correct? But we are guessing one of them.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that might be shared? But we don\'t have such.\n\nI think we have to choose one.\n\nLet me pick ""BRAKE"" because K is a common letter? Or ""FRAME"" because M is common? But let\'s see.\n\nAnother word: ""FRAUD"" -> F R A U D -> but D is eliminated? From guess 2, D is not in the word? So invalid.\n\n""FRAIL"" -> F R A I L -> position 4 is I? But we need the fifth letter to be E? This has L at position 5? Not E.\n\nSo, no.\n\nI think we have to choose from the three.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BRAKE"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nSo, guess: BRAKE\n\nBut let\'s confirm: B R A K E -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:A, 4:K, 5:E.\n\nPattern matches, and no eliminated letters.\n\nSo, <guess>brake</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- The secret word pattern is `_ R A _ E` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as R, A, E).\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, N, G, D, P, T (from Guesses 1-3).\n- Remaining possible words include **BRAVE** (B at position 1, V at 4), **BRAKE** (B at position 1, K at 4), and **FRAME** (F at position 1, M at 4).\n\nI chose **BRAKE** for this guess because:\n- It tests two new common consonants (B and K) for the unknown positions.\n- It fits the required pattern and avoids all eliminated letters.\n- If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., confirming or ruling out B and K).\n\n<guess>brake</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: prate -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: brake -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 4: ""brake"" -> B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   - B is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - R is correct (position 2).
   - A is correct (position 3).
   - K is not in the word (x).
   - E is correct (position 5).

 So now we know:
   Position 1: B (correct)
   Position 2: R (correct)
   Position 3: A (correct)
   Position 5: E (correct)

 And the word is: B R A _ E

 We also know that K is not in the word, and from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, N, G, D, P, T.

 So the only missing letter is at position 4.

 We need to find a letter for position 4 that:
   - Is not in the eliminated set: C, N, G, D, P, T, K (add K to the list now)
   - And forms a valid English word with ""BRA_E""

 What are the possibilities?

 We can list letters that can fit in ""BRA_E"" to form a word:

   - BRAVE: V at position 4 -> but we haven't tried V? And it's not eliminated.
   - BRACE: C is eliminated -> invalid.
   - BRADE: D is eliminated -> invalid.
   - BRAKE: we just tried, and K is not in the word -> invalid.
   - BRAME: M at position 4? Is ""brame"" a word? It might be obscure (meaning a fierce rush or attack), but let's consider.
   - BRANE: N is eliminated -> invalid.
   - BRARE: R at position 4? But we already have R? And ""brare"" is not common? Also, R is already used? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters? But it's possible.

 However, note: we have fixed B, R, A, E. The only missing is position 4.

 Common words:
   - BRAVE: B R A V E
   - BRACE: invalid (C)
   - BRAKE: invalid (K not in word)
   - BRINE: N eliminated and position 3 is I? Not A -> invalid.

 Other possibilities:
   - BRAZE: Z at position 4? ""Braze"" means to solder or to make hard like brass. But Z is available? We haven't eliminated Z.

   - BRAES: E at position 4? But then we have two E's? And the word would be B R A E S -> but that's 5 letters? And position 5 is E? So it would be B R A E S? But then position 4 is E? And position 5 is S? That doesn't match our pattern? Our pattern is B R A _ E, so the fifth is E? So if we put E at position 4, then the word is B R A E E? That doesn't make sense? Or ""BRAES"" is a word? It is a plural of brae (a hillside), but it is spelled B R A E S? So positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:A, 4:E, 5:S -> but we need position 5 to be E? So it doesn't fit.

   - BRASH: S at position 4? Then the word is B R A S H -> but position 5 is H? We need E at position 5? So no.

   - BRASS: S at position 4 and 5? But we need E at position 5? So no.

   - BRAWL: L at position 4? Then B R A W L -> position 5 is L? Not E.

   - BRAYS: Y at position 4? Then B R A Y S -> position 5 is S? Not E.

   - BRAIL: I at position 4? Then B R A I L -> position 5 is L? Not E.

   - BRAID: D eliminated -> invalid.

   - BREAD: D eliminated -> invalid.

   - BREME: E at position 4? Then B R E M E -> but position 3 is E? Not A? And we have A fixed at position 3? So no.

   - BRUME: U at position 4? Then B R U M E -> position 3 is U? Not A.

 So, after eliminating, the only common word that fits is ""BRAVE"" (B R A V E).

 But is there any other?

   - ""BRAAI"": not English? And doesn't end with E.

   - ""BRADE"": D eliminated.

   - ""BLAZE"": but position 2 is L? Not R.

   - ""FRAVE"": not a word.

   - ""BRAVO"": O at position 4? Then B R A V O -> position 5 is O? Not E.

   - ""BRAVA"": A at position 4? Then B R A V A -> position 5 is A? Not E.

   - ""BRAVI"": I at position 4? Then B R A V I -> position 5 is I? Not E.

 So, the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses available letters is ""BRAVE"".

 Therefore, the secret word must be ""BRAVE"".

 But note: we haven't tried V before? And it's not eliminated? So we can guess ""BRAVE"".

 However, we must be cautious: is there any other possibility?

 What about ""BRUME""? But that has U at position 3? Not A.

 Or ""BRINE"": N eliminated and I at position 3.

 Another: ""BROME"": O at position 3? Not A.

 So, I think ""BRAVE"" is the only common word.

 Therefore, we guess ""BRAVE"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- The secret word pattern is **B R A _ E** (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed as B, R, A, E).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, N, G, D, P, T, K** (from Guesses 1-4).
- The only unknown is position 4, which must be a letter not in the eliminated set and must form a valid English word.

Possible words fitting the pattern **B R A _ E**:
- **BRAVE** (V at position 4) → Valid, common word, and V is not eliminated.
- Other possibilities like BRACE (C eliminated), BRAKE (K eliminated), or BRADE (D eliminated) are invalid. Less common words (e.g., BRAME) are unlikely.

Since **BRAVE** is the only common English word matching the pattern and constraints, it must be the solution.  

<guess>brave</guess>",brave,"We have feedback from Guess 4: ""brake"" -> B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   - B is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - R is correct (position 2).
   - A is correct (position 3).
   - K is not in the word (x).
   - E is correct (position 5).

 So now we know:
   Position 1: B (correct)
   Position 2: R (correct)
   Position 3: A (correct)
   Position 5: E (correct)

 And the word is: B R A _ E

 We also know that K is not in the word, and from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, N, G, D, P, T.

 So the only missing letter is at position 4.

 We need to find a letter for position 4 that:
   - Is not in the eliminated set: C, N, G, D, P, T, K (add K to the list now)
   - And forms a valid English word with ""BRA_E""

 What are the possibilities?

 We can list letters that can fit in ""BRA_E"" to form a word:

   - BRAVE: V at position 4 -> but we haven't tried V? And it's not eliminated.
   - BRACE: C is eliminated -> invalid.
   - BRADE: D is eliminated -> invalid.
   - BRAKE: we just tried, and K is not in the word -> invalid.
   - BRAME: M at position 4? Is ""brame"" a word? It might be obscure (meaning a fierce rush or attack), but let's consider.
   - BRANE: N is eliminated -> invalid.
   - BRARE: R at position 4? But we already have R? And ""brare"" is not common? Also, R is already used? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters? But it's possible.

 However, note: we have fixed B, R, A, E. The only missing is position 4.

 Common words:
   - BRAVE: B R A V E
   - BRACE: invalid (C)
   - BRAKE: invalid (K not in word)
   - BRINE: N eliminated and position 3 is I? Not A -> invalid.

 Other possibilities:
   - BRAZE: Z at position 4? ""Braze"" means to solder or to make hard like brass. But Z is available? We haven't eliminated Z.

   - BRAES: E at position 4? But then we have two E's? And the word would be B R A E S -> but that's 5 letters? And position 5 is E? So it would be B R A E S? But then position 4 is E? And position 5 is S? That doesn't match our pattern? Our pattern is B R A _ E, so the fifth is E? So if we put E at position 4, then the word is B R A E E? That doesn't make sense? Or ""BRAES"" is a word? It is a plural of brae (a hillside), but it is spelled B R A E S? So positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:A, 4:E, 5:S -> but we need position 5 to be E? So it doesn't fit.

   - BRASH: S at position 4? Then the word is B R A S H -> but position 5 is H? We need E at position 5? So no.

   - BRASS: S at position 4 and 5? But we need E at position 5? So no.

   - BRAWL: L at position 4? Then B R A W L -> position 5 is L? Not E.

   - BRAYS: Y at position 4? Then B R A Y S -> position 5 is S? Not E.

   - BRAIL: I at position 4? Then B R A I L -> position 5 is L? Not E.

   - BRAID: D eliminated -> invalid.

   - BREAD: D eliminated -> invalid.

   - BREME: E at position 4? Then B R E M E -> but position 3 is E? Not A? And we have A fixed at position 3? So no.

   - BRUME: U at position 4? Then B R U M E -> position 3 is U? Not A.

 So, after eliminating, the only common word that fits is ""BRAVE"" (B R A V E).

 But is there any other?

   - ""BRAAI"": not English? And doesn't end with E.

   - ""BRADE"": D eliminated.

   - ""BLAZE"": but position 2 is L? Not R.

   - ""FRAVE"": not a word.

   - ""BRAVO"": O at position 4? Then B R A V O -> position 5 is O? Not E.

   - ""BRAVA"": A at position 4? Then B R A V A -> position 5 is A? Not E.

   - ""BRAVI"": I at position 4? Then B R A V I -> position 5 is I? Not E.

 So, the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses available letters is ""BRAVE"".

 Therefore, the secret word must be ""BRAVE"".

 But note: we haven't tried V before? And it's not eliminated? So we can guess ""BRAVE"".

 However, we must be cautious: is there any other possibility?
