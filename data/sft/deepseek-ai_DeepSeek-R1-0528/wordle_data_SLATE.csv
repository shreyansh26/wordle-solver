We are starting the game and need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. A good starting word often has common letters and avoids repeat letters.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. We want a word that includes some of these and has distinct letters.

A classic starting word is CRATE. It has common letters: C, R, A, T, E and all unique. Let's consider other options like SLATE, STARE, ROAST, etc. But CRATE is a good one.

However, let's analyze: CRATE has the letters C, R, A, T, E. These are all common.

Alternatively, we can use SALET (which is a word, but less common) or SOARE. But let's stick with a common word.

I'll go with CRATE.

But note: the example in the rules used BRISK, which has B, R, I, S, K. So to avoid any bias, we choose independently.

Another popular choice is ROATE (which is a valid word derived from ""roated"", though uncommon) or more standard: RAISE, which has R, A, I, S, E.

RAISE: R, A, I, S, E. All vowels except O and U? We have A, I, E. That covers three vowels and two consonants.

But let me check the frequency: E is the most common, then A, R, I, S, etc.

RAISE is a good candidate.

We can also consider using a word that includes more consonants that are common? But vowels are important.

Alternatively, ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U. This has four vowels and D. It's good for revealing vowels, but D and U might be less common? Not necessarily.

However, ADIEU lacks some common consonants. So let me pick RAISE.

But note: we only have 6 tries. We need a word that balances vowels and consonants.

Another word: SLATE. S, L, A, T, E. This has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T). S and T are very common.

So comparing RAISE: 
- letters: R, A, I, S, E -> which includes R, A, I, S, E (three vowels: A, I, E and two consonants: R, S)

SLATE: S, L, A, T, E -> two vowels: A, E, and consonants: S, L, T.

RAISE has more vowels? Three vowels versus two. But RAISE has the letter I which is a vowel, and SLATE has A and E.

Another candidate: CRANE: C, R, A, N, E -> two vowels: A, E and consonants: C, R, N.

I think RAISE is a solid choice.

But let's look at the actual frequency in 5-letter words:

According to various sources, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T, etc.

So a word like SOARE (if accepted) or STARE.

STARE: S, T, A, R, E -> includes S, T, A, R, E. It has two of the most common consonants and three vowels? Well, A and E are vowels, and S, T, R are very common consonants.

STARE seems great: common letters and all distinct.

Similarly, CRANE and SLATE are also good.

But STARE has the advantage of having S and T which are very common at the beginning or end? Actually, S is common at the end and T is common at the beginning? But in Wordle, positions matter too.

I recall that the word CRANE is ranked high by some algorithms. But let's not overcomplicate.

Since the rules don't specify whether the word is common or rare, but we must enter a valid English word.

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it covers S, T, A, R, E — five common letters.

Alternatively, if we want to cover more vowels, but STARE covers A and E (and E is the most common vowel).

So my first guess: STARE.

But note: there are words like ""ROATE"" and ""RAISE"" that also include the letter I and are considered optimal by some.

Given that, I think both STARE and RAISE are good.

I'll go with RAISE because I often use that.

But let me check: RAISE vs. STARE.

RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
STARE: S, T, A, R, E

RAISE has I (which is a vowel) instead of T. But T is more common than I? Actually, in English, E, T, A, O, I, N are very common. T is more common than I.

Therefore, STARE includes T (which is the second most common letter after E) and also S, A, R, E. 

So STARE might be better.

I'll go with STARE.

We can make our guess: STARE.

So, the guess is ""stare"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I'll prioritize common consonants and vowels to cover frequent letters in the English language. The goal is to get feedback on letter presence and positioning quickly.

I consider words like ""RAISE"" or ""CRANE,"" but ""STARE"" includes high-frequency letters: S, T, A, R, E. Among these:
- E, A, R, and S are among the most common letters in 5-letter words.
- T is also very frequent, especially at the start or end of words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five unique letters at once.

This distribution balances vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, T, R), increasing the chance of revealing multiple correct letters or positions. Based on analysis of optimal starting words, ""STARE"" is a strong choice.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""stare""
Feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) R(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- T is in the secret word but in the wrong position. Since it was guessed in position 2, but it's not there, it must be in another position (not 2).
- A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
- R is NOT in the secret word.
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, we know:
- The secret word has the form: S _ A _ E
- The letters: S, A, E are fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- The secret word contains T, but not in position 2. Since R is not in the word, we avoid R.

Positions to determine: position 2 and position 4.

We know the secret word has T, but T must be in either position 4 (since position 2 is wrong, and positions 1,3,5 are taken) or we might be missing a position. Actually, positions available: 2 and 4.

But T was in position 2 in the guess, but is not there. Therefore, T must be in position 4? Because those are the only remaining positions.

The word structure: Position 1: S, Position 2: ?, Position 3: A, Position 4: ?, Position 5: E.

T is in the word but not in position 2, so the only other possibility is position 4.

So, position 4 must be T? Not necessarily, because there could be repeated letters? But in this feedback, we don't have any indication of repeated letters. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates yet.

We must be cautious: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't show that for T. Since we have only one T in the guess, if the secret word had two Ts, then one might be marked differently. But in this case, we had T marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position.

Given that, and since R is absent, the secret word has: S, A, E, T (and one more letter for position 2).

Also, since T is present but not in position 2, it must be in position 4 because positions 1,3,5 are fixed and occupied.

Therefore, the secret word is likely: S _ A T E? But we have position 4: if T is there, then the word is S?A T E.

But we have to confirm: the word has five positions. Position 1: S, position 3: A, position 5: E, and T must be somewhere. The only position left for T is position 4 (since position 2 is wrong).

So, structure: S _ A T E? That would be ""SLATE"" for example? But we need to find the second letter.

Wait, no: the secret word has T in it, but it might not be in position 4? Actually, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. T cannot be in 1 (because S is there), cannot be in 3 (A), cannot be in 5 (E), and it's not in 2 (as per feedback). Therefore, it must be in position 4.

So, we deduce: position 1: S, position 3: A, position 4: T, position 5: E.

Then position 2 is the missing letter.

So the secret word is S?ATE, where ? is the unknown letter.

But we have to find what letter goes in position 2.

Also, we know that R is not in the word, so whatever the letter is, it's not R.

Now, what are possible English words of the form S?ATE?

Let me list some:
- SLATE
- STATE (but STATE has T? No, STATE would be S-T-A-T-E, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E.

But in our case, if we propose STATE as a guess: position 2 is T, but in the feedback we have T marked as ""-"" meaning that T is in the word but not in position 2. But if the secret word has T in position 2, then when we guessed ""stare"" with T in position 2, if the secret word had T there, it would have been marked ""✓"", but it was marked ""-"", meaning that it's not in the correct position. Therefore, the secret word cannot have T in position 2. Therefore, STATE is not possible because it has T in position 2? Actually, STATE has T in both position 2 and 4? But we haven't considered duplicates yet.

But the feedback for ""stare"": we have T not in position 2, but it might be that the secret word has two Ts? For example, if secret word is STATE, and we guess STARE:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position0: T? STATE has T in position 2? When we guess STARE in position 2: T. Secret STATE has T in position 2, so it should be marked ✓, but in the feedback it was marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? That would be inconsistent.

Therefore, if the secret word were STATE, then when guessing ""stare"":
- S: position1: correct -> ✓
- T: position2: correct? Secret has T at position2 -> should be ✓, not -.
But the feedback says T is ""-"", meaning not in correct position? Therefore, the secret word does not have T in position 2.

Therefore, STATE is not possible.

Similarly, any word with T in position 2 is impossible.

Therefore, the secret word cannot have T in position 2. Since T must be in the word (as per feedback) and the only available position is 4, T must be in position 4.

Therefore, the word is S?ATE.

We need to find the letter for position 2.

Also, the letter cannot be R because R is absent.

Possible English words of the form S?ATE where ? is a letter:

Common ones:
- SLATE (L)
- SEATE? Not a word.
- SHATE? Not a word.
- SCATE? Not common, but ""scate"" isn't standard. Skate? But K, so SKATE? SKATE is S-K-A-T-E, which fits.

Also, SPATE (P)

And SWATE? Not common.

So possible options: SLATE, SPATE, SKATE.

Are there others? SUATE? Not a word. SNATE? Not. SOATE? Not. SEATE? No.

We might also consider SAUTE? SAUTE: that would be S-A-U-T-E? But position 3 is A, so if we have SAUTE, positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, not matching since our position 3 must be A.

Our structure requires position1:S, position3:A, position4:T, position5:E, so position2 must be filled.

Also, since position3 is A, we cannot have A? No, the letter in position2 can be any consonant or vowel except R.

So candidates:
- SLATE: L
- SKATE: K
- SPATE: P
- SHAKE? But SHAKE is S-H-A-K-E, which would have position4 being K? Not T. So not.

Our requirement: positions: 1:S, 2:?,3:A,4:T,5:E.

Words: 
- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E
- SKATE: S-K-A-T-E
- SPATE: S-P-A-T-E
- STATE? But STATE has T in position2, which we know is not possible because T cannot be in position2.

What about STALE? STALE: S-T-A-L-E -> position2:T, but again T is in position2 which should be wrong? But STALE: position1:S, position2:T, ... but we know T cannot be in position2? Yes, so STALE would not be valid because T would be in position2 and the feedback said it wasn't.

Also, SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> but position4 is D, not T. So no.

Thus the main candidates: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

We might also consider SNATE? Not a valid English word. SCATE? Same.

We need to guess one of these? But we have try 2, so we can guess one of them.

But note: our goal is to get the word, but also to confirm.

We can make a guess that can help differentiate.

Currently, we have three possibilities: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

We can guess SLATE, for example. If it's correct, great. If not, the feedback will tell us.

But let's think: if we guess SLATE and it's not the secret, then we'll know:
- If SLATE is guessed, secret is S?ATE, so:
  - Position1: S ✓ (fixed)
  - Position2: if L is correct? If secret is SKATE, then L would be marked x or -?
    For SKATE: 
      Position1: S ✓
      Position2: L in guess, secret has K -> not present? Or wait, SKATE has no L? So L would be x.
    Similarly, position3: A ✓, position4: T ✓, position5: E ✓.
    But position2: L vs K -> since K is different, L is not in the word (if secret is SKATE) or if secret is SPATE, no L.

So by guessing SLATE:
  If secret is SLATE: all ✓.
  If secret is SKATE: feedback: S✓ Lx A✓ T✓ E✓ -> so we know position2 is wrong and L not present, so candidates left: SKATE or SPATE? SPATE has P instead.

Similarly, we'd know that position2 is not L and so we try SKATE next? But we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But position2 is the only unknown. And we know all other positions: position1:S,3:A,4:T,5:E are fixed? Are they?

From feedback: 
  S in position1: correct and stays.
  A in position3: correct and stays.
  E in position5: correct and stays.
  T: we deduced must be in position4? Is that fixed?

Actually, in feedback, T was marked present but wrong position. We have positions available: 2 and 4. Position 2 is unknown, position 4 is unknown? But in the guess ""stare"", we have position4: R (which is absent) so position4 was R but wrong.

Now T is in the word but not in position2, and not in 1,3,5? So it must be in position4? 

But could the word have a double letter? For example, if the secret word has two Ts? For example, if the secret word is STATS? But we have position5:E fixed? Secret word ends with E. So STATS wouldn't end with E.

Or if secret word is STAGE? But STAGE: S-T-A-G-E, position4:G, not T. But we know T must be in the secret word.

But T is in the word and only position4 is available? Suppose the word has T in position4? Or could it be in some other position? Positions are all fixed except 2 and 4.

Position 1,3,5: fixed to S,A,E.

Therefore, the T must be in position4? Because position2 is excluded by the feedback.

Therefore, position4 must be T.

Similarly, position2 must be a letter that isn't R (since R is absent) and also, for the word to be valid.

Thus, the secret word is of form S?ATE.

We need to guess the letter at position2.

To save tries, we can guess one candidate: say, SLATE.

If correct, we win.

If not, then we know from feedback: for example, if SLATE is guessed:

Case secret is SKATE:
  Position1: S✓, position2: L vs K -> L not in word? Or in wrong position? Since SKATE doesn't have L, it will be marked x.
  Position3: A✓, position4: T✓, position5: E✓.

So feedback: S✓ Lx A✓ T✓ E✓

This tells us that position2 is wrong and L is absent.

Similarly, if secret is SPATE, we get S✓ Lx A✓ T✓ E✓.

Thus, we cannot differentiate between SKATE and SPATE? Because both wouldn't have L? But actually, the feedback will show that L is absent. Then we know the secret doesn't have L, so we can try SKATE or SPATE next? And if we try SKATE and the secret is SPATE, we might get:

Guess SKATE, secret SPATE: then position2: K vs P -> K not in word? Marked x? Positions: S✓ A✓ T✓ E✓ all good except position2 x.

Then for SPATE: S✓, P (not guessed) etc.

After guessing SLATE and getting Lx, we know that position2 is not L and the missing letter is from SKATE or SPATE? But we still don't know which.

Instead, we could guess a word that doesn't fix all positions? But we have strong constraints.

Another approach: we have position2 as unknown, and we know R is not in the word. Also, T is in position4? Actually, T is fixed at position4.

So why not guess SKATE? Or SPATE?

Since we have to guess, and we have three options, we can pick one.

But note: in the first guess, ""stare"", we have the T marked as not in position2, but T is now in position4? So we assume that.

What if there is a word like ""SEATS""? But SEATS ends with S, not E? Position5:E fixed.

Or ""SCANT""? Doesn't have T in position4? Position4 in SCANT is N? Not T.

So S?ATE only: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

Also, ""SWATH""? But SWATH is S-W-A-T-H, which ends with H, not E? Position5 must be E.

Thus, only a few possibilities.

To differentiate, we can guess a word that tests the letter at position2 with the other words.

For example, guess ""SKATE"" directly.

If secret is SKATE: win.

If secret is SPATE: then feedback when guessing SKATE:
  Position1: S✓
  Position2: K vs P -> K not in secret? Secret SPATE has P, no K? So K would be marked x? Because K not present? But secret SPATE has no K? So position2: Kx
  Position3: A✓
  Position4: T✓
  Position5: E✓

So feedback: S✓ Kx A✓ T✓ E✓

Similarly, if we guess SKATE and secret is SLATE, likewise Kx? Because SLATE has L, no K? So S✓ Kx A✓ T✓ E✓? But we already excluded SLATE? No, if we guess SKATE, and secret is SLATE, we get S✓ Kx A✓ T✓ E✓.

Then we know position2 must be L? But we tried K? Then we try SLATE next.

But we waste a try? Ideally, we want to guess in a way that narrows down.

Since we have only one letter missing, we can guess SLATE first.

Let me list the possibilities: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

We can guess ""SLATE"". Then:
  If correct: finish.
  If feedback shows position2 wrong and L not in word (Lx), then the secret must be either SKATE or SPATE.

Then, on next guess, we can guess, say, ""SKATE"". If it's SKATE, done. If not, it must be SPATE? So then we try SPATE on the third try.

But we have 6 tries, so we can use two guesses to cover.

Alternatively, we can guess ""SPATE"" first? Same thing.

But note: we might also consider other words? For example, is ""SHARE"" an option? But secret must be S?ATE, so SHARE ends with E? SHARE: S-H-A-R-E -> but R is absent? And position3:A, but position4:R? In secret, position4 must be T? So SHARE does not have T? And we know T must be present. So SHARE not possible.

Similarly, only S?ATE with ? being L, K, P.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as the next guess. It's a common word.

So, guess: SLATE

<thinking>
From feedback:
- S is in position 1 (fixed), A in position 3 (fixed), E in position 5 (fixed).
- T is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 2, leaving position 4 as the only possible location.
- R is absent and must be avoided.

Thus, the secret word fits S?ATE pattern, with position 2 being an unknown letter (not R). Common possibilities are SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

Choosing SLATE:
- Directly tests if L is the missing letter. 
- If incorrect, we eliminate L—leaving SKATE/SPATE—which takes one additional guess to resolve (with 4 tries left).
- This is efficient given constraints and avoids overcomplicating.
</thinking>

<guess>slate</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""stare"" (S✓ T(-) A✓ R(x) E✓), I deduced the following:
- S, A, and E are fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- R is absent from the secret word.
- T is in the word but not in position 2, leaving only position 4 available for T (since positions 1, 3, and 5 are occupied and fixed).
- Therefore, the secret word has the structure S?ATE, where the second position must contain a letter that is not R and completes a valid word.

Common English words fitting S?ATE include:
- SLATE
- SKATE
- SPATE

I chose ""SLATE"" as the next guess because it efficiently tests the second position's letter:
- If correct, the game ends.
- If incorrect, based on feedback, we can distinguish between SKATE and SPATE in subsequent guesses (e.g., missing L would point to K or P in the second position).

This approach leverages the constraints to minimize guesses while covering common possibilities.

<guess>slate</guess>",slate,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""stare""
Feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) R(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- T is in the secret word but in the wrong position. Since it was guessed in position 2, but it's not there, it must be in another position (not 2).
- A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
- R is NOT in the secret word.
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, we know:
- The secret word has the form: S _ A _ E
- The letters: S, A, E are fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- The secret word contains T, but not in position 2. Since R is not in the word, we avoid R.

Positions to determine: position 2 and position 4.

We know the secret word has T, but T must be in either position 4 (since position 2 is wrong, and positions 1,3,5 are taken) or we might be missing a position. Actually, positions available: 2 and 4.

But T was in position 2 in the guess, but is not there. Therefore, T must be in position 4? Because those are the only remaining positions.

The word structure: Position 1: S, Position 2: ?, Position 3: A, Position 4: ?, Position 5: E.

T is in the word but not in position 2, so the only other possibility is position 4.

So, position 4 must be T? Not necessarily, because there could be repeated letters? But in this feedback, we don't have any indication of repeated letters. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates yet.

We must be cautious: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't show that for T. Since we have only one T in the guess, if the secret word had two Ts, then one might be marked differently. But in this case, we had T marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position.

Given that, and since R is absent, the secret word has: S, A, E, T (and one more letter for position 2).

Also, since T is present but not in position 2, it must be in position 4 because positions 1,3,5 are fixed and occupied.

Therefore, the secret word is likely: S _ A T E? But we have position 4: if T is there, then the word is S?A T E.

But we have to confirm: the word has five positions. Position 1: S, position 3: A, position 5: E, and T must be somewhere. The only position left for T is position 4 (since position 2 is wrong).

So, structure: S _ A T E? That would be ""SLATE"" for example? But we need to find the second letter.

Wait, no: the secret word has T in it, but it might not be in position 4? Actually, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. T cannot be in 1 (because S is there), cannot be in 3 (A), cannot be in 5 (E), and it's not in 2 (as per feedback). Therefore, it must be in position 4.

So, we deduce: position 1: S, position 3: A, position 4: T, position 5: E.

Then position 2 is the missing letter.

So the secret word is S?ATE, where ? is the unknown letter.

But we have to find what letter goes in position 2.

Also, we know that R is not in the word, so whatever the letter is, it's not R.

Now, what are possible English words of the form S?ATE?

Let me list some:
- SLATE
- STATE (but STATE has T? No, STATE would be S-T-A-T-E, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E.

But in our case, if we propose STATE as a guess: position 2 is T, but in the feedback we have T marked as ""-"" meaning that T is in the word but not in position 2. But if the secret word has T in position 2, then when we guessed ""stare"" with T in position 2, if the secret word had T there, it would have been marked ""✓"", but it was marked ""-"", meaning that it's not in the correct position. Therefore, the secret word cannot have T in position 2. Therefore, STATE is not possible because it has T in position 2? Actually, STATE has T in both position 2 and 4? But we haven't considered duplicates yet.

But the feedback for ""stare"": we have T not in position 2, but it might be that the secret word has two Ts? For example, if secret word is STATE, and we guess STARE:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position0: T? STATE has T in position 2? When we guess STARE in position 2: T. Secret STATE has T in position 2, so it should be marked ✓, but in the feedback it was marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? That would be inconsistent.

Therefore, if the secret word were STATE, then when guessing ""stare"":
- S: position1: correct -> ✓
- T: position2: correct? Secret has T at position2 -> should be ✓, not -.
But the feedback says T is ""-"", meaning not in correct position? Therefore, the secret word does not have T in position 2.

Therefore, STATE is not possible.

Similarly, any word with T in position 2 is impossible.

Therefore, the secret word cannot have T in position 2. Since T must be in the word (as per feedback) and the only available position is 4, T must be in position 4.

Therefore, the word is S?ATE.

We need to find the letter for position 2.

Also, the letter cannot be R because R is absent.

Possible English words of the form S?ATE where ? is a letter:

Common ones:
- SLATE (L)
- SEATE? Not a word.
- SHATE? Not a word.
- SCATE? Not common, but ""scate"" isn't standard. Skate? But K, so SKATE? SKATE is S-K-A-T-E, which fits.

Also, SPATE (P)

And SWATE? Not common.

So possible options: SLATE, SPATE, SKATE.

Are there others? SUATE? Not a word. SNATE? Not. SOATE? Not. SEATE? No.

We might also consider SAUTE? SAUTE: that would be S-A-U-T-E? But position 3 is A, so if we have SAUTE, positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, not matching since our position 3 must be A.

Our structure requires position1:S, position3:A, position4:T, position5:E, so position2 must be filled.

Also, since position3 is A, we cannot have A? No, the letter in position2 can be any consonant or vowel except R.

So candidates:
- SLATE: L
- SKATE: K
- SPATE: P
- SHAKE? But SHAKE is S-H-A-K-E, which would have position4 being K? Not T. So not.

Our requirement: positions: 1:S, 2:?,3:A,4:T,5:E.

Words: 
- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E
- SKATE: S-K-A-T-E
- SPATE: S-P-A-T-E
- STATE? But STATE has T in position2, which we know is not possible because T cannot be in position2.

What about STALE? STALE: S-T-A-L-E -> position2:T, but again T is in position2 which should be wrong? But STALE: position1:S, position2:T, ... but we know T cannot be in position2? Yes, so STALE would not be valid because T would be in position2 and the feedback said it wasn't.

Also, SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> but position4 is D, not T. So no.

Thus the main candidates: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

We might also consider SNATE? Not a valid English word. SCATE? Same.

We need to guess one of these? But we have try 2, so we can guess one of them.

But note: our goal is to get the word, but also to confirm.

We can make a guess that can help differentiate.

Currently, we have three possibilities: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

We can guess SLATE, for example. If it's correct, great. If not, the feedback will tell us.

But let's think: if we guess SLATE and it's not the secret, then we'll know:
- If SLATE is guessed, secret is S?ATE, so:
  - Position1: S ✓ (fixed)
  - Position2: if L is correct? If secret is SKATE, then L would be marked x or -?
    For SKATE: 
      Position1: S ✓
      Position2: L in guess, secret has K -> not present? Or wait, SKATE has no L? So L would be x.
    Similarly, position3: A ✓, position4: T ✓, position5: E ✓.
    But position2: L vs K -> since K is different, L is not in the word (if secret is SKATE) or if secret is SPATE, no L.

So by guessing SLATE:
  If secret is SLATE: all ✓.
  If secret is SKATE: feedback: S✓ Lx A✓ T✓ E✓ -> so we know position2 is wrong and L not present, so candidates left: SKATE or SPATE? SPATE has P instead.

Similarly, we'd know that position2 is not L and so we try SKATE next? But we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But position2 is the only unknown. And we know all other positions: position1:S,3:A,4:T,5:E are fixed? Are they?

From feedback: 
  S in position1: correct and stays.
  A in position3: correct and stays.
  E in position5: correct and stays.
  T: we deduced must be in position4? Is that fixed?

Actually, in feedback, T was marked present but wrong position. We have positions available: 2 and 4. Position 2 is unknown, position 4 is unknown? But in the guess ""stare"", we have position4: R (which is absent) so position4 was R but wrong.

Now T is in the word but not in position2, and not in 1,3,5? So it must be in position4? 

But could the word have a double letter? For example, if the secret word has two Ts? For example, if the secret word is STATS? But we have position5:E fixed? Secret word ends with E. So STATS wouldn't end with E.

Or if secret word is STAGE? But STAGE: S-T-A-G-E, position4:G, not T. But we know T must be in the secret word.

But T is in the word and only position4 is available? Suppose the word has T in position4? Or could it be in some other position? Positions are all fixed except 2 and 4.

Position 1,3,5: fixed to S,A,E.

Therefore, the T must be in position4? Because position2 is excluded by the feedback.

Therefore, position4 must be T.

Similarly, position2 must be a letter that isn't R (since R is absent) and also, for the word to be valid.

Thus, the secret word is of form S?ATE.

We need to guess the letter at position2.

To save tries, we can guess one candidate: say, SLATE.

If correct, we win.

If not, then we know from feedback: for example, if SLATE is guessed:

Case secret is SKATE:
  Position1: S✓, position2: L vs K -> L not in word? Or in wrong position? Since SKATE doesn't have L, it will be marked x.
  Position3: A✓, position4: T✓, position5: E✓.

So feedback: S✓ Lx A✓ T✓ E✓

This tells us that position2 is wrong and L is absent.

Similarly, if secret is SPATE, we get S✓ Lx A✓ T✓ E✓.

Thus, we cannot differentiate between SKATE and SPATE? Because both wouldn't have L? But actually, the feedback will show that L is absent. Then we know the secret doesn't have L, so we can try SKATE or SPATE next? And if we try SKATE and the secret is SPATE, we might get:

Guess SKATE, secret SPATE: then position2: K vs P -> K not in word? Marked x? Positions: S✓ A✓ T✓ E✓ all good except position2 x.

Then for SPATE: S✓, P (not guessed) etc.

After guessing SLATE and getting Lx, we know that position2 is not L and the missing letter is from SKATE or SPATE? But we still don't know which.

Instead, we could guess a word that doesn't fix all positions? But we have strong constraints.

Another approach: we have position2 as unknown, and we know R is not in the word. Also, T is in position4? Actually, T is fixed at position4.

So why not guess SKATE? Or SPATE?

Since we have to guess, and we have three options, we can pick one.

But note: in the first guess, ""stare"", we have the T marked as not in position2, but T is now in position4? So we assume that.

What if there is a word like ""SEATS""? But SEATS ends with S, not E? Position5:E fixed.

Or ""SCANT""? Doesn't have T in position4? Position4 in SCANT is N? Not T.

So S?ATE only: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

Also, ""SWATH""? But SWATH is S-W-A-T-H, which ends with H, not E? Position5 must be E.

Thus, only a few possibilities.

To differentiate, we can guess a word that tests the letter at position2 with the other words.

For example, guess ""SKATE"" directly.

If secret is SKATE: win.

If secret is SPATE: then feedback when guessing SKATE:
  Position1: S✓
  Position2: K vs P -> K not in secret? Secret SPATE has P, no K? So K would be marked x? Because K not present? But secret SPATE has no K? So position2: Kx
  Position3: A✓
  Position4: T✓
  Position5: E✓

So feedback: S✓ Kx A✓ T✓ E✓

Similarly, if we guess SKATE and secret is SLATE, likewise Kx? Because SLATE has L, no K? So S✓ Kx A✓ T✓ E✓? But we already excluded SLATE? No, if we guess SKATE, and secret is SLATE, we get S✓ Kx A✓ T✓ E✓.

Then we know position2 must be L? But we tried K? Then we try SLATE next.

But we waste a try? Ideally, we want to guess in a way that narrows down.

Since we have only one letter missing, we can guess SLATE first.

Let me list the possibilities: SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

We can guess ""SLATE"". Then:
  If correct: finish.
  If feedback shows position2 wrong and L not in word (Lx), then the secret must be either SKATE or SPATE.

Then, on next guess, we can guess, say, ""SKATE"". If it's SKATE, done. If not, it must be SPATE? So then we try SPATE on the third try.

But we have 6 tries, so we can use two guesses to cover.

Alternatively, we can guess ""SPATE"" first? Same thing.

But note: we might also consider other words? For example, is ""SHARE"" an option? But secret must be S?ATE, so SHARE ends with E? SHARE: S-H-A-R-E -> but R is absent? And position3:A, but position4:R? In secret, position4 must be T? So SHARE does not have T? And we know T must be present. So SHARE not possible.

Similarly, only S?ATE with ? being L, K, P.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as the next guess. It's a common word.

So, guess: SLATE

<thinking>
From feedback:
- S is in position 1 (fixed), A in position 3 (fixed), E in position 5 (fixed).
- T is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 2, leaving position 4 as the only possible location.
- R is absent and must be avoided.

Thus, the secret word fits S?ATE pattern, with position 2 being an unknown letter (not R). Common possibilities are SLATE, SKATE, SPATE.

Choosing SLATE:
- Directly tests if L is the missing letter. 
- If incorrect, we eliminate L—leaving SKATE/SPATE—which takes one additional guess to resolve (with 4 tries left).
- This is efficient given constraints and avoids overcomplicating.
</thinking>

<guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""stare"" (S✓ T(-) A✓ R(x) E✓), I deduced the following:
- S, A, and E are fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- R is absent from the secret word.
- T is in the word but not in position 2, leaving only position 4 available for T (since positions 1, 3, and 5 are occupied and fixed).
- Therefore, the secret word has the structure S?ATE, where the second position must contain a letter that is not R and completes a valid word.

Common English words fitting S?ATE include:
- SLATE
- SKATE
- SPATE

I chose ""SLATE"" as the next guess because it efficiently tests the second position's letter:
- If correct, the game ends.
- If incorrect, based on feedback, we can distinguish between SKATE and SPATE in subsequent guesses (e.g., missing L would point to K or P in the second position).

This approach leverages the constraints to minimize guesses while covering common possibilities.",Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
