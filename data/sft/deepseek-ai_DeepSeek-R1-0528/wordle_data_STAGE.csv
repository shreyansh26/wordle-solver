First, I have the feedback from my first guess. I guessed ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x (letter C not in the word)
- R: x (letter R not in the word)
- A: ✓ (letter A is in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (letter N not in the word)
- E: ✓ (letter E is in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this:
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all.
- Letters A and E are in the word, and they are in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in the third position, and E is in the fifth position, since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E.

The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.

I need to make a new guess that respects the known information:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter and E as the 5th letter.
- It does not contain C, R, or N.

Also, since it's a 5-letter English word, I should choose a word that fits this pattern: _ _ A _ E, where the first, second, and fourth letters are unknown, but should not be C, R, or N, and should be other letters.

Now, I need to figure out what letters could be in those positions. Since I have two letters confirmed, I should try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Common letters in English five-letter words include vowels like I, O, U, and consonants like L, S, T, etc. But I already know A and E are in, so I might focus on consonants.

Possible words ending with A_E: like ""brace"", but B? ""brace"" has B, R, A, C, E. But R and C are not in the word, from feedback. R and C are excluded.

Words with pattern _ _ A _ E.

I should think of words like ""spade"", ""shade"", ""glade"", but let's see which letters are possible.

Excluded letters: C, R, N.

Also, since A and E are accounted for, I need new letters.

Aim to cover frequent letters not yet tested. For example, S, T, L, I, O.

Let me sketch possible words:
- If first letter is S: S _ A _ E → ""spade""? But ""spade"" has P and D. Is that possible?
- Or ""stale"", but ""stale"" has T, A, L, E? Positions: S (1), T (2), A (3), L (4), E (5). That could work.

But I haven't tested S or T or L yet.

Another option: ""shake"" – S,H,A,K,E – that has K, but positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), K (4), E (5).

Similarly, ""scale"" but ""scale"" has C and L, but C is excluded, so no.

C is excluded, so not ""scale"".

""place"" has P,L,A,C,E but C is excluded.

So, I need a word without C, R, N.

Also, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

List of tested letters: C (absent), R (absent), A (present, at pos 3), N (absent), E (present, at pos 5).

So untested letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

I should aim for a word that has frequent consonants and vowels.

For example, S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good guess might be ""SLATE"" or something similar.

But SLATE: S, L, A, T, E. Positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5).

This uses A and E in correct positions, introduces S, L, T which are all untested.

Another option: ""SHADE"" – S, H, A, D, E.

Or ""GLADE"" – G, L, A, D, E.

But ""SLATE"" seems nice because T is common.

What about ""SAUTE""? But U is less common.

I think ""SLATE"" is solid.

Since A and E are fixed, I can focus on the other positions.

Let me consider ""QUAKE"", but Q is rare.

Better to stick with common letters.

Another common starter word is ""ADIEU"", but A and E positions are fixed, ""adieu"" has A first, not third, so no.

Must have A at 3 and E at 5.

Other words: ""PLANE"" but it has N which is excluded? Plane: P,L,A,N,E. N is absent, so not good to use known absent letters.

N is excluded, so avoid N.

In ""SLATE"", no excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E. All are possible except A and E known.

S, L, T are new.

Similarly, ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. H and D new.

But ""SLATE"" might be better because L and T are more common in multiple positions.

In Wordle, after such feedback, ""SLATE"" is a good guess because it tests S, L, T.

I could consider ""ALIVE"" but that has A first, not third.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

Another word is ""GRATE"" but G,R,A,T,E? R is excluded, so no.

R is absent.

So, avoid R.

Similarly, C and N absent.

So, available letters.

""PHASE"": P,H,A,S,E? Positions: P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5).

That could be, tests P, H, S.

But ""SLATE"" tests S, L, T.

I think ""SLATE"" is fine.

To cover more vowels, ""OPAQUE"" is 6 letters, not 5.

No.

""AISLE"" has A first, and no E in fifth; ends with E, but A is position 1.

Not matching pattern.

Must have 3rd letter A and 5th letter E.

So candidates: words ending with ...A..E, specifically position 3:A, position 5:E.

Like ""crave"" but C and R excluded.

""brave"" B,R,A,V,E? R excluded.

""leave"" L,E,A,V,E? But positions: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). E is in second position, but we know E must be fifth, so E could be elsewhere? No, E is only confirmed at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? Let's clarify.

The feedback only says that E is in the word and in the correct position, which is fifth. But it doesn't say that there can't be another E. Similarly for A.

But since there's no feedback about multiple occurrences, I should assume for now that they are single occurrences, but I can't be sure.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", E was last and correct, A was third and correct, so A is definitely at position 3, E at position 5.

Other E's? Unlikely, but possible.

Similarly, A only at position 3.

Now, for ""leave"", it has E at position 2 and 5. But position 5 E is good, position 2 E is extra, and A at position 3, which matches. But ""leave"" has E at position 2, which might not be in the word since E might not be duplicated, but we don't know.

Similarly, letters: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). But E(2) could be absent or present; since E(5) is correct, E(2) might be incorrect.

In terms of testing, it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters where possible.

""SLATE"": all distinct letters: S,L,A,T,E.

A and E known present, S,L,T unknown.

Similarly, ""SHAME"": S,H,A,M,E? M could be, but S is first.

""SLATE"" seems standard.

I recall that in Wordle, with A and E fixed, ""SLATE"" is a good second guess.

Another is ""PLATE"" but P,L,A,T,E. Plate has P,L,A,T,E. Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Excluded letters are C,R,N not present, so PLATE is fine.

But ""SLATE"" avoids P, which is less common than S? S is very common.

""SLATE"" starts with S which is good.

""STATE"" has repeated T, not ideal.

""SCALE"" but C excluded.

So, I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""slate"".

So my guess should be ""slate"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Letters A and E are correct and in position 3 and 5 respectively (as indicated by the ✓).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by x).

For the next guess, I need to:
- Use the pattern _ _ A _ E (where positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown but should not be C, R, or N).
- Include new common letters to test for their presence and narrow down possibilities. Letters like S, L, and T are good candidates as they are frequent in English words.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, R, N).

A suitable guess is ""SLATE"":
- Position 1: S (untested)
- Position 2: L (untested)
- Position 3: A (✓ known)
- Position 4: T (untested)
- Position 5: E (✓ known)

This guess efficiently tests S, L, and T in new positions while respecting the known correct positions.

""place"" has P,L,A,C,E but C is excluded.

So, I need a word without C, R, N.

Also, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

List of tested letters: C (absent), R (absent), A (present, at pos 3), N (absent), E (present, at pos 5).

So untested letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

I should aim for a word that has frequent consonants and vowels.

For example, S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good guess might be ""SLATE"" or something similar.

But SLATE: S, L, A, T, E. Positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5).

This uses A and E in correct positions, introduces S, L, T which are all untested.

Another option: ""SHADE"" – S, H, A, D, E.

Or ""GLADE"" – G, L, A, D, E.

But ""SLATE"" seems nice because T is common.

What about ""SAUTE""? But U is less common.

I think ""SLATE"" is solid.

Since A and E are fixed, I can focus on the other positions.

Let me consider ""QUAKE"", but Q is rare.

Better to stick with common letters.

Another common starter word is ""ADIEU"", but A and E positions are fixed, ""adieu"" has A first, not third, so no.

Must have A at 3 and E at 5.

Other words: ""PLANE"" but it has N which is excluded? Plane: P,L,A,N,E. N is absent, so not good to use known absent letters.

N is excluded, so avoid N.

In ""SLATE"", no excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E. All are possible except A and E known.

S, L, T are new.

Similarly, ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. H and D new.

But ""SLATE"" might be better because L and T are more common in multiple positions.

In Wordle, after such feedback, ""SLATE"" is a good guess because it tests S, L, T.

I could consider ""ALIVE"" but that has A first, not third.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

Another word is ""GRATE"" but G,R,A,T,E? R is excluded, so no.

R is absent.

So, avoid R.

Similarly, C and N absent.

So, available letters.

""PHASE"": P,H,A,S,E? Positions: P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5).

That could be, tests P, H, S.

But ""SLATE"" tests S, L, T.

I think ""SLATE"" is fine.

To cover more vowels, ""OPAQUE"" is 6 letters, not 5.

No.

""AISLE"" has A first, and no E in fifth; ends with E, but A is position 1.

Not matching pattern.

Must have 3rd letter A and 5th letter E.

So candidates: words ending with ...A..E, specifically position 3:A, position 5:E.

Like ""crave"" but C and R excluded.

""brave"" B,R,A,V,E? R excluded.

""leave"" L,E,A,V,E? But positions: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). E is in second position, but we know E must be fifth, so E could be elsewhere? No, E is only confirmed at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? Let's clarify.

The feedback only says that E is in the word and in the correct position, which is fifth. But it doesn't say that there can't be another E. Similarly for A.

But since there's no feedback about multiple occurrences, I should assume for now that they are single occurrences, but I can't be sure.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", E was last and correct, A was third and correct, so A is definitely at position 3, E at position 5.

Other E's? Unlikely, but possible.

Similarly, A only at position 3.

Now, for ""leave"", it has E at position 2 and 5. But position 5 E is good, position 2 E is extra, and A at position 3, which matches. But ""leave"" has E at position 2, which might not be in the word since E might not be duplicated, but we don't know.

Similarly, letters: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). But E(2) could be absent or present; since E(5) is correct, E(2) might be incorrect.

In terms of testing, it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters where possible.

""SLATE"": all distinct letters: S,L,A,T,E.

A and E known present, S,L,T unknown.

Similarly, ""SHAME"": S,H,A,M,E? M could be, but S is first.

""SLATE"" seems standard.

I recall that in Wordle, with A and E fixed, ""SLATE"" is a good second guess.

Another is ""PLATE"" but P,L,A,T,E. Plate has P,L,A,T,E. Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Excluded letters are C,R,N not present, so PLATE is fine.

But ""SLATE"" avoids P, which is less common than S? S is very common.

""SLATE"" starts with S which is good.

""STATE"" has repeated T, not ideal.

""SCALE"" but C excluded.

So, I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""slate"".

So my guess should be ""slate"".Based on the previous feedback:
- Letters A and E are correct and in position 3 and 5 respectively (as indicated by the ✓).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by x).

For the next guess, I need to:
- Use the pattern _ _ A _ E (where positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown but should not be C, R, or N).
- Include new common letters to test for their presence and narrow down possibilities. Letters like S, L, and T are good candidates as they are frequent in English words.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, R, N).

A suitable guess is ""SLATE"":
- Position 1: S (untested)
- Position 2: L (untested)
- Position 3: A (✓ known)
- Position 4: T (untested)
- Position 5: E (✓ known)

This guess efficiently tests S, L, and T in new positions while respecting the known correct positions.

We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

So, we know:
- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

New information:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as present but wrong position).

Also, we can add L to the list of absent letters.

Current knowledge:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- T is in the word, but not in position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L

The word pattern is: S _ A _ E

T is present but not in position 4. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2. Why? Because the only other position available is position 2 or 4, but position 4 is where T was placed and it was wrong, so T must be in position 2.

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: ? (must be T, because T is present and not in 4, and 1,3,5 are fixed and not T? But S is fixed at 1, A at 3, E at 5, so the only positions left are 2 and 4. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.

But we don't know for sure that T is in position 2; it could be that T is in the word and we need to place it in position 2 in the next guess to test, but actually, the feedback says T is present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2 because that's the only other position available? Not necessarily, because the word could have T in position 2, but we need to confirm.

The word has five positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: cannot be T (because in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not there)
- Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

Moreover, since position 2 is the only unknown position that could hold T, and T must be somewhere, so position 2 must be T.

But is that correct? Let me think: the word has T, and it's not in position 4, and positions 1,3,5 are occupied by S, A, E which are fixed and different from T (unless there is duplication, but we don't know). S, A, E are different letters, and T is another letter, so likely no duplication. But we should consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but in this case, since T is a separate letter, and positions 1,3,5 are fixed, T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word must be S T A ? E, but position 4 is unknown.

We have position 4 to determine.

Also, we know that T is in the word, so in position 2 it should be correct.

But we need to confirm with a guess.

In the next guess, we can set position 2 to T and try to find what is in position 4.

But we also need to make sure that the word is valid.

Current pattern: S _ A _ E, with the blank in position 2 must be T, and position 4 is unknown.

But we don't have direct confirmation that position 2 is T, but logically it must be.

To be safe, we can assume that and guess a word with S, T, A, ?, E.

Now, what can be in position 4?

We know absent letters: C, R, N, L.

Also, from the feedback, we have tested S, L, A, T, E. S and A and E are present, L absent, T present.

We need to find a letter for position 4 that is not C, R, N, L, and it must be a letter that can form a valid word.

Possible words: state, stage, stake, etc.

But ""state"" has T at position 2 and 4? ""state"" is S,T,A,T,E. But position 4 is T, but we know T is not in position 4 because in ""slate"" T was in position 4 and it was wrong position, meaning T is not in position 4. So ""state"" would have T in position 4, which is invalid.

Similarly, we need a word where position 4 is not T, and position 2 is T.

So, pattern: S T A ? E

Now, ? can be various letters, but not C, R, N, L, and also not S, A, E, T? S, A, E are already used, but they could be duplicated? But in ""slate"", S was in position 1 and correct, and E in 5 correct, A in 3 correct, and T was misplaced, so if there were duplicates, the feedback might show, but it didn't indicate any duplicate for S, A, or E, so probably no duplicates. But we can't be 100% sure, but for now, assume no duplicates.

So position 4 should be a new letter.

Common letters that can fit: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need a valid English word.

Possible words:
- stake: S,T,A,K,E
- stage: S,T,A,G,E
- stave: S,T,A,V,E
- stade: but D is possible, but ""stade"" is a word? Stade is a historical term for a stadium, but might be accepted.
- state: but position 4 is T, which is invalid as per feedback.

""state"" has T at position 4, which we know is wrong, so not possible.

Similarly, ""stale"" has L, but L is absent.

L is absent, so not ""stale"".

""stare"" has R, absent.

""spate"" has P, which is possible: S,P,A,T,E but positions: S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But in this case, position 2 is P, not T. But we think position 2 should be T.

In our pattern, we have position 2 as T.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

Perhaps T is not in position 2? But where else can it be?

Positions: 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E, 4 cannot be T, so only position 2 is left. So T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

Now, for position 4, we need a letter that forms a valid word.

Common words:
- stake (K)
- stage (G)
- stave (V)
- stade (D) - less common
- stape - not a word
- stane - but N is absent
- so not

Also, ""smaze"" is rare.

Better to choose a common word.

We also have the feedback that T is present but not in position 4, which we used.

In the next guess, we can confirm by setting position 2 to T and trying a letter for position 4.

But we need to guess a word.

Since we have to make a guess, let's list possible words: stake, stage, stave, etc.

But we can also test other letters.

Another idea: we might not be sure about position 2, but I think it's safe.

To be thorough, let's consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but it's unlikely.

For example, if the word had two T's, but in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, which means there is a T elsewhere, but it could be that position 2 is not T, but that would require position 2 to be something else and T to be in position 2 or elsewhere, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so only position 2 is available for T. If there were two T's, one could be in position 2 and one elsewhere, but position 4 is not T, so if there is another T, it must be in position 2, and position 4 is different.

But in any case, position 2 must be T if there is only one T, or if there are two, position 2 could be T and position 4 something else.

But since position 4 is not T, position 2 must be T to have T in the word.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

Now, for the guess, we can choose a word like ""stake"" to test K, or ""stage"" to test G, etc.

But we also need to consider that we have only 4 guesses left, but we can solve it.

Another thing: in the feedback for ""slate"", we have S correct, A correct, E correct, L absent, T present but wrong position.

So for the next guess, if we guess ""stake"", for example, it would be S(1), T(2), A(3), K(4), E(5).

If K is correct, we might get it, or if not, we get feedback.

Similarly.

But to maximize information, since we have only position 4 unknown, we might as well guess a word that could be correct.

Possible letters for position 4: since absent letters are C,R,N,L, and we have many options.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But we need a word: stake (K), stage (G), stade (D), stave (V), stope? But stope is S,T,O,P,E, but position 3 is O, not A, no.

Pattern must be S T A ? E.

So:
- stake: K
- stage: G
- stane: but N absent, invalid
- state: T, but position 4 T invalid
- stape: not common
- stave: V
- swage: but W, and position 2 is W, not T? No, we need position 2 T.

""swage"" is S,W,A,G,E, not T.

So only words with S, T, A, ?, E.

Another one: ""stake"", ""stage"", ""stave"", ""stale"" but L absent, ""stare"" R absent, ""stoke"" position 3 O not A.

So limited options.

""styme""? Not a word.

I think the common ones are stake, stage, stave.

Also, ""sedge"" but position 2 E, not T.

No.

So, I think ""stake"" is a good guess.

But let's see if we can test more letters, but since only one position is unknown, we can guess one of these.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has a different letter to test, but it might not be necessary.

Another idea: we know T is present, but we don't know if it's in position 2, but we deduced it must be.

To confirm, we could guess a word with T in position 2 and a new letter in position 4.

I think ""stake"" is fine.

But in ""stake"", if we guess it, and if it's correct, great, if not, we get feedback on K.

Similarly.

Since we have the pattern, we can list all possible words and choose one.

Possible words: 
- stake
- stage
- stave
- stade (if accepted)
- sware? S,W,A,R,E but R absent
- skate: but K, but position 1 is S, position 2 K, not T? ""skate"" is S,K,A,T,E, so position 2 is K, position 4 is T. But we think position 2 should be T, so not.

In ""skate"", position 4 is T, which we know is wrong, so it would be invalid to guess because T cannot be in position 4.

Similarly, any word with T in position 4 is invalid.

So back to S T A ? E.

I think ""stake"" is a common word.

""stage"" is also common.

""stave"" is less common but possible.

To decide, I can choose ""stake"" as it's very common.

But let's see the previous feedback.

Another thing: in the first guess, we had A and E correct, and now S correct, T present.

So for the next guess, ""stake"" seems good.

Perhaps we can think if there is a word that uses untested letters.

But position 4 is the only unknown, so we have to choose a letter.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""stake"".

But let's make sure about the position.

Perhaps T is not in position 2? But I think it must be.

Assume the word is S T A ? E.

Guess: stake.

But in the response format.

So, thought process: Based on feedback, position 1 is S, position 3 is A, position 5 is E. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2. Therefore, the word is S T A ? E. For the next guess, I choose ""stake"" to test K in position 4.

If not, we can adjust.

But ""stake"" might be the word.

So, <guess>stake</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""slate"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  
  This provides new information:  
  - S is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.  
  - L is not in the word.  
  - T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it received ""-"", meaning it is present but misplaced).  
  - A and E remain correctly placed at positions 3 and 5.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word must have the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed as S, A, and E, respectively).
- T is confirmed to be in the word but cannot be in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback). Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed and occupied by S, A, and E (which are distinct from T), T must be in position 2. This is the only remaining position where T can appear.
- Therefore, the word structure is: **S T A ? E**, where position 4 is the only unknown.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L (from both feedbacks). Position 4 must be a letter not in this absent list and not S, A, T, or E (assuming no duplicates for simplicity, as no duplicates were indicated in feedback).
- Possible letters for position 4 include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc., but it must form a valid English word.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- With only position 4 unknown, the next guess should test a likely letter for that position to solve the word efficiently.
- Common 5-letter words fitting **S T A ? E** include:
  - ""stake"" (position 4 = K)
  - ""stage"" (position 4 = G)
  - ""stave"" (position 4 = V)
  - ""stade"" (position 4 = D, less common)
- ""stake"" is chosen as the guess because:
  - It uses K, a common untested letter.
  - It is a high-frequency word, increasing the chance of being correct.
  - If incorrect, the feedback on K will immediately confirm or eliminate it for position 4, narrowing possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if K is wrong, ""stage"" or ""stave"" could be next).

<guess>stake</guess>",stake,"We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

So, we know:
- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

New information:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as present but wrong position).

Also, we can add L to the list of absent letters.

Current knowledge:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- T is in the word, but not in position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L

The word pattern is: S _ A _ E

T is present but not in position 4. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2. Why? Because the only other position available is position 2 or 4, but position 4 is where T was placed and it was wrong, so T must be in position 2.

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: ? (must be T, because T is present and not in 4, and 1,3,5 are fixed and not T? But S is fixed at 1, A at 3, E at 5, so the only positions left are 2 and 4. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.

But we don't know for sure that T is in position 2; it could be that T is in the word and we need to place it in position 2 in the next guess to test, but actually, the feedback says T is present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2 because that's the only other position available? Not necessarily, because the word could have T in position 2, but we need to confirm.

The word has five positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: cannot be T (because in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not there)
- Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

Moreover, since position 2 is the only unknown position that could hold T, and T must be somewhere, so position 2 must be T.

But is that correct? Let me think: the word has T, and it's not in position 4, and positions 1,3,5 are occupied by S, A, E which are fixed and different from T (unless there is duplication, but we don't know). S, A, E are different letters, and T is another letter, so likely no duplication. But we should consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but in this case, since T is a separate letter, and positions 1,3,5 are fixed, T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word must be S T A ? E, but position 4 is unknown.

We have position 4 to determine.

Also, we know that T is in the word, so in position 2 it should be correct.

But we need to confirm with a guess.

In the next guess, we can set position 2 to T and try to find what is in position 4.

But we also need to make sure that the word is valid.

Current pattern: S _ A _ E, with the blank in position 2 must be T, and position 4 is unknown.

But we don't have direct confirmation that position 2 is T, but logically it must be.

To be safe, we can assume that and guess a word with S, T, A, ?, E.

Now, what can be in position 4?

We know absent letters: C, R, N, L.

Also, from the feedback, we have tested S, L, A, T, E. S and A and E are present, L absent, T present.

We need to find a letter for position 4 that is not C, R, N, L, and it must be a letter that can form a valid word.

Possible words: state, stage, stake, etc.

But ""state"" has T at position 2 and 4? ""state"" is S,T,A,T,E. But position 4 is T, but we know T is not in position 4 because in ""slate"" T was in position 4 and it was wrong position, meaning T is not in position 4. So ""state"" would have T in position 4, which is invalid.

Similarly, we need a word where position 4 is not T, and position 2 is T.

So, pattern: S T A ? E

Now, ? can be various letters, but not C, R, N, L, and also not S, A, E, T? S, A, E are already used, but they could be duplicated? But in ""slate"", S was in position 1 and correct, and E in 5 correct, A in 3 correct, and T was misplaced, so if there were duplicates, the feedback might show, but it didn't indicate any duplicate for S, A, or E, so probably no duplicates. But we can't be 100% sure, but for now, assume no duplicates.

So position 4 should be a new letter.

Common letters that can fit: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need a valid English word.

Possible words:
- stake: S,T,A,K,E
- stage: S,T,A,G,E
- stave: S,T,A,V,E
- stade: but D is possible, but ""stade"" is a word? Stade is a historical term for a stadium, but might be accepted.
- state: but position 4 is T, which is invalid as per feedback.

""state"" has T at position 4, which we know is wrong, so not possible.

Similarly, ""stale"" has L, but L is absent.

L is absent, so not ""stale"".

""stare"" has R, absent.

""spate"" has P, which is possible: S,P,A,T,E but positions: S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But in this case, position 2 is P, not T. But we think position 2 should be T.

In our pattern, we have position 2 as T.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

Perhaps T is not in position 2? But where else can it be?

Positions: 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E, 4 cannot be T, so only position 2 is left. So T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

Now, for position 4, we need a letter that forms a valid word.

Common words:
- stake (K)
- stage (G)
- stave (V)
- stade (D) - less common
- stape - not a word
- stane - but N is absent
- so not

Also, ""smaze"" is rare.

Better to choose a common word.

We also have the feedback that T is present but not in position 4, which we used.

In the next guess, we can confirm by setting position 2 to T and trying a letter for position 4.

But we need to guess a word.

Since we have to make a guess, let's list possible words: stake, stage, stave, etc.

But we can also test other letters.

Another idea: we might not be sure about position 2, but I think it's safe.

To be thorough, let's consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but it's unlikely.

For example, if the word had two T's, but in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, which means there is a T elsewhere, but it could be that position 2 is not T, but that would require position 2 to be something else and T to be in position 2 or elsewhere, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so only position 2 is available for T. If there were two T's, one could be in position 2 and one elsewhere, but position 4 is not T, so if there is another T, it must be in position 2, and position 4 is different.

But in any case, position 2 must be T if there is only one T, or if there are two, position 2 could be T and position 4 something else.

But since position 4 is not T, position 2 must be T to have T in the word.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

Now, for the guess, we can choose a word like ""stake"" to test K, or ""stage"" to test G, etc.

But we also need to consider that we have only 4 guesses left, but we can solve it.

Another thing: in the feedback for ""slate"", we have S correct, A correct, E correct, L absent, T present but wrong position.

So for the next guess, if we guess ""stake"", for example, it would be S(1), T(2), A(3), K(4), E(5).

If K is correct, we might get it, or if not, we get feedback.

Similarly.

But to maximize information, since we have only position 4 unknown, we might as well guess a word that could be correct.

Possible letters for position 4: since absent letters are C,R,N,L, and we have many options.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But we need a word: stake (K), stage (G), stade (D), stave (V), stope? But stope is S,T,O,P,E, but position 3 is O, not A, no.

Pattern must be S T A ? E.

So:
- stake: K
- stage: G
- stane: but N absent, invalid
- state: T, but position 4 T invalid
- stape: not common
- stave: V
- swage: but W, and position 2 is W, not T? No, we need position 2 T.

""swage"" is S,W,A,G,E, not T.

So only words with S, T, A, ?, E.

Another one: ""stake"", ""stage"", ""stave"", ""stale"" but L absent, ""stare"" R absent, ""stoke"" position 3 O not A.

So limited options.

""styme""? Not a word.

I think the common ones are stake, stage, stave.

Also, ""sedge"" but position 2 E, not T.

No.

So, I think ""stake"" is a good guess.

But let's see if we can test more letters, but since only one position is unknown, we can guess one of these.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has a different letter to test, but it might not be necessary.

Another idea: we know T is present, but we don't know if it's in position 2, but we deduced it must be.

To confirm, we could guess a word with T in position 2 and a new letter in position 4.

I think ""stake"" is fine.

But in ""stake"", if we guess it, and if it's correct, great, if not, we get feedback on K.

Similarly.

Since we have the pattern, we can list all possible words and choose one.

Possible words: 
- stake
- stage
- stave
- stade (if accepted)
- sware? S,W,A,R,E but R absent
- skate: but K, but position 1 is S, position 2 K, not T? ""skate"" is S,K,A,T,E, so position 2 is K, position 4 is T. But we think position 2 should be T, so not.

In ""skate"", position 4 is T, which we know is wrong, so it would be invalid to guess because T cannot be in position 4.

Similarly, any word with T in position 4 is invalid.

So back to S T A ? E.

I think ""stake"" is a common word.

""stage"" is also common.

""stave"" is less common but possible.

To decide, I can choose ""stake"" as it's very common.

But let's see the previous feedback.

Another thing: in the first guess, we had A and E correct, and now S correct, T present.

So for the next guess, ""stake"" seems good.

Perhaps we can think if there is a word that uses untested letters.

But position 4 is the only unknown, so we have to choose a letter.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""stake"".

But let's make sure about the position.

Perhaps T is not in position 2? But I think it must be.

Assume the word is S T A ? E.

Guess: stake.

But in the response format.

So, thought process: Based on feedback, position 1 is S, position 3 is A, position 5 is E. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2. Therefore, the word is S T A ? E. For the next guess, I choose ""stake"" to test K in position 4.

If not, we can adjust.

But ""stake"" might be the word.

So, <guess>stake</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,STAGE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I have the feedback from my first guess. I guessed ""crane"", and the feedback was:
- C: x (letter C not in the word)
- R: x (letter R not in the word)
- A: ✓ (letter A is in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (letter N not in the word)
- E: ✓ (letter E is in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this:
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all.
- Letters A and E are in the word, and they are in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in the third position, and E is in the fifth position, since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E.

The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.

I need to make a new guess that respects the known information:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter and E as the 5th letter.
- It does not contain C, R, or N.

Also, since it's a 5-letter English word, I should choose a word that fits this pattern: _ _ A _ E, where the first, second, and fourth letters are unknown, but should not be C, R, or N, and should be other letters.

Now, I need to figure out what letters could be in those positions. Since I have two letters confirmed, I should try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

Common letters in English five-letter words include vowels like I, O, U, and consonants like L, S, T, etc. But I already know A and E are in, so I might focus on consonants.

Possible words ending with A_E: like ""brace"", but B? ""brace"" has B, R, A, C, E. But R and C are not in the word, from feedback. R and C are excluded.

Words with pattern _ _ A _ E.

I should think of words like ""spade"", ""shade"", ""glade"", but let's see which letters are possible.

Excluded letters: C, R, N.

Also, since A and E are accounted for, I need new letters.

Aim to cover frequent letters not yet tested. For example, S, T, L, I, O.

Let me sketch possible words:
- If first letter is S: S _ A _ E → ""spade""? But ""spade"" has P and D. Is that possible?
- Or ""stale"", but ""stale"" has T, A, L, E? Positions: S (1), T (2), A (3), L (4), E (5). That could work.

But I haven't tested S or T or L yet.

Another option: ""shake"" – S,H,A,K,E – that has K, but positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), K (4), E (5).

Similarly, ""scale"" but ""scale"" has C and L, but C is excluded, so no.

C is excluded, so not ""scale"".

""place"" has P,L,A,C,E but C is excluded.

So, I need a word without C, R, N.

Also, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

List of tested letters: C (absent), R (absent), A (present, at pos 3), N (absent), E (present, at pos 5).

So untested letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

I should aim for a word that has frequent consonants and vowels.

For example, S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good guess might be ""SLATE"" or something similar.

But SLATE: S, L, A, T, E. Positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5).

This uses A and E in correct positions, introduces S, L, T which are all untested.

Another option: ""SHADE"" – S, H, A, D, E.

Or ""GLADE"" – G, L, A, D, E.

But ""SLATE"" seems nice because T is common.

What about ""SAUTE""? But U is less common.

I think ""SLATE"" is solid.

Since A and E are fixed, I can focus on the other positions.

Let me consider ""QUAKE"", but Q is rare.

Better to stick with common letters.

Another common starter word is ""ADIEU"", but A and E positions are fixed, ""adieu"" has A first, not third, so no.

Must have A at 3 and E at 5.

Other words: ""PLANE"" but it has N which is excluded? Plane: P,L,A,N,E. N is absent, so not good to use known absent letters.

N is excluded, so avoid N.

In ""SLATE"", no excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E. All are possible except A and E known.

S, L, T are new.

Similarly, ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. H and D new.

But ""SLATE"" might be better because L and T are more common in multiple positions.

In Wordle, after such feedback, ""SLATE"" is a good guess because it tests S, L, T.

I could consider ""ALIVE"" but that has A first, not third.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

Another word is ""GRATE"" but G,R,A,T,E? R is excluded, so no.

R is absent.

So, avoid R.

Similarly, C and N absent.

So, available letters.

""PHASE"": P,H,A,S,E? Positions: P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5).

That could be, tests P, H, S.

But ""SLATE"" tests S, L, T.

I think ""SLATE"" is fine.

To cover more vowels, ""OPAQUE"" is 6 letters, not 5.

No.

""AISLE"" has A first, and no E in fifth; ends with E, but A is position 1.

Not matching pattern.

Must have 3rd letter A and 5th letter E.

So candidates: words ending with ...A..E, specifically position 3:A, position 5:E.

Like ""crave"" but C and R excluded.

""brave"" B,R,A,V,E? R excluded.

""leave"" L,E,A,V,E? But positions: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). E is in second position, but we know E must be fifth, so E could be elsewhere? No, E is only confirmed at position 5, but it could be elsewhere? Let's clarify.

The feedback only says that E is in the word and in the correct position, which is fifth. But it doesn't say that there can't be another E. Similarly for A.

But since there's no feedback about multiple occurrences, I should assume for now that they are single occurrences, but I can't be sure.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", E was last and correct, A was third and correct, so A is definitely at position 3, E at position 5.

Other E's? Unlikely, but possible.

Similarly, A only at position 3.

Now, for ""leave"", it has E at position 2 and 5. But position 5 E is good, position 2 E is extra, and A at position 3, which matches. But ""leave"" has E at position 2, which might not be in the word since E might not be duplicated, but we don't know.

Similarly, letters: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). But E(2) could be absent or present; since E(5) is correct, E(2) might be incorrect.

In terms of testing, it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters where possible.

""SLATE"": all distinct letters: S,L,A,T,E.

A and E known present, S,L,T unknown.

Similarly, ""SHAME"": S,H,A,M,E? M could be, but S is first.

""SLATE"" seems standard.

I recall that in Wordle, with A and E fixed, ""SLATE"" is a good second guess.

Another is ""PLATE"" but P,L,A,T,E. Plate has P,L,A,T,E. Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Excluded letters are C,R,N not present, so PLATE is fine.

But ""SLATE"" avoids P, which is less common than S? S is very common.

""SLATE"" starts with S which is good.

""STATE"" has repeated T, not ideal.

""SCALE"" but C excluded.

So, I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""slate"".

So my guess should be ""slate"".Based on the previous feedback:
- Letters A and E are correct and in position 3 and 5 respectively (as indicated by the ✓).
- Letters C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by x).

For the next guess, I need to:
- Use the pattern _ _ A _ E (where positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown but should not be C, R, or N).
- Include new common letters to test for their presence and narrow down possibilities. Letters like S, L, and T are good candidates as they are frequent in English words.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, R, N).

A suitable guess is ""SLATE"":
- Position 1: S (untested)
- Position 2: L (untested)
- Position 3: A (✓ known)
- Position 4: T (untested)
- Position 5: E (✓ known)

This guess efficiently tests S, L, and T in new positions while respecting the known correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

So, we know:
- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

New information:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as present but wrong position).

Also, we can add L to the list of absent letters.

Current knowledge:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- T is in the word, but not in position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L

The word pattern is: S _ A _ E

T is present but not in position 4. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2. Why? Because the only other position available is position 2 or 4, but position 4 is where T was placed and it was wrong, so T must be in position 2.

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: ? (must be T, because T is present and not in 4, and 1,3,5 are fixed and not T? But S is fixed at 1, A at 3, E at 5, so the only positions left are 2 and 4. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.

But we don't know for sure that T is in position 2; it could be that T is in the word and we need to place it in position 2 in the next guess to test, but actually, the feedback says T is present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2 because that's the only other position available? Not necessarily, because the word could have T in position 2, but we need to confirm.

The word has five positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: cannot be T (because in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not there)
- Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

Moreover, since position 2 is the only unknown position that could hold T, and T must be somewhere, so position 2 must be T.

But is that correct? Let me think: the word has T, and it's not in position 4, and positions 1,3,5 are occupied by S, A, E which are fixed and different from T (unless there is duplication, but we don't know). S, A, E are different letters, and T is another letter, so likely no duplication. But we should consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but in this case, since T is a separate letter, and positions 1,3,5 are fixed, T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word must be S T A ? E, but position 4 is unknown.

We have position 4 to determine.

Also, we know that T is in the word, so in position 2 it should be correct.

But we need to confirm with a guess.

In the next guess, we can set position 2 to T and try to find what is in position 4.

But we also need to make sure that the word is valid.

Current pattern: S _ A _ E, with the blank in position 2 must be T, and position 4 is unknown.

But we don't have direct confirmation that position 2 is T, but logically it must be.

To be safe, we can assume that and guess a word with S, T, A, ?, E.

Now, what can be in position 4?

We know absent letters: C, R, N, L.

Also, from the feedback, we have tested S, L, A, T, E. S and A and E are present, L absent, T present.

We need to find a letter for position 4 that is not C, R, N, L, and it must be a letter that can form a valid word.

Possible words: state, stage, stake, etc.

But ""state"" has T at position 2 and 4? ""state"" is S,T,A,T,E. But position 4 is T, but we know T is not in position 4 because in ""slate"" T was in position 4 and it was wrong position, meaning T is not in position 4. So ""state"" would have T in position 4, which is invalid.

Similarly, we need a word where position 4 is not T, and position 2 is T.

So, pattern: S T A ? E

Now, ? can be various letters, but not C, R, N, L, and also not S, A, E, T? S, A, E are already used, but they could be duplicated? But in ""slate"", S was in position 1 and correct, and E in 5 correct, A in 3 correct, and T was misplaced, so if there were duplicates, the feedback might show, but it didn't indicate any duplicate for S, A, or E, so probably no duplicates. But we can't be 100% sure, but for now, assume no duplicates.

So position 4 should be a new letter.

Common letters that can fit: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need a valid English word.

Possible words:
- stake: S,T,A,K,E
- stage: S,T,A,G,E
- stave: S,T,A,V,E
- stade: but D is possible, but ""stade"" is a word? Stade is a historical term for a stadium, but might be accepted.
- state: but position 4 is T, which is invalid as per feedback.

""state"" has T at position 4, which we know is wrong, so not possible.

Similarly, ""stale"" has L, but L is absent.

L is absent, so not ""stale"".

""stare"" has R, absent.

""spate"" has P, which is possible: S,P,A,T,E but positions: S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But in this case, position 2 is P, not T. But we think position 2 should be T.

In our pattern, we have position 2 as T.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

Perhaps T is not in position 2? But where else can it be?

Positions: 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E, 4 cannot be T, so only position 2 is left. So T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

Now, for position 4, we need a letter that forms a valid word.

Common words:
- stake (K)
- stage (G)
- stave (V)
- stade (D) - less common
- stape - not a word
- stane - but N is absent
- so not

Also, ""smaze"" is rare.

Better to choose a common word.

We also have the feedback that T is present but not in position 4, which we used.

In the next guess, we can confirm by setting position 2 to T and trying a letter for position 4.

But we need to guess a word.

Since we have to make a guess, let's list possible words: stake, stage, stave, etc.

But we can also test other letters.

Another idea: we might not be sure about position 2, but I think it's safe.

To be thorough, let's consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but it's unlikely.

For example, if the word had two T's, but in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, which means there is a T elsewhere, but it could be that position 2 is not T, but that would require position 2 to be something else and T to be in position 2 or elsewhere, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so only position 2 is available for T. If there were two T's, one could be in position 2 and one elsewhere, but position 4 is not T, so if there is another T, it must be in position 2, and position 4 is different.

But in any case, position 2 must be T if there is only one T, or if there are two, position 2 could be T and position 4 something else.

But since position 4 is not T, position 2 must be T to have T in the word.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

Now, for the guess, we can choose a word like ""stake"" to test K, or ""stage"" to test G, etc.

But we also need to consider that we have only 4 guesses left, but we can solve it.

Another thing: in the feedback for ""slate"", we have S correct, A correct, E correct, L absent, T present but wrong position.

So for the next guess, if we guess ""stake"", for example, it would be S(1), T(2), A(3), K(4), E(5).

If K is correct, we might get it, or if not, we get feedback.

Similarly.

But to maximize information, since we have only position 4 unknown, we might as well guess a word that could be correct.

Possible letters for position 4: since absent letters are C,R,N,L, and we have many options.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But we need a word: stake (K), stage (G), stade (D), stave (V), stope? But stope is S,T,O,P,E, but position 3 is O, not A, no.

Pattern must be S T A ? E.

So:
- stake: K
- stage: G
- stane: but N absent, invalid
- state: T, but position 4 T invalid
- stape: not common
- stave: V
- swage: but W, and position 2 is W, not T? No, we need position 2 T.

""swage"" is S,W,A,G,E, not T.

So only words with S, T, A, ?, E.

Another one: ""stake"", ""stage"", ""stave"", ""stale"" but L absent, ""stare"" R absent, ""stoke"" position 3 O not A.

So limited options.

""styme""? Not a word.

I think the common ones are stake, stage, stave.

Also, ""sedge"" but position 2 E, not T.

No.

So, I think ""stake"" is a good guess.

But let's see if we can test more letters, but since only one position is unknown, we can guess one of these.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has a different letter to test, but it might not be necessary.

Another idea: we know T is present, but we don't know if it's in position 2, but we deduced it must be.

To confirm, we could guess a word with T in position 2 and a new letter in position 4.

I think ""stake"" is fine.

But in ""stake"", if we guess it, and if it's correct, great, if not, we get feedback on K.

Similarly.

Since we have the pattern, we can list all possible words and choose one.

Possible words: 
- stake
- stage
- stave
- stade (if accepted)
- sware? S,W,A,R,E but R absent
- skate: but K, but position 1 is S, position 2 K, not T? ""skate"" is S,K,A,T,E, so position 2 is K, position 4 is T. But we think position 2 should be T, so not.

In ""skate"", position 4 is T, which we know is wrong, so it would be invalid to guess because T cannot be in position 4.

Similarly, any word with T in position 4 is invalid.

So back to S T A ? E.

I think ""stake"" is a common word.

""stage"" is also common.

""stave"" is less common but possible.

To decide, I can choose ""stake"" as it's very common.

But let's see the previous feedback.

Another thing: in the first guess, we had A and E correct, and now S correct, T present.

So for the next guess, ""stake"" seems good.

Perhaps we can think if there is a word that uses untested letters.

But position 4 is the only unknown, so we have to choose a letter.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""stake"".

But let's make sure about the position.

Perhaps T is not in position 2? But I think it must be.

Assume the word is S T A ? E.

Guess: stake.

But in the response format.

So, thought process: Based on feedback, position 1 is S, position 3 is A, position 5 is E. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2. Therefore, the word is S T A ? E. For the next guess, I choose ""stake"" to test K in position 4.

If not, we can adjust.

But ""stake"" might be the word.

So, <guess>stake</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""slate"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  
  This provides new information:  
  - S is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.  
  - L is not in the word.  
  - T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it received ""-"", meaning it is present but misplaced).  
  - A and E remain correctly placed at positions 3 and 5.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word must have the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed as S, A, and E, respectively).
- T is confirmed to be in the word but cannot be in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback). Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed and occupied by S, A, and E (which are distinct from T), T must be in position 2. This is the only remaining position where T can appear.
- Therefore, the word structure is: **S T A ? E**, where position 4 is the only unknown.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L (from both feedbacks). Position 4 must be a letter not in this absent list and not S, A, T, or E (assuming no duplicates for simplicity, as no duplicates were indicated in feedback).
- Possible letters for position 4 include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc., but it must form a valid English word.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- With only position 4 unknown, the next guess should test a likely letter for that position to solve the word efficiently.
- Common 5-letter words fitting **S T A ? E** include:
  - ""stake"" (position 4 = K)
  - ""stage"" (position 4 = G)
  - ""stave"" (position 4 = V)
  - ""stade"" (position 4 = D, less common)
- ""stake"" is chosen as the guess because:
  - It uses K, a common untested letter.
  - It is a high-frequency word, increasing the chance of being correct.
  - If incorrect, the feedback on K will immediately confirm or eliminate it for position 4, narrowing possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if K is wrong, ""stage"" or ""stave"" could be next).

Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2. Why? Because the only other position available is position 2 or 4, but position 4 is where T was placed and it was wrong, so T must be in position 2.\n\nPositions:\n1: S (fixed)\n2: ? (must be T, because T is present and not in 4, and 1,3,5 are fixed and not T? But S is fixed at 1, A at 3, E at 5, so the only positions left are 2 and 4. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure that T is in position 2; it could be that T is in the word and we need to place it in position 2 in the next guess to test, but actually, the feedback says T is present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2 because that\'s the only other position available? Not necessarily, because the word could have T in position 2, but we need to confirm.\n\nThe word has five positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 5: E\n- Position 4: cannot be T (because in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not there)\n- Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.\n\nMoreover, since position 2 is the only unknown position that could hold T, and T must be somewhere, so position 2 must be T.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me think: the word has T, and it\'s not in position 4, and positions 1,3,5 are occupied by S, A, E which are fixed and different from T (unless there is duplication, but we don\'t know). S, A, E are different letters, and T is another letter, so likely no duplication. But we should consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but in this case, since T is a separate letter, and positions 1,3,5 are fixed, T must be in position 2.\n\nTherefore, the word must be S T A ? E, but position 4 is unknown.\n\nWe have position 4 to determine.\n\nAlso, we know that T is in the word, so in position 2 it should be correct.\n\nBut we need to confirm with a guess.\n\nIn the next guess, we can set position 2 to T and try to find what is in position 4.\n\nBut we also need to make sure that the word is valid.\n\nCurrent pattern: S _ A _ E, with the blank in position 2 must be T, and position 4 is unknown.\n\nBut we don\'t have direct confirmation that position 2 is T, but logically it must be.\n\nTo be safe, we can assume that and guess a word with S, T, A, ?, E.\n\nNow, what can be in position 4?\n\nWe know absent letters: C, R, N, L.\n\nAlso, from the feedback, we have tested S, L, A, T, E. S and A and E are present, L absent, T present.\n\nWe need to find a letter for position 4 that is not C, R, N, L, and it must be a letter that can form a valid word.\n\nPossible words: state, stage, stake, etc.\n\nBut ""state"" has T at position 2 and 4? ""state"" is S,T,A,T,E. But position 4 is T, but we know T is not in position 4 because in ""slate"" T was in position 4 and it was wrong position, meaning T is not in position 4. So ""state"" would have T in position 4, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we need a word where position 4 is not T, and position 2 is T.\n\nSo, pattern: S T A ? E\n\nNow, ? can be various letters, but not C, R, N, L, and also not S, A, E, T? S, A, E are already used, but they could be duplicated? But in ""slate"", S was in position 1 and correct, and E in 5 correct, A in 3 correct, and T was misplaced, so if there were duplicates, the feedback might show, but it didn\'t indicate any duplicate for S, A, or E, so probably no duplicates. But we can\'t be 100% sure, but for now, assume no duplicates.\n\nSo position 4 should be a new letter.\n\nCommon letters that can fit: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut we need a valid English word.\n\nPossible words:\n- stake: S,T,A,K,E\n- stage: S,T,A,G,E\n- stave: S,T,A,V,E\n- stade: but D is possible, but ""stade"" is a word? Stade is a historical term for a stadium, but might be accepted.\n- state: but position 4 is T, which is invalid as per feedback.\n\n""state"" has T at position 4, which we know is wrong, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""stale"" has L, but L is absent.\n\nL is absent, so not ""stale"".\n\n""stare"" has R, absent.\n\n""spate"" has P, which is possible: S,P,A,T,E but positions: S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But in this case, position 2 is P, not T. But we think position 2 should be T.\n\nIn our pattern, we have position 2 as T.\n\nBut let\'s not jump to conclusions.\n\nPerhaps T is not in position 2? But where else can it be?\n\nPositions: 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E, 4 cannot be T, so only position 2 is left. So T must be in position 2.\n\nTherefore, the word is S T A ? E.\n\nNow, for position 4, we need a letter that forms a valid word.\n\nCommon words:\n- stake (K)\n- stage (G)\n- stave (V)\n- stade (D) - less common\n- stape - not a word\n- stane - but N is absent\n- so not\n\nAlso, ""smaze"" is rare.\n\nBetter to choose a common word.\n\nWe also have the feedback that T is present but not in position 4, which we used.\n\nIn the next guess, we can confirm by setting position 2 to T and trying a letter for position 4.\n\nBut we need to guess a word.\n\nSince we have to make a guess, let\'s list possible words: stake, stage, stave, etc.\n\nBut we can also test other letters.\n\nAnother idea: we might not be sure about position 2, but I think it\'s safe.\n\nTo be thorough, let\'s consider the possibility of duplicate letters, but it\'s unlikely.\n\nFor example, if the word had two T\'s, but in ""slate"", T was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, which means there is a T elsewhere, but it could be that position 2 is not T, but that would require position 2 to be something else and T to be in position 2 or elsewhere, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so only position 2 is available for T. If there were two T\'s, one could be in position 2 and one elsewhere, but position 4 is not T, so if there is another T, it must be in position 2, and position 4 is different.\n\nBut in any case, position 2 must be T if there is only one T, or if there are two, position 2 could be T and position 4 something else.\n\nBut since position 4 is not T, position 2 must be T to have T in the word.\n\nTherefore, the word is S T A ? E.\n\nNow, for the guess, we can choose a word like ""stake"" to test K, or ""stage"" to test G, etc.\n\nBut we also need to consider that we have only 4 guesses left, but we can solve it.\n\nAnother thing: in the feedback for ""slate"", we have S correct, A correct, E correct, L absent, T present but wrong position.\n\nSo for the next guess, if we guess ""stake"", for example, it would be S(1), T(2), A(3), K(4), E(5).\n\nIf K is correct, we might get it, or if not, we get feedback.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to maximize information, since we have only position 4 unknown, we might as well guess a word that could be correct.\n\nPossible letters for position 4: since absent letters are C,R,N,L, and we have many options.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need a word: stake (K), stage (G), stade (D), stave (V), stope? But stope is S,T,O,P,E, but position 3 is O, not A, no.\n\nPattern must be S T A ? E.\n\nSo:\n- stake: K\n- stage: G\n- stane: but N absent, invalid\n- state: T, but position 4 T invalid\n- stape: not common\n- stave: V\n- swage: but W, and position 2 is W, not T? No, we need position 2 T.\n\n""swage"" is S,W,A,G,E, not T.\n\nSo only words with S, T, A, ?, E.\n\nAnother one: ""stake"", ""stage"", ""stave"", ""stale"" but L absent, ""stare"" R absent, ""stoke"" position 3 O not A.\n\nSo limited options.\n\n""styme""? Not a word.\n\nI think the common ones are stake, stage, stave.\n\nAlso, ""sedge"" but position 2 E, not T.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, I think ""stake"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can test more letters, but since only one position is unknown, we can guess one of these.\n\nPerhaps we can guess a word that has a different letter to test, but it might not be necessary.\n\nAnother idea: we know T is present, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 2, but we deduced it must be.\n\nTo confirm, we could guess a word with T in position 2 and a new letter in position 4.\n\nI think ""stake"" is fine.\n\nBut in ""stake"", if we guess it, and if it\'s correct, great, if not, we get feedback on K.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSince we have the pattern, we can list all possible words and choose one.\n\nPossible words: \n- stake\n- stage\n- stave\n- stade (if accepted)\n- sware? S,W,A,R,E but R absent\n- skate: but K, but position 1 is S, position 2 K, not T? ""skate"" is S,K,A,T,E, so position 2 is K, position 4 is T. But we think position 2 should be T, so not.\n\nIn ""skate"", position 4 is T, which we know is wrong, so it would be invalid to guess because T cannot be in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, any word with T in position 4 is invalid.\n\nSo back to S T A ? E.\n\nI think ""stake"" is a common word.\n\n""stage"" is also common.\n\n""stave"" is less common but possible.\n\nTo decide, I can choose ""stake"" as it\'s very common.\n\nBut let\'s see the previous feedback.\n\nAnother thing: in the first guess, we had A and E correct, and now S correct, T present.\n\nSo for the next guess, ""stake"" seems good.\n\nPerhaps we can think if there is a word that uses untested letters.\n\nBut position 4 is the only unknown, so we have to choose a letter.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""stake"".\n\nBut let\'s make sure about the position.\n\nPerhaps T is not in position 2? But I think it must be.\n\nAssume the word is S T A ? E.\n\nGuess: stake.\n\nBut in the response format.\n\nSo, thought process: Based on feedback, position 1 is S, position 3 is A, position 5 is E. T is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2. Therefore, the word is S T A ? E. For the next guess, I choose ""stake"" to test K in position 4.\n\nIf not, we can adjust.\n\nBut ""stake"" might be the word.\n\nSo, <guess>stake</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - A is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.  \n  - C, R, and N are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""slate"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  \n  This provides new information:  \n  - S is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.  \n  - L is not in the word.  \n  - T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it received ""-"", meaning it is present but misplaced).  \n  - A and E remain correctly placed at positions 3 and 5.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- The secret word must have the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed as S, A, and E, respectively).\n- T is confirmed to be in the word but cannot be in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback). Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed and occupied by S, A, and E (which are distinct from T), T must be in position 2. This is the only remaining position where T can appear.\n- Therefore, the word structure is: **S T A ? E**, where position 4 is the only unknown.\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, L (from both feedbacks). Position 4 must be a letter not in this absent list and not S, A, T, or E (assuming no duplicates for simplicity, as no duplicates were indicated in feedback).\n- Possible letters for position 4 include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc., but it must form a valid English word.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- With only position 4 unknown, the next guess should test a likely letter for that position to solve the word efficiently.\n- Common 5-letter words fitting **S T A ? E** include:\n  - ""stake"" (position 4 = K)\n  - ""stage"" (position 4 = G)\n  - ""stave"" (position 4 = V)\n  - ""stade"" (position 4 = D, less common)\n- ""stake"" is chosen as the guess because:\n  - It uses K, a common untested letter.\n  - It is a high-frequency word, increasing the chance of being correct.\n  - If incorrect, the feedback on K will immediately confirm or eliminate it for position 4, narrowing possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if K is wrong, ""stage"" or ""stave"" could be next).\n\n<guess>stake</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: stake -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: correct and in position 1 (✓)
- L: absent (x)
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
- T: present but wrong position (since it was in position 4 but is not correct there) (-)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Guess 3: ""stake""
- S: correct and in position 1 (✓)
- T: correct and in position 2 (✓)  [This is new information]
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
- K: absent (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correct letters in known positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: T  (from guess 3, T is now confirmed at position 2)
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 5: E

2. The only unknown position is position 4.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, L, K (from the feedback, these are not in the word)

4. We know the word must be of the form: S T A _ E

5. We need to find a letter for the fourth position that is not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 4: Since the absent letters are C, R, N, L, K, we can consider other common consonants or vowels. However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

Common words that fit the pattern ""ST A _ E"":

- ""stage"" (with G)
- ""stare"" (but R is absent, so no)
- ""stale"" (but L is absent, so no)
- ""stave"" (with V)
- ""stade"" (with D, but less common)
- ""stape"" (not common, might not be valid)
- ""state"" (but T is already in position 2, and we have no duplicate T indicated? Also, in guess 2, T was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning T is not in position 4. So ""state"" would have T in position 4, which is invalid.)

In guess 2, when we had ""slate"" with T in position 4, it was marked as ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, position 4 cannot be T. Also, in guess 3, we have T at position 2 and it is correct, so if there were a duplicate T, we don't have evidence for it, but it's possible. However, since in guess 3, with ""stake"", we have T at position 2 and it's correct, and K is absent, and no other T was present, so likely no duplicate.

But to be safe, we should avoid using T in position 4 because of the previous feedback.

So, possible words:

- ""stage"" (G in position 4)
- ""stave"" (V in position 4)
- ""stade"" (D in position 4) - but ""stade"" is a historical term, might not be common
- ""stane"" (but N is absent, so no)
- ""swage"" (W in position 2? No, pattern is fixed: position 2 is T, so ""swage"" is S,W,A,G,E, which doesn't fit)

Therefore, the most common words are ""stage"" and ""stave"".

We have not tested G or V yet.

Since we have only one position left, we can choose one of these.

""Stage"" is a very common word, so it's a good candidate.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""stope"" is S,T,O,P,E, but position 3 is O, not A. So no.

Or ""stoke"" similarly.

So, I think ""stage"" and ""stave"" are the main options.

We can also consider ""styme"" but that's not a standard word.

Given that, I propose ""stage"" as the next guess.

If we guess ""stage"", it will confirm if G is in position 4.

If it's not, then we can try ""stave"" next.

But we have two guesses left, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we might think of other letters, but G and V are the most likely.

Another word: ""stale"" is out because L is absent.

""stare"" is out because R is absent.

""stake"" we already tried and K is absent.

So, ""stage"" it is.

Therefore, the next guess is ""stage"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - A is in position 3, E is in position 5. C, R, N are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""slate"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  
  - S is in position 1, A in position 3, E in position 5. L is absent. T is in the word but not in position 4.

- **Guess 3: ""stake"" → Feedback: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)**  
  - S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 5. K is absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has fixed positions:  
  - Position 1: S  
  - Position 2: T  
  - Position 3: A  
  - Position 5: E  
  - Only position 4 is unknown (pattern: **S T A _ E**).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, K (cannot appear in position 4).
- T is confirmed in position 2, so position 4 cannot be T (as per Guess 2 feedback: T is not in position 4).
- Possible letters for position 4: Any letter not absent and not already placed (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.), but it must form a valid English word.
- Common words fitting this pattern: ""stage"" (G in position 4), ""stave"" (V in position 4), or ""stade"" (D in position 4, less common).

### Next Guess Strategy:
- ""stage"" is chosen because:
  - It tests G, a common untested letter for position 4.
  - It is a high-frequency word, increasing the chance of being correct.
  - If incorrect, feedback on G will confirm or eliminate it, leaving ""stave"" or other options for the next guess.

<guess>stage</guess>",stage,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: correct and in position 1 (✓)
- L: absent (x)
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
- T: present but wrong position (since it was in position 4 but is not correct there) (-)

- T: correct and in position 2 (✓)  [This is new information]
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
- K: absent (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correct letters in known positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: T  (from guess 3, T is now confirmed at position 2)
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 5: E

2. The only unknown position is position 4.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, L, K (from the feedback, these are not in the word)

4. We know the word must be of the form: S T A _ E

5. We need to find a letter for the fourth position that is not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 4: Since the absent letters are C, R, N, L, K, we can consider other common consonants or vowels. However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

Common words that fit the pattern ""ST A _ E"":

- ""stage"" (with G)
- ""stare"" (but R is absent, so no)
- ""stale"" (but L is absent, so no)
- ""stave"" (with V)
- ""stade"" (with D, but less common)
- ""stape"" (not common, might not be valid)
- ""state"" (but T is already in position 2, and we have no duplicate T indicated? Also, in guess 2, T was in position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning T is not in position 4. So ""state"" would have T in position 4, which is invalid.)

In guess 2, when we had ""slate"" with T in position 4, it was marked as ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, position 4 cannot be T. Also, in guess 3, we have T at position 2 and it is correct, so if there were a duplicate T, we don't have evidence for it, but it's possible. However, since in guess 3, with ""stake"", we have T at position 2 and it's correct, and K is absent, and no other T was present, so likely no duplicate.

But to be safe, we should avoid using T in position 4 because of the previous feedback.

So, possible words:

- ""stage"" (G in position 4)
- ""stave"" (V in position 4)
- ""stade"" (D in position 4) - but ""stade"" is a historical term, might not be common
- ""stane"" (but N is absent, so no)
- ""swage"" (W in position 2? No, pattern is fixed: position 2 is T, so ""swage"" is S,W,A,G,E, which doesn't fit)

Therefore, the most common words are ""stage"" and ""stave"".

We have not tested G or V yet.

Since we have only one position left, we can choose one of these.

""Stage"" is a very common word, so it's a good candidate.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""stope"" is S,T,O,P,E, but position 3 is O, not A. So no.

Or ""stoke"" similarly.

So, I think ""stage"" and ""stave"" are the main options.

We can also consider ""styme"" but that's not a standard word.

Given that, I propose ""stage"" as the next guess.

If we guess ""stage"", it will confirm if G is in position 4.

If it's not, then we can try ""stave"" next.

But we have two guesses left, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we might think of other letters, but G and V are the most likely.

Another word: ""stale"" is out because L is absent.

""stare"" is out because R is absent.

""stake"" we already tried and K is absent.

So, ""stage"" it is.

Therefore, the next guess is ""stage"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - A is in position 3, E is in position 5. C, R, N are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""slate"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  
  - S is in position 1, A in position 3, E in position 5. L is absent. T is in the word but not in position 4.

- **Guess 3: ""stake"" → Feedback: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)**  
  - S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 5. K is absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has fixed positions:  
  - Position 1: S  
  - Position 2: T  
  - Position 3: A  
  - Position 5: E  
  - Only position 4 is unknown (pattern: **S T A _ E**).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, K (cannot appear in position 4).
- T is confirmed in position 2, so position 4 cannot be T (as per Guess 2 feedback: T is not in position 4).
- Possible letters for position 4: Any letter not absent and not already placed (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.), but it must form a valid English word.
- Common words fitting this pattern: ""stage"" (G in position 4), ""stave"" (V in position 4), or ""stade"" (D in position 4, less common).

### Next Guess Strategy:
- ""stage"" is chosen because:
  - It tests G, a common untested letter for position 4.
  - It is a high-frequency word, increasing the chance of being correct.
  - If incorrect, feedback on G will confirm or eliminate it, leaving ""stave"" or other options for the next guess.",Guess 4: stage -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
