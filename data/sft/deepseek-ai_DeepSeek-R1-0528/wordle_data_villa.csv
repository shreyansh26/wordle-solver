We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the secret word)
  E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback we know:
  - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd position in ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
  - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
  - Contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of a word that includes 'A' (in a position other than 3) and uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using the letters that we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E).

We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't say that the secret word has distinct letters, but in practice, we can assume that until we have evidence of duplicates. However, the feedback might not reveal duplicates clearly. But for now, let's try to use a word with distinct letters to maximize information.

Possible words: 
  We need a word with 'A' not in the 3rd position.

Let's consider common words:

Option 1: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have only one known letter so far.

But note: we have only one known letter: A. And we know it's not in position 3.

We can try words that have 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Common starting words that fit:

- ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and we haven't tried B, O, U, T. But note: we haven't tried O, U, T? Actually, we tried only C,R,A,N,E. So B, O, U, T are new.

But wait: we know R is not in the word, so ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so that's fine.

But let's check: 
  A: in position 1 -> we hope it's not in the correct position? Actually, it might be. We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLANT"" but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N got x) so we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So ""PLANT"" is invalid because of N.

Another option: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
  A is in position 3? But we need to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, no: the feedback said that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, A is in a different position. Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1,2,4,5) to see if it's correct there.

But note: we are allowed to put A in position 3 again? Yes, but we know it's not the correct position because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it in position 3 again. We should try a new position.

So in ""STAMP"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's break it down:
  S T A M P -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.

But we know that A is not in position 3 in the secret word, so putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, we want a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try to find a word with A in position 1: 
  Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess: E got x) so we cannot use E.

Another: ""AUDIO"" -> A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. We haven't tried these. But note: we know the word doesn't have E, so that's okay. However, we are not sure about the other letters.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess) and also T? We haven't tried T? Actually, we haven't tried T. But wait: ""SLATE"" has E at the end, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So we must avoid E.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A not in position 3.

Possible words:
  - ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and B, O, U, T are new. -> valid.
  - ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, and U, D, I, O -> valid.
  - ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.
  - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> has two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is in position 2 and 5? But we can try. However, we haven't tried P, S, T. But note: we know the word has at least one A (and we are putting two A's, which might be okay if the word has two A's). But we don't know. Also, we are avoiding position 3 for A? In ""PASTA"", the first A is in position 2 and the second in position 5. So we are not using position 3. So that's okay.

But we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. Let's check if ""PASTA"" is valid? Yes.

But we want to maximize new letters. ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"" have 5 distinct letters, while ""PASTA"" has 4 distinct (A repeated) so it gives less information. So we prefer distinct letters.

Therefore, let's choose between ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"".

We can also consider ""TODAY"": T, O, D, A, Y -> A in position 4. This is good because we are trying A in a new position (position 4). And we haven't tried T, O, D, Y.

But note: we don't know if O, D, Y are in the word. So it's a good candidate.

Similarly, ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. Also good.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

Another: ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2.

We have many options.

We should choose a word that uses common letters and has A in a position we haven't tried (so not position 3). We tried A in position 3 already, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we can try A in a position that is common for words. For example, position 1 or 2.

But note: we don't have any other information. So we can choose a word that has A and four new letters.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and A is in position 1.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" is also good because it has two vowels (A, I, O) and two consonants (U, D) and might help us identify vowels.

But we know the word has at least one A, so we are already covering that.

Another idea: we know the word has an A, so we can try to put A in a different position to see if we can get a ✓. So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know it's not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

So let's go with ""ABOUT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ABOUT"" is a valid English word.

So our second guess: ""ABOUT""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we know the secret word does not contain R (from first guess) and ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R, so that's fine.

So let's choose ""ABOUT"".

Alternatively, we could choose ""TODAY"" to put A in position 4, which is a less common position? But we don't know.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""ABOUT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include ""A"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.
- It should exclude C, R, N, E (known absent letters).
- To maximize new information, use common unused letters (e.g., B, O, U, T, S, L) and prioritize distinct letters.

A strong second guess is ""about"":
- Places ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, O, U, T.
- Avoids known absent letters and the ineffective 3rd position for ""A"".

- ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and we haven't tried B, O, U, T. But note: we haven't tried O, U, T? Actually, we tried only C,R,A,N,E. So B, O, U, T are new.

But wait: we know R is not in the word, so ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so that's fine.

But let's check: 
  A: in position 1 -> we hope it's not in the correct position? Actually, it might be. We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLANT"" but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N got x) so we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So ""PLANT"" is invalid because of N.

Another option: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
  A is in position 3? But we need to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, no: the feedback said that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, A is in a different position. Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1,2,4,5) to see if it's correct there.

But note: we are allowed to put A in position 3 again? Yes, but we know it's not the correct position because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it in position 3 again. We should try a new position.

So in ""STAMP"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's break it down:
  S T A M P -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.

But we know that A is not in position 3 in the secret word, so putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, we want a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try to find a word with A in position 1: 
  Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess: E got x) so we cannot use E.

Another: ""AUDIO"" -> A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. We haven't tried these. But note: we know the word doesn't have E, so that's okay. However, we are not sure about the other letters.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess) and also T? We haven't tried T? Actually, we haven't tried T. But wait: ""SLATE"" has E at the end, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So we must avoid E.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A not in position 3.

Possible words:
  - ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and B, O, U, T are new. -> valid.
  - ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, and U, D, I, O -> valid.
  - ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.
  - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> has two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is in position 2 and 5? But we can try. However, we haven't tried P, S, T. But note: we know the word has at least one A (and we are putting two A's, which might be okay if the word has two A's). But we don't know. Also, we are avoiding position 3 for A? In ""PASTA"", the first A is in position 2 and the second in position 5. So we are not using position 3. So that's okay.

But we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. Let's check if ""PASTA"" is valid? Yes.

But we want to maximize new letters. ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"" have 5 distinct letters, while ""PASTA"" has 4 distinct (A repeated) so it gives less information. So we prefer distinct letters.

Therefore, let's choose between ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"".

We can also consider ""TODAY"": T, O, D, A, Y -> A in position 4. This is good because we are trying A in a new position (position 4). And we haven't tried T, O, D, Y.

But note: we don't know if O, D, Y are in the word. So it's a good candidate.

Similarly, ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. Also good.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

Another: ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2.

We have many options.

We should choose a word that uses common letters and has A in a position we haven't tried (so not position 3). We tried A in position 3 already, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we can try A in a position that is common for words. For example, position 1 or 2.

But note: we don't have any other information. So we can choose a word that has A and four new letters.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and A is in position 1.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" is also good because it has two vowels (A, I, O) and two consonants (U, D) and might help us identify vowels.

But we know the word has at least one A, so we are already covering that.

Another idea: we know the word has an A, so we can try to put A in a different position to see if we can get a ✓. So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know it's not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

So let's go with ""ABOUT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ABOUT"" is a valid English word.

So our second guess: ""ABOUT""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we know the secret word does not contain R (from first guess) and ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R, so that's fine.

So let's choose ""ABOUT"".

Alternatively, we could choose ""TODAY"" to put A in position 4, which is a less common position? But we don't know.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""ABOUT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include ""A"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.
- It should exclude C, R, N, E (known absent letters).
- To maximize new information, use common unused letters (e.g., B, O, U, T, S, L) and prioritize distinct letters.

A strong second guess is ""about"":
- Places ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, O, U, T.
- Avoids known absent letters and the ineffective 3rd position for ""A"".

We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not in position 1 (since we put it in position 1 here) and not in position 3 (from the first guess)
  B: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  U: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T

Present letter (but not in the correct position yet): A

We also know that A is not in position 1 (from ""about"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the letter A in one of the positions: 2, 4, or 5, and does not contain any of the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new letters to gather more information.

Available letters: We have used 9 letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T). So we have 17 letters left: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know A is in the word, so we must include A.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible, and also test A in a new position.

Possible positions for A: We haven't tried A in position 2, 4, or 5. We can choose one of these.

To maximize information, we might want to try A in a position that is common, like position 2. Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple positions at once, but we only have one known letter.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use only the available letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
  We need to fill the blanks with letters from D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.

  Examples: 
    ""SAVvy"" -> but ""v"" repeated? and ""SAVVY"" has two V's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we should avoid repeating letters to get more information. So let's try distinct letters.

  Possible words: 
    ""SALAD"" -> but we have A in position 2 and 5? But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid repeating A to test other letters. Also, ""SALAD"" has L and D which are new, but also A again. And we know A is present, so repeating A might not give new information. Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: S is not in the absent list? We haven't tried S. But wait, in ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D. We know A is present, but we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Actually, we are putting A in two positions. If we get a '-' for the second A, it doesn't tell us if there is a second A or not? The feedback for a duplicate letter can be tricky. Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, it's better to avoid repeating A for now to keep it simple.

  Alternatively, we can use a word with A only once and in position 2.

  Example: ""SALTY"" -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) so we cannot use T.

  Another: ""SALSA"" -> has two S and two A, which is not ideal.

  How about ""HALLS"" -> but we have two L's and we are putting A in position 2. Also, we haven't tried H, L, S. But note: we are avoiding T, which is absent. However, ""HALLS"" has two L's. We want to avoid duplicates if possible.

  Let me think of words without duplicates: 
    ""PAGAN"" -> but N is absent (from guess1) so invalid.
    ""MAGMA"" -> duplicate M and A? and G is new, but duplicate.

  It's hard to find a word with A in position 2 without duplicates and without the absent letters.

  Let me try position 4: _ _ _ A _
  Example: ""PLAZA"" -> but P, L, A, Z, A -> duplicate A and Z is not common. Also, we have to avoid absent letters: P and L are new? But ""PLAZA"" has two A's.

  Another: ""FOCAL"" -> but O is absent (from guess2) and C is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.

  Another: ""MEDIA"" -> but E is absent (from guess1) and D, I, A -> but E is absent.

  Another: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2? Wait, position 2: V-A-L-I-D -> so A is in position 2. And we haven't tried V, L, I, D. And no duplicates. This seems good.

  But wait, we are considering position 4? Let me clarify: for ""VALID"": 
    Position 1: V
    Position 2: A -> we are trying A in position 2.
    Position 3: L
    Position 4: I
    Position 5: D

  So A is in position 2.

  Similarly, we can have A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A
  Example: ""PIZZA"" -> duplicate Z, and we don't know about Z. But duplicate might be okay? But we want to avoid duplicates for information.

  Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are absent (from guess2) -> invalid.

  Another: ""KARMA"" -> K, A, R, M, A -> but R is absent (from guess1) and duplicate A.

  Another: ""DELTA"" -> E is absent.

  Another: ""SALSA"" -> duplicate S and A.

  It seems difficult to find a word with A in position 5 without duplicates and without absent letters.

  So let's focus on position 2 and 4.

  We found ""VALID"" for position 2. Let me check if it's valid: 
    V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct, and we haven't tried V, L, I, D. And we avoid absent letters.

  But note: we know A is in the word, so we are including it. And we are putting it in position 2, which we haven't tried.

  However, we also have the option of position 4.

  For position 4: 
    Example: ""SPLIT"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
    ""SPLIT"" doesn't have A? We need A in position 4.

  Let me think: _ _ _ A _
    ""FLAKY"" -> F, L, A, K, Y -> A in position 4? Actually, position 1:F, 2:L, 3:A? No, that's position 3. We need A in position 4.

  How about: ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1? But we cannot put A in position 1 (we know it's not there). So we need a word that has A in position 4 and not in position 1,2,3? Actually, we can have A only in position 4.

  Example: ""DELTA"" -> but E is absent.

  ""GAMMA"" -> duplicate M and A, and A is in position 2 and 5? Not position 4.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is absent and A in position 2 and 5.

  ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but T is absent.

  ""DISCO"" -> no A.

  ""VIGIL"" -> no A.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but R and C are absent.

  ""PODIA"" -> O is absent.

  ""QUAIL"" -> U is absent? And Q is not common.

  It's challenging. 

  Another: ""FJORD"" -> no A.

  How about ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but T is absent. And A is in position 2.

  So for position 4, it's hard to find a word without using absent letters.

  Therefore, let's go with A in position 2: ""VALID"" seems a good candidate.

  But note: we haven't tried position 5 for A. We might try that in the future if needed.

  Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 5: 
    Example: ""PIZZA"" -> not ideal because of duplicate Z and Z is uncommon.
    ""JUMBA"" -> invalid because of U and B.

    ""KAPPA"" -> duplicate P and A, and K and P are new? But duplicate.

    ""GUPPY"" -> no A.

    ""ZEBRA"" -> E and R and B are absent.

  So let's stick with ""VALID"".

  But wait, we have another option: A in position 4. Let me try one more time.

  ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

  ""SYNCH"" -> no A.

  ""PYGMY"" -> no A.

  ""SHYLY"" -> no A.

  ""SISSY"" -> no A.

  ""DADDY"" -> no A.

  ""MADAM"" -> A in position 2 and 4? But we can use it. However, we are putting A in position 2 and 4. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, we are testing position 2 and 4 at the same time. But we also have M and D.

  ""MADAM"": 
    M, A, D, A, M -> duplicate M and duplicate A.

  We want to avoid duplicates to get more information.

  So I think ""VALID"" is a better choice.

  But note: ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common. We might choose a word with more common letters.

  What about ""SALAD""? It has A in position 2 and 5, and we get to test S, L, D. But duplicate A. However, we know A is present, so if we get a '-' for the first A (position 2) and a 'x' for the second A (position 5), that would tell us there is only one A? But the feedback for duplicate letters in Wordle: if the letter appears only once in the secret word, then only one occurrence will be marked (either ✓ or -) and the other will be x. But if the secret word has two A's, then both might be marked? Actually, the rules: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets ✓, else if there is an extra occurrence and the secret has fewer, it might get x. But it's a bit complex.

  To avoid confusion, let's try to use distinct letters.

  Another word with A in position 2: ""GAILY"" -> G, A, I, L, Y -> all distinct. And we haven't tried G, I, L, Y. And we avoid absent letters.

  ""GAILY"" is a valid word? It means in a cheerful way. Yes.

  Similarly, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> also good.

  ""HAILY"" -> not a word.

  ""JAILY"" -> not a word.

  ""LAITY"" -> L, A, I, T, Y -> but T is absent (from guess2) -> invalid.

  So ""GAILY"" and ""DAILY"" are options.

  Also, ""VALID"" is an option.

  We can also consider ""WAIFS"" -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2. Distinct letters.

  But ""WAIFS"" is a word (meaning: homeless children).

  However, we might prefer more common words.

  Let me list the options:
    Option 1: VALID -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2.
    Option 2: GAILY -> G, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.
    Option 3: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.
    Option 4: WAIFS -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2.

  We can choose any of these. They all test A in position 2 and use distinct new letters.

  Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters. Among the available letters, S, L, D, G, F are common.

  ""DAILY"" uses D, A, I, L, Y -> D and L are common.

  ""GAILY"" uses G, A, I, L, Y -> G is less common than D? But both are acceptable.

  ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common.

  ""WAIFS"" uses W and F, which are less common.

  So ""DAILY"" or ""GAILY"" might be better.

  But note: we have to consider that we are also testing the position of A. If we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know A is in position 4 or 5.

  Let's choose ""DAILY"" because it has more common letters.

  But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters: D is not in the absent list? We haven't tried D. So it's okay.

  However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""DAILY"" is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""SALAD"" but it has duplicate A. Let's avoid that.

  Another common word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D -> A in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is a good choice.

  But note: we have not tried position 4 or 5 for A. By putting A in position 2, we are testing one of the possibilities. If it's not there, then we know A is in 4 or 5.

  We can also consider a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test that directly. But we haven't found a good one without duplicates.

  Another word with A in position 4: ""FLAVA"" -> not a standard word.

  ""PULKA"" -> not common.

  ""TICCA"" -> not common.

  So let's go with ""DAILY"".

  But wait, we have ""SALSA"" but duplicate.

  I think ""DAILY"" is acceptable.

  However, let me check if there is a word with A in position 5 that is valid and without duplicates and without absent letters.

  Example: ""PAPAL"" -> duplicate P and A in position 2 and 5? And we know A is not in position 2? Actually, we don't know if A is in position 2, we only know it's not in 1 or 3. So it could be in 2. But ""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are testing position 2 and 5 at the same time. But duplicate P.

  ""FATWA"" -> F, A, T, W, A -> duplicate A and T is absent.

  ""KARMA"" -> duplicate A and R absent.

  ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> duplicate A.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> absent letters.

  So no good word for position 5.

  Therefore, we choose a word with A in position 2: ""DAILY"".

  So our third guess: ""DAILY""

  We'll get feedback on D, A, I, L, Y.

  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

  And we test D, I, L, Y.

  Alternatively, we could choose ""GAILY"" or ""VALID"". I think ""DAILY"" is fine.

  Let me see the feedback we might get.

  But we don't know the secret word, so we just have to guess.

  So I'll go with ""DAILY"".

  However, note that we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

  Another word: ""SALAD"" might be acceptable if we are okay with duplicate A. But let's avoid.

  Or ""PANSY"" -> but N is absent.

  So ""DAILY"" it is.

  But wait, we have ""HAILS"" -> H, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. And distinct letters. H, A, I, L, S. We haven't tried H, I, L, S. And S is very common.

  ""HAILS"" might be better than ""DAILY"" because S is more common than Y? But both are valid.

  We can choose ""HAILS"".

  Similarly, ""FAILS"" -> F, A, I, L, S -> but we haven't tried F.

  ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S.

  All are good.

  Since we have many options, let's pick one that covers common consonants.

  I think ""HAILS"" is a good choice because H, S, L are common.

  But we don't know which are in the word.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that position? But we couldn't find one.

  Let me try again for position 4: 
    ""STOIC"" -> no A and O is absent.
    ""SPIKY"" -> no A.
    ""DYING"" -> no A.
    ""FLING"" -> no A.
    ""SLING"" -> no A.
    ""SWING"" -> no A.
    ""AXING"" -> A in position 1? But we know A is not in position 1.

  How about ""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A -> O is absent -> invalid.

  ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1 -> invalid.

  ""INLAY"" -> I, N, L, A, Y -> but N is absent -> invalid.

  ""ITCHY"" -> no A.

  So I think we are forced to put A in position 2 or 5. And position 5 is hard.

  So let's go with position 2.

  I'll choose ""HAILS"" because it has common letters.

  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If it's not there, we know it's in 4 or 5.

  So guess: ""HAILS""

  But let's confirm the letters: H, A, I, L, S -> all distinct, and we haven't tried them, and not in the absent list.

  So <guess>hails</guess>

  However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and we have to return in the format.

  But I see that in the first two guesses, we used ""crane"" and ""about"", so we are consistent.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""DAILY"", but I think ""HAILS"" is also fine.

  Let me see: which one is more common? Both are valid.

  I'll go with ""HAILS"" because S is a common ending letter.

  So final decision: ""HAILS""

  But note: we are also testing I and L, which are vowels? I is a vowel, L is consonant.

  We want to cover more consonants? ""HAILS"" has H, L, S which are consonants and I is vowel.

  ""VALID"" has V, L, D (consonants) and I (vowel). But V is less common.

  So ""HAILS"" is better.

  Therefore, we guess ""HAILS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (about)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), and B, O, U, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (9 letters eliminated).
- **Available letters**: A, and all unused letters (D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its location. Position 2 is prioritized as it's common.
- **Use 4 new, distinct letters** from the available pool to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters** and positions where A is invalid (1 or 3).
- **Strong candidate words**: 
  - `HAILS` (A in position 2, tests H, A, I, L, S).
  - `DAILY` (A in position 2, tests D, A, I, L, Y).
  - `VALID` (A in position 2, tests V, A, L, I, D).
- **Chosen word**: `HAILS` (prioritizes common letters like S, L, H and tests A in position 2).

<guess>hails</guess>",hails,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not in position 1 (since we put it in position 1 here) and not in position 3 (from the first guess)
  B: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  U: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T

Present letter (but not in the correct position yet): A

We also know that A is not in position 1 (from ""about"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the letter A in one of the positions: 2, 4, or 5, and does not contain any of the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new letters to gather more information.

Available letters: We have used 9 letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T). So we have 17 letters left: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know A is in the word, so we must include A.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible, and also test A in a new position.

Possible positions for A: We haven't tried A in position 2, 4, or 5. We can choose one of these.

To maximize information, we might want to try A in a position that is common, like position 2. Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple positions at once, but we only have one known letter.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use only the available letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
  We need to fill the blanks with letters from D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.

  Examples: 
    ""SAVvy"" -> but ""v"" repeated? and ""SAVVY"" has two V's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we should avoid repeating letters to get more information. So let's try distinct letters.

  Possible words: 
    ""SALAD"" -> but we have A in position 2 and 5? But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid repeating A to test other letters. Also, ""SALAD"" has L and D which are new, but also A again. And we know A is present, so repeating A might not give new information. Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: S is not in the absent list? We haven't tried S. But wait, in ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D. We know A is present, but we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Actually, we are putting A in two positions. If we get a '-' for the second A, it doesn't tell us if there is a second A or not? The feedback for a duplicate letter can be tricky. Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, it's better to avoid repeating A for now to keep it simple.

  Alternatively, we can use a word with A only once and in position 2.

  Example: ""SALTY"" -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) so we cannot use T.

  Another: ""SALSA"" -> has two S and two A, which is not ideal.

  How about ""HALLS"" -> but we have two L's and we are putting A in position 2. Also, we haven't tried H, L, S. But note: we are avoiding T, which is absent. However, ""HALLS"" has two L's. We want to avoid duplicates if possible.

  Let me think of words without duplicates: 
    ""PAGAN"" -> but N is absent (from guess1) so invalid.
    ""MAGMA"" -> duplicate M and A? and G is new, but duplicate.

  It's hard to find a word with A in position 2 without duplicates and without the absent letters.

  Let me try position 4: _ _ _ A _
  Example: ""PLAZA"" -> but P, L, A, Z, A -> duplicate A and Z is not common. Also, we have to avoid absent letters: P and L are new? But ""PLAZA"" has two A's.

  Another: ""FOCAL"" -> but O is absent (from guess2) and C is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.

  Another: ""MEDIA"" -> but E is absent (from guess1) and D, I, A -> but E is absent.

  Another: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2? Wait, position 2: V-A-L-I-D -> so A is in position 2. And we haven't tried V, L, I, D. And no duplicates. This seems good.

  But wait, we are considering position 4? Let me clarify: for ""VALID"": 
    Position 1: V
    Position 2: A -> we are trying A in position 2.
    Position 3: L
    Position 4: I
    Position 5: D

  So A is in position 2.

  Similarly, we can have A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A
  Example: ""PIZZA"" -> duplicate Z, and we don't know about Z. But duplicate might be okay? But we want to avoid duplicates for information.

  Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are absent (from guess2) -> invalid.

  Another: ""KARMA"" -> K, A, R, M, A -> but R is absent (from guess1) and duplicate A.

  Another: ""DELTA"" -> E is absent.

  Another: ""SALSA"" -> duplicate S and A.

  It seems difficult to find a word with A in position 5 without duplicates and without absent letters.

  So let's focus on position 2 and 4.

  We found ""VALID"" for position 2. Let me check if it's valid: 
    V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct, and we haven't tried V, L, I, D. And we avoid absent letters.

  But note: we know A is in the word, so we are including it. And we are putting it in position 2, which we haven't tried.

  However, we also have the option of position 4.

  For position 4: 
    Example: ""SPLIT"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
    ""SPLIT"" doesn't have A? We need A in position 4.

  Let me think: _ _ _ A _
    ""FLAKY"" -> F, L, A, K, Y -> A in position 4? Actually, position 1:F, 2:L, 3:A? No, that's position 3. We need A in position 4.

  How about: ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1? But we cannot put A in position 1 (we know it's not there). So we need a word that has A in position 4 and not in position 1,2,3? Actually, we can have A only in position 4.

  Example: ""DELTA"" -> but E is absent.

  ""GAMMA"" -> duplicate M and A, and A is in position 2 and 5? Not position 4.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is absent and A in position 2 and 5.

  ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but T is absent.

  ""DISCO"" -> no A.

  ""VIGIL"" -> no A.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but R and C are absent.

  ""PODIA"" -> O is absent.

  ""QUAIL"" -> U is absent? And Q is not common.

  It's challenging. 

  Another: ""FJORD"" -> no A.

  How about ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but T is absent. And A is in position 2.

  So for position 4, it's hard to find a word without using absent letters.

  Therefore, let's go with A in position 2: ""VALID"" seems a good candidate.

  But note: we haven't tried position 5 for A. We might try that in the future if needed.

  Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 5: 
    Example: ""PIZZA"" -> not ideal because of duplicate Z and Z is uncommon.
    ""JUMBA"" -> invalid because of U and B.

    ""KAPPA"" -> duplicate P and A, and K and P are new? But duplicate.

    ""GUPPY"" -> no A.

    ""ZEBRA"" -> E and R and B are absent.

  So let's stick with ""VALID"".

  But wait, we have another option: A in position 4. Let me try one more time.

  ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

  ""SYNCH"" -> no A.

  ""PYGMY"" -> no A.

  ""SHYLY"" -> no A.

  ""SISSY"" -> no A.

  ""DADDY"" -> no A.

  ""MADAM"" -> A in position 2 and 4? But we can use it. However, we are putting A in position 2 and 4. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, we are testing position 2 and 4 at the same time. But we also have M and D.

  ""MADAM"": 
    M, A, D, A, M -> duplicate M and duplicate A.

  We want to avoid duplicates to get more information.

  So I think ""VALID"" is a better choice.

  But note: ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common. We might choose a word with more common letters.

  What about ""SALAD""? It has A in position 2 and 5, and we get to test S, L, D. But duplicate A. However, we know A is present, so if we get a '-' for the first A (position 2) and a 'x' for the second A (position 5), that would tell us there is only one A? But the feedback for duplicate letters in Wordle: if the letter appears only once in the secret word, then only one occurrence will be marked (either ✓ or -) and the other will be x. But if the secret word has two A's, then both might be marked? Actually, the rules: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets ✓, else if there is an extra occurrence and the secret has fewer, it might get x. But it's a bit complex.

  To avoid confusion, let's try to use distinct letters.

  Another word with A in position 2: ""GAILY"" -> G, A, I, L, Y -> all distinct. And we haven't tried G, I, L, Y. And we avoid absent letters.

  ""GAILY"" is a valid word? It means in a cheerful way. Yes.

  Similarly, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> also good.

  ""HAILY"" -> not a word.

  ""JAILY"" -> not a word.

  ""LAITY"" -> L, A, I, T, Y -> but T is absent (from guess2) -> invalid.

  So ""GAILY"" and ""DAILY"" are options.

  Also, ""VALID"" is an option.

  We can also consider ""WAIFS"" -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2. Distinct letters.

  But ""WAIFS"" is a word (meaning: homeless children).

  However, we might prefer more common words.

  Let me list the options:
    Option 1: VALID -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2.
    Option 2: GAILY -> G, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.
    Option 3: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.
    Option 4: WAIFS -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2.

  We can choose any of these. They all test A in position 2 and use distinct new letters.

  Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters. Among the available letters, S, L, D, G, F are common.

  ""DAILY"" uses D, A, I, L, Y -> D and L are common.

  ""GAILY"" uses G, A, I, L, Y -> G is less common than D? But both are acceptable.

  ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common.

  ""WAIFS"" uses W and F, which are less common.

  So ""DAILY"" or ""GAILY"" might be better.

  But note: we have to consider that we are also testing the position of A. If we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know A is in position 4 or 5.

  Let's choose ""DAILY"" because it has more common letters.

  But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters: D is not in the absent list? We haven't tried D. So it's okay.

  However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""DAILY"" is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""SALAD"" but it has duplicate A. Let's avoid that.

  Another common word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D -> A in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is a good choice.

  But note: we have not tried position 4 or 5 for A. By putting A in position 2, we are testing one of the possibilities. If it's not there, then we know A is in 4 or 5.

  We can also consider a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test that directly. But we haven't found a good one without duplicates.

  Another word with A in position 4: ""FLAVA"" -> not a standard word.

  ""PULKA"" -> not common.

  ""TICCA"" -> not common.

  So let's go with ""DAILY"".

  But wait, we have ""SALSA"" but duplicate.

  I think ""DAILY"" is acceptable.

  However, let me check if there is a word with A in position 5 that is valid and without duplicates and without absent letters.

  Example: ""PAPAL"" -> duplicate P and A in position 2 and 5? And we know A is not in position 2? Actually, we don't know if A is in position 2, we only know it's not in 1 or 3. So it could be in 2. But ""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are testing position 2 and 5 at the same time. But duplicate P.

  ""FATWA"" -> F, A, T, W, A -> duplicate A and T is absent.

  ""KARMA"" -> duplicate A and R absent.

  ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> duplicate A.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> absent letters.

  So no good word for position 5.

  Therefore, we choose a word with A in position 2: ""DAILY"".

  So our third guess: ""DAILY""

  We'll get feedback on D, A, I, L, Y.

  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

  And we test D, I, L, Y.

  Alternatively, we could choose ""GAILY"" or ""VALID"". I think ""DAILY"" is fine.

  Let me see the feedback we might get.

  But we don't know the secret word, so we just have to guess.

  So I'll go with ""DAILY"".

  However, note that we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

  Another word: ""SALAD"" might be acceptable if we are okay with duplicate A. But let's avoid.

  Or ""PANSY"" -> but N is absent.

  So ""DAILY"" it is.

  But wait, we have ""HAILS"" -> H, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. And distinct letters. H, A, I, L, S. We haven't tried H, I, L, S. And S is very common.

  ""HAILS"" might be better than ""DAILY"" because S is more common than Y? But both are valid.

  We can choose ""HAILS"".

  Similarly, ""FAILS"" -> F, A, I, L, S -> but we haven't tried F.

  ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S.

  All are good.

  Since we have many options, let's pick one that covers common consonants.

  I think ""HAILS"" is a good choice because H, S, L are common.

  But we don't know which are in the word.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that position? But we couldn't find one.

  Let me try again for position 4: 
    ""STOIC"" -> no A and O is absent.
    ""SPIKY"" -> no A.
    ""DYING"" -> no A.
    ""FLING"" -> no A.
    ""SLING"" -> no A.
    ""SWING"" -> no A.
    ""AXING"" -> A in position 1? But we know A is not in position 1.

  How about ""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A -> O is absent -> invalid.

  ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1 -> invalid.

  ""INLAY"" -> I, N, L, A, Y -> but N is absent -> invalid.

  ""ITCHY"" -> no A.

  So I think we are forced to put A in position 2 or 5. And position 5 is hard.

  So let's go with position 2.

  I'll choose ""HAILS"" because it has common letters.

  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If it's not there, we know it's in 4 or 5.

  So guess: ""HAILS""

  But let's confirm the letters: H, A, I, L, S -> all distinct, and we haven't tried them, and not in the absent list.

  So <guess>hails</guess>

  However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and we have to return in the format.

  But I see that in the first two guesses, we used ""crane"" and ""about"", so we are consistent.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""DAILY"", but I think ""HAILS"" is also fine.

  Let me see: which one is more common? Both are valid.

  I'll go with ""HAILS"" because S is a common ending letter.

  So final decision: ""HAILS""

  But note: we are also testing I and L, which are vowels? I is a vowel, L is consonant.

  We want to cover more consonants? ""HAILS"" has H, L, S which are consonants and I is vowel.

  ""VALID"" has V, L, D (consonants) and I (vowel). But V is less common.

  So ""HAILS"" is better.

  Therefore, we guess ""HAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (about)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), and B, O, U, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (9 letters eliminated).
- **Available letters**: A, and all unused letters (D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its location. Position 2 is prioritized as it's common.
- **Use 4 new, distinct letters** from the available pool to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters** and positions where A is invalid (1 or 3).
- **Strong candidate words**:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,villa,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the secret word)
  E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback we know:
  - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd position in ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
  - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
  - Contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of a word that includes 'A' (in a position other than 3) and uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using the letters that we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E).

We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't say that the secret word has distinct letters, but in practice, we can assume that until we have evidence of duplicates. However, the feedback might not reveal duplicates clearly. But for now, let's try to use a word with distinct letters to maximize information.

Possible words: 
  We need a word with 'A' not in the 3rd position.

Let's consider common words:

Option 1: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have only one known letter so far.

But note: we have only one known letter: A. And we know it's not in position 3.

We can try words that have 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Common starting words that fit:

- ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and we haven't tried B, O, U, T. But note: we haven't tried O, U, T? Actually, we tried only C,R,A,N,E. So B, O, U, T are new.

But wait: we know R is not in the word, so ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so that's fine.

But let's check: 
  A: in position 1 -> we hope it's not in the correct position? Actually, it might be. We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLANT"" but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N got x) so we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So ""PLANT"" is invalid because of N.

Another option: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
  A is in position 3? But we need to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, no: the feedback said that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, A is in a different position. Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1,2,4,5) to see if it's correct there.

But note: we are allowed to put A in position 3 again? Yes, but we know it's not the correct position because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it in position 3 again. We should try a new position.

So in ""STAMP"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's break it down:
  S T A M P -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.

But we know that A is not in position 3 in the secret word, so putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, we want a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try to find a word with A in position 1: 
  Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess: E got x) so we cannot use E.

Another: ""AUDIO"" -> A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. We haven't tried these. But note: we know the word doesn't have E, so that's okay. However, we are not sure about the other letters.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess) and also T? We haven't tried T? Actually, we haven't tried T. But wait: ""SLATE"" has E at the end, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So we must avoid E.

Let me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A not in position 3.

Possible words:
  - ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and B, O, U, T are new. -> valid.
  - ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, and U, D, I, O -> valid.
  - ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.
  - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> has two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is in position 2 and 5? But we can try. However, we haven't tried P, S, T. But note: we know the word has at least one A (and we are putting two A's, which might be okay if the word has two A's). But we don't know. Also, we are avoiding position 3 for A? In ""PASTA"", the first A is in position 2 and the second in position 5. So we are not using position 3. So that's okay.

But we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. Let's check if ""PASTA"" is valid? Yes.

But we want to maximize new letters. ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"" have 5 distinct letters, while ""PASTA"" has 4 distinct (A repeated) so it gives less information. So we prefer distinct letters.

Therefore, let's choose between ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"".

We can also consider ""TODAY"": T, O, D, A, Y -> A in position 4. This is good because we are trying A in a new position (position 4). And we haven't tried T, O, D, Y.

But note: we don't know if O, D, Y are in the word. So it's a good candidate.

Similarly, ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. Also good.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

Another: ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2.

We have many options.

We should choose a word that uses common letters and has A in a position we haven't tried (so not position 3). We tried A in position 3 already, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we can try A in a position that is common for words. For example, position 1 or 2.

But note: we don't have any other information. So we can choose a word that has A and four new letters.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and A is in position 1.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" is also good because it has two vowels (A, I, O) and two consonants (U, D) and might help us identify vowels.

But we know the word has at least one A, so we are already covering that.

Another idea: we know the word has an A, so we can try to put A in a different position to see if we can get a ✓. So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know it's not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

So let's go with ""ABOUT"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ABOUT"" is a valid English word.

So our second guess: ""ABOUT""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we know the secret word does not contain R (from first guess) and ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R, so that's fine.

So let's choose ""ABOUT"".

Alternatively, we could choose ""TODAY"" to put A in position 4, which is a less common position? But we don't know.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""ABOUT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include ""A"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.
- It should exclude C, R, N, E (known absent letters).
- To maximize new information, use common unused letters (e.g., B, O, U, T, S, L) and prioritize distinct letters.

A strong second guess is ""about"":
- Places ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, O, U, T.
- Avoids known absent letters and the ineffective 3rd position for ""A"".

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not in position 1 (since we put it in position 1 here) and not in position 3 (from the first guess)
  B: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  U: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T

Present letter (but not in the correct position yet): A

We also know that A is not in position 1 (from ""about"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the letter A in one of the positions: 2, 4, or 5, and does not contain any of the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new letters to gather more information.

Available letters: We have used 9 letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T). So we have 17 letters left: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know A is in the word, so we must include A.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible, and also test A in a new position.

Possible positions for A: We haven't tried A in position 2, 4, or 5. We can choose one of these.

To maximize information, we might want to try A in a position that is common, like position 2. Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple positions at once, but we only have one known letter.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use only the available letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
  We need to fill the blanks with letters from D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.

  Examples: 
    ""SAVvy"" -> but ""v"" repeated? and ""SAVVY"" has two V's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we should avoid repeating letters to get more information. So let's try distinct letters.

  Possible words: 
    ""SALAD"" -> but we have A in position 2 and 5? But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid repeating A to test other letters. Also, ""SALAD"" has L and D which are new, but also A again. And we know A is present, so repeating A might not give new information. Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: S is not in the absent list? We haven't tried S. But wait, in ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D. We know A is present, but we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Actually, we are putting A in two positions. If we get a '-' for the second A, it doesn't tell us if there is a second A or not? The feedback for a duplicate letter can be tricky. Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, it's better to avoid repeating A for now to keep it simple.

  Alternatively, we can use a word with A only once and in position 2.

  Example: ""SALTY"" -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) so we cannot use T.

  Another: ""SALSA"" -> has two S and two A, which is not ideal.

  How about ""HALLS"" -> but we have two L's and we are putting A in position 2. Also, we haven't tried H, L, S. But note: we are avoiding T, which is absent. However, ""HALLS"" has two L's. We want to avoid duplicates if possible.

  Let me think of words without duplicates: 
    ""PAGAN"" -> but N is absent (from guess1) so invalid.
    ""MAGMA"" -> duplicate M and A? and G is new, but duplicate.

  It's hard to find a word with A in position 2 without duplicates and without the absent letters.

  Let me try position 4: _ _ _ A _
  Example: ""PLAZA"" -> but P, L, A, Z, A -> duplicate A and Z is not common. Also, we have to avoid absent letters: P and L are new? But ""PLAZA"" has two A's.

  Another: ""FOCAL"" -> but O is absent (from guess2) and C is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.

  Another: ""MEDIA"" -> but E is absent (from guess1) and D, I, A -> but E is absent.

  Another: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2? Wait, position 2: V-A-L-I-D -> so A is in position 2. And we haven't tried V, L, I, D. And no duplicates. This seems good.

  But wait, we are considering position 4? Let me clarify: for ""VALID"": 
    Position 1: V
    Position 2: A -> we are trying A in position 2.
    Position 3: L
    Position 4: I
    Position 5: D

  So A is in position 2.

  Similarly, we can have A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A
  Example: ""PIZZA"" -> duplicate Z, and we don't know about Z. But duplicate might be okay? But we want to avoid duplicates for information.

  Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are absent (from guess2) -> invalid.

  Another: ""KARMA"" -> K, A, R, M, A -> but R is absent (from guess1) and duplicate A.

  Another: ""DELTA"" -> E is absent.

  Another: ""SALSA"" -> duplicate S and A.

  It seems difficult to find a word with A in position 5 without duplicates and without absent letters.

  So let's focus on position 2 and 4.

  We found ""VALID"" for position 2. Let me check if it's valid: 
    V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct, and we haven't tried V, L, I, D. And we avoid absent letters.

  But note: we know A is in the word, so we are including it. And we are putting it in position 2, which we haven't tried.

  However, we also have the option of position 4.

  For position 4: 
    Example: ""SPLIT"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
    ""SPLIT"" doesn't have A? We need A in position 4.

  Let me think: _ _ _ A _
    ""FLAKY"" -> F, L, A, K, Y -> A in position 4? Actually, position 1:F, 2:L, 3:A? No, that's position 3. We need A in position 4.

  How about: ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1? But we cannot put A in position 1 (we know it's not there). So we need a word that has A in position 4 and not in position 1,2,3? Actually, we can have A only in position 4.

  Example: ""DELTA"" -> but E is absent.

  ""GAMMA"" -> duplicate M and A, and A is in position 2 and 5? Not position 4.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is absent and A in position 2 and 5.

  ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but T is absent.

  ""DISCO"" -> no A.

  ""VIGIL"" -> no A.

  ""LYCRA"" -> but R and C are absent.

  ""PODIA"" -> O is absent.

  ""QUAIL"" -> U is absent? And Q is not common.

  It's challenging. 

  Another: ""FJORD"" -> no A.

  How about ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but T is absent. And A is in position 2.

  So for position 4, it's hard to find a word without using absent letters.

  Therefore, let's go with A in position 2: ""VALID"" seems a good candidate.

  But note: we haven't tried position 5 for A. We might try that in the future if needed.

  Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 5: 
    Example: ""PIZZA"" -> not ideal because of duplicate Z and Z is uncommon.
    ""JUMBA"" -> invalid because of U and B.

    ""KAPPA"" -> duplicate P and A, and K and P are new? But duplicate.

    ""GUPPY"" -> no A.

    ""ZEBRA"" -> E and R and B are absent.

  So let's stick with ""VALID"".

  But wait, we have another option: A in position 4. Let me try one more time.

  ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

  ""SYNCH"" -> no A.

  ""PYGMY"" -> no A.

  ""SHYLY"" -> no A.

  ""SISSY"" -> no A.

  ""DADDY"" -> no A.

  ""MADAM"" -> A in position 2 and 4? But we can use it. However, we are putting A in position 2 and 4. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, we are testing position 2 and 4 at the same time. But we also have M and D.

  ""MADAM"": 
    M, A, D, A, M -> duplicate M and duplicate A.

  We want to avoid duplicates to get more information.

  So I think ""VALID"" is a better choice.

  But note: ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common. We might choose a word with more common letters.

  What about ""SALAD""? It has A in position 2 and 5, and we get to test S, L, D. But duplicate A. However, we know A is present, so if we get a '-' for the first A (position 2) and a 'x' for the second A (position 5), that would tell us there is only one A? But the feedback for duplicate letters in Wordle: if the letter appears only once in the secret word, then only one occurrence will be marked (either ✓ or -) and the other will be x. But if the secret word has two A's, then both might be marked? Actually, the rules: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets ✓, else if there is an extra occurrence and the secret has fewer, it might get x. But it's a bit complex.

  To avoid confusion, let's try to use distinct letters.

  Another word with A in position 2: ""GAILY"" -> G, A, I, L, Y -> all distinct. And we haven't tried G, I, L, Y. And we avoid absent letters.

  ""GAILY"" is a valid word? It means in a cheerful way. Yes.

  Similarly, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> also good.

  ""HAILY"" -> not a word.

  ""JAILY"" -> not a word.

  ""LAITY"" -> L, A, I, T, Y -> but T is absent (from guess2) -> invalid.

  So ""GAILY"" and ""DAILY"" are options.

  Also, ""VALID"" is an option.

  We can also consider ""WAIFS"" -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2. Distinct letters.

  But ""WAIFS"" is a word (meaning: homeless children).

  However, we might prefer more common words.

  Let me list the options:
    Option 1: VALID -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2.
    Option 2: GAILY -> G, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.
    Option 3: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.
    Option 4: WAIFS -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2.

  We can choose any of these. They all test A in position 2 and use distinct new letters.

  Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters. Among the available letters, S, L, D, G, F are common.

  ""DAILY"" uses D, A, I, L, Y -> D and L are common.

  ""GAILY"" uses G, A, I, L, Y -> G is less common than D? But both are acceptable.

  ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common.

  ""WAIFS"" uses W and F, which are less common.

  So ""DAILY"" or ""GAILY"" might be better.

  But note: we have to consider that we are also testing the position of A. If we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know A is in position 4 or 5.

  Let's choose ""DAILY"" because it has more common letters.

  But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters: D is not in the absent list? We haven't tried D. So it's okay.

  However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""DAILY"" is valid.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""SALAD"" but it has duplicate A. Let's avoid that.

  Another common word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D -> A in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid.

  So I think ""DAILY"" is a good choice.

  But note: we have not tried position 4 or 5 for A. By putting A in position 2, we are testing one of the possibilities. If it's not there, then we know A is in 4 or 5.

  We can also consider a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test that directly. But we haven't found a good one without duplicates.

  Another word with A in position 4: ""FLAVA"" -> not a standard word.

  ""PULKA"" -> not common.

  ""TICCA"" -> not common.

  So let's go with ""DAILY"".

  But wait, we have ""SALSA"" but duplicate.

  I think ""DAILY"" is acceptable.

  However, let me check if there is a word with A in position 5 that is valid and without duplicates and without absent letters.

  Example: ""PAPAL"" -> duplicate P and A in position 2 and 5? And we know A is not in position 2? Actually, we don't know if A is in position 2, we only know it's not in 1 or 3. So it could be in 2. But ""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are testing position 2 and 5 at the same time. But duplicate P.

  ""FATWA"" -> F, A, T, W, A -> duplicate A and T is absent.

  ""KARMA"" -> duplicate A and R absent.

  ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> duplicate A.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> absent letters.

  So no good word for position 5.

  Therefore, we choose a word with A in position 2: ""DAILY"".

  So our third guess: ""DAILY""

  We'll get feedback on D, A, I, L, Y.

  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

  And we test D, I, L, Y.

  Alternatively, we could choose ""GAILY"" or ""VALID"". I think ""DAILY"" is fine.

  Let me see the feedback we might get.

  But we don't know the secret word, so we just have to guess.

  So I'll go with ""DAILY"".

  However, note that we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

  Another word: ""SALAD"" might be acceptable if we are okay with duplicate A. But let's avoid.

  Or ""PANSY"" -> but N is absent.

  So ""DAILY"" it is.

  But wait, we have ""HAILS"" -> H, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. And distinct letters. H, A, I, L, S. We haven't tried H, I, L, S. And S is very common.

  ""HAILS"" might be better than ""DAILY"" because S is more common than Y? But both are valid.

  We can choose ""HAILS"".

  Similarly, ""FAILS"" -> F, A, I, L, S -> but we haven't tried F.

  ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S.

  All are good.

  Since we have many options, let's pick one that covers common consonants.

  I think ""HAILS"" is a good choice because H, S, L are common.

  But we don't know which are in the word.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that position? But we couldn't find one.

  Let me try again for position 4: 
    ""STOIC"" -> no A and O is absent.
    ""SPIKY"" -> no A.
    ""DYING"" -> no A.
    ""FLING"" -> no A.
    ""SLING"" -> no A.
    ""SWING"" -> no A.
    ""AXING"" -> A in position 1? But we know A is not in position 1.

  How about ""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A -> O is absent -> invalid.

  ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1 -> invalid.

  ""INLAY"" -> I, N, L, A, Y -> but N is absent -> invalid.

  ""ITCHY"" -> no A.

  So I think we are forced to put A in position 2 or 5. And position 5 is hard.

  So let's go with position 2.

  I'll choose ""HAILS"" because it has common letters.

  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If it's not there, we know it's in 4 or 5.

  So guess: ""HAILS""

  But let's confirm the letters: H, A, I, L, S -> all distinct, and we haven't tried them, and not in the absent list.

  So <guess>hails</guess>

  However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and we have to return in the format.

  But I see that in the first two guesses, we used ""crane"" and ""about"", so we are consistent.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""DAILY"", but I think ""HAILS"" is also fine.

  Let me see: which one is more common? Both are valid.

  I'll go with ""HAILS"" because S is a common ending letter.

  So final decision: ""HAILS""

  But note: we are also testing I and L, which are vowels? I is a vowel, L is consonant.

  We want to cover more consonants? ""HAILS"" has H, L, S which are consonants and I is vowel.

  ""VALID"" has V, L, D (consonants) and I (vowel). But V is less common.

  So ""HAILS"" is better.

  Therefore, we guess ""HAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (about)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), and B, O, U, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (9 letters eliminated).
- **Available letters**: A, and all unused letters (D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its location. Position 2 is prioritized as it's common.
- **Use 4 new, distinct letters** from the available pool to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters** and positions where A is invalid (1 or 3).
- **Strong candidate words**: 
  - `HAILS` (A in position 2, tests H, A, I, L, S).
  - `DAILY` (A in position 2, tests D, A, I, L, Y).
  - `VALID` (A in position 2, tests V, A, L, I, D).
- **Chosen word**: `HAILS` (prioritizes common letters like S, L, H and tests A in position 2).

Actually, the rules don\'t say that the secret word has distinct letters, but in practice, we can assume that until we have evidence of duplicates. However, the feedback might not reveal duplicates clearly. But for now, let\'s try to use a word with distinct letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words: \n  We need a word with \'A\' not in the 3rd position.\n\nLet\'s consider common words:\n\nOption 1: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A\'s and two D\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have only one known letter so far.\n\nBut note: we have only one known letter: A. And we know it\'s not in position 3.\n\nWe can try words that have \'A\' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nCommon starting words that fit:\n\n- ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and we haven\'t tried B, O, U, T. But note: we haven\'t tried O, U, T? Actually, we tried only C,R,A,N,E. So B, O, U, T are new.\n\nBut wait: we know R is not in the word, so ""ABOUT"" doesn\'t have R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut let\'s check: \n  A: in position 1 -> we hope it\'s not in the correct position? Actually, it might be. We don\'t know. We just know it\'s not in position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PLANT"" but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N got x) so we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\nSo ""PLANT"" is invalid because of N.\n\nAnother option: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. \n  A is in position 3? But we need to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, no: the feedback said that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, A is in a different position. Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1,2,4,5) to see if it\'s correct there.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to put A in position 3 again? Yes, but we know it\'s not the correct position because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it in position 3 again. We should try a new position.\n\nSo in ""STAMP"", A is in position 3? Actually, let\'s break it down:\n  S T A M P -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.\n\nBut we know that A is not in position 3 in the secret word, so putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, we want a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to find a word with A in position 1: \n  Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess: E got x) so we cannot use E.\n\nAnother: ""AUDIO"" -> A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. We haven\'t tried these. But note: we know the word doesn\'t have E, so that\'s okay. However, we are not sure about the other letters.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""SLATE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from first guess) and also T? We haven\'t tried T? Actually, we haven\'t tried T. But wait: ""SLATE"" has E at the end, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nSo we must avoid E.\n\nLet me think of words without C, R, N, E and with A not in position 3.\n\nPossible words:\n  - ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and B, O, U, T are new. -> valid.\n  - ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, and U, D, I, O -> valid.\n  - ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.\n  - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is in position 2 and 5? But we can try. However, we haven\'t tried P, S, T. But note: we know the word has at least one A (and we are putting two A\'s, which might be okay if the word has two A\'s). But we don\'t know. Also, we are avoiding position 3 for A? In ""PASTA"", the first A is in position 2 and the second in position 5. So we are not using position 3. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. Let\'s check if ""PASTA"" is valid? Yes.\n\nBut we want to maximize new letters. ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"" have 5 distinct letters, while ""PASTA"" has 4 distinct (A repeated) so it gives less information. So we prefer distinct letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between ""ABOUT"" and ""AUDIO"".\n\nWe can also consider ""TODAY"": T, O, D, A, Y -> A in position 4. This is good because we are trying A in a new position (position 4). And we haven\'t tried T, O, D, Y.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if O, D, Y are in the word. So it\'s a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. Also good.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we are.\n\nAnother: ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2.\n\nWe have many options.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters and has A in a position we haven\'t tried (so not position 3). We tried A in position 3 already, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nTo maximize information, we can try A in a position that is common for words. For example, position 1 or 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any other information. So we can choose a word that has A and four new letters.\n\nI think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and A is in position 1.\n\nAlternatively, ""AUDIO"" is also good because it has two vowels (A, I, O) and two consonants (U, D) and might help us identify vowels.\n\nBut we know the word has at least one A, so we are already covering that.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has an A, so we can try to put A in a different position to see if we can get a ✓. So if we put A in position 1 and it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know it\'s not in position 1 and we can try other positions.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ABOUT"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo our second guess: ""ABOUT""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each letter.\n\nBut note: we know the secret word does not contain R (from first guess) and ""ABOUT"" doesn\'t have R, so that\'s fine.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ABOUT"".\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""TODAY"" to put A in position 4, which is a less common position? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include ""A"" (since it\'s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.\n- It should exclude C, R, N, E (known absent letters).\n- To maximize new information, use common unused letters (e.g., B, O, U, T, S, L) and prioritize distinct letters.\n\nA strong second guess is ""about"":\n- Places ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: B, O, U, T.\n- Avoids known absent letters and the ineffective 3rd position for ""A"".\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not in position 1 (since we put it in position 1 here) and not in position 3 (from the first guess)\n  B: x (not in the word)\n  O: x (not in the word)\n  U: x (not in the word)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T\n\nPresent letter (but not in the correct position yet): A\n\nWe also know that A is not in position 1 (from ""about"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, the secret word has the letter A in one of the positions: 2, 4, or 5, and does not contain any of the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 3).\n- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n- Uses new letters to gather more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We have used 9 letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T). So we have 17 letters left: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know A is in the word, so we must include A.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible, and also test A in a new position.\n\nPossible positions for A: We haven\'t tried A in position 2, 4, or 5. We can choose one of these.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to try A in a position that is common, like position 2. Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple positions at once, but we only have one known letter.\n\nWe also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use only the available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put A in position 2: _ A _ _ _\n  We need to fill the blanks with letters from D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n  Examples: \n    ""SAVvy"" -> but ""v"" repeated? and ""SAVVY"" has two V\'s, but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we should avoid repeating letters to get more information. So let\'s try distinct letters.\n\n  Possible words: \n    ""SALAD"" -> but we have A in position 2 and 5? But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears multiple times. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid repeating A to test other letters. Also, ""SALAD"" has L and D which are new, but also A again. And we know A is present, so repeating A might not give new information. Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: S is not in the absent list? We haven\'t tried S. But wait, in ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D. We know A is present, but we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Actually, we are putting A in two positions. If we get a \'-\' for the second A, it doesn\'t tell us if there is a second A or not? The feedback for a duplicate letter can be tricky. Since we don\'t know if there is a duplicate, it\'s better to avoid repeating A for now to keep it simple.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a word with A only once and in position 2.\n\n  Example: ""SALTY"" -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) so we cannot use T.\n\n  Another: ""SALSA"" -> has two S and two A, which is not ideal.\n\n  How about ""HALLS"" -> but we have two L\'s and we are putting A in position 2. Also, we haven\'t tried H, L, S. But note: we are avoiding T, which is absent. However, ""HALLS"" has two L\'s. We want to avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n  Let me think of words without duplicates: \n    ""PAGAN"" -> but N is absent (from guess1) so invalid.\n    ""MAGMA"" -> duplicate M and A? and G is new, but duplicate.\n\n  It\'s hard to find a word with A in position 2 without duplicates and without the absent letters.\n\n  Let me try position 4: _ _ _ A _\n  Example: ""PLAZA"" -> but P, L, A, Z, A -> duplicate A and Z is not common. Also, we have to avoid absent letters: P and L are new? But ""PLAZA"" has two A\'s.\n\n  Another: ""FOCAL"" -> but O is absent (from guess2) and C is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.\n\n  Another: ""MEDIA"" -> but E is absent (from guess1) and D, I, A -> but E is absent.\n\n  Another: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2? Wait, position 2: V-A-L-I-D -> so A is in position 2. And we haven\'t tried V, L, I, D. And no duplicates. This seems good.\n\n  But wait, we are considering position 4? Let me clarify: for ""VALID"": \n    Position 1: V\n    Position 2: A -> we are trying A in position 2.\n    Position 3: L\n    Position 4: I\n    Position 5: D\n\n  So A is in position 2.\n\n  Similarly, we can have A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A\n  Example: ""PIZZA"" -> duplicate Z, and we don\'t know about Z. But duplicate might be okay? But we want to avoid duplicates for information.\n\n  Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are absent (from guess2) -> invalid.\n\n  Another: ""KARMA"" -> K, A, R, M, A -> but R is absent (from guess1) and duplicate A.\n\n  Another: ""DELTA"" -> E is absent.\n\n  Another: ""SALSA"" -> duplicate S and A.\n\n  It seems difficult to find a word with A in position 5 without duplicates and without absent letters.\n\n  So let\'s focus on position 2 and 4.\n\n  We found ""VALID"" for position 2. Let me check if it\'s valid: \n    V, A, L, I, D -> all distinct, and we haven\'t tried V, L, I, D. And we avoid absent letters.\n\n  But note: we know A is in the word, so we are including it. And we are putting it in position 2, which we haven\'t tried.\n\n  However, we also have the option of position 4.\n\n  For position 4: \n    Example: ""SPLIT"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n    ""SPLIT"" doesn\'t have A? We need A in position 4.\n\n  Let me think: _ _ _ A _\n    ""FLAKY"" -> F, L, A, K, Y -> A in position 4? Actually, position 1:F, 2:L, 3:A? No, that\'s position 3. We need A in position 4.\n\n  How about: ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1? But we cannot put A in position 1 (we know it\'s not there). So we need a word that has A in position 4 and not in position 1,2,3? Actually, we can have A only in position 4.\n\n  Example: ""DELTA"" -> but E is absent.\n\n  ""GAMMA"" -> duplicate M and A, and A is in position 2 and 5? Not position 4.\n\n  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is absent and A in position 2 and 5.\n\n  ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but T is absent.\n\n  ""DISCO"" -> no A.\n\n  ""VIGIL"" -> no A.\n\n  ""LYCRA"" -> but R and C are absent.\n\n  ""PODIA"" -> O is absent.\n\n  ""QUAIL"" -> U is absent? And Q is not common.\n\n  It\'s challenging. \n\n  Another: ""FJORD"" -> no A.\n\n  How about ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but T is absent. And A is in position 2.\n\n  So for position 4, it\'s hard to find a word without using absent letters.\n\n  Therefore, let\'s go with A in position 2: ""VALID"" seems a good candidate.\n\n  But note: we haven\'t tried position 5 for A. We might try that in the future if needed.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 5: \n    Example: ""PIZZA"" -> not ideal because of duplicate Z and Z is uncommon.\n    ""JUMBA"" -> invalid because of U and B.\n\n    ""KAPPA"" -> duplicate P and A, and K and P are new? But duplicate.\n\n    ""GUPPY"" -> no A.\n\n    ""ZEBRA"" -> E and R and B are absent.\n\n  So let\'s stick with ""VALID"".\n\n  But wait, we have another option: A in position 4. Let me try one more time.\n\n  ""LYMPH"" -> no A.\n\n  ""SYNCH"" -> no A.\n\n  ""PYGMY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""SHYLY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""SISSY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""DADDY"" -> no A.\n\n  ""MADAM"" -> A in position 2 and 4? But we can use it. However, we are putting A in position 2 and 4. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated. Also, we are testing position 2 and 4 at the same time. But we also have M and D.\n\n  ""MADAM"": \n    M, A, D, A, M -> duplicate M and duplicate A.\n\n  We want to avoid duplicates to get more information.\n\n  So I think ""VALID"" is a better choice.\n\n  But note: ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common. We might choose a word with more common letters.\n\n  What about ""SALAD""? It has A in position 2 and 5, and we get to test S, L, D. But duplicate A. However, we know A is present, so if we get a \'-\' for the first A (position 2) and a \'x\' for the second A (position 5), that would tell us there is only one A? But the feedback for duplicate letters in Wordle: if the letter appears only once in the secret word, then only one occurrence will be marked (either ✓ or -) and the other will be x. But if the secret word has two A\'s, then both might be marked? Actually, the rules: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets ✓, else if there is an extra occurrence and the secret has fewer, it might get x. But it\'s a bit complex.\n\n  To avoid confusion, let\'s try to use distinct letters.\n\n  Another word with A in position 2: ""GAILY"" -> G, A, I, L, Y -> all distinct. And we haven\'t tried G, I, L, Y. And we avoid absent letters.\n\n  ""GAILY"" is a valid word? It means in a cheerful way. Yes.\n\n  Similarly, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> also good.\n\n  ""HAILY"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""JAILY"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""LAITY"" -> L, A, I, T, Y -> but T is absent (from guess2) -> invalid.\n\n  So ""GAILY"" and ""DAILY"" are options.\n\n  Also, ""VALID"" is an option.\n\n  We can also consider ""WAIFS"" -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2. Distinct letters.\n\n  But ""WAIFS"" is a word (meaning: homeless children).\n\n  However, we might prefer more common words.\n\n  Let me list the options:\n    Option 1: VALID -> V, A, L, I, D -> A in position 2.\n    Option 2: GAILY -> G, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.\n    Option 3: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2.\n    Option 4: WAIFS -> W, A, I, F, S -> A in position 2.\n\n  We can choose any of these. They all test A in position 2 and use distinct new letters.\n\n  Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters. Among the available letters, S, L, D, G, F are common.\n\n  ""DAILY"" uses D, A, I, L, Y -> D and L are common.\n\n  ""GAILY"" uses G, A, I, L, Y -> G is less common than D? But both are acceptable.\n\n  ""VALID"" uses V, which is less common.\n\n  ""WAIFS"" uses W and F, which are less common.\n\n  So ""DAILY"" or ""GAILY"" might be better.\n\n  But note: we have to consider that we are also testing the position of A. If we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, then we know A is in position 4 or 5.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""DAILY"" because it has more common letters.\n\n  But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters: D is not in the absent list? We haven\'t tried D. So it\'s okay.\n\n  However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""DAILY"" is valid.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose ""SALAD"" but it has duplicate A. Let\'s avoid that.\n\n  Another common word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D -> A in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So invalid.\n\n  So I think ""DAILY"" is a good choice.\n\n  But note: we have not tried position 4 or 5 for A. By putting A in position 2, we are testing one of the possibilities. If it\'s not there, then we know A is in 4 or 5.\n\n  We can also consider a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test that directly. But we haven\'t found a good one without duplicates.\n\n  Another word with A in position 4: ""FLAVA"" -> not a standard word.\n\n  ""PULKA"" -> not common.\n\n  ""TICCA"" -> not common.\n\n  So let\'s go with ""DAILY"".\n\n  But wait, we have ""SALSA"" but duplicate.\n\n  I think ""DAILY"" is acceptable.\n\n  However, let me check if there is a word with A in position 5 that is valid and without duplicates and without absent letters.\n\n  Example: ""PAPAL"" -> duplicate P and A in position 2 and 5? And we know A is not in position 2? Actually, we don\'t know if A is in position 2, we only know it\'s not in 1 or 3. So it could be in 2. But ""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are testing position 2 and 5 at the same time. But duplicate P.\n\n  ""FATWA"" -> F, A, T, W, A -> duplicate A and T is absent.\n\n  ""KARMA"" -> duplicate A and R absent.\n\n  ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> duplicate A.\n\n  ""ZEBRA"" -> absent letters.\n\n  So no good word for position 5.\n\n  Therefore, we choose a word with A in position 2: ""DAILY"".\n\n  So our third guess: ""DAILY""\n\n  We\'ll get feedback on D, A, I, L, Y.\n\n  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\n  And we test D, I, L, Y.\n\n  Alternatively, we could choose ""GAILY"" or ""VALID"". I think ""DAILY"" is fine.\n\n  Let me see the feedback we might get.\n\n  But we don\'t know the secret word, so we just have to guess.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""DAILY"".\n\n  However, note that we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.\n\n  Another word: ""SALAD"" might be acceptable if we are okay with duplicate A. But let\'s avoid.\n\n  Or ""PANSY"" -> but N is absent.\n\n  So ""DAILY"" it is.\n\n  But wait, we have ""HAILS"" -> H, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. And distinct letters. H, A, I, L, S. We haven\'t tried H, I, L, S. And S is very common.\n\n  ""HAILS"" might be better than ""DAILY"" because S is more common than Y? But both are valid.\n\n  We can choose ""HAILS"".\n\n  Similarly, ""FAILS"" -> F, A, I, L, S -> but we haven\'t tried F.\n\n  ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S.\n\n  All are good.\n\n  Since we have many options, let\'s pick one that covers common consonants.\n\n  I think ""HAILS"" is a good choice because H, S, L are common.\n\n  But we don\'t know which are in the word.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that position? But we couldn\'t find one.\n\n  Let me try again for position 4: \n    ""STOIC"" -> no A and O is absent.\n    ""SPIKY"" -> no A.\n    ""DYING"" -> no A.\n    ""FLING"" -> no A.\n    ""SLING"" -> no A.\n    ""SWING"" -> no A.\n    ""AXING"" -> A in position 1? But we know A is not in position 1.\n\n  How about ""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A -> O is absent -> invalid.\n\n  ""ALPHA"" -> A in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n  ""INLAY"" -> I, N, L, A, Y -> but N is absent -> invalid.\n\n  ""ITCHY"" -> no A.\n\n  So I think we are forced to put A in position 2 or 5. And position 5 is hard.\n\n  So let\'s go with position 2.\n\n  I\'ll choose ""HAILS"" because it has common letters.\n\n  But note: we are putting A in position 2. If it\'s not there, we know it\'s in 4 or 5.\n\n  So guess: ""HAILS""\n\n  But let\'s confirm the letters: H, A, I, L, S -> all distinct, and we haven\'t tried them, and not in the absent list.\n\n  So <guess>hails</guess>\n\n  However, the problem says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and we have to return in the format.\n\n  But I see that in the first two guesses, we used ""crane"" and ""about"", so we are consistent.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose ""DAILY"", but I think ""HAILS"" is also fine.\n\n  Let me see: which one is more common? Both are valid.\n\n  I\'ll go with ""HAILS"" because S is a common ending letter.\n\n  So final decision: ""HAILS""\n\n  But note: we are also testing I and L, which are vowels? I is a vowel, L is consonant.\n\n  We want to cover more consonants? ""HAILS"" has H, L, S which are consonants and I is vowel.\n\n  ""VALID"" has V, L, D (consonants) and I (vowel). But V is less common.\n\n  So ""HAILS"" is better.\n\n  Therefore, we guess ""HAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- **Guess 2 (about)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), and B, O, U, T are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.\n- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (9 letters eliminated).\n- **Available letters**: A, and all unused letters (D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include A** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its location. Position 2 is prioritized as it\'s common.\n- **Use 4 new, distinct letters** from the available pool to maximize information.\n- **Avoid absent letters** and positions where A is invalid (1 or 3).\n- **Strong candidate words**: \n  - `HAILS` (A in position 2, tests H, A, I, L, S).\n  - `DAILY` (A in position 2, tests D, A, I, L, Y).\n  - `VALID` (A in position 2, tests V, A, L, I, D).\n- **Chosen word**: `HAILS` (prioritizes common letters like S, L, H and tests A in position 2).\n\n<guess>hails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: hails -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) I(-) L(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x -> not in word
  R: x -> not in word
  A: - -> in word but wrong position (3rd)
  N: x -> not in word
  E: x -> not in word

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - -> in word but wrong position (1st)
  B: x -> not in word
  O: x -> not in word
  U: x -> not in word
  T: x -> not in word

Guess 3: ""hails""
  H: x -> not in word
  A: - -> in word but wrong position (2nd)
  I: - -> in word but wrong position (4th)
  L: ✓ -> in word and correct position (5th letter is L, since position in ""hails"" is 4? Let's break down ""hails"":)

Actually, let's index ""hails"":
  Position 1: H -> gets x
  Position 2: A -> gets - 
  Position 3: I -> gets - 
  Position 4: L -> gets ✓? Wait, no: The feedback is for the entire word. The word ""hails"" is 5 letters: 
  H A I L S

So positions:
  1: H -> x
  2: A -> -
  3: I -> no, position 3 is I? But feedback says I(-). So position 3: I -> -, and then 
  Position 4: L -> ✓? Actually, the feedback is given as: H(x) A(-) I(-) L(✓) S) but it says: ""L(✓)"" and then S(x)? 

The feedback provided: ""H(x) A(-) I(-) L(✓) S(x)""

So:
  Position 1: H -> x
  Position 2: A -> - 
  Position 3: I -> - 
  Position 4: L -> this feedback shows L(✓), meaning L is in the correct position. But note: in ""hails"", position 4 is L? 
  Actually, ""hails"":
    H (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)

So position 4 is L, and we get ✓ for L. That means the secret word has L in position 4.

Then position 5: S -> x, so S is not in the word.

Therefore, from Guess 3: hails -> 
  H: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word but wrong position, and since we tried position 2, it's not position 2)
  I: - (in word but wrong position, and we tried position 3, so not position 3)
  L: ✓ (in word and in position 4) -> so the secret word has L in the 4th position.
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:
  Secret word: 
    Position 4: L

And we know:
  Present letters: A, I, L (L is fixed at position 4)
  A is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 (from guesses: position 1: about, position 2: hails, position 3: hails? Wait, we never put A in position 3? We put A in position 3 in ""crane"" (which is not allowed) and then in position 1 and 2. But in ""hails"", position 3 is I, not A. So we have:

For A:
  Tried positions: 1 (about), 2 (hails), and 3 (crane) -> all wrong. So A must be in position 4 or 5? However, at position 4 we have L! So position 4 is taken by L. Therefore, A must be in position 5. Because the only remaining position is 5.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
  Position 4: L (fixed)
  A cannot be in 1,2,3 -> so only position 5 left.

Similarly, for I:
  We tried I in position 3 (in hails) and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So I must be in position 1,2, or 5? But position 5 is now candidate for A? We have two letters to place: A and I, and we also have the fixed L at position 4.

Moreover, from Guess 3, we also learned that S is not in the word, and H is not in the word.

So let's summarize:

Known letters:
  A: must be in position 5? Because:
    Positions available: 1,2,3,5 (position 4 is L).
    A cannot be in 1,2,3 -> so only position 5.
  I: in the word, not in position 3 (and we tried position 3, so it could be in 1,2, or 5? But if A is in 5, then I cannot be in 5. Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.
  L: fixed at position 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters. So we have:
  Position 1: ? 
  Position 2: ? 
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: A (we deduced)

But from the feedback, we have I as well, which must be placed in position 1 or 2.

Now, are there any other known present or absent letters?

Absent letters from all guesses:

From Guess 1: C, R, N, E
From Guess 2: B, O, U, T
From Guess 3: H, S

So total absent: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, H, S

Present letters: A, I, L (and we know L is at 4, A must be at 5, and I at 1 or 2)

But wait, we have a contradiction? Because I is also present, and we have only one empty position for I? No, we have positions 1,2,3 to fill, but we have I and two other unknown letters? Because the word has to have 5 letters, and we have:

Known to be in the word: A, I, L (three letters). So we are missing two letters.

But we know that A and I are present, but we haven't found their positions? Actually, we placed A at position 5 and I must be in 1 or 2? Then positions 1,2,3: 
  Position 1: could be I or a new letter?
  Position 2: could be I or a new letter?
  Position 3: must be another letter? 

The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In ""hails"", we learned about H, A, I, L, S. We did not test all letters in the secret word.

We know the secret word has:
  - A (somewhere, we think position 5)
  - I (somewhere, we think position 1 or 2)
  - L (at position 4)
  - and two more letters that we haven't encountered? Because we only know three letters: A, I, L.

But from feedback, we know that the secret word has five letters, so there are two more letters that we haven't guessed correctly (or missed).

And the feedback for ""hails"" shows:
  H (x) -> absent
  A (-) -> present but not position 2
  I (-) -> present but not position 3
  L (✓) -> present and in position 4
  S (x) -> absent

So the word contains A and I and L, plus two other letters not in {H, S, etc.}.

Now, we have to find what the other two letters are.

Moreover, we deduced that A must be in position 5 because:
  Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 4 is L -> the others: 1,2,3,5 for A. But A cannot be in 1 (tried in about), 2 (tried in hails), 3 (tried in crane) -> so only position 5.

Similarly, I is present but not in position 3 (tried in hails). Since A is in 5, I must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
  - Has L in position 4 (fixed)
  - Has A in position 5 (we think)
  - Has I in position 1 or 2? Or we could try to test I in one of the positions? Actually, we might as well put I in position 1 to test that.

But also, we have to include two more unknown letters to discover them.

So the guess should be:
  Position 1: ?  (could be I or a new letter)
  Position 2: ?  (could be I or a new letter)
  Position 3: ?  (a new letter, since I cannot be there and A is in 5)
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: A

And we don't know what to put in positions 1,2,3? But we need to choose words that are valid.

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Available letters: all except C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,H,S (so we eliminated C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,H,S).

Available: D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and we know I and L are in the word (L is already placed), and A is in the word (placed at 5). So for positions 1,2,3, we can use letters from the available set (excluding absent ones) and including I (for positions 1 or 2).

But note: we have I that must be placed in position 1 or 2? Actually, the secret word might have I in position 1 or 2? Or we haven't tried it in other positions? No, we know it is in the word and not in position 3. We haven't tried it in position 1 or 2? But in ""hails"", we tried I in position 3. That's the only time we tried I. So we don't know about position 1 or 2 for I.

But also, we have two more letters to fill.

To maximize information, we can try a word that puts I in position 1 and then new letters in 2 and 3. Alternatively, put I in position 2 and new letters in 1 and 3.

But note: we have only a few guesses left, so we want to confirm as much as possible.

Since we are confident that A is in position 5 (because it cannot be elsewhere), we can lock that. Similarly, L is locked in position 4.

So let's build a guess:

Option: Put I in position 1: then positions: I ? ? L A

We need to fill ? and ? with two new letters (from available set) that form a valid word.

We also note that the secret word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:
  I _ _ L A

What words have that pattern? 
  With 5 letters, ending with L A.

Common words: 
  ""IDEAL"": I, D, E, A, L -> but E is absent (from guess1), so invalid.
  ""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> N absent -> invalid.
  ""LABIA"": L at position 1? No, we need pattern ? ? ? L A: so fourth letter L, fifth A.

So third letter must be between I (pos1) and L (pos4) and A (pos5).

What words have the form I X Y L A? 
  X is position 2, Y position 3.

Examples: 
  ""IDOLA"": I, D, O, L, A -> O is absent -> invalid.
  ""IFLTA"": not a word.
  ""IMPLA"": not a word.
  ""IMPALA"": too long.

  ""INULA"": I, N, U, L, A -> N and U absent -> invalid.

  ""VISTA"": V, I, S, T, A -> but S and T absent -> invalid.

  ""DIVAN"": but not matching pattern.

  ""PILOT"": has O and T -> absent.

It seems difficult to find a word with pattern I_X_Y_L_A.

Maybe put I in position 2: then pattern: ? I ? L A

So words: X I Y L A

Examples:
  ""VILLA"": V, I, L, L, A -> but L repeated? And the pattern: 
    Position 1: V
    Position 2: I
    Position 3: L? But we have a fixed L at position 4. And we already have I at 2? Then position 3: L, position 4: L? That would be V, I, L, L, A -> but we know L is at position 4 (correct), so putting L in position 3? That would mean the secret word has two L's? But the feedback for ""hails"" showed a ✓ for L at position 4 and did not indicate anything about duplicate L? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicates.

In Guess 3: ""hails"" -> we got L(✓) for position 4, so L is at position 4. If we put L in position 4 and the secret word has only one L, then if we also put L in another position, it might show as x or -? But we don't know. So it's possible to have duplicates.

But in ""VILLA"", we would have:
  Position 1: V -> not tried
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L -> we know L is at position 4, so this might not be present? 
  Position 4: L -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 5: A

But if the secret word has only one L (at position 4), then if we guess L at position 3, it would get x because it is not in the word? But we know L is present? Only one occurrence? Actually, the feedback rules: for each letter in the guess, mark if it is in the word and if in correct position.

If the secret word has only one L at position 4, then:
  - L in position 4: ✓
  - L in position 3: x (because there is no other L)

If the secret word has two L's, then:
  - L in position 3: - (if there is an L in another position) or perhaps ✓ only if in the correct position.

Since we don't know, we should avoid risking duplicate L in the guess? But we can try.

But let's try to find valid words without using duplicates or absent letters.

Word pattern: _ I _ L A

Available letters: D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

Placeholder: X at position 1, Y at position 3.

Words: 
  ""BILGA"" -> B absent -> invalid.
  ""DILYA"" ? Not common.
  ""FILMG"" -> not 5 letters? ""FILMA"" not word.

Let me think: 
""PILAF"" or ""PILAF"": P, I, L, A, F -> but pattern? 
The word ""PILAF"": 
  P (1), I (2), L (3), A (4), F (5) -> but we need L at position 4? In ""PILAF"", L is at position 3. Our pattern requires L at position 4.

We need position 4 to be L and position 5 to be A.

So it must be: ? ? ? L A -> for ""PILAF"", it doesn't fit.

Alternative: ""JUMBO"" -> invalid.

How about ""MATILDA"" -> too long.

I found: ""KOILA"" -> not common.

Maybe ""DAIL"" is only 4.

One standard word: ""AXILA"" -> but A is already at position5? And we have X? 
  A X I L A -> no, we need pattern: position 5 is A, so if we do ""EXILA"" but E is absent.

Another: ""VITULA"" -> too long.

It's hard.

Perhaps we consider that the letter in position 3 might be I? But no, we tried I at position 3 and got a ""-"", meaning it is not there? Or wait, in ""hails"", we put I at position 3 (in ""hails"", position3 is I) and got ""-"", so I is not in position 3? And we are not putting I there.

But in the secret word, position3 might be another letter.

Let's try to list some words with ? ? ? L A:

Common words: 
  ""PULLA"" -> P, U, L, L, A -> U absent -> invalid.
  ""ZILA"" -> not 5 letters.
  ""VILLA"": already considered, has two L's.

Another: ""BALLA"" -> B absent.

  ""DOLLA"" -> O absent.

  ""GALLA"" -> G, A, L, L, A -> duplicate.

  ""FELLA"" -> E absent.

  ""CELLA"" -> E and C absent.

  ""HELLA"" -> H and E absent.

  ""WILLA"" -> W, I, L, L, A -> has I and L and A. Pattern: 
    Position 1: W
    Position 2: I
    Position 3: L? 
    Position 4: L
    Position 5: A

But then at position 3: L, and position 4: L. We know L is fixed at position 4. If the secret word has only one L, then position 3: L might be marked x. If we put L in position 3 and the secret word has only one L (at position 4), then for position 3: L would get x.

But if the secret word has two L's, then one of them might be at position 3 or 4? But we only know position 4 is L.

We might risk it? But then we also get to see if there are two L's.

We might try ""WILLA"", but is it a word? ""Willa"" is a proper name? Maybe not ideal.

Another word: ""MILPA"" -> M, I, L, P, A -> but pattern: position 1: M, position2: I, position3: L, position4: P? No, we need position4 to be L.

That won't work.

Think anew: the pattern we need is: _ I _ L A -> only if we put I in position 2.

Then position 1: ?, position 3: ?

With available letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

What words exist? 
  ""DITTA"" -> T absent.
  ""MIRZA"" -> R absent.
  ""DICKY"" -> C and K? But C absent.

  ""FIGGY"" -> not really.

  ""MIXED"" -> not matching.

It seems tough.

Perhaps instead of rushing to this guess, we notice that we have not actually confirmed that A is in position 5. We deduced it because it cannot be in 1,2,3 and position4 is L. But what if the secret word has two A's? Then A could be in position 4 as well? But we also have L at position4? No, position4 can’t hold two letters.

In ""hails"", we only have one letter at position4: L. In the secret word, position4 is L, so A cannot be there because a position holds one letter.

So A must be in position5.

Therefore, we must have a word ending with ""LA"".

Common 5-letter words ending with ""LA"": 
  ""KOALA"" -> K, O, A, L, A -> wait, letters: K,O,A, but then L and A? Actually, ""KOALA"": positions: 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A? But we need position4 to be L and position5 to be A? In ""KOALA"", position4 is L? Let's see: K O A L A -> so position4 is L, position5 is A -> matches! But does it fit our constraints?

But ""KOALA"":
  K -> not tried? 
  O -> absent (from guess2) -> invalid.
  A -> in the word, but position3: we have A at position3? But we know A cannot be in position3, because in ""crane"" it was position3 and got '-'. Also, in ""KOALA"", position3 is A and that is invalid.

Also, O is absent.

So invalid.

Another: ""VIOLA"" -> O and L in position4? V I O L A: position4 is L, position5 is A -> good, but O in position3? And O is absent -> invalid.

""GIFFA"" -> not common.

""DUCAL"" -> D, U, C, A, L -> but U and C absent.

""FECAL"" -> E and C absent.

""YODEL"" -> D, E, L at4? Y O D E L: position4 is E, not L.

We need exactly: * * * L A.

Let me think from common words:
  ""CULLA"" -> C and U absent.
  ""GULLA"" -> U absent.

  ""PULLA"" -> U absent.

  ""SULLA"" -> S and U absent.

  ""VERLA"" -> not common.

  ""TABLA"" -> T and B absent.

  ""KABLA"" -> not common.

  ""FLAXA"" -> F, L, A, X, A -> pattern: F L A X A? Not ending with LA? and L in position2, not position4.

""SPELA"" -> not common.

Perhaps we are missing something.

Another idea: maybe the secret word is ""ANIM L""? But that's 5 letters: A N I M L? Then pattern would be different.

But we know the word has A, I, L, and two others.

And we must avoid absent letters.

And it must have L at position4 and A at position5.

So let's try to fill positions 1,2,3.

We also heve to include I somewhere? In position1 or position2.

Let me propose a guess that has:
  Position 1: I (to test if it's there)
  Position 2: a new letter, say M
  Position 3: a new letter, say P
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: A

Word: I M P L A -> ""IMPLA"" -> not a valid word.

I and then G: ""IGLOA"" -> I G L O A -> but O absent, and pattern: position3 is L? No.

Position3 can't be L because we need position4 to be L.

Position3 must be a consonant between I and L.

""ISLWA"" -> not word.

""IDOLA"" -> O absent.

""INULA"" -> N and U absent.

""IXTLA"" -> X and T? T absent, and also not common.

""KAZLA"" -> not common.

 perhaps include a vowel in position3? For example, U is absent, O is absent, E is absent. Available vowels: A, I (but A is in position5) and we have position3 could be another vowel? like Y? or no vowel.

We can use Y, as in ""CARRY"", but not applicable.

Try: 
  Position 1: F, position2: I, position3: Y, position4: L, position5: A -> ""FIYLA"" -> not a word.

  G I Y L A -> ""GIYLA""  not a word.

Another: ""KILA"" is 4 letters.

The word we want is rare.

Perhaps our deduction that A must be in position5 is incorrect? What if the word has duplicate A's? For example, could it have A in a position we haven't tried and also in position5? We haven't tried position5 for A.

But we already ruled out position1,2,3 for A. The only position left for A is position5? Or position4, but position4 is L.

So deduction is correct.

So the word must end with * * * L A.

Now, we have to find valid English words of the form \w\w\w L A not using the absent letters.

Let's try:
  ""PIPLA"" -> P, I, P, L, A -> has I in position2? P in position1, I in position2? P in position3: so P? And not using absent? Available: P is allowed. But is ""PIPLA"" a word? I think not.

  ""PIPAL"" is a word: P I P A L -> then position4 is A? But we need position4 to be L and position5 to be A? So this is P I P A L -> position4: A, position5: L -> not matching.

We need position4: L, position5: A.

So must be ...L at fourth position and fifth A.

English words ending with "" LA "" / ""L A"" at last two positions.

Common ones: 
  ""paella"" -> 6 letters.
  ""fibula""-> 6.
  5-letter words: 
    ""koala"" -> as above, has issues. 
    ""villa"" -> we discussed.
    ""tacan"" -> no.
    ""scala""-> S is absent.
    ""tegla""-> not common.
    ""doula""-> O and U absent.
    ""novela""-> long.
    ""paglia""-> long.

I found: ""LILA"" is 4.

Another: ""YELLA"" -> but ""yella"" is not standard english? And has E and L at position3? Y E L L A -> position4 is L, position5 is A -> what about the feedback? 
  But E and one L? Pattern: Y E L L A. We can try to see.

But E is in the word? We know E is absent (from guess1). So invalid.

""JOWLA""-> J,O -> O absent.

""KETLA""-> not word.

""MATLA""-> not word.

 This is struggling.

 Perhaps we missed that in the first guess, A is ""present but wrong position"" so it must be in the word, and in the second guess, also ""present but wrong position"" so in the word, and now in the third guess, A is ""present but wrong position"" in position2. After trying positions 1,2,3 and they are wrong, and position4 is L, then A must be in position5.

 So we must find a word.

Let me try: ""BIFFA""-> not word.

""DIFFA""-> not.

Maybe include J: ""JIAYA""-> not.

Another idea: the word might be ""DAILY"" itself? But we already guessed? No, we guessed ""hails"", not ""daily"".

Let's recall secret word has A, I, L, and two other letters, L at position4, A at position5. And I in position1 or position2.

And the word is ending with LA.

Try: ""DEVIL"" not.

 What about ""QU A L A"" -> ""QUALA"" not word.

 Perhaps ""MAPLA"" not word.

We might try ""VISTA"" but S and T are out.

Or ""MIDST"" -> absent letters.

But we have to work with available letters.

Perhaps our deduction is wrong? Could A be in position4? But position4 is L! From hails. So that's fixed.

Unless there are two L's? For example, the secret word has L at position4 and also has another letter.

But we have L at position4 with ✓, so L is there. A cannot be at position4.

So only position5 for A.

Similarly, I must be at position1 or2.

 But I think we have to chose a guess even if the word is uncommon.

After research, I found that ""KYLIE"" doesn't match the pattern.

Back to available letters: for the first three positions, we need to choose letters from: D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And the word pattern: [letter] [maybe I] [letter] L A

Specifically: let's I in position1: then ? I ? L A -> available for position1 and position3: from the remaining letters.

For example: ""GIGLA"" not word.

""JIGGA"" -> J I G G A -> pattern J I G G A -> position3 is G, position4 is G? But we need position4 to be L and position5 A, so not.

We need precisely position4 as L.

""FIGLA"" not word.

""KITLA"" not word.

""PIELA"" not word.

""VILLA"" is the only common word I can think of, and it has two L's: V I L L A -> then position4 is L, position5 is A -> perfect pattern.

Checking the letters: 
  V: available (not absent)
  I: present
  L: at position4 (already known)
  L: at position3? -> this is the second L.
  A: at position5

Now, is ""VILLA"" a valid English word? Yes, it means a country house.

 But we have two L's: will that be a problem? In terms of letter try:

  We have not used L in position3 before. But from feedback from ""hails"", we got L in position4 which is correct. If we guess ""VILLA"", and the secret word has only one L (at position4), then:
    - V: if not in word, marked x.
    - I: if in word and in position2, marked? But we don't know I's position.
    - L in position3: marked x (because secret has only one L and it's at position4)
    - L in position4: ✓
    - A: in position5, which is correct, so ✓

But the secret word might have two L's? For example, ""VILLA"" itself, then:
    - V: ✓ if in position1
    - I: ✓ in position2
    - L in position3: - or ✓? Actually, if the secret is ""VILLA"", then position3 is L, so ✓
    - L in position4: ✓
    - A: ✓

But we don't know if the secret has two L's.

Also, note that in ""VILLA"", position3 is L, which we haven't tried before. In ""hails"", we only tried I in position3, not L.

In our deduction, there's no constraint that L cannot be in position3? But we know from the fixed position that L is at position4, but there could be another L elsewhere.

So we can guess ""VILLA"".

But we also must confirm I: in ""VILLA"", I is in position2. If the secret word has I in position2, it would be correct. If I is in position1, then our guess of I in position2 might be -.

Given the available options, ""VILLA"" is a valid guess.

The other option is to put I in position1. than in ""IVDLA"" no such word.

So guess: ""VILLA""

We know that V is new, I is at position2, L at position3 and L at position4, A at position5.

And we avoid absent letters.

So let's go with that.

<guess>villa</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (about)**: A is present but not in position 1.
- **Guess 3 (hails)**: 
  - A is present but not in position 2.
  - I is present but not in position 3.
  - L is in the **exact position 4** (✓).
  - H and S are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **L is fixed in position 4**.
- **A must be in position 5** since it cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (tested in attempts), and position 4 is occupied by L.
- **I is present** but not in position 3. With position 4 fixed and A in position 5, I must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, H, S.
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize confirming **A in position 5** and **I in position 1 or 2**.
- **Test new letters** to identify the remaining two slots (positions 1, 2, or 3).
- Choose a valid word matching the pattern `_ I _ L A` (if I is in position 2) or `I _ _ L A` (if I is in position 1).
- Strong candidate: **""VILLA""**:
  - Places I in position 2 (to test its location).
  - Places A in position 5 (as deduced).
  - Uses new unverified letter V in position 1 and L in position 3 (to explore potential duplicates or new letter L).

<guess>villa</guess>",villa,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x -> not in word
  R: x -> not in word
  A: - -> in word but wrong position (3rd)
  N: x -> not in word
  E: x -> not in word

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - -> in word but wrong position (1st)
  B: x -> not in word
  O: x -> not in word
  U: x -> not in word
  T: x -> not in word

Guess 3: ""hails""
  H: x -> not in word
  A: - -> in word but wrong position (2nd)
  I: - -> in word but wrong position (4th)
  L: ✓ -> in word and correct position (5th letter is L, since position in ""hails"" is 4? Let's break down ""hails"":)

Actually, let's index ""hails"":
  Position 1: H -> gets x
  Position 2: A -> gets - 
  Position 3: I -> gets - 
  Position 4: L -> gets ✓? Wait, no: The feedback is for the entire word. The word ""hails"" is 5 letters: 
  H A I L S

So positions:
  1: H -> x
  2: A -> -
  3: I -> no, position 3 is I? But feedback says I(-). So position 3: I -> -, and then 
  Position 4: L -> ✓? Actually, the feedback is given as: H(x) A(-) I(-) L(✓) S) but it says: ""L(✓)"" and then S(x)? 

The feedback provided: ""H(x) A(-) I(-) L(✓) S(x)""

So:
  Position 1: H -> x
  Position 2: A -> - 
  Position 3: I -> - 
  Position 4: L -> this feedback shows L(✓), meaning L is in the correct position. But note: in ""hails"", position 4 is L? 
  Actually, ""hails"":
    H (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)

So position 4 is L, and we get ✓ for L. That means the secret word has L in position 4.

Then position 5: S -> x, so S is not in the word.

Therefore, from Guess 3: hails -> 
  H: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word but wrong position, and since we tried position 2, it's not position 2)
  I: - (in word but wrong position, and we tried position 3, so not position 3)
  L: ✓ (in word and in position 4) -> so the secret word has L in the 4th position.
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:
  Secret word: 
    Position 4: L

And we know:
  Present letters: A, I, L (L is fixed at position 4)
  A is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 (from guesses: position 1: about, position 2: hails, position 3: hails? Wait, we never put A in position 3? We put A in position 3 in ""crane"" (which is not allowed) and then in position 1 and 2. But in ""hails"", position 3 is I, not A. So we have:

For A:
  Tried positions: 1 (about), 2 (hails), and 3 (crane) -> all wrong. So A must be in position 4 or 5? However, at position 4 we have L! So position 4 is taken by L. Therefore, A must be in position 5. Because the only remaining position is 5.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
  Position 4: L (fixed)
  A cannot be in 1,2,3 -> so only position 5 left.

Similarly, for I:
  We tried I in position 3 (in hails) and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So I must be in position 1,2, or 5? But position 5 is now candidate for A? We have two letters to place: A and I, and we also have the fixed L at position 4.

Moreover, from Guess 3, we also learned that S is not in the word, and H is not in the word.

So let's summarize:

Known letters:
  A: must be in position 5? Because:
    Positions available: 1,2,3,5 (position 4 is L).
    A cannot be in 1,2,3 -> so only position 5.
  I: in the word, not in position 3 (and we tried position 3, so it could be in 1,2, or 5? But if A is in 5, then I cannot be in 5. Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.
  L: fixed at position 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters. So we have:
  Position 1: ? 
  Position 2: ? 
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: A (we deduced)

But from the feedback, we have I as well, which must be placed in position 1 or 2.

Now, are there any other known present or absent letters?

Absent letters from all guesses:

From Guess 1: C, R, N, E
From Guess 2: B, O, U, T
From Guess 3: H, S

So total absent: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, H, S

Present letters: A, I, L (and we know L is at 4, A must be at 5, and I at 1 or 2)

But wait, we have a contradiction? Because I is also present, and we have only one empty position for I? No, we have positions 1,2,3 to fill, but we have I and two other unknown letters? Because the word has to have 5 letters, and we have:

Known to be in the word: A, I, L (three letters). So we are missing two letters.

But we know that A and I are present, but we haven't found their positions? Actually, we placed A at position 5 and I must be in 1 or 2? Then positions 1,2,3: 
  Position 1: could be I or a new letter?
  Position 2: could be I or a new letter?
  Position 3: must be another letter? 

The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In ""hails"", we learned about H, A, I, L, S. We did not test all letters in the secret word.

We know the secret word has:
  - A (somewhere, we think position 5)
  - I (somewhere, we think position 1 or 2)
  - L (at position 4)
  - and two more letters that we haven't encountered? Because we only know three letters: A, I, L.

But from feedback, we know that the secret word has five letters, so there are two more letters that we haven't guessed correctly (or missed).

And the feedback for ""hails"" shows:
  H (x) -> absent
  A (-) -> present but not position 2
  I (-) -> present but not position 3
  L (✓) -> present and in position 4
  S (x) -> absent

So the word contains A and I and L, plus two other letters not in {H, S, etc.}.

Now, we have to find what the other two letters are.

Moreover, we deduced that A must be in position 5 because:
  Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 4 is L -> the others: 1,2,3,5 for A. But A cannot be in 1 (tried in about), 2 (tried in hails), 3 (tried in crane) -> so only position 5.

Similarly, I is present but not in position 3 (tried in hails). Since A is in 5, I must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
  - Has L in position 4 (fixed)
  - Has A in position 5 (we think)
  - Has I in position 1 or 2? Or we could try to test I in one of the positions? Actually, we might as well put I in position 1 to test that.

But also, we have to include two more unknown letters to discover them.

So the guess should be:
  Position 1: ?  (could be I or a new letter)
  Position 2: ?  (could be I or a new letter)
  Position 3: ?  (a new letter, since I cannot be there and A is in 5)
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: A

And we don't know what to put in positions 1,2,3? But we need to choose words that are valid.

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Available letters: all except C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,H,S (so we eliminated C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,H,S).

Available: D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and we know I and L are in the word (L is already placed), and A is in the word (placed at 5). So for positions 1,2,3, we can use letters from the available set (excluding absent ones) and including I (for positions 1 or 2).

But note: we have I that must be placed in position 1 or 2? Actually, the secret word might have I in position 1 or 2? Or we haven't tried it in other positions? No, we know it is in the word and not in position 3. We haven't tried it in position 1 or 2? But in ""hails"", we tried I in position 3. That's the only time we tried I. So we don't know about position 1 or 2 for I.

But also, we have two more letters to fill.

To maximize information, we can try a word that puts I in position 1 and then new letters in 2 and 3. Alternatively, put I in position 2 and new letters in 1 and 3.

But note: we have only a few guesses left, so we want to confirm as much as possible.

Since we are confident that A is in position 5 (because it cannot be elsewhere), we can lock that. Similarly, L is locked in position 4.

So let's build a guess:

Option: Put I in position 1: then positions: I ? ? L A

We need to fill ? and ? with two new letters (from available set) that form a valid word.

We also note that the secret word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:
  I _ _ L A

What words have that pattern? 
  With 5 letters, ending with L A.

Common words: 
  ""IDEAL"": I, D, E, A, L -> but E is absent (from guess1), so invalid.
  ""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> N absent -> invalid.
  ""LABIA"": L at position 1? No, we need pattern ? ? ? L A: so fourth letter L, fifth A.

So third letter must be between I (pos1) and L (pos4) and A (pos5).

What words have the form I X Y L A? 
  X is position 2, Y position 3.

Examples: 
  ""IDOLA"": I, D, O, L, A -> O is absent -> invalid.
  ""IFLTA"": not a word.
  ""IMPLA"": not a word.
  ""IMPALA"": too long.

  ""INULA"": I, N, U, L, A -> N and U absent -> invalid.

  ""VISTA"": V, I, S, T, A -> but S and T absent -> invalid.

  ""DIVAN"": but not matching pattern.

  ""PILOT"": has O and T -> absent.

It seems difficult to find a word with pattern I_X_Y_L_A.

Maybe put I in position 2: then pattern: ? I ? L A

So words: X I Y L A

Examples:
  ""VILLA"": V, I, L, L, A -> but L repeated? And the pattern: 
    Position 1: V
    Position 2: I
    Position 3: L? But we have a fixed L at position 4. And we already have I at 2? Then position 3: L, position 4: L? That would be V, I, L, L, A -> but we know L is at position 4 (correct), so putting L in position 3? That would mean the secret word has two L's? But the feedback for ""hails"" showed a ✓ for L at position 4 and did not indicate anything about duplicate L? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicates.

In Guess 3: ""hails"" -> we got L(✓) for position 4, so L is at position 4. If we put L in position 4 and the secret word has only one L, then if we also put L in another position, it might show as x or -? But we don't know. So it's possible to have duplicates.

But in ""VILLA"", we would have:
  Position 1: V -> not tried
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L -> we know L is at position 4, so this might not be present? 
  Position 4: L -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 5: A

But if the secret word has only one L (at position 4), then if we guess L at position 3, it would get x because it is not in the word? But we know L is present? Only one occurrence? Actually, the feedback rules: for each letter in the guess, mark if it is in the word and if in correct position.

If the secret word has only one L at position 4, then:
  - L in position 4: ✓
  - L in position 3: x (because there is no other L)

If the secret word has two L's, then:
  - L in position 3: - (if there is an L in another position) or perhaps ✓ only if in the correct position.

Since we don't know, we should avoid risking duplicate L in the guess? But we can try.

But let's try to find valid words without using duplicates or absent letters.

Word pattern: _ I _ L A

Available letters: D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

Placeholder: X at position 1, Y at position 3.

Words: 
  ""BILGA"" -> B absent -> invalid.
  ""DILYA"" ? Not common.
  ""FILMG"" -> not 5 letters? ""FILMA"" not word.

Let me think: 
""PILAF"" or ""PILAF"": P, I, L, A, F -> but pattern? 
The word ""PILAF"": 
  P (1), I (2), L (3), A (4), F (5) -> but we need L at position 4? In ""PILAF"", L is at position 3. Our pattern requires L at position 4.

We need position 4 to be L and position 5 to be A.

So it must be: ? ? ? L A -> for ""PILAF"", it doesn't fit.

Alternative: ""JUMBO"" -> invalid.

How about ""MATILDA"" -> too long.

I found: ""KOILA"" -> not common.

Maybe ""DAIL"" is only 4.

One standard word: ""AXILA"" -> but A is already at position5? And we have X? 
  A X I L A -> no, we need pattern: position 5 is A, so if we do ""EXILA"" but E is absent.

Another: ""VITULA"" -> too long.

It's hard.

Perhaps we consider that the letter in position 3 might be I? But no, we tried I at position 3 and got a ""-"", meaning it is not there? Or wait, in ""hails"", we put I at position 3 (in ""hails"", position3 is I) and got ""-"", so I is not in position 3? And we are not putting I there.

But in the secret word, position3 might be another letter.

Let's try to list some words with ? ? ? L A:

Common words: 
  ""PULLA"" -> P, U, L, L, A -> U absent -> invalid.
  ""ZILA"" -> not 5 letters.
  ""VILLA"": already considered, has two L's.

Another: ""BALLA"" -> B absent.

  ""DOLLA"" -> O absent.

  ""GALLA"" -> G, A, L, L, A -> duplicate.

  ""FELLA"" -> E absent.

  ""CELLA"" -> E and C absent.

  ""HELLA"" -> H and E absent.

  ""WILLA"" -> W, I, L, L, A -> has I and L and A. Pattern: 
    Position 1: W
    Position 2: I
    Position 3: L? 
    Position 4: L
    Position 5: A

But then at position 3: L, and position 4: L. We know L is fixed at position 4. If the secret word has only one L, then position 3: L might be marked x. If we put L in position 3 and the secret word has only one L (at position 4), then for position 3: L would get x.

But if the secret word has two L's, then one of them might be at position 3 or 4? But we only know position 4 is L.

We might risk it? But then we also get to see if there are two L's.

We might try ""WILLA"", but is it a word? ""Willa"" is a proper name? Maybe not ideal.

Another word: ""MILPA"" -> M, I, L, P, A -> but pattern: position 1: M, position2: I, position3: L, position4: P? No, we need position4 to be L.

That won't work.

Think anew: the pattern we need is: _ I _ L A -> only if we put I in position 2.

Then position 1: ?, position 3: ?

With available letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

What words exist? 
  ""DITTA"" -> T absent.
  ""MIRZA"" -> R absent.
  ""DICKY"" -> C and K? But C absent.

  ""FIGGY"" -> not really.

  ""MIXED"" -> not matching.

It seems tough.

Perhaps instead of rushing to this guess, we notice that we have not actually confirmed that A is in position 5. We deduced it because it cannot be in 1,2,3 and position4 is L. But what if the secret word has two A's? Then A could be in position 4 as well? But we also have L at position4? No, position4 can’t hold two letters.

In ""hails"", we only have one letter at position4: L. In the secret word, position4 is L, so A cannot be there because a position holds one letter.

So A must be in position5.

Therefore, we must have a word ending with ""LA"".

Common 5-letter words ending with ""LA"": 
  ""KOALA"" -> K, O, A, L, A -> wait, letters: K,O,A, but then L and A? Actually, ""KOALA"": positions: 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A? But we need position4 to be L and position5 to be A? In ""KOALA"", position4 is L? Let's see: K O A L A -> so position4 is L, position5 is A -> matches! But does it fit our constraints?

But ""KOALA"":
  K -> not tried? 
  O -> absent (from guess2) -> invalid.
  A -> in the word, but position3: we have A at position3? But we know A cannot be in position3, because in ""crane"" it was position3 and got '-'. Also, in ""KOALA"", position3 is A and that is invalid.

Also, O is absent.

So invalid.

Another: ""VIOLA"" -> O and L in position4? V I O L A: position4 is L, position5 is A -> good, but O in position3? And O is absent -> invalid.

""GIFFA"" -> not common.

""DUCAL"" -> D, U, C, A, L -> but U and C absent.

""FECAL"" -> E and C absent.

""YODEL"" -> D, E, L at4? Y O D E L: position4 is E, not L.

We need exactly: * * * L A.

Let me think from common words:
  ""CULLA"" -> C and U absent.
  ""GULLA"" -> U absent.

  ""PULLA"" -> U absent.

  ""SULLA"" -> S and U absent.

  ""VERLA"" -> not common.

  ""TABLA"" -> T and B absent.

  ""KABLA"" -> not common.

  ""FLAXA"" -> F, L, A, X, A -> pattern: F L A X A? Not ending with LA? and L in position2, not position4.

""SPELA"" -> not common.

Perhaps we are missing something.

Another idea: maybe the secret word is ""ANIM L""? But that's 5 letters: A N I M L? Then pattern would be different.

But we know the word has A, I, L, and two others.

And we must avoid absent letters.

And it must have L at position4 and A at position5.

So let's try to fill positions 1,2,3.

We also heve to include I somewhere? In position1 or position2.

Let me propose a guess that has:
  Position 1: I (to test if it's there)
  Position 2: a new letter, say M
  Position 3: a new letter, say P
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: A

Word: I M P L A -> ""IMPLA"" -> not a valid word.

I and then G: ""IGLOA"" -> I G L O A -> but O absent, and pattern: position3 is L? No.

Position3 can't be L because we need position4 to be L.

Position3 must be a consonant between I and L.

""ISLWA"" -> not word.

""IDOLA"" -> O absent.

""INULA"" -> N and U absent.

""IXTLA"" -> X and T? T absent, and also not common.

""KAZLA"" -> not common.

 perhaps include a vowel in position3? For example, U is absent, O is absent, E is absent. Available vowels: A, I (but A is in position5) and we have position3 could be another vowel? like Y? or no vowel.

We can use Y, as in ""CARRY"", but not applicable.

Try: 
  Position 1: F, position2: I, position3: Y, position4: L, position5: A -> ""FIYLA"" -> not a word.

  G I Y L A -> ""GIYLA""  not a word.

Another: ""KILA"" is 4 letters.

The word we want is rare.

Perhaps our deduction that A must be in position5 is incorrect? What if the word has duplicate A's? For example, could it have A in a position we haven't tried and also in position5? We haven't tried position5 for A.

But we already ruled out position1,2,3 for A. The only position left for A is position5? Or position4, but position4 is L.

So deduction is correct.

So the word must end with * * * L A.

Now, we have to find valid English words of the form \w\w\w L A not using the absent letters.

Let's try:
  ""PIPLA"" -> P, I, P, L, A -> has I in position2? P in position1, I in position2? P in position3: so P? And not using absent? Available: P is allowed. But is ""PIPLA"" a word? I think not.

  ""PIPAL"" is a word: P I P A L -> then position4 is A? But we need position4 to be L and position5 to be A? So this is P I P A L -> position4: A, position5: L -> not matching.

We need position4: L, position5: A.

So must be ...L at fourth position and fifth A.

English words ending with "" LA "" / ""L A"" at last two positions.

Common ones: 
  ""paella"" -> 6 letters.
  ""fibula""-> 6.
  5-letter words: 
    ""koala"" -> as above, has issues. 
    ""villa"" -> we discussed.
    ""tacan"" -> no.
    ""scala""-> S is absent.
    ""tegla""-> not common.
    ""doula""-> O and U absent.
    ""novela""-> long.
    ""paglia""-> long.

I found: ""LILA"" is 4.

Another: ""YELLA"" -> but ""yella"" is not standard english? And has E and L at position3? Y E L L A -> position4 is L, position5 is A -> what about the feedback? 
  But E and one L? Pattern: Y E L L A. We can try to see.

But E is in the word? We know E is absent (from guess1). So invalid.

""JOWLA""-> J,O -> O absent.

""KETLA""-> not word.

""MATLA""-> not word.

 This is struggling.

 Perhaps we missed that in the first guess, A is ""present but wrong position"" so it must be in the word, and in the second guess, also ""present but wrong position"" so in the word, and now in the third guess, A is ""present but wrong position"" in position2. After trying positions 1,2,3 and they are wrong, and position4 is L, then A must be in position5.

 So we must find a word.

Let me try: ""BIFFA""-> not word.

""DIFFA""-> not.

Maybe include J: ""JIAYA""-> not.

Another idea: the word might be ""DAILY"" itself? But we already guessed? No, we guessed ""hails"", not ""daily"".

Let's recall secret word has A, I, L, and two other letters, L at position4, A at position5. And I in position1 or position2.

And the word is ending with LA.

Try: ""DEVIL"" not.

 What about ""QU A L A"" -> ""QUALA"" not word.

 Perhaps ""MAPLA"" not word.

We might try ""VISTA"" but S and T are out.

Or ""MIDST"" -> absent letters.

But we have to work with available letters.

Perhaps our deduction is wrong? Could A be in position4? But position4 is L! From hails. So that's fixed.

Unless there are two L's? For example, the secret word has L at position4 and also has another letter.

But we have L at position4 with ✓, so L is there. A cannot be at position4.

So only position5 for A.

Similarly, I must be at position1 or2.

 But I think we have to chose a guess even if the word is uncommon.

After research, I found that ""KYLIE"" doesn't match the pattern.

Back to available letters: for the first three positions, we need to choose letters from: D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And the word pattern: [letter] [maybe I] [letter] L A

Specifically: let's I in position1: then ? I ? L A -> available for position1 and position3: from the remaining letters.

For example: ""GIGLA"" not word.

""JIGGA"" -> J I G G A -> pattern J I G G A -> position3 is G, position4 is G? But we need position4 to be L and position5 A, so not.

We need precisely position4 as L.

""FIGLA"" not word.

""KITLA"" not word.

""PIELA"" not word.

""VILLA"" is the only common word I can think of, and it has two L's: V I L L A -> then position4 is L, position5 is A -> perfect pattern.

Checking the letters: 
  V: available (not absent)
  I: present
  L: at position4 (already known)
  L: at position3? -> this is the second L.
  A: at position5

Now, is ""VILLA"" a valid English word? Yes, it means a country house.

 But we have two L's: will that be a problem? In terms of letter try:

  We have not used L in position3 before. But from feedback from ""hails"", we got L in position4 which is correct. If we guess ""VILLA"", and the secret word has only one L (at position4), then:
    - V: if not in word, marked x.
    - I: if in word and in position2, marked? But we don't know I's position.
    - L in position3: marked x (because secret has only one L and it's at position4)
    - L in position4: ✓
    - A: in position5, which is correct, so ✓

But the secret word might have two L's? For example, ""VILLA"" itself, then:
    - V: ✓ if in position1
    - I: ✓ in position2
    - L in position3: - or ✓? Actually, if the secret is ""VILLA"", then position3 is L, so ✓
    - L in position4: ✓
    - A: ✓

But we don't know if the secret has two L's.

Also, note that in ""VILLA"", position3 is L, which we haven't tried before. In ""hails"", we only tried I in position3, not L.

In our deduction, there's no constraint that L cannot be in position3? But we know from the fixed position that L is at position4, but there could be another L elsewhere.

So we can guess ""VILLA"".

But we also must confirm I: in ""VILLA"", I is in position2. If the secret word has I in position2, it would be correct. If I is in position1, then our guess of I in position2 might be -.

Given the available options, ""VILLA"" is a valid guess.

The other option is to put I in position1. than in ""IVDLA"" no such word.

So guess: ""VILLA""

We know that V is new, I is at position2, L at position3 and L at position4, A at position5.

And we avoid absent letters.

So let's go with that.

<guess>villa</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (about)**: A is present but not in position 1.
- **Guess 3 (hails)**: 
  - A is present but not in position 2.
  - I is present but not in position 3.
  - L is in the **exact position 4** (✓).
  - H and S are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **L is fixed in position 4**.
- **A must be in position 5** since it cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (tested in attempts), and position 4 is occupied by L.
- **I is present** but not in position 3. With position 4 fixed and A in position 5, I must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, H, S.
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize confirming **A in position 5** and **I in position 1 or 2**.
- **Test new letters** to identify the remaining two slots (positions 1, 2, or 3).
- Choose a valid word matching the pattern `_ I _ L A` (if I is in position 2) or `I _ _ L A` (if I is in position 1).
- Strong candidate: **""VILLA""**:
  - Places I in position 2 (to test its location).
  - Places A in position 5 (as deduced).
  - Uses new unverified letter V in position 1 and L in position 3 (to explore potential duplicates or new letter L).",Guess 4: villa -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
