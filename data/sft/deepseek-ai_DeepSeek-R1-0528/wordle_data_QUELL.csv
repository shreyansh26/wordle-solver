We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's wrong position).

 Also, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we know E is in the word, we should try a word that includes E and other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have E and avoid the excluded letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can try to place E in a different position to see if we can find its correct location.

 Since E was at the 5th position and it was wrong, the correct position must be one of the first four.

 We also want to use other common letters that we haven't tested: such as S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's choose a word that:
 - Contains E (but not at the end)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N
 - Uses other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but it contains A (which is excluded) and T, S, L, E. But A is excluded, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A. So let's think of words without A, C, R, N.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" - but it has O, I, S, E. However, we don't know about O, I, S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" - but E is at the end again, and we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for E was (-) meaning it's in the word but not at the 5th position. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 We should try to put E in a different position: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 Let's try to put E at the 2nd position? Or 3rd? 

 We also want to test other vowels? We know A is out, so vowels left: E (we have), I, O, U.

 Since we have E, we can try to include I or O.

 How about ""TIMES""? But T is common. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's check: 
 T: not tested
 I: not tested
 M: not tested (but we used N and it was excluded, but M is different)
 E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at the end again? In ""TIMES"", E is at the end. We should avoid that.

 We need to put E not at the end.

 How about ""STEEL""? But it has two E's. We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters to get more information.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" - but that's 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L. E is at the 4th position. And it avoids A, C, R, N.

 But we don't know about S, P, I, L.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that E is present and not at the end. So in ""SPIEL"", E is at the 4th position, which is not the end? Actually, the positions are:

 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: E
 Position 5: L

 So E is at the 4th position, which is not the 5th. So that's acceptable.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Another idea: ""DOUSE"" - again E at the end, so avoid.

 How about ""BELIE""? That's 5 letters? B-E-L-I-E. But it has two E's. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at the 2nd and 5th. The 5th is the end, which we know is wrong for E, so the E at the 5th would be incorrect. But we have E at the 2nd too. However, the word might have only one E. So we might get confusing feedback.

 We want to avoid multiple same letters for now.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Common words: 
 - ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.
 - ""TOPIC"" -> C is excluded.

 How about ""QUOTE""? But we don't have Q and U, and it doesn't have E.

 We need E.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
 S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? 
 S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""OWLED""? Not common.

 How about ""PILED""? 
 P, I, L, E, D -> E at the 4th position. That's good.

 But we don't know about P, I, L, D.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E at the 4th.

 Or ""SHIED"": S, H, I, E, D.

 But let's choose a word that has more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""SMITE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRE""? But R is excluded (we had R in the first guess and it was x). So we cannot use R.

 We must remember: excluded letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

 How about ""WHILE""? 
 W, H, I, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""DEALT""? But A is excluded and we have A in the first guess and it was x. So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A, C, R, N and with E not at the end.

 Let me list: 
 - Position for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Words with E at position 1: 
   ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> no A, C, R, N.
   ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but O and W are less common? But we can try.

 Words with E at position 2:
   ""LEAST"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
   ""BEAST"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
   ""FEIST"" -> not common? But F, E, I, S, T -> no A, C, R, N.

 Words with E at position 3:
   ""CHEAP"" -> C and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""TREAD"" -> R and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""STEAM"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

 Words with E at position 4:
   ""SPIKE"" -> E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is K. So E is at 4, which is not the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So E at 4 is acceptable.

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> but E is at the 5th? Wait, no: 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? 
        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K
        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.

   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.

   How about ""SPIEL"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.

   Similarly, ""SHIED"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: H
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D

   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.

   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.

   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".

   Let's choose one that has common letters. 

   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 
   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it's not common.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.

   How about ""BELOW""? 
        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is also a possibility.

   We have several options: 
     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)
     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)
     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.
   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.
   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.

   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We don't have any information about the other positions.

   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.

   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.

   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""STEEL""? Two E's and E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That's valid. But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.

   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.

   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.

   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

   Let me decide: ""BELOW""

   B E L O W

   If we get feedback:
     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it's in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.

   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other vowels.

   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.

   ""BELOW"" has O.

   So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

   But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.

   So second guess: ""BELOW""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.

   Let me write the guess: below

   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn't know about position 1.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.

   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.

   But we don't know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.

   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven't used and also tests more common letters.

   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.

   We must include E.

   How about ""THEIR""? 
        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.

   How about ""THIEF""? 
        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is a valid word.

   But we are testing F, which is less common.

   How about ""SHINE""? 
        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.

   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:
     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)
     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.

   So let's go with ""SPIEL"".

   Guess: spiel

   Format: <guess>spiel</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) and position E in a new location (positions 1–4) to gather more information.

Selected ""**spiel**"" because:
- Places E in the **4th position** (a new location to test).
- Uses new high-frequency letters: S, P, I, L.
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D

   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.

   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.

   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".

   Let's choose one that has common letters. 

   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 
   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it's not common.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.

   How about ""BELOW""? 
        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is also a possibility.

   We have several options: 
     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)
     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)
     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.
   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.
   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.

   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We don't have any information about the other positions.

   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.

   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.

   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""STEEL""? Two E's and E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That's valid. But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.

   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.

   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.

   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

   Let me decide: ""BELOW""

   B E L O W

   If we get feedback:
     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it's in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.

   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other vowels.

   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.

   ""BELOW"" has O.

   So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

   But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.

   So second guess: ""BELOW""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.

   Let me write the guess: below

   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn't know about position 1.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.

   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.

   But we don't know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.

   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven't used and also tests more common letters.

   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.

   We must include E.

   How about ""THEIR""? 
        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.

   How about ""THIEF""? 
        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is a valid word.

   But we are testing F, which is less common.

   How about ""SHINE""? 
        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.

   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:
     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)
     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.

   So let's go with ""SPIEL"".

   Guess: spiel

- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's wrong position).

 Also, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we know E is in the word, we should try a word that includes E and other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have E and avoid the excluded letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can try to place E in a different position to see if we can find its correct location.

 Since E was at the 5th position and it was wrong, the correct position must be one of the first four.

 We also want to use other common letters that we haven't tested: such as S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's choose a word that:
 - Contains E (but not at the end)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N
 - Uses other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but it contains A (which is excluded) and T, S, L, E. But A is excluded, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A. So let's think of words without A, C, R, N.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" - but it has O, I, S, E. However, we don't know about O, I, S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" - but E is at the end again, and we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for E was (-) meaning it's in the word but not at the 5th position. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 We should try to put E in a different position: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 Let's try to put E at the 2nd position? Or 3rd? 

 We also want to test other vowels? We know A is out, so vowels left: E (we have), I, O, U.

 Since we have E, we can try to include I or O.

 How about ""TIMES""? But T is common. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's check: 
 T: not tested
 I: not tested
 M: not tested (but we used N and it was excluded, but M is different)
 E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at the end again? In ""TIMES"", E is at the end. We should avoid that.

 We need to put E not at the end.

 How about ""STEEL""? But it has two E's. We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters to get more information.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" - but that's 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L. E is at the 4th position. And it avoids A, C, R, N.

 But we don't know about S, P, I, L.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that E is present and not at the end. So in ""SPIEL"", E is at the 4th position, which is not the end? Actually, the positions are:

 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: E
 Position 5: L

 So E is at the 4th position, which is not the 5th. So that's acceptable.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Another idea: ""DOUSE"" - again E at the end, so avoid.

 How about ""BELIE""? That's 5 letters? B-E-L-I-E. But it has two E's. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at the 2nd and 5th. The 5th is the end, which we know is wrong for E, so the E at the 5th would be incorrect. But we have E at the 2nd too. However, the word might have only one E. So we might get confusing feedback.

 We want to avoid multiple same letters for now.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Common words: 
 - ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.
 - ""TOPIC"" -> C is excluded.

 How about ""QUOTE""? But we don't have Q and U, and it doesn't have E.

 We need E.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
 S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? 
 S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""OWLED""? Not common.

 How about ""PILED""? 
 P, I, L, E, D -> E at the 4th position. That's good.

 But we don't know about P, I, L, D.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E at the 4th.

 Or ""SHIED"": S, H, I, E, D.

 But let's choose a word that has more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""SMITE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRE""? But R is excluded (we had R in the first guess and it was x). So we cannot use R.

 We must remember: excluded letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

 How about ""WHILE""? 
 W, H, I, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""DEALT""? But A is excluded and we have A in the first guess and it was x. So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A, C, R, N and with E not at the end.

 Let me list: 
 - Position for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Words with E at position 1: 
   ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> no A, C, R, N.
   ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but O and W are less common? But we can try.

 Words with E at position 2:
   ""LEAST"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
   ""BEAST"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
   ""FEIST"" -> not common? But F, E, I, S, T -> no A, C, R, N.

 Words with E at position 3:
   ""CHEAP"" -> C and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""TREAD"" -> R and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""STEAM"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

 Words with E at position 4:
   ""SPIKE"" -> E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is K. So E is at 4, which is not the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So E at 4 is acceptable.

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> but E is at the 5th? Wait, no: 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? 
        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K
        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.

   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.

   How about ""SPIEL"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.

   Similarly, ""SHIED"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: H
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D

   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.

   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.

   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".

   Let's choose one that has common letters. 

   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 
   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it's not common.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.

   How about ""BELOW""? 
        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is also a possibility.

   We have several options: 
     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)
     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)
     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.
   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.
   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.

   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We don't have any information about the other positions.

   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.

   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.

   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""STEEL""? Two E's and E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That's valid. But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.

   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.

   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.

   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

   Let me decide: ""BELOW""

   B E L O W

   If we get feedback:
     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it's in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.

   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other vowels.

   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.

   ""BELOW"" has O.

   So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

   But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.

   So second guess: ""BELOW""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.

   Let me write the guess: below

   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn't know about position 1.

   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.

   But we don't know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.

   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven't used and also tests more common letters.

   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.

   We must include E.

   How about ""THEIR""? 
        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.

   How about ""THIEF""? 
        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is a valid word.

   But we are testing F, which is less common.

   How about ""SHINE""? 
        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.

   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:
     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)
     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.

Avoid.\n\n How about ""OWLED""? Not common.\n\n How about ""PILED""? \n P, I, L, E, D -> E at the 4th position. That\'s good.\n\n But we don\'t know about P, I, L, D.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E at the 4th.\n\n Or ""SHIED"": S, H, I, E, D.\n\n But let\'s choose a word that has more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: ""SMITE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.\n\n How about ""SHIRE""? But R is excluded (we had R in the first guess and it was x). So we cannot use R.\n\n We must remember: excluded letters: C, R, A, N.\n\n So we cannot use R.\n\n Therefore, ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.\n\n How about ""WHILE""? \n W, H, I, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.\n\n How about ""DEALT""? But A is excluded and we have A in the first guess and it was x. So we cannot use A.\n\n We need a word without A, C, R, N and with E not at the end.\n\n Let me list: \n - Position for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Words with E at position 1: \n   ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> no A, C, R, N.\n   ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but O and W are less common? But we can try.\n\n Words with E at position 2:\n   ""LEAST"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n   ""BEAST"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n   ""FEIST"" -> not common? But F, E, I, S, T -> no A, C, R, N.\n\n Words with E at position 3:\n   ""CHEAP"" -> C and A excluded -> invalid.\n   ""TREAD"" -> R and A excluded -> invalid.\n   ""STEAM"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n Words with E at position 4:\n   ""SPIKE"" -> E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is K. So E is at 4, which is not the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So E at 4 is acceptable.\n\n   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> but E is at the 5th? Wait, no: \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? \n        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:\n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: K\n        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.\n\n   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.\n\n   How about ""SPIEL"": \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   Similarly, ""SHIED"": \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: H\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: D\n\n   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.\n\n   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.\n\n   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".\n\n   Let\'s choose one that has common letters. \n\n   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. \n   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.\n\n   Both are valid.\n\n   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it\'s not common.\n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.\n\n   How about ""BELOW""? \n        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.\n\n   This is also a possibility.\n\n   We have several options: \n     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)\n     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)\n     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)\n\n   We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.\n   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.\n   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.\n\n   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.\n\n   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.\n\n   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the other positions.\n\n   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.\n\n   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.\n\n   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""STEEL""? Two E\'s and E at the end -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That\'s valid. But we don\'t know about S, T, U, P.\n\n   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.\n\n   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.\n\n   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.\n\n   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\n   Let me decide: ""BELOW""\n\n   B E L O W\n\n   If we get feedback:\n     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it\'s in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other vowels.\n\n   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.\n\n   ""BELOW"" has O.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n   But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.\n\n   So second guess: ""BELOW""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.\n\n   Let me write the guess: below\n\n   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn\'t know about position 1.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.\n\n   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.\n\n   But we don\'t know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.\n\n   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven\'t used and also tests more common letters.\n\n   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n   We must include E.\n\n   How about ""THEIR""? \n        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.\n\n   How about ""THIEF""? \n        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.\n\n   This is a valid word.\n\n   But we are testing F, which is less common.\n\n   How about ""SHINE""? \n        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.\n\n   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.\n\n   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:\n     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)\n     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""SPIEL"".\n\n   Guess: spiel\n\n   Format: <guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) and position E in a new location (positions 1–4) to gather more information.\n\nSelected ""**spiel**"" because:\n- Places E in the **4th position** (a new location to test).\n- Uses new high-frequency letters: S, P, I, L.\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
Meaning: S, P, I are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we placed it at position 4 and got '-'). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""spiel"", L is the 5th letter).

So, from the feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I
- Confirmed letters: E (present, but not in position 4 or 5) and L (present and in position 5)

Since L is in position 5, we know the secret word ends with L.

E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5. Since we have only 5 positions, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Ends with L (because position 5 is fixed as L) — actually, no, we don't have to, but we can use this to our advantage. However, we are not required to put L at the end in the guess because we are still exploring. But note: the feedback for L in guess 2 was a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position (position 5). So in the secret word, the fifth letter is definitely L.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can fix the fifth letter as L to save a spot, but we don't have to. However, if we fix the fifth letter, we can focus on the first four.

But we also need to find the position of E and the other letters.

We have to include E and L. Since L is fixed at the end, we only need to place E in one of the first three positions.

We also need to test new letters.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L (but E and L are in the word, the others are not). So we should avoid C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

Common letters left: T, O, U, D, M, H, G, B, Y, etc.

We know the word has E and L (with L at the end). So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ L

And E is in one of the first three positions.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters.

Possible words:

- E at position 1: e.g., ""E? ? ? L"" -> words like ""EXCEL"" but C is excluded -> invalid. Or ""EAGLE"" but A and E (A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  We need without A, C, R, N, S, P, I.

  How about ""EIGHT"" -> but H and G are allowed? But ""EIGHT"" ends with T, not L. We need to end with L.

  So we need words ending with L and starting with E? But we don't know if E is at position 1.

  Let's think of words ending with L that have E in position 1, 2, or 3.

  Examples:
    Position 1: ""EXCEL"" (invalid due to C), ""EASEL"" (A and S excluded), ""EERIE"" (not ending with L) -> not working.

    Position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but double L? And we have L at the end, but in ""HELLO"", the L is at position 4 and 5? Actually: H-E-L-L-O -> not ending with L? It ends with O. We need ending with L.

    How about ""BELL"" -> too short.

    We need 5 letters: _ _ _ _ L

    With E at position 2: ? E ? ? L

    Examples: ""LEVEL"" -> but V and E, and also E at position 1 and 3? But we don't know about V. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, I. V is allowed.

    But ""LEVEL"": 
        Position 1: L -> but we already have L at the end, and if L is at position 1, that's allowed? But we don't know if L is at position 1. Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only one? We don't know if there are multiple E's.

    Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had one E and it was not at the end, and in ""spiel"" we had one E and it was not at the 4th. But it could be that the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the count, only that E is present. So it could have more than one.

    However, to keep it simple, let's assume we are looking for words with E and L (with L at the end) and without the excluded letters.

    Words with E at position 2 and ending with L: 
        ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> but J is not very common, and two E's? 
        ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> two E's and two L's? 

    But we don't know if the word has multiple letters.

    Alternatively, E at position 3: ? ? E ? L

    Examples: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait: 
        H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at position 4. But we already know from guess 2 that E is not at position 4 (because in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got '-'). So E cannot be at position 4.

    Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 3, but we just saw that position 4 is not allowed (from guess 2). And position 5 is L, so E cannot be at 5. So positions 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.

    But we also learned from guess 1 that E is not at position 5 (which we already knew) and from guess 2 that E is not at position 4.

    So E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

    Now, for the word ""HOTEL"", if we consider it, E is at position 4, which we now know is impossible. So we cannot use that.

    How about E at position 3: 
        Example: ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at position 4? 
        M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5) -> again E at 4 -> invalid.

    We need E at position 3: meaning the third letter is E.

    So pattern: _ _ E _ L

    Examples: 
        ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> two E's? 
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at the end and also at position 4? And Q and U are less common.

    How about ""HOTEL"" is not because E is at 4.

    Another example: ""LABEL"" -> but L is at position 1 and 5? And A is excluded.

    How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.

    We need words ending with L and having E at position 3.

    Let me think: 
        ""REBEL"" -> R is excluded.
        ""LEVEL"" -> E at position 2 and 4? 
            L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at 2 and 4. But we don't know if E is at 4? We know E is not at 4 from guess 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E (because in ""spiel"", we put E at 4 and it was marked as '-', meaning E is not at 4). So in ""LEVEL"", if we put it, the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct? But we are not sure.

        However, we are making a guess to test, so we can use ""LEVEL"" to test multiple things? But it has two E's and two L's.

    Alternatively, let's find a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, ends with L, and uses only available letters.

    Since we are struggling, let's list possible words:

    E at 1: 
        E _ _ _ L
        Examples: 
          ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXILE"" -> X and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""EMAIL"" -> A and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELBOW"" -> but ends with W, not L -> invalid.
          ""ENDED"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""EQUAL"" -> Q, U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

        It's hard. Maybe E at 1 is not common with L at the end without the excluded letters.

    E at 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L at 1 and 5, E at 2 and 4 -> but E at 4 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 4), so if the word has E at 4, it would be wrong. But in ""LEVEL"", there is an E at 2 and at 4. We don't know if the word has two E's. But we can try it? 
          However, we are avoiding excluded letters: L is allowed (we know it's in the word), V is not excluded. So ""LEVEL"" is a candidate? But we have to consider that the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct.

          But note: the feedback for E in the secret word: we only know there is at least one E. It could be that the word has two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we know from guess 2 that position 4 is not E. So the E at position 4 in ""LEVEL"" would be marked as '-' (if the word has an E at 4) or 'x' (if not). But we know the secret word does not have E at 4, so if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at 4 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not present? But wait, if the word has two E's, one at 2 and one at 4, then the E at 4 would be present but in the wrong position? No, because we know E is not at position 4, so the secret word cannot have E at 4. Therefore, if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at position 4 would be an extra E that is not in the word? Or if the word has only one E (at position 2), then the E at 4 would be incorrect.

          Actually, the feedback for ""spiel"" told us that the letter E in position 4 is not the correct position for E. It does not tell us that there is no E at position 4 in the secret word? It tells us that the secret word has E, but not at position 4. So the secret word has E in some other position, but it might have another E? We don't know.

          However, to avoid complexity, let's try to find a word with only one E.

    E at 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""HOTEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""WHEEL"" -> E at 3 and 4? W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed -> so if we use it, the E at 4 would be wrong.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5? 
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> E at 4 is not allowed.

        How about ""METAL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""BETEL"" -> E at 2? B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.

        ""OCTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""DUTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.

        It's difficult.

    After re-examining, I recall that we don't necessarily have to fix the L at the end in our guess. We can try a word that doesn't have L at the end to test other positions for E and other letters. But we know L is at position 5, so if we don't put L at the end, we might get feedback on L again? But we already know L is at position 5, so if we put L in a different position, it would be marked as '-' (if it's present but wrong position) or 'x' (if not present, but we know it is present so it would be '-').

    However, to maximize information, we might want to test more letters without fixing the known L.

    We know:
      - The secret word has E and L (with L at position 5).
      - E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
      - Excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    We can try a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also has L but not at the end (so we can test where L is not, but we already know it's at 5, so putting it elsewhere would be a minus). And we can test other new letters.

    For example, we can try ""BELOW"" again? But we didn't try it before. But ""BELOW"" has E at position 2 and ends with W, not L. And we know L is at position 5, so we can't put L at 5 in this guess? We can, but we are not required to.

    How about ""TABLE""? But A is excluded.

    How about ""LATHE""? But A excluded.

    How about ""TOWEL""? 
        T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4. So that would be a bad choice.

    How about ""DWELL""? 
        D, W, E, L, L -> E at position 3, and L at 4 and 5. But we know L is at position 5, so the L at 4 would be a minus? And we are testing D, W.

    But ""DWELL"" has two L's, which is acceptable.

    However, we are not sure about the position of E: we are putting it at 3, which is a possibility.

    But we also have to avoid the excluded letters.

    Another idea: ""MOTEL"" -> M, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    How about ""HOTEL"" -> same.

    Let's try to find a word with E at position 1: 
        ""LEAVE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEPER"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEGAL"" -> A and G? A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEMEL"" -> not a word.

    E at position 2:
        ""WEIGH"" -> not ending with L, and no L -> but we know L is in the word, so we should include L? Not necessarily, but if we don't include L, we will get feedback that L is present (but not in the word we guessed) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about the position of L.

    We know L is at position 5, so we can focus on the first four letters.

    Let me think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also include other common letters, and avoid the excluded ones.

    We can try ""FIGHT"" -> but no E and no L.

    We must include E because we are trying to find its position.

    How about ""LIGHT""? -> no E.

    We must include E.

    How about ""THEFT"" -> no L.

    We are not required to include L in the guess, but we know L is in the word, so if we don't include it, we'll get a '-' for L in the feedback? No, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. If we don't guess L, we won't get feedback on L. But we already know L is at position 5, so it's not critical to include it.

    However, to make progress on the other letters, we can guess a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and doesn't include L.

    For example, ""THEFT"": 
        T, H, E, F, T -> E at position 3. 
        But it has two T's? And no L. 
        We can use this to test T, H, F.

    But then we won't get information about the other letters in the secret word.

    Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" -> no E.

    How about ""DOZEN"" -> N excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""BOXED"" -> no L, and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be '-', but we already know that.

    Let's choose a word with E at position 1: 
        ""EVERY"" -> E, V, E, R, Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBER"" -> E, M, B, E, R -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> no R, no A, no C, no S, no P, no I, no N. And R is excluded, so this is valid? 
        ""EMBED"": E at 1 and 4? But we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so the E at position 4 in ""EMBED"" would be a problem.

        However, we are guessing to test. The secret word has E, but not at 4 or 5. So if we guess ""EMBED"", the E at 1 might be correct or not, and the E at 4 will be marked as '-' or 'x'? Since the secret word has E but not at 4, the E at 4 in the guess will be marked as '-' only if there is another occurrence of E that is not at 4? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know the word has at least one E, but it might have two.

        This is getting complicated.

    Given the complexity, let's go back to the known information and try to list possible words.

    The secret word: 
        Position 5: L
        Contains E (not at 4 or 5, so at 1, 2, or 3)
        Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I

    So the word is in the form: 
        [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]L

    With letter1, letter2, or letter3 being E.

    And letter4 is not E (because E is not at 4).

    And the letters are from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    Common letters left: B, D, E, G, H, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

    We can try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses common letters.

    For example, with E at position 1:
        E _ _ _ L
        Possible words: 
          ""EQUAL"" -> Q and A -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EVERY"" -> V, E, R, Y -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXCEL"" -> X, C -> C excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXPEL"" -> X, P -> P excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A, S -> both excluded -> invalid.
          ""EAGLE"" -> A, G -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EDGEL"" -> not a word.
          ""EIGHT"" -> I, G, H, T -> I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we have L at position 2 and 5? And E at 1 and 5? But position 5 is L, not E. And we have two E's? 
          ""ELUDE"": positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:U, 4:D, 5:E -> but we need position 5 to be L, so not.

        I can't find a common word with E at 1 and ending with L without the excluded letters.

    E at position 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5, and E at 2 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed, so this word would have E at 4 which is invalid for the secret word. So ""LEVEL"" cannot be the secret word because it has E at position 4, which we know is not allowed.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.
          ""BETEL"" -> B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> invalid.
          ""REBEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> Y, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""NEWEL"" -> N, E, W, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

        How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded -> invalid.
        "" pencil"" -> not 5 letters.

        It's hard.

    E at position 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4 -> E at 4 not allowed.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and L at 4 and 5. This is a word. And it doesn't use excluded letters? Q, U, E, L, L. Q and U are allowed (not excluded). 
          ""QUELl"" is a word (a crosspiece in a window frame or a verb meaning to die down).

          But let's check: positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> so E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5. 
          But we know that in the secret word, position 5 is L, and position 4 is not E (which is satisfied because position 4 is L, not E). 
          However, we have L at position 4, which might be correct or not? We don't know about position 4 yet.

          The secret word has L only at position 5? Or could it have L at position 4 as well? We don't know.

          ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.

          Another example: ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> positions: 1:D, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> E at 3.

          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""CREEL"" -> C and R excluded -> invalid.

          "" kneel"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.

          ""SPIEL"" -> already guessed.

        So possible words: ""QUELL"", ""DWELL"", and perhaps others.

        "" hotel"" -> not.

        "" motel"" -> not.

        "" barrel"" -> not 5 letters.

        So among these, ""DWELL"" uses more common letters than ""QUELL"".

    Given the above, we can try ""DWELL"" as the next guess.

    But note: ""DWELL"" has two L's. We know L is at position 5, but it might also be at position 4? We don't know.

    If we guess ""DWELL"", the feedback might be:

        D: ? 
        W: ?
        E: ? (at position 3)
        L: at position 4 and 5.

    We know position 5 is L, so that will be ✓.
    Position 4 is L: if the secret word has L at position 4, then it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be '-' or 'x'? But if the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 in the guess would be '-' (because L is in the word but not at position 4) or 'x' if there is only one L and it's at 5? 

    According to Wordle rules, if there is only one L in the secret word, and we guess two L's, then one of them will be ✓ (if in the correct position) and the other will be 'x' (because there's only one). But if there are two L's, then both could be ✓ or one ✓ and one '-'.

    We don't know if there is more than one L.

    Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and doesn't have L at position 4, to avoid confusion.

    How about "" power"" -> not 5 letters ending with L.

    Another word: ""Hovel"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L -> but E at position 4 is not allowed, so invalid for our guess because we know E is not at 4.

    How about "" rowel"" -> R excluded.

    "" towel"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" vowel"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" dowel"" -> D, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    So it's hard to avoid.

    Perhaps ""DWELL"" is a reasonable guess.

    Or ""QUELL"".

    Let's choose ""DWELL"" because it uses more common letters.

    Guess: dwell

    But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L's.

    Another possibility: ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.

    After careful thought, I recall that we have not used T, O, H, M, U, etc.

    How about we try a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, and includes T, O, H, and also includes L at position 5? 

    For example, "" hotel"" is not.

    How about "" moth"" -> not 5 letters.

    Let's try to construct: 
        We want: _ _ _ _ L, with one of the first three being E, and the fourth not E.

        With common letters: say, T, O, H.

        For example, if E at 1: ""TE? ? L"" -> ""tepal"" -> not common, and A.
                       ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.

        E at 2: ""? E? ? L"" -> ""METAL"" -> A excluded.
                 "" method"" -> not 5 letters.

        E at 3: ""??E?L"" -> ""THEWL"" -> not a common word.
                 ""TOKEN"" -> not ending with L.

        "" model"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    Given the difficulty, I think we should guess ""DWELL"" or ""QUELL"". Let's choose ""DWELL"".

    But we have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are at try 3.

    Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't end with L but has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and also includes L in a different position to see if there is another L.

    For example, ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2, L at position 3.

    This way, we can test:
        B, E, L, O, W.
        We know L is in the word, but if we put it at position 3, and the secret word has L only at position 5, then L will be marked as '-' (present but not at 3).
        E at position 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, it will be '?', or if not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so it will be '-' if not at 2, or '✓' if at 2.

    This might give us information about the position of E and also test B, O, W.

    So let's consider ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    This guess: 
        B at 1, E at 2, L at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

    We know that in the secret word:
        - L is at position 5, so W at 5 will be 'x' (because it's not L) and L at position 3 will be '-' (because L is in the word but not at 3, since it's at 5).
        - E at 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, then '✓', else '-'.
        - B and O: we don't know.

    But we can get information about B and O.

    So this guess might be informative.

    Let's compare with ""DWELL"":

        ""DWELL"": tests D, W, E, L (at 4 and 5). We know L at 5 will be '✓', and L at 4 will be 'x' or '-' or '✓' (if there is L at 4). E at 3 will be '✓' if E is at 3, else '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 3, then '-'.

    Both are valid.

    I think ""BELOW"" is better because it tests more new letters (B, O, W) and doesn't repeat L, so less ambiguity.

    So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    Format: <guess>below</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at position 4 or 5** (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, N, S, P, I.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., B, O, W, D, T) to gather more information.
- Since L is confirmed at position 5, the guess does not need to end with L, but placing L elsewhere can provide positional feedback.

Selected **""below""** because:
- Places **E at position 2** (testing a new position for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **B, O, W**.
- Includes **L at position 3** to check if it appears elsewhere (though we know it must be at position 5, this may reveal if there are multiple L's).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

<guess>below</guess>",below,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
Meaning: S, P, I are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we placed it at position 4 and got '-'). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""spiel"", L is the 5th letter).

So, from the feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I
- Confirmed letters: E (present, but not in position 4 or 5) and L (present and in position 5)

Since L is in position 5, we know the secret word ends with L.

E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5. Since we have only 5 positions, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Ends with L (because position 5 is fixed as L) — actually, no, we don't have to, but we can use this to our advantage. However, we are not required to put L at the end in the guess because we are still exploring. But note: the feedback for L in guess 2 was a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position (position 5). So in the secret word, the fifth letter is definitely L.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can fix the fifth letter as L to save a spot, but we don't have to. However, if we fix the fifth letter, we can focus on the first four.

But we also need to find the position of E and the other letters.

We have to include E and L. Since L is fixed at the end, we only need to place E in one of the first three positions.

We also need to test new letters.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L (but E and L are in the word, the others are not). So we should avoid C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

Common letters left: T, O, U, D, M, H, G, B, Y, etc.

We know the word has E and L (with L at the end). So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ L

And E is in one of the first three positions.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters.

Possible words:

- E at position 1: e.g., ""E? ? ? L"" -> words like ""EXCEL"" but C is excluded -> invalid. Or ""EAGLE"" but A and E (A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  We need without A, C, R, N, S, P, I.

  How about ""EIGHT"" -> but H and G are allowed? But ""EIGHT"" ends with T, not L. We need to end with L.

  So we need words ending with L and starting with E? But we don't know if E is at position 1.

  Let's think of words ending with L that have E in position 1, 2, or 3.

  Examples:
    Position 1: ""EXCEL"" (invalid due to C), ""EASEL"" (A and S excluded), ""EERIE"" (not ending with L) -> not working.

    Position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but double L? And we have L at the end, but in ""HELLO"", the L is at position 4 and 5? Actually: H-E-L-L-O -> not ending with L? It ends with O. We need ending with L.

    How about ""BELL"" -> too short.

    We need 5 letters: _ _ _ _ L

    With E at position 2: ? E ? ? L

    Examples: ""LEVEL"" -> but V and E, and also E at position 1 and 3? But we don't know about V. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, I. V is allowed.

    But ""LEVEL"": 
        Position 1: L -> but we already have L at the end, and if L is at position 1, that's allowed? But we don't know if L is at position 1. Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only one? We don't know if there are multiple E's.

    Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had one E and it was not at the end, and in ""spiel"" we had one E and it was not at the 4th. But it could be that the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the count, only that E is present. So it could have more than one.

    However, to keep it simple, let's assume we are looking for words with E and L (with L at the end) and without the excluded letters.

    Words with E at position 2 and ending with L: 
        ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> but J is not very common, and two E's? 
        ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> two E's and two L's? 

    But we don't know if the word has multiple letters.

    Alternatively, E at position 3: ? ? E ? L

    Examples: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait: 
        H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at position 4. But we already know from guess 2 that E is not at position 4 (because in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got '-'). So E cannot be at position 4.

    Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 3, but we just saw that position 4 is not allowed (from guess 2). And position 5 is L, so E cannot be at 5. So positions 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.

    But we also learned from guess 1 that E is not at position 5 (which we already knew) and from guess 2 that E is not at position 4.

    So E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

    Now, for the word ""HOTEL"", if we consider it, E is at position 4, which we now know is impossible. So we cannot use that.

    How about E at position 3: 
        Example: ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at position 4? 
        M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5) -> again E at 4 -> invalid.

    We need E at position 3: meaning the third letter is E.

    So pattern: _ _ E _ L

    Examples: 
        ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> two E's? 
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at the end and also at position 4? And Q and U are less common.

    How about ""HOTEL"" is not because E is at 4.

    Another example: ""LABEL"" -> but L is at position 1 and 5? And A is excluded.

    How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.

    We need words ending with L and having E at position 3.

    Let me think: 
        ""REBEL"" -> R is excluded.
        ""LEVEL"" -> E at position 2 and 4? 
            L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at 2 and 4. But we don't know if E is at 4? We know E is not at 4 from guess 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E (because in ""spiel"", we put E at 4 and it was marked as '-', meaning E is not at 4). So in ""LEVEL"", if we put it, the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct? But we are not sure.

        However, we are making a guess to test, so we can use ""LEVEL"" to test multiple things? But it has two E's and two L's.

    Alternatively, let's find a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, ends with L, and uses only available letters.

    Since we are struggling, let's list possible words:

    E at 1: 
        E _ _ _ L
        Examples: 
          ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXILE"" -> X and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""EMAIL"" -> A and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELBOW"" -> but ends with W, not L -> invalid.
          ""ENDED"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""EQUAL"" -> Q, U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

        It's hard. Maybe E at 1 is not common with L at the end without the excluded letters.

    E at 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L at 1 and 5, E at 2 and 4 -> but E at 4 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 4), so if the word has E at 4, it would be wrong. But in ""LEVEL"", there is an E at 2 and at 4. We don't know if the word has two E's. But we can try it? 
          However, we are avoiding excluded letters: L is allowed (we know it's in the word), V is not excluded. So ""LEVEL"" is a candidate? But we have to consider that the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct.

          But note: the feedback for E in the secret word: we only know there is at least one E. It could be that the word has two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we know from guess 2 that position 4 is not E. So the E at position 4 in ""LEVEL"" would be marked as '-' (if the word has an E at 4) or 'x' (if not). But we know the secret word does not have E at 4, so if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at 4 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not present? But wait, if the word has two E's, one at 2 and one at 4, then the E at 4 would be present but in the wrong position? No, because we know E is not at position 4, so the secret word cannot have E at 4. Therefore, if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at position 4 would be an extra E that is not in the word? Or if the word has only one E (at position 2), then the E at 4 would be incorrect.

          Actually, the feedback for ""spiel"" told us that the letter E in position 4 is not the correct position for E. It does not tell us that there is no E at position 4 in the secret word? It tells us that the secret word has E, but not at position 4. So the secret word has E in some other position, but it might have another E? We don't know.

          However, to avoid complexity, let's try to find a word with only one E.

    E at 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""HOTEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""WHEEL"" -> E at 3 and 4? W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed -> so if we use it, the E at 4 would be wrong.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5? 
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> E at 4 is not allowed.

        How about ""METAL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""BETEL"" -> E at 2? B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.

        ""OCTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""DUTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.

        It's difficult.

    After re-examining, I recall that we don't necessarily have to fix the L at the end in our guess. We can try a word that doesn't have L at the end to test other positions for E and other letters. But we know L is at position 5, so if we don't put L at the end, we might get feedback on L again? But we already know L is at position 5, so if we put L in a different position, it would be marked as '-' (if it's present but wrong position) or 'x' (if not present, but we know it is present so it would be '-').

    However, to maximize information, we might want to test more letters without fixing the known L.

    We know:
      - The secret word has E and L (with L at position 5).
      - E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
      - Excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    We can try a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also has L but not at the end (so we can test where L is not, but we already know it's at 5, so putting it elsewhere would be a minus). And we can test other new letters.

    For example, we can try ""BELOW"" again? But we didn't try it before. But ""BELOW"" has E at position 2 and ends with W, not L. And we know L is at position 5, so we can't put L at 5 in this guess? We can, but we are not required to.

    How about ""TABLE""? But A is excluded.

    How about ""LATHE""? But A excluded.

    How about ""TOWEL""? 
        T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4. So that would be a bad choice.

    How about ""DWELL""? 
        D, W, E, L, L -> E at position 3, and L at 4 and 5. But we know L is at position 5, so the L at 4 would be a minus? And we are testing D, W.

    But ""DWELL"" has two L's, which is acceptable.

    However, we are not sure about the position of E: we are putting it at 3, which is a possibility.

    But we also have to avoid the excluded letters.

    Another idea: ""MOTEL"" -> M, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    How about ""HOTEL"" -> same.

    Let's try to find a word with E at position 1: 
        ""LEAVE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEPER"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEGAL"" -> A and G? A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEMEL"" -> not a word.

    E at position 2:
        ""WEIGH"" -> not ending with L, and no L -> but we know L is in the word, so we should include L? Not necessarily, but if we don't include L, we will get feedback that L is present (but not in the word we guessed) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about the position of L.

    We know L is at position 5, so we can focus on the first four letters.

    Let me think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also include other common letters, and avoid the excluded ones.

    We can try ""FIGHT"" -> but no E and no L.

    We must include E because we are trying to find its position.

    How about ""LIGHT""? -> no E.

    We must include E.

    How about ""THEFT"" -> no L.

    We are not required to include L in the guess, but we know L is in the word, so if we don't include it, we'll get a '-' for L in the feedback? No, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. If we don't guess L, we won't get feedback on L. But we already know L is at position 5, so it's not critical to include it.

    However, to make progress on the other letters, we can guess a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and doesn't include L.

    For example, ""THEFT"": 
        T, H, E, F, T -> E at position 3. 
        But it has two T's? And no L. 
        We can use this to test T, H, F.

    But then we won't get information about the other letters in the secret word.

    Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" -> no E.

    How about ""DOZEN"" -> N excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""BOXED"" -> no L, and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be '-', but we already know that.

    Let's choose a word with E at position 1: 
        ""EVERY"" -> E, V, E, R, Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBER"" -> E, M, B, E, R -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> no R, no A, no C, no S, no P, no I, no N. And R is excluded, so this is valid? 
        ""EMBED"": E at 1 and 4? But we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so the E at position 4 in ""EMBED"" would be a problem.

        However, we are guessing to test. The secret word has E, but not at 4 or 5. So if we guess ""EMBED"", the E at 1 might be correct or not, and the E at 4 will be marked as '-' or 'x'? Since the secret word has E but not at 4, the E at 4 in the guess will be marked as '-' only if there is another occurrence of E that is not at 4? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know the word has at least one E, but it might have two.

        This is getting complicated.

    Given the complexity, let's go back to the known information and try to list possible words.

    The secret word: 
        Position 5: L
        Contains E (not at 4 or 5, so at 1, 2, or 3)
        Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I

    So the word is in the form: 
        [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]L

    With letter1, letter2, or letter3 being E.

    And letter4 is not E (because E is not at 4).

    And the letters are from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    Common letters left: B, D, E, G, H, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

    We can try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses common letters.

    For example, with E at position 1:
        E _ _ _ L
        Possible words: 
          ""EQUAL"" -> Q and A -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EVERY"" -> V, E, R, Y -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXCEL"" -> X, C -> C excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXPEL"" -> X, P -> P excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A, S -> both excluded -> invalid.
          ""EAGLE"" -> A, G -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EDGEL"" -> not a word.
          ""EIGHT"" -> I, G, H, T -> I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we have L at position 2 and 5? And E at 1 and 5? But position 5 is L, not E. And we have two E's? 
          ""ELUDE"": positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:U, 4:D, 5:E -> but we need position 5 to be L, so not.

        I can't find a common word with E at 1 and ending with L without the excluded letters.

    E at position 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5, and E at 2 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed, so this word would have E at 4 which is invalid for the secret word. So ""LEVEL"" cannot be the secret word because it has E at position 4, which we know is not allowed.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.
          ""BETEL"" -> B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> invalid.
          ""REBEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> Y, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""NEWEL"" -> N, E, W, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

        How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded -> invalid.
        "" pencil"" -> not 5 letters.

        It's hard.

    E at position 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4 -> E at 4 not allowed.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and L at 4 and 5. This is a word. And it doesn't use excluded letters? Q, U, E, L, L. Q and U are allowed (not excluded). 
          ""QUELl"" is a word (a crosspiece in a window frame or a verb meaning to die down).

          But let's check: positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> so E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5. 
          But we know that in the secret word, position 5 is L, and position 4 is not E (which is satisfied because position 4 is L, not E). 
          However, we have L at position 4, which might be correct or not? We don't know about position 4 yet.

          The secret word has L only at position 5? Or could it have L at position 4 as well? We don't know.

          ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.

          Another example: ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> positions: 1:D, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> E at 3.

          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""CREEL"" -> C and R excluded -> invalid.

          "" kneel"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.

          ""SPIEL"" -> already guessed.

        So possible words: ""QUELL"", ""DWELL"", and perhaps others.

        "" hotel"" -> not.

        "" motel"" -> not.

        "" barrel"" -> not 5 letters.

        So among these, ""DWELL"" uses more common letters than ""QUELL"".

    Given the above, we can try ""DWELL"" as the next guess.

    But note: ""DWELL"" has two L's. We know L is at position 5, but it might also be at position 4? We don't know.

    If we guess ""DWELL"", the feedback might be:

        D: ? 
        W: ?
        E: ? (at position 3)
        L: at position 4 and 5.

    We know position 5 is L, so that will be ✓.
    Position 4 is L: if the secret word has L at position 4, then it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be '-' or 'x'? But if the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 in the guess would be '-' (because L is in the word but not at position 4) or 'x' if there is only one L and it's at 5? 

    According to Wordle rules, if there is only one L in the secret word, and we guess two L's, then one of them will be ✓ (if in the correct position) and the other will be 'x' (because there's only one). But if there are two L's, then both could be ✓ or one ✓ and one '-'.

    We don't know if there is more than one L.

    Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and doesn't have L at position 4, to avoid confusion.

    How about "" power"" -> not 5 letters ending with L.

    Another word: ""Hovel"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L -> but E at position 4 is not allowed, so invalid for our guess because we know E is not at 4.

    How about "" rowel"" -> R excluded.

    "" towel"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" vowel"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" dowel"" -> D, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    So it's hard to avoid.

    Perhaps ""DWELL"" is a reasonable guess.

    Or ""QUELL"".

    Let's choose ""DWELL"" because it uses more common letters.

    Guess: dwell

    But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L's.

    Another possibility: ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.

    After careful thought, I recall that we have not used T, O, H, M, U, etc.

    How about we try a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, and includes T, O, H, and also includes L at position 5? 

    For example, "" hotel"" is not.

    How about "" moth"" -> not 5 letters.

    Let's try to construct: 
        We want: _ _ _ _ L, with one of the first three being E, and the fourth not E.

        With common letters: say, T, O, H.

        For example, if E at 1: ""TE? ? L"" -> ""tepal"" -> not common, and A.
                       ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.

        E at 2: ""? E? ? L"" -> ""METAL"" -> A excluded.
                 "" method"" -> not 5 letters.

        E at 3: ""??E?L"" -> ""THEWL"" -> not a common word.
                 ""TOKEN"" -> not ending with L.

        "" model"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    Given the difficulty, I think we should guess ""DWELL"" or ""QUELL"". Let's choose ""DWELL"".

    But we have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are at try 3.

    Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't end with L but has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and also includes L in a different position to see if there is another L.

    For example, ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2, L at position 3.

    This way, we can test:
        B, E, L, O, W.
        We know L is in the word, but if we put it at position 3, and the secret word has L only at position 5, then L will be marked as '-' (present but not at 3).
        E at position 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, it will be '?', or if not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so it will be '-' if not at 2, or '✓' if at 2.

    This might give us information about the position of E and also test B, O, W.

    So let's consider ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    This guess: 
        B at 1, E at 2, L at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

    We know that in the secret word:
        - L is at position 5, so W at 5 will be 'x' (because it's not L) and L at position 3 will be '-' (because L is in the word but not at 3, since it's at 5).
        - E at 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, then '✓', else '-'.
        - B and O: we don't know.

    But we can get information about B and O.

    So this guess might be informative.

    Let's compare with ""DWELL"":

        ""DWELL"": tests D, W, E, L (at 4 and 5). We know L at 5 will be '✓', and L at 4 will be 'x' or '-' or '✓' (if there is L at 4). E at 3 will be '✓' if E is at 3, else '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 3, then '-'.

    Both are valid.

    I think ""BELOW"" is better because it tests more new letters (B, O, W) and doesn't repeat L, so less ambiguity.

    So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    Format: <guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at position 4 or 5** (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, N, S, P, I.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., B, O, W, D, T) to gather more information.
- Since L is confirmed at position 5, the guess does not need to end with L, but placing L elsewhere can provide positional feedback.

Selected **""below""** because:
- Places **E at position 2** (testing a new position for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **B, O, W**.
- Includes **L at position 3** to check if it appears elsewhere (though we know it must be at position 5, this may reveal if there are multiple L's).
- Avoids all excluded letters.",Guess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x),FAIL

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's wrong position).

 Also, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we know E is in the word, we should try a word that includes E and other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have E and avoid the excluded letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can try to place E in a different position to see if we can find its correct location.

 Since E was at the 5th position and it was wrong, the correct position must be one of the first four.

 We also want to use other common letters that we haven't tested: such as S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's choose a word that:
 - Contains E (but not at the end)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N
 - Uses other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but it contains A (which is excluded) and T, S, L, E. But A is excluded, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A. So let's think of words without A, C, R, N.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" - but it has O, I, S, E. However, we don't know about O, I, S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" - but E is at the end again, and we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for E was (-) meaning it's in the word but not at the 5th position. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 We should try to put E in a different position: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 Let's try to put E at the 2nd position? Or 3rd? 

 We also want to test other vowels? We know A is out, so vowels left: E (we have), I, O, U.

 Since we have E, we can try to include I or O.

 How about ""TIMES""? But T is common. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's check: 
 T: not tested
 I: not tested
 M: not tested (but we used N and it was excluded, but M is different)
 E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at the end again? In ""TIMES"", E is at the end. We should avoid that.

 We need to put E not at the end.

 How about ""STEEL""? But it has two E's. We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters to get more information.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" - but that's 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L. E is at the 4th position. And it avoids A, C, R, N.

 But we don't know about S, P, I, L.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that E is present and not at the end. So in ""SPIEL"", E is at the 4th position, which is not the end? Actually, the positions are:

 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: E
 Position 5: L

 So E is at the 4th position, which is not the 5th. So that's acceptable.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Another idea: ""DOUSE"" - again E at the end, so avoid.

 How about ""BELIE""? That's 5 letters? B-E-L-I-E. But it has two E's. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at the 2nd and 5th. The 5th is the end, which we know is wrong for E, so the E at the 5th would be incorrect. But we have E at the 2nd too. However, the word might have only one E. So we might get confusing feedback.

 We want to avoid multiple same letters for now.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Common words: 
 - ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.
 - ""TOPIC"" -> C is excluded.

 How about ""QUOTE""? But we don't have Q and U, and it doesn't have E.

 We need E.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
 S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? 
 S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""OWLED""? Not common.

 How about ""PILED""? 
 P, I, L, E, D -> E at the 4th position. That's good.

 But we don't know about P, I, L, D.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E at the 4th.

 Or ""SHIED"": S, H, I, E, D.

 But let's choose a word that has more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""SMITE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRE""? But R is excluded (we had R in the first guess and it was x). So we cannot use R.

 We must remember: excluded letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

 How about ""WHILE""? 
 W, H, I, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""DEALT""? But A is excluded and we have A in the first guess and it was x. So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A, C, R, N and with E not at the end.

 Let me list: 
 - Position for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Words with E at position 1: 
   ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> no A, C, R, N.
   ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but O and W are less common? But we can try.

 Words with E at position 2:
   ""LEAST"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
   ""BEAST"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
   ""FEIST"" -> not common? But F, E, I, S, T -> no A, C, R, N.

 Words with E at position 3:
   ""CHEAP"" -> C and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""TREAD"" -> R and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""STEAM"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

 Words with E at position 4:
   ""SPIKE"" -> E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is K. So E is at 4, which is not the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So E at 4 is acceptable.

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> but E is at the 5th? Wait, no: 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? 
        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K
        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.

   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.

   How about ""SPIEL"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.

   Similarly, ""SHIED"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: H
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D

   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.

   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.

   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".

   Let's choose one that has common letters. 

   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 
   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it's not common.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.

   How about ""BELOW""? 
        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is also a possibility.

   We have several options: 
     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)
     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)
     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.
   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.
   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.

   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We don't have any information about the other positions.

   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.

   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.

   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""STEEL""? Two E's and E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That's valid. But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.

   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.

   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.

   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

   Let me decide: ""BELOW""

   B E L O W

   If we get feedback:
     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it's in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.

   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other vowels.

   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.

   ""BELOW"" has O.

   So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

   But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.

   So second guess: ""BELOW""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.

   Let me write the guess: below

   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn't know about position 1.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.

   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.

   But we don't know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.

   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven't used and also tests more common letters.

   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.

   We must include E.

   How about ""THEIR""? 
        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.

   How about ""THIEF""? 
        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is a valid word.

   But we are testing F, which is less common.

   How about ""SHINE""? 
        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.

   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:
     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)
     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.

   So let's go with ""SPIEL"".

   Guess: spiel

   Format: <guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) and position E in a new location (positions 1–4) to gather more information.

Selected ""**spiel**"" because:
- Places E in the **4th position** (a new location to test).
- Uses new high-frequency letters: S, P, I, L.
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

<guess>spiel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
Meaning: S, P, I are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we placed it at position 4 and got '-'). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""spiel"", L is the 5th letter).

So, from the feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I
- Confirmed letters: E (present, but not in position 4 or 5) and L (present and in position 5)

Since L is in position 5, we know the secret word ends with L.

E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5. Since we have only 5 positions, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Ends with L (because position 5 is fixed as L) — actually, no, we don't have to, but we can use this to our advantage. However, we are not required to put L at the end in the guess because we are still exploring. But note: the feedback for L in guess 2 was a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position (position 5). So in the secret word, the fifth letter is definitely L.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can fix the fifth letter as L to save a spot, but we don't have to. However, if we fix the fifth letter, we can focus on the first four.

But we also need to find the position of E and the other letters.

We have to include E and L. Since L is fixed at the end, we only need to place E in one of the first three positions.

We also need to test new letters.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L (but E and L are in the word, the others are not). So we should avoid C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

Common letters left: T, O, U, D, M, H, G, B, Y, etc.

We know the word has E and L (with L at the end). So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ L

And E is in one of the first three positions.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters.

Possible words:

- E at position 1: e.g., ""E? ? ? L"" -> words like ""EXCEL"" but C is excluded -> invalid. Or ""EAGLE"" but A and E (A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  We need without A, C, R, N, S, P, I.

  How about ""EIGHT"" -> but H and G are allowed? But ""EIGHT"" ends with T, not L. We need to end with L.

  So we need words ending with L and starting with E? But we don't know if E is at position 1.

  Let's think of words ending with L that have E in position 1, 2, or 3.

  Examples:
    Position 1: ""EXCEL"" (invalid due to C), ""EASEL"" (A and S excluded), ""EERIE"" (not ending with L) -> not working.

    Position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but double L? And we have L at the end, but in ""HELLO"", the L is at position 4 and 5? Actually: H-E-L-L-O -> not ending with L? It ends with O. We need ending with L.

    How about ""BELL"" -> too short.

    We need 5 letters: _ _ _ _ L

    With E at position 2: ? E ? ? L

    Examples: ""LEVEL"" -> but V and E, and also E at position 1 and 3? But we don't know about V. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, I. V is allowed.

    But ""LEVEL"": 
        Position 1: L -> but we already have L at the end, and if L is at position 1, that's allowed? But we don't know if L is at position 1. Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only one? We don't know if there are multiple E's.

    Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had one E and it was not at the end, and in ""spiel"" we had one E and it was not at the 4th. But it could be that the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the count, only that E is present. So it could have more than one.

    However, to keep it simple, let's assume we are looking for words with E and L (with L at the end) and without the excluded letters.

    Words with E at position 2 and ending with L: 
        ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> but J is not very common, and two E's? 
        ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> two E's and two L's? 

    But we don't know if the word has multiple letters.

    Alternatively, E at position 3: ? ? E ? L

    Examples: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait: 
        H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at position 4. But we already know from guess 2 that E is not at position 4 (because in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got '-'). So E cannot be at position 4.

    Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 3, but we just saw that position 4 is not allowed (from guess 2). And position 5 is L, so E cannot be at 5. So positions 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.

    But we also learned from guess 1 that E is not at position 5 (which we already knew) and from guess 2 that E is not at position 4.

    So E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

    Now, for the word ""HOTEL"", if we consider it, E is at position 4, which we now know is impossible. So we cannot use that.

    How about E at position 3: 
        Example: ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at position 4? 
        M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5) -> again E at 4 -> invalid.

    We need E at position 3: meaning the third letter is E.

    So pattern: _ _ E _ L

    Examples: 
        ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> two E's? 
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at the end and also at position 4? And Q and U are less common.

    How about ""HOTEL"" is not because E is at 4.

    Another example: ""LABEL"" -> but L is at position 1 and 5? And A is excluded.

    How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.

    We need words ending with L and having E at position 3.

    Let me think: 
        ""REBEL"" -> R is excluded.
        ""LEVEL"" -> E at position 2 and 4? 
            L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at 2 and 4. But we don't know if E is at 4? We know E is not at 4 from guess 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E (because in ""spiel"", we put E at 4 and it was marked as '-', meaning E is not at 4). So in ""LEVEL"", if we put it, the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct? But we are not sure.

        However, we are making a guess to test, so we can use ""LEVEL"" to test multiple things? But it has two E's and two L's.

    Alternatively, let's find a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, ends with L, and uses only available letters.

    Since we are struggling, let's list possible words:

    E at 1: 
        E _ _ _ L
        Examples: 
          ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXILE"" -> X and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""EMAIL"" -> A and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELBOW"" -> but ends with W, not L -> invalid.
          ""ENDED"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""EQUAL"" -> Q, U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

        It's hard. Maybe E at 1 is not common with L at the end without the excluded letters.

    E at 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L at 1 and 5, E at 2 and 4 -> but E at 4 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 4), so if the word has E at 4, it would be wrong. But in ""LEVEL"", there is an E at 2 and at 4. We don't know if the word has two E's. But we can try it? 
          However, we are avoiding excluded letters: L is allowed (we know it's in the word), V is not excluded. So ""LEVEL"" is a candidate? But we have to consider that the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct.

          But note: the feedback for E in the secret word: we only know there is at least one E. It could be that the word has two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we know from guess 2 that position 4 is not E. So the E at position 4 in ""LEVEL"" would be marked as '-' (if the word has an E at 4) or 'x' (if not). But we know the secret word does not have E at 4, so if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at 4 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not present? But wait, if the word has two E's, one at 2 and one at 4, then the E at 4 would be present but in the wrong position? No, because we know E is not at position 4, so the secret word cannot have E at 4. Therefore, if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at position 4 would be an extra E that is not in the word? Or if the word has only one E (at position 2), then the E at 4 would be incorrect.

          Actually, the feedback for ""spiel"" told us that the letter E in position 4 is not the correct position for E. It does not tell us that there is no E at position 4 in the secret word? It tells us that the secret word has E, but not at position 4. So the secret word has E in some other position, but it might have another E? We don't know.

          However, to avoid complexity, let's try to find a word with only one E.

    E at 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""HOTEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""WHEEL"" -> E at 3 and 4? W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed -> so if we use it, the E at 4 would be wrong.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5? 
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> E at 4 is not allowed.

        How about ""METAL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""BETEL"" -> E at 2? B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.

        ""OCTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""DUTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.

        It's difficult.

    After re-examining, I recall that we don't necessarily have to fix the L at the end in our guess. We can try a word that doesn't have L at the end to test other positions for E and other letters. But we know L is at position 5, so if we don't put L at the end, we might get feedback on L again? But we already know L is at position 5, so if we put L in a different position, it would be marked as '-' (if it's present but wrong position) or 'x' (if not present, but we know it is present so it would be '-').

    However, to maximize information, we might want to test more letters without fixing the known L.

    We know:
      - The secret word has E and L (with L at position 5).
      - E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
      - Excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    We can try a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also has L but not at the end (so we can test where L is not, but we already know it's at 5, so putting it elsewhere would be a minus). And we can test other new letters.

    For example, we can try ""BELOW"" again? But we didn't try it before. But ""BELOW"" has E at position 2 and ends with W, not L. And we know L is at position 5, so we can't put L at 5 in this guess? We can, but we are not required to.

    How about ""TABLE""? But A is excluded.

    How about ""LATHE""? But A excluded.

    How about ""TOWEL""? 
        T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4. So that would be a bad choice.

    How about ""DWELL""? 
        D, W, E, L, L -> E at position 3, and L at 4 and 5. But we know L is at position 5, so the L at 4 would be a minus? And we are testing D, W.

    But ""DWELL"" has two L's, which is acceptable.

    However, we are not sure about the position of E: we are putting it at 3, which is a possibility.

    But we also have to avoid the excluded letters.

    Another idea: ""MOTEL"" -> M, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    How about ""HOTEL"" -> same.

    Let's try to find a word with E at position 1: 
        ""LEAVE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEPER"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEGAL"" -> A and G? A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEMEL"" -> not a word.

    E at position 2:
        ""WEIGH"" -> not ending with L, and no L -> but we know L is in the word, so we should include L? Not necessarily, but if we don't include L, we will get feedback that L is present (but not in the word we guessed) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about the position of L.

    We know L is at position 5, so we can focus on the first four letters.

    Let me think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also include other common letters, and avoid the excluded ones.

    We can try ""FIGHT"" -> but no E and no L.

    We must include E because we are trying to find its position.

    How about ""LIGHT""? -> no E.

    We must include E.

    How about ""THEFT"" -> no L.

    We are not required to include L in the guess, but we know L is in the word, so if we don't include it, we'll get a '-' for L in the feedback? No, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. If we don't guess L, we won't get feedback on L. But we already know L is at position 5, so it's not critical to include it.

    However, to make progress on the other letters, we can guess a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and doesn't include L.

    For example, ""THEFT"": 
        T, H, E, F, T -> E at position 3. 
        But it has two T's? And no L. 
        We can use this to test T, H, F.

    But then we won't get information about the other letters in the secret word.

    Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" -> no E.

    How about ""DOZEN"" -> N excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""BOXED"" -> no L, and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be '-', but we already know that.

    Let's choose a word with E at position 1: 
        ""EVERY"" -> E, V, E, R, Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBER"" -> E, M, B, E, R -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> no R, no A, no C, no S, no P, no I, no N. And R is excluded, so this is valid? 
        ""EMBED"": E at 1 and 4? But we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so the E at position 4 in ""EMBED"" would be a problem.

        However, we are guessing to test. The secret word has E, but not at 4 or 5. So if we guess ""EMBED"", the E at 1 might be correct or not, and the E at 4 will be marked as '-' or 'x'? Since the secret word has E but not at 4, the E at 4 in the guess will be marked as '-' only if there is another occurrence of E that is not at 4? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know the word has at least one E, but it might have two.

        This is getting complicated.

    Given the complexity, let's go back to the known information and try to list possible words.

    The secret word: 
        Position 5: L
        Contains E (not at 4 or 5, so at 1, 2, or 3)
        Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I

    So the word is in the form: 
        [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]L

    With letter1, letter2, or letter3 being E.

    And letter4 is not E (because E is not at 4).

    And the letters are from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    Common letters left: B, D, E, G, H, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

    We can try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses common letters.

    For example, with E at position 1:
        E _ _ _ L
        Possible words: 
          ""EQUAL"" -> Q and A -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EVERY"" -> V, E, R, Y -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXCEL"" -> X, C -> C excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXPEL"" -> X, P -> P excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A, S -> both excluded -> invalid.
          ""EAGLE"" -> A, G -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EDGEL"" -> not a word.
          ""EIGHT"" -> I, G, H, T -> I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we have L at position 2 and 5? And E at 1 and 5? But position 5 is L, not E. And we have two E's? 
          ""ELUDE"": positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:U, 4:D, 5:E -> but we need position 5 to be L, so not.

        I can't find a common word with E at 1 and ending with L without the excluded letters.

    E at position 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5, and E at 2 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed, so this word would have E at 4 which is invalid for the secret word. So ""LEVEL"" cannot be the secret word because it has E at position 4, which we know is not allowed.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.
          ""BETEL"" -> B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> invalid.
          ""REBEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> Y, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""NEWEL"" -> N, E, W, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

        How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded -> invalid.
        "" pencil"" -> not 5 letters.

        It's hard.

    E at position 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4 -> E at 4 not allowed.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and L at 4 and 5. This is a word. And it doesn't use excluded letters? Q, U, E, L, L. Q and U are allowed (not excluded). 
          ""QUELl"" is a word (a crosspiece in a window frame or a verb meaning to die down).

          But let's check: positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> so E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5. 
          But we know that in the secret word, position 5 is L, and position 4 is not E (which is satisfied because position 4 is L, not E). 
          However, we have L at position 4, which might be correct or not? We don't know about position 4 yet.

          The secret word has L only at position 5? Or could it have L at position 4 as well? We don't know.

          ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.

          Another example: ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> positions: 1:D, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> E at 3.

          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""CREEL"" -> C and R excluded -> invalid.

          "" kneel"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.

          ""SPIEL"" -> already guessed.

        So possible words: ""QUELL"", ""DWELL"", and perhaps others.

        "" hotel"" -> not.

        "" motel"" -> not.

        "" barrel"" -> not 5 letters.

        So among these, ""DWELL"" uses more common letters than ""QUELL"".

    Given the above, we can try ""DWELL"" as the next guess.

    But note: ""DWELL"" has two L's. We know L is at position 5, but it might also be at position 4? We don't know.

    If we guess ""DWELL"", the feedback might be:

        D: ? 
        W: ?
        E: ? (at position 3)
        L: at position 4 and 5.

    We know position 5 is L, so that will be ✓.
    Position 4 is L: if the secret word has L at position 4, then it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be '-' or 'x'? But if the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 in the guess would be '-' (because L is in the word but not at position 4) or 'x' if there is only one L and it's at 5? 

    According to Wordle rules, if there is only one L in the secret word, and we guess two L's, then one of them will be ✓ (if in the correct position) and the other will be 'x' (because there's only one). But if there are two L's, then both could be ✓ or one ✓ and one '-'.

    We don't know if there is more than one L.

    Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and doesn't have L at position 4, to avoid confusion.

    How about "" power"" -> not 5 letters ending with L.

    Another word: ""Hovel"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L -> but E at position 4 is not allowed, so invalid for our guess because we know E is not at 4.

    How about "" rowel"" -> R excluded.

    "" towel"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" vowel"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" dowel"" -> D, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    So it's hard to avoid.

    Perhaps ""DWELL"" is a reasonable guess.

    Or ""QUELL"".

    Let's choose ""DWELL"" because it uses more common letters.

    Guess: dwell

    But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L's.

    Another possibility: ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.

    After careful thought, I recall that we have not used T, O, H, M, U, etc.

    How about we try a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, and includes T, O, H, and also includes L at position 5? 

    For example, "" hotel"" is not.

    How about "" moth"" -> not 5 letters.

    Let's try to construct: 
        We want: _ _ _ _ L, with one of the first three being E, and the fourth not E.

        With common letters: say, T, O, H.

        For example, if E at 1: ""TE? ? L"" -> ""tepal"" -> not common, and A.
                       ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.

        E at 2: ""? E? ? L"" -> ""METAL"" -> A excluded.
                 "" method"" -> not 5 letters.

        E at 3: ""??E?L"" -> ""THEWL"" -> not a common word.
                 ""TOKEN"" -> not ending with L.

        "" model"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    Given the difficulty, I think we should guess ""DWELL"" or ""QUELL"". Let's choose ""DWELL"".

    But we have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are at try 3.

    Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't end with L but has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and also includes L in a different position to see if there is another L.

    For example, ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2, L at position 3.

    This way, we can test:
        B, E, L, O, W.
        We know L is in the word, but if we put it at position 3, and the secret word has L only at position 5, then L will be marked as '-' (present but not at 3).
        E at position 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, it will be '?', or if not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so it will be '-' if not at 2, or '✓' if at 2.

    This might give us information about the position of E and also test B, O, W.

    So let's consider ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    This guess: 
        B at 1, E at 2, L at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

    We know that in the secret word:
        - L is at position 5, so W at 5 will be 'x' (because it's not L) and L at position 3 will be '-' (because L is in the word but not at 3, since it's at 5).
        - E at 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, then '✓', else '-'.
        - B and O: we don't know.

    But we can get information about B and O.

    So this guess might be informative.

    Let's compare with ""DWELL"":

        ""DWELL"": tests D, W, E, L (at 4 and 5). We know L at 5 will be '✓', and L at 4 will be 'x' or '-' or '✓' (if there is L at 4). E at 3 will be '✓' if E is at 3, else '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 3, then '-'.

    Both are valid.

    I think ""BELOW"" is better because it tests more new letters (B, O, W) and doesn't repeat L, so less ambiguity.

    So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    Format: <guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at position 4 or 5** (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, N, S, P, I.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., B, O, W, D, T) to gather more information.
- Since L is confirmed at position 5, the guess does not need to end with L, but placing L elsewhere can provide positional feedback.

Selected **""below""** because:
- Places **E at position 2** (testing a new position for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **B, O, W**.
- Includes **L at position 3** to check if it appears elsewhere (though we know it must be at position 5, this may reveal if there are multiple L's).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

Wait, no: \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? \n        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:\n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: K\n        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.\n\n   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.\n\n   How about ""SPIEL"": \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   Similarly, ""SHIED"": \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: H\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: D\n\n   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.\n\n   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.\n\n   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".\n\n   Let\'s choose one that has common letters. \n\n   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. \n   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.\n\n   Both are valid.\n\n   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it\'s not common.\n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.\n\n   How about ""BELOW""? \n        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.\n\n   This is also a possibility.\n\n   We have several options: \n     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)\n     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)\n     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)\n\n   We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.\n   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.\n   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.\n\n   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.\n\n   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.\n\n   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the other positions.\n\n   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.\n\n   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.\n\n   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""STEEL""? Two E\'s and E at the end -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That\'s valid. But we don\'t know about S, T, U, P.\n\n   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.\n\n   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.\n\n   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.\n\n   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\n   Let me decide: ""BELOW""\n\n   B E L O W\n\n   If we get feedback:\n     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it\'s in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other vowels.\n\n   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.\n\n   ""BELOW"" has O.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n   But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.\n\n   So second guess: ""BELOW""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.\n\n   Let me write the guess: below\n\n   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn\'t know about position 1.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.\n\n   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.\n\n   But we don\'t know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.\n\n   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven\'t used and also tests more common letters.\n\n   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n   We must include E.\n\n   How about ""THEIR""? \n        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.\n\n   How about ""THIEF""? \n        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.\n\n   This is a valid word.\n\n   But we are testing F, which is less common.\n\n   How about ""SHINE""? \n        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.\n\n   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.\n\n   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:\n     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)\n     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""SPIEL"".\n\n   Guess: spiel\n\n   Format: <guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) and position E in a new location (positions 1–4) to gather more information.\n\nSelected ""**spiel**"" because:\n- Places E in the **4th position** (a new location to test).\n- Uses new high-frequency letters: S, P, I, L.\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word.

So we should avoid C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, U, D, M, H, G, B, Y, etc.\n\nWe know the word has E and L (with L at the end). So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ L\n\nAnd E is in one of the first three positions.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- E at position 1: e.g., ""E? ? ? L"" -> words like ""EXCEL"" but C is excluded -> invalid. Or ""EAGLE"" but A and E (A is excluded) -> invalid. \n  We need without A, C, R, N, S, P, I.\n\n  How about ""EIGHT"" -> but H and G are allowed? But ""EIGHT"" ends with T, not L. We need to end with L.\n\n  So we need words ending with L and starting with E? But we don\'t know if E is at position 1.\n\n  Let\'s think of words ending with L that have E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\n  Examples:\n    Position 1: ""EXCEL"" (invalid due to C), ""EASEL"" (A and S excluded), ""EERIE"" (not ending with L) -> not working.\n\n    Position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but double L? And we have L at the end, but in ""HELLO"", the L is at position 4 and 5? Actually: H-E-L-L-O -> not ending with L? It ends with O. We need ending with L.\n\n    How about ""BELL"" -> too short.\n\n    We need 5 letters: _ _ _ _ L\n\n    With E at position 2: ? E ? ? L\n\n    Examples: ""LEVEL"" -> but V and E, and also E at position 1 and 3? But we don\'t know about V. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, I. V is allowed.\n\n    But ""LEVEL"": \n        Position 1: L -> but we already have L at the end, and if L is at position 1, that\'s allowed? But we don\'t know if L is at position 1. Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only one? We don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s.\n\n    Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had one E and it was not at the end, and in ""spiel"" we had one E and it was not at the 4th. But it could be that the word has two E\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us the count, only that E is present. So it could have more than one.\n\n    However, to keep it simple, let\'s assume we are looking for words with E and L (with L at the end) and without the excluded letters.\n\n    Words with E at position 2 and ending with L: \n        ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> but J is not very common, and two E\'s? \n        ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> two E\'s and two L\'s? \n\n    But we don\'t know if the word has multiple letters.\n\n    Alternatively, E at position 3: ? ? E ? L\n\n    Examples: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait: \n        H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at position 4. But we already know from guess 2 that E is not at position 4 (because in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got \'-\'). So E cannot be at position 4.\n\n    Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 3, but we just saw that position 4 is not allowed (from guess 2). And position 5 is L, so E cannot be at 5. So positions 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.\n\n    But we also learned from guess 1 that E is not at position 5 (which we already knew) and from guess 2 that E is not at position 4.\n\n    So E must be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\n    Now, for the word ""HOTEL"", if we consider it, E is at position 4, which we now know is impossible. So we cannot use that.\n\n    How about E at position 3: \n        Example: ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at position 4? \n        M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5) -> again E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n    We need E at position 3: meaning the third letter is E.\n\n    So pattern: _ _ E _ L\n\n    Examples: \n        ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> two E\'s? \n        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at the end and also at position 4? And Q and U are less common.\n\n    How about ""HOTEL"" is not because E is at 4.\n\n    Another example: ""LABEL"" -> but L is at position 1 and 5? And A is excluded.\n\n    How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.\n\n    We need words ending with L and having E at position 3.\n\n    Let me think: \n        ""REBEL"" -> R is excluded.\n        ""LEVEL"" -> E at position 2 and 4? \n            L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if E is at 4? We know E is not at 4 from guess 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E (because in ""spiel"", we put E at 4 and it was marked as \'-\', meaning E is not at 4). So in ""LEVEL"", if we put it, the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct? But we are not sure.\n\n        However, we are making a guess to test, so we can use ""LEVEL"" to test multiple things? But it has two E\'s and two L\'s.\n\n    Alternatively, let\'s find a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, ends with L, and uses only available letters.\n\n    Since we are struggling, let\'s list possible words:\n\n    E at 1: \n        E _ _ _ L\n        Examples: \n          ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EXILE"" -> X and I excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EMAIL"" -> A and I excluded -> invalid.\n          ""ELBOW"" -> but ends with W, not L -> invalid.\n          ""ENDED"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        How about ""EQUAL"" -> Q, U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n        It\'s hard. Maybe E at 1 is not common with L at the end without the excluded letters.\n\n    E at 2:\n        _ E _ _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""LEVEL"" -> L at 1 and 5, E at 2 and 4 -> but E at 4 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 4), so if the word has E at 4, it would be wrong. But in ""LEVEL"", there is an E at 2 and at 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. But we can try it? \n          However, we are avoiding excluded letters: L is allowed (we know it\'s in the word), V is not excluded. So ""LEVEL"" is a candidate? But we have to consider that the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct.\n\n          But note: the feedback for E in the secret word: we only know there is at least one E. It could be that the word has two E\'s, one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we know from guess 2 that position 4 is not E. So the E at position 4 in ""LEVEL"" would be marked as \'-\' (if the word has an E at 4) or \'x\' (if not). But we know the secret word does not have E at 4, so if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at 4 would be marked as \'x\' (because it\'s not present? But wait, if the word has two E\'s, one at 2 and one at 4, then the E at 4 would be present but in the wrong position? No, because we know E is not at position 4, so the secret word cannot have E at 4. Therefore, if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at position 4 would be an extra E that is not in the word? Or if the word has only one E (at position 2), then the E at 4 would be incorrect.\n\n          Actually, the feedback for ""spiel"" told us that the letter E in position 4 is not the correct position for E. It does not tell us that there is no E at position 4 in the secret word? It tells us that the secret word has E, but not at position 4. So the secret word has E in some other position, but it might have another E? We don\'t know.\n\n          However, to avoid complexity, let\'s try to find a word with only one E.\n\n    E at 3:\n        _ _ E _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""HOTEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""MODEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""WHEEL"" -> E at 3 and 4? W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed -> so if we use it, the E at 4 would be wrong.\n          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5? \n          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> E at 4 is not allowed.\n\n        How about ""METAL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""BETEL"" -> E at 2? B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.\n\n        ""OCTEL"" -> not a word.\n\n        ""DUTEL"" -> not a word.\n\n        ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.\n\n        It\'s difficult.\n\n    After re-examining, I recall that we don\'t necessarily have to fix the L at the end in our guess. We can try a word that doesn\'t have L at the end to test other positions for E and other letters. But we know L is at position 5, so if we don\'t put L at the end, we might get feedback on L again? But we already know L is at position 5, so if we put L in a different position, it would be marked as \'-\' (if it\'s present but wrong position) or \'x\' (if not present, but we know it is present so it would be \'-\').\n\n    However, to maximize information, we might want to test more letters without fixing the known L.\n\n    We know:\n      - The secret word has E and L (with L at position 5).\n      - E is in position 1, 2, or 3.\n      - Excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\n    We can try a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also has L but not at the end (so we can test where L is not, but we already know it\'s at 5, so putting it elsewhere would be a minus). And we can test other new letters.\n\n    For example, we can try ""BELOW"" again? But we didn\'t try it before. But ""BELOW"" has E at position 2 and ends with W, not L. And we know L is at position 5, so we can\'t put L at 5 in this guess? We can, but we are not required to.\n\n    How about ""TABLE""? But A is excluded.\n\n    How about ""LATHE""? But A excluded.\n\n    How about ""TOWEL""? \n        T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4. So that would be a bad choice.\n\n    How about ""DWELL""? \n        D, W, E, L, L -> E at position 3, and L at 4 and 5. But we know L is at position 5, so the L at 4 would be a minus? And we are testing D, W.\n\n    But ""DWELL"" has two L\'s, which is acceptable.\n\n    However, we are not sure about the position of E: we are putting it at 3, which is a possibility.\n\n    But we also have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\n    Another idea: ""MOTEL"" -> M, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.\n\n    How about ""HOTEL"" -> same.\n\n    Let\'s try to find a word with E at position 1: \n        ""LEAVE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""LEPER"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n        ""LEGAL"" -> A and G? A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""LEMEL"" -> not a word.\n\n    E at position 2:\n        ""WEIGH"" -> not ending with L, and no L -> but we know L is in the word, so we should include L? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t include L, we will get feedback that L is present (but not in the word we guessed) but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information about the position of L.\n\n    We know L is at position 5, so we can focus on the first four letters.\n\n    Let me think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also include other common letters, and avoid the excluded ones.\n\n    We can try ""FIGHT"" -> but no E and no L.\n\n    We must include E because we are trying to find its position.\n\n    How about ""LIGHT""? -> no E.\n\n    We must include E.\n\n    How about ""THEFT"" -> no L.\n\n    We are not required to include L in the guess, but we know L is in the word, so if we don\'t include it, we\'ll get a \'-\' for L in the feedback? No, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. If we don\'t guess L, we won\'t get feedback on L. But we already know L is at position 5, so it\'s not critical to include it.\n\n    However, to make progress on the other letters, we can guess a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and doesn\'t include L.\n\n    For example, ""THEFT"": \n        T, H, E, F, T -> E at position 3. \n        But it has two T\'s? And no L. \n        We can use this to test T, H, F.\n\n    But then we won\'t get information about the other letters in the secret word.\n\n    Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" -> no E.\n\n    How about ""DOZEN"" -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n    How about ""BOXED"" -> no L, and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be \'-\', but we already know that.\n\n    Let\'s choose a word with E at position 1: \n        ""EVERY"" -> E, V, E, R, Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.\n        ""EMBER"" -> E, M, B, E, R -> R excluded -> invalid.\n        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> no R, no A, no C, no S, no P, no I, no N. And R is excluded, so this is valid? \n        ""EMBED"": E at 1 and 4? But we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so the E at position 4 in ""EMBED"" would be a problem.\n\n        However, we are guessing to test. The secret word has E, but not at 4 or 5. So if we guess ""EMBED"", the E at 1 might be correct or not, and the E at 4 will be marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Since the secret word has E but not at 4, the E at 4 in the guess will be marked as \'-\' only if there is another occurrence of E that is not at 4? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s \'-\'. If it\'s not in the word at all, it\'s \'x\'. But we know the word has at least one E, but it might have two.\n\n        This is getting complicated.\n\n    Given the complexity, let\'s go back to the known information and try to list possible words.\n\n    The secret word: \n        Position 5: L\n        Contains E (not at 4 or 5, so at 1, 2, or 3)\n        Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I\n\n    So the word is in the form: \n        [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]L\n\n    With letter1, letter2, or letter3 being E.\n\n    And letter4 is not E (because E is not at 4).\n\n    And the letters are from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\n    Common letters left: B, D, E, G, H, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\n    We can try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses common letters.\n\n    For example, with E at position 1:\n        E _ _ _ L\n        Possible words: \n          ""EQUAL"" -> Q and A -> A excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EVERY"" -> V, E, R, Y -> R excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EXCEL"" -> X, C -> C excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EXPEL"" -> X, P -> P excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EASEL"" -> A, S -> both excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EAGLE"" -> A, G -> A excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EDGEL"" -> not a word.\n          ""EIGHT"" -> I, G, H, T -> I excluded -> invalid.\n          ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we have L at position 2 and 5? And E at 1 and 5? But position 5 is L, not E. And we have two E\'s? \n          ""ELUDE"": positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:U, 4:D, 5:E -> but we need position 5 to be L, so not.\n\n        I can\'t find a common word with E at 1 and ending with L without the excluded letters.\n\n    E at position 2:\n        _ E _ _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5, and E at 2 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed, so this word would have E at 4 which is invalid for the secret word. So ""LEVEL"" cannot be the secret word because it has E at position 4, which we know is not allowed.\n          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.\n          ""BETEL"" -> B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> invalid.\n          ""REBEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""YODEL"" -> Y, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""NEWEL"" -> N, E, W, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.\n          ""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n        How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded -> invalid.\n        "" pencil"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        It\'s hard.\n\n    E at position 3:\n        _ _ E _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4 -> E at 4 not allowed.\n          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and L at 4 and 5. This is a word. And it doesn\'t use excluded letters? Q, U, E, L, L. Q and U are allowed (not excluded). \n          ""QUELl"" is a word (a crosspiece in a window frame or a verb meaning to die down).\n\n          But let\'s check: positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> so E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5. \n          But we know that in the secret word, position 5 is L, and position 4 is not E (which is satisfied because position 4 is L, not E). \n          However, we have L at position 4, which might be correct or not? We don\'t know about position 4 yet.\n\n          The secret word has L only at position 5? Or could it have L at position 4 as well? We don\'t know.\n\n          ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.\n\n          Another example: ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> positions: 1:D, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> E at 3.\n\n          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.\n\n          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.\n\n          ""CREEL"" -> C and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n          "" kneel"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n          ""SPIEL"" -> already guessed.\n\n        So possible words: ""QUELL"", ""DWELL"", and perhaps others.\n\n        "" hotel"" -> not.\n\n        "" motel"" -> not.\n\n        "" barrel"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        So among these, ""DWELL"" uses more common letters than ""QUELL"".\n\n    Given the above, we can try ""DWELL"" as the next guess.\n\n    But note: ""DWELL"" has two L\'s. We know L is at position 5, but it might also be at position 4? We don\'t know.\n\n    If we guess ""DWELL"", the feedback might be:\n\n        D: ? \n        W: ?\n        E: ? (at position 3)\n        L: at position 4 and 5.\n\n    We know position 5 is L, so that will be ✓.\n    Position 4 is L: if the secret word has L at position 4, then it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be \'-\' or \'x\'? But if the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 in the guess would be \'-\' (because L is in the word but not at position 4) or \'x\' if there is only one L and it\'s at 5? \n\n    According to Wordle rules, if there is only one L in the secret word, and we guess two L\'s, then one of them will be ✓ (if in the correct position) and the other will be \'x\' (because there\'s only one). But if there are two L\'s, then both could be ✓ or one ✓ and one \'-\'.\n\n    We don\'t know if there is more than one L.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and doesn\'t have L at position 4, to avoid confusion.\n\n    How about "" power"" -> not 5 letters ending with L.\n\n    Another word: ""Hovel"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L -> but E at position 4 is not allowed, so invalid for our guess because we know E is not at 4.\n\n    How about "" rowel"" -> R excluded.\n\n    "" towel"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.\n\n    "" vowel"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.\n\n    "" dowel"" -> D, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n    So it\'s hard to avoid.\n\n    Perhaps ""DWELL"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n    Or ""QUELL"".\n\n    Let\'s choose ""DWELL"" because it uses more common letters.\n\n    Guess: dwell\n\n    But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L\'s.\n\n    Another possibility: ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.\n\n    After careful thought, I recall that we have not used T, O, H, M, U, etc.\n\n    How about we try a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, and includes T, O, H, and also includes L at position 5? \n\n    For example, "" hotel"" is not.\n\n    How about "" moth"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n    Let\'s try to construct: \n        We want: _ _ _ _ L, with one of the first three being E, and the fourth not E.\n\n        With common letters: say, T, O, H.\n\n        For example, if E at 1: ""TE? ? L"" -> ""tepal"" -> not common, and A.\n                       ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        E at 2: ""? E? ? L"" -> ""METAL"" -> A excluded.\n                 "" method"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        E at 3: ""??E?L"" -> ""THEWL"" -> not a common word.\n                 ""TOKEN"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        "" model"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n    Given the difficulty, I think we should guess ""DWELL"" or ""QUELL"". Let\'s choose ""DWELL"".\n\n    But we have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are at try 3.\n\n    Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t end with L but has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and also includes L in a different position to see if there is another L.\n\n    For example, ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2, L at position 3.\n\n    This way, we can test:\n        B, E, L, O, W.\n        We know L is in the word, but if we put it at position 3, and the secret word has L only at position 5, then L will be marked as \'-\' (present but not at 3).\n        E at position 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, it will be \'?\', or if not, then \'-\' or \'x\'? But we know E is in the word, so it will be \'-\' if not at 2, or \'✓\' if at 2.\n\n    This might give us information about the position of E and also test B, O, W.\n\n    So let\'s consider ""BELOW"".\n\n    Guess: below\n\n    This guess: \n        B at 1, E at 2, L at 3, O at 4, W at 5.\n\n    We know that in the secret word:\n        - L is at position 5, so W at 5 will be \'x\' (because it\'s not L) and L at position 3 will be \'-\' (because L is in the word but not at 3, since it\'s at 5).\n        - E at 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, then \'✓\', else \'-\'.\n        - B and O: we don\'t know.\n\n    But we can get information about B and O.\n\n    So this guess might be informative.\n\n    Let\'s compare with ""DWELL"":\n\n        ""DWELL"": tests D, W, E, L (at 4 and 5). We know L at 5 will be \'✓\', and L at 4 will be \'x\' or \'-\' or \'✓\' (if there is L at 4). E at 3 will be \'✓\' if E is at 3, else \'-\' or \'x\'? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 3, then \'-\'.\n\n    Both are valid.\n\n    I think ""BELOW"" is better because it tests more new letters (B, O, W) and doesn\'t repeat L, so less ambiguity.\n\n    So I\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n    Guess: below\n\n    Format: <guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I (not in the word at all).\n- **Confirmed Letters**: \n  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.\n  - **E** is in the word but **not at position 4 or 5** (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., B, O, W, D, T) to gather more information.\n- Since L is confirmed at position 5, the guess does not need to end with L, but placing L elsewhere can provide positional feedback.\n\nSelected **""below""** because:\n- Places **E at position 2** (testing a new position for E).\n- Tests new high-frequency letters: **B, O, W**.\n- Includes **L at position 3** to check if it appears elsewhere (though we know it must be at position 5, this may reveal if there are multiple L\'s).\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\nGuess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""below"":
  B(x) -> B is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 2.
  L(-) -> L is in the word but not at position 3 (we already know L is at position 5, so this is consistent).
  O(x) -> O is not in the word.
  W(x) -> W is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, B, O, W (all marked 'x' in previous guesses)
- Confirmed: 
    - L is at position 5 (from guess 2: L(✓) at position 5)
    - E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3.

The secret word pattern: 
    Position 1: ? (could be E or another letter)
    Position 2: ? (cannot be E, and not any excluded letter)
    Position 3: ? (could be E or another letter, but note: if E is at 3, then position 1 is not E; if E is at 1, then position 3 is not E)
    Position 4: ? (cannot be E, and not excluded)
    Position 5: L

Excluded letters: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W

Available letters: D, E, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y, and possibly others.

We must include E in position 1 or 3.

We have two cases:
  Case 1: E at position 1 -> word pattern: E _ _ _ L
  Case 2: E at position 3 -> word pattern: _ _ E _ L

We need to choose a guess that helps distinguish between these cases and tests new letters.

We can try to cover both cases by choosing a word that has E at position 1 and also tests common letters for the other positions.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E at position 3 to see if it gets a check.

But let's think of words that fit one of the patterns and use common available letters.

First, for case 1 (E at 1): 
    E _ _ _ L
    We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with available letters, avoiding excluded ones.

    Possible words:
        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded -> invalid.
        ""EDGED"" -> D and G, but ends with D? We need L at the end -> invalid.
        ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""EVENT"" -> V and T, but ends with T -> invalid.
        ""EXILE"" -> I and X? I excluded -> invalid.
        ""EQUAL"" -> U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""EMMET""? -> E, M, M, E, T -> but we need L at the end -> invalid.

    We need the word to end with L.

    So: E _ _ _ L

    Examples:
        ""EXPEL"" -> X and P excluded -> invalid.
        ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
        ""EVERL"" -> not a word.
        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.

    It's hard to find a common word.

    How about ""EQUAL"" -> but A excluded.

    Another: ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.

    This case might be less likely.

Case 2: E at position 3: _ _ E _ L

    Examples:
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is L, so position 4 would be L as well? 
        ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> but D and W are excluded (from guess 3: D and W were not tested in guess 3? Wait, in guess 3 we had B, E, L, O, W -> W was marked 'x', so W is excluded. D was not tested? But we don't know about D.

        In guess 3, we tested B, E, L, O, W. D was not tested.

        But ""DWELL"" has D and W. W is excluded (from guess 3: W(x)), so we cannot use W.

        ""QUELL"": Q and U are not excluded, but we don't know about them.

        Other words:
          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.
          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.
          ""KNEEL"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> W excluded -> invalid.
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so this word would have E at 4 which is not allowed. So it cannot be the secret word.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> O excluded (from guess 3: O(x)) -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> O excluded -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A and P excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TABLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""FABLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""GAVEL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""NOVEL"" -> O and N excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""HOVEL"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""DOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""MOTEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""VOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TIGER"" -> not ending with L.

        This is difficult.

    Let's list available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y, E (but E must be at 1 or 3), and L (at 5).

    We need a word of the form _ _ E _ L.

    With available letters for the first two and the fourth.

    Possibilities:
        - First two: try common consonants: T, H, M, D, etc.
        - Fourth: try common: T, D, H, etc.

    Examples:
        ""THE"" + letter + ""L"" -> ""THE?L"" -> ""THETL"" not a word.
        ""THENL"" not a word.
        ""THECL"" not.

        ""THEEL"" -> not a word.

        ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

        ""FETAL"" -> A excluded.

        ""HEMAL"" -> A excluded.

        ""DEMUR"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HEDYL"" -> not a word.

        ""MEDIA"" -> not ending with L.

        ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.

        ""HELLO"" -> not ending with L.

        ""JELLY"" -> not ending with L.

        ""KELLY"" -> K, E, L, L, Y -> but we need E at 3? K at 1, E at 2, L at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> not matching pattern.

        We need E at position 3.

        How about ""TEXEL"" -> T, E, X, E, L -> but E at position 2 and 4? And X is not excluded? But we need E at 3. This has E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""LYTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""BYTEL"" -> not.

        ""HYMEL"" -> not.

        ""GEMEL"" -> G, E, M, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""HEVEL"" -> not.

        ""REVEL"" -> R excluded.

        ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded.

        ""KEVEL"" -> K, E, V, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""BEVEL"" -> B excluded.

        ""LEVEL"" -> not valid because of E at 4.

        After research, I recall ""towel"" is a word but O and W excluded.

        Another idea: ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HUTCH"" -> not.

        I am considering: ""FECAL"" -> A excluded.

        This is very challenging.

    Given the difficulty, perhaps case 1 (E at 1) is more likely, and we should try to find a word for that.

    Case 1: E at 1, then _ _ _ L at the end.

    We need: E ? ? ? L

    Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y.

    Examples:
        ""EQUAL"" -> A excluded.
        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.
        ""EIGHT"" -> I and G, H, T -> I excluded.
        ""EIGHT"" is not valid.

        ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.

        ""EDGES"" -> S excluded.

        ""EGRET"" -> R excluded.

        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded.

        ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we need L at position 5, so this ends with E, not L.

        ""ELINT"" -> not ending with L.

        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> B excluded and not ending with L.

        ""EMPTY"" -> P excluded.

        ""ENVOY"" -> N excluded.

        ""EPOCH"" -> P and O excluded.

        ""ETHYL"" -> E, T, H, Y, L -> this is a word! 
            Positions: 1:E, 2:T, 3:H, 4:Y, 5:L -> so E at 1, and L at 5.

        And it uses T, H, Y, which are available.

        So ""ETHYL"" is a valid guess.

        Also, it doesn't use any excluded letters.

    So we can guess ""ETHYL"".

    This tests:
        E at position 1: if the secret word has E at 1, then we get a check.
        T at 2, H at 3, Y at 4: we don't know.

    If the secret word is ""ETHYL"", then we win.

    If not, we get feedback on T, H, Y.

    But note: we are not sure if E is at 1 or 3. If we guess ""ETHYL"" and E is not at 1, then we'll know E must be at 3.

    So this guess can help distinguish.

    Alternatively, we could guess a word that has E at position 3 to test that case.

    For example, for case 2: _ _ E _ L, we can try ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> but we need L at the end, so not.

    Or ""THYML"" -> not a word.

    ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

    ""HUTCH"" -> not.

    So ""ETHYL"" seems a good choice.

    Let's go with ""ETHYL"".

    Guess: ethyl

    Format: <guess>ethyl</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W (all marked 'x' in previous guesses).
- **Confirmed Letters**:
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at positions 2, 4, or 5** (so it must be at position 1 or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1 or 3.
- Must **avoid** all excluded letters (A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, H, Y, D, M, G) to gather more information.
- The word must end with **L** (position 5 is fixed).

Selected **""ethyl""** because:
- Places **E at position 1** (testing one of the two possible positions for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **T, H, Y**.
- Ends with **L** (position 5 is confirmed).
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- If E is correct at position 1, this could solve the puzzle; if not, it confirms E must be at position 3.

<guess>ethyl</guess>",ethyl,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""below"":
  B(x) -> B is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 2.
  L(-) -> L is in the word but not at position 3 (we already know L is at position 5, so this is consistent).
  O(x) -> O is not in the word.
  W(x) -> W is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, B, O, W (all marked 'x' in previous guesses)
- Confirmed: 
    - L is at position 5 (from guess 2: L(✓) at position 5)
    - E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3.

The secret word pattern: 
    Position 1: ? (could be E or another letter)
    Position 2: ? (cannot be E, and not any excluded letter)
    Position 3: ? (could be E or another letter, but note: if E is at 3, then position 1 is not E; if E is at 1, then position 3 is not E)
    Position 4: ? (cannot be E, and not excluded)
    Position 5: L

Excluded letters: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W

Available letters: D, E, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y, and possibly others.

We must include E in position 1 or 3.

We have two cases:
  Case 1: E at position 1 -> word pattern: E _ _ _ L
  Case 2: E at position 3 -> word pattern: _ _ E _ L

We need to choose a guess that helps distinguish between these cases and tests new letters.

We can try to cover both cases by choosing a word that has E at position 1 and also tests common letters for the other positions.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E at position 3 to see if it gets a check.

But let's think of words that fit one of the patterns and use common available letters.

First, for case 1 (E at 1): 
    E _ _ _ L
    We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with available letters, avoiding excluded ones.

    Possible words:
        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded -> invalid.
        ""EDGED"" -> D and G, but ends with D? We need L at the end -> invalid.
        ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""EVENT"" -> V and T, but ends with T -> invalid.
        ""EXILE"" -> I and X? I excluded -> invalid.
        ""EQUAL"" -> U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""EMMET""? -> E, M, M, E, T -> but we need L at the end -> invalid.

    We need the word to end with L.

    So: E _ _ _ L

    Examples:
        ""EXPEL"" -> X and P excluded -> invalid.
        ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
        ""EVERL"" -> not a word.
        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.

    It's hard to find a common word.

    How about ""EQUAL"" -> but A excluded.

    Another: ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.

    This case might be less likely.

Case 2: E at position 3: _ _ E _ L

    Examples:
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is L, so position 4 would be L as well? 
        ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> but D and W are excluded (from guess 3: D and W were not tested in guess 3? Wait, in guess 3 we had B, E, L, O, W -> W was marked 'x', so W is excluded. D was not tested? But we don't know about D.

        In guess 3, we tested B, E, L, O, W. D was not tested.

        But ""DWELL"" has D and W. W is excluded (from guess 3: W(x)), so we cannot use W.

        ""QUELL"": Q and U are not excluded, but we don't know about them.

        Other words:
          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.
          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.
          ""KNEEL"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> W excluded -> invalid.
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so this word would have E at 4 which is not allowed. So it cannot be the secret word.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> O excluded (from guess 3: O(x)) -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> O excluded -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A and P excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TABLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""FABLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""GAVEL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""MOTEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""VOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TIGER"" -> not ending with L.

        This is difficult.

    Let's list available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y, E (but E must be at 1 or 3), and L (at 5).

    We need a word of the form _ _ E _ L.

    With available letters for the first two and the fourth.

    Possibilities:
        - First two: try common consonants: T, H, M, D, etc.
        - Fourth: try common: T, D, H, etc.

    Examples:
        ""THE"" + letter + ""L"" -> ""THE?L"" -> ""THETL"" not a word.
        ""THENL"" not a word.
        ""THECL"" not.

        ""KELLY"" -> K, E, L, L, Y -> but we need E at 3? K at 1, E at 2, L at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> not matching pattern.

        We need E at position 3.

        How about ""TEXEL"" -> T, E, X, E, L -> but E at position 2 and 4? And X is not excluded? But we need E at 3. This has E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""LYTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""BYTEL"" -> not.

        ""HYMEL"" -> not.

        ""GEMEL"" -> G, E, M, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""HEVEL"" -> not.

        ""REVEL"" -> R excluded.

        ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded.

        ""KEVEL"" -> K, E, V, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""BEVEL"" -> B excluded.

        How about ""HUTCH"" -> not.

        I am considering: ""FECAL"" -> A excluded.

        This is very challenging.

    Given the difficulty, perhaps case 1 (E at 1) is more likely, and we should try to find a word for that.

    Case 1: E at 1, then _ _ _ L at the end.

    We need: E ? ? ? L

    Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y.

    Examples:
        ""EQUAL"" -> A excluded.
        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.
        ""EIGHT"" -> I and G, H, T -> I excluded.
        ""EIGHT"" is not valid.

        ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.

        ""EDGES"" -> S excluded.

        ""EGRET"" -> R excluded.

        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded.

        ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we need L at position 5, so this ends with E, not L.

        ""ELINT"" -> not ending with L.

        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> B excluded and not ending with L.

        ""EMPTY"" -> P excluded.

        ""ENVOY"" -> N excluded.

        ""EPOCH"" -> P and O excluded.

        ""ETHYL"" -> E, T, H, Y, L -> this is a word! 
            Positions: 1:E, 2:T, 3:H, 4:Y, 5:L -> so E at 1, and L at 5.

        And it uses T, H, Y, which are available.

        So ""ETHYL"" is a valid guess.

        Also, it doesn't use any excluded letters.

    So we can guess ""ETHYL"".

    This tests:
        E at position 1: if the secret word has E at 1, then we get a check.
        T at 2, H at 3, Y at 4: we don't know.

    If the secret word is ""ETHYL"", then we win.

    If not, we get feedback on T, H, Y.

    But note: we are not sure if E is at 1 or 3. If we guess ""ETHYL"" and E is not at 1, then we'll know E must be at 3.

    So this guess can help distinguish.

    Alternatively, we could guess a word that has E at position 3 to test that case.

    For example, for case 2: _ _ E _ L, we can try ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> but we need L at the end, so not.

    Or ""THYML"" -> not a word.

    ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

    ""HUTCH"" -> not.

    So ""ETHYL"" seems a good choice.

    Let's go with ""ETHYL"".

    Guess: ethyl

    Format: <guess>ethyl</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W (all marked 'x' in previous guesses).
- **Confirmed Letters**:
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at positions 2, 4, or 5** (so it must be at position 1 or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1 or 3.
- Must **avoid** all excluded letters (A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, H, Y, D, M, G) to gather more information.
- The word must end with **L** (position 5 is fixed).

Selected **""ethyl""** because:
- Places **E at position 1** (testing one of the two possible positions for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **T, H, Y**.
- Ends with **L** (position 5 is confirmed).
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- If E is correct at position 1, this could solve the puzzle; if not, it confirms E must be at position 3.",Guess 4: ethyl -> FEEDBACK: E(-) T(x) H(x) Y(x) L(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the end and it's wrong position).

 Also, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we know E is in the word, we should try a word that includes E and other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have E and avoid the excluded letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can try to place E in a different position to see if we can find its correct location.

 Since E was at the 5th position and it was wrong, the correct position must be one of the first four.

 We also want to use other common letters that we haven't tested: such as S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's choose a word that:
 - Contains E (but not at the end)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N
 - Uses other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" is a common starting word, but it contains A (which is excluded) and T, S, L, E. But A is excluded, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A. So let's think of words without A, C, R, N.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" - but it has O, I, S, E. However, we don't know about O, I, S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" - but E is at the end again, and we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for E was (-) meaning it's in the word but not at the 5th position. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 We should try to put E in a different position: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 Let's try to put E at the 2nd position? Or 3rd? 

 We also want to test other vowels? We know A is out, so vowels left: E (we have), I, O, U.

 Since we have E, we can try to include I or O.

 How about ""TIMES""? But T is common. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's check: 
 T: not tested
 I: not tested
 M: not tested (but we used N and it was excluded, but M is different)
 E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at the end again? In ""TIMES"", E is at the end. We should avoid that.

 We need to put E not at the end.

 How about ""STEEL""? But it has two E's. We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters to get more information.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" - but that's 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L. E is at the 4th position. And it avoids A, C, R, N.

 But we don't know about S, P, I, L.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that E is present and not at the end. So in ""SPIEL"", E is at the 4th position, which is not the end? Actually, the positions are:

 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: E
 Position 5: L

 So E is at the 4th position, which is not the 5th. So that's acceptable.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Another idea: ""DOUSE"" - again E at the end, so avoid.

 How about ""BELIE""? That's 5 letters? B-E-L-I-E. But it has two E's. And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at the 2nd and 5th. The 5th is the end, which we know is wrong for E, so the E at the 5th would be incorrect. But we have E at the 2nd too. However, the word might have only one E. So we might get confusing feedback.

 We want to avoid multiple same letters for now.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Common words: 
 - ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.
 - ""TOPIC"" -> C is excluded.

 How about ""QUOTE""? But we don't have Q and U, and it doesn't have E.

 We need E.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
 S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? 
 S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""OWLED""? Not common.

 How about ""PILED""? 
 P, I, L, E, D -> E at the 4th position. That's good.

 But we don't know about P, I, L, D.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E at the 4th.

 Or ""SHIED"": S, H, I, E, D.

 But let's choose a word that has more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""SMITE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRE""? But R is excluded (we had R in the first guess and it was x). So we cannot use R.

 We must remember: excluded letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

 How about ""WHILE""? 
 W, H, I, L, E -> E at the end? Avoid.

 How about ""DEALT""? But A is excluded and we have A in the first guess and it was x. So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A, C, R, N and with E not at the end.

 Let me list: 
 - Position for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Words with E at position 1: 
   ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> no A, C, R, N.
   ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but O and W are less common? But we can try.

 Words with E at position 2:
   ""LEAST"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
   ""BEAST"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
   ""FEIST"" -> not common? But F, E, I, S, T -> no A, C, R, N.

 Words with E at position 3:
   ""CHEAP"" -> C and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""TREAD"" -> R and A excluded -> invalid.
   ""STEAM"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

 Words with E at position 4:
   ""SPIKE"" -> E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is K. So E is at 4, which is not the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So E at 4 is acceptable.

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> but E is at the 5th? Wait, no: 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? 
        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: K
        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.

   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.

   How about ""SPIEL"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: P
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.

   Similarly, ""SHIED"": 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: H
        Position 3: I
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D

   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.

   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.

   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".

   Let's choose one that has common letters. 

   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 
   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.

   Both are valid.

   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it's not common.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.

   How about ""BELOW""? 
        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is also a possibility.

   We have several options: 
     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)
     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)
     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.
   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.
   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.

   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.

   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   We don't have any information about the other positions.

   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.

   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.

   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""STEEL""? Two E's and E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That's valid. But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.

   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.

   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.

   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

   Let me decide: ""BELOW""

   B E L O W

   If we get feedback:
     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it's in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.

   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other vowels.

   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.

   ""BELOW"" has O.

   So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

   But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.

   So second guess: ""BELOW""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.

   Let me write the guess: below

   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn't know about position 1.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.

   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.

   But we don't know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.

   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven't used and also tests more common letters.

   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.

   We must include E.

   How about ""THEIR""? 
        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.

   How about ""THIEF""? 
        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.

   This is a valid word.

   But we are testing F, which is less common.

   How about ""SHINE""? 
        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.

   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:
     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)
     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.

   So let's go with ""SPIEL"".

   Guess: spiel

   Format: <guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) and position E in a new location (positions 1–4) to gather more information.

Selected ""**spiel**"" because:
- Places E in the **4th position** (a new location to test).
- Uses new high-frequency letters: S, P, I, L.
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

<guess>spiel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
Meaning: S, P, I are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we placed it at position 4 and got '-'). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""spiel"", L is the 5th letter).

So, from the feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I
- Confirmed letters: E (present, but not in position 4 or 5) and L (present and in position 5)

Since L is in position 5, we know the secret word ends with L.

E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5. Since we have only 5 positions, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Ends with L (because position 5 is fixed as L) — actually, no, we don't have to, but we can use this to our advantage. However, we are not required to put L at the end in the guess because we are still exploring. But note: the feedback for L in guess 2 was a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position (position 5). So in the secret word, the fifth letter is definitely L.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can fix the fifth letter as L to save a spot, but we don't have to. However, if we fix the fifth letter, we can focus on the first four.

But we also need to find the position of E and the other letters.

We have to include E and L. Since L is fixed at the end, we only need to place E in one of the first three positions.

We also need to test new letters.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L (but E and L are in the word, the others are not). So we should avoid C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

Common letters left: T, O, U, D, M, H, G, B, Y, etc.

We know the word has E and L (with L at the end). So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ L

And E is in one of the first three positions.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters.

Possible words:

- E at position 1: e.g., ""E? ? ? L"" -> words like ""EXCEL"" but C is excluded -> invalid. Or ""EAGLE"" but A and E (A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  We need without A, C, R, N, S, P, I.

  How about ""EIGHT"" -> but H and G are allowed? But ""EIGHT"" ends with T, not L. We need to end with L.

  So we need words ending with L and starting with E? But we don't know if E is at position 1.

  Let's think of words ending with L that have E in position 1, 2, or 3.

  Examples:
    Position 1: ""EXCEL"" (invalid due to C), ""EASEL"" (A and S excluded), ""EERIE"" (not ending with L) -> not working.

    Position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but double L? And we have L at the end, but in ""HELLO"", the L is at position 4 and 5? Actually: H-E-L-L-O -> not ending with L? It ends with O. We need ending with L.

    How about ""BELL"" -> too short.

    We need 5 letters: _ _ _ _ L

    With E at position 2: ? E ? ? L

    Examples: ""LEVEL"" -> but V and E, and also E at position 1 and 3? But we don't know about V. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, I. V is allowed.

    But ""LEVEL"": 
        Position 1: L -> but we already have L at the end, and if L is at position 1, that's allowed? But we don't know if L is at position 1. Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only one? We don't know if there are multiple E's.

    Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had one E and it was not at the end, and in ""spiel"" we had one E and it was not at the 4th. But it could be that the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the count, only that E is present. So it could have more than one.

    However, to keep it simple, let's assume we are looking for words with E and L (with L at the end) and without the excluded letters.

    Words with E at position 2 and ending with L: 
        ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> but J is not very common, and two E's? 
        ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> two E's and two L's? 

    But we don't know if the word has multiple letters.

    Alternatively, E at position 3: ? ? E ? L

    Examples: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait: 
        H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at position 4. But we already know from guess 2 that E is not at position 4 (because in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got '-'). So E cannot be at position 4.

    Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 3, but we just saw that position 4 is not allowed (from guess 2). And position 5 is L, so E cannot be at 5. So positions 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.

    But we also learned from guess 1 that E is not at position 5 (which we already knew) and from guess 2 that E is not at position 4.

    So E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

    Now, for the word ""HOTEL"", if we consider it, E is at position 4, which we now know is impossible. So we cannot use that.

    How about E at position 3: 
        Example: ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at position 4? 
        M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5) -> again E at 4 -> invalid.

    We need E at position 3: meaning the third letter is E.

    So pattern: _ _ E _ L

    Examples: 
        ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> two E's? 
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at the end and also at position 4? And Q and U are less common.

    How about ""HOTEL"" is not because E is at 4.

    Another example: ""LABEL"" -> but L is at position 1 and 5? And A is excluded.

    How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.

    We need words ending with L and having E at position 3.

    Let me think: 
        ""REBEL"" -> R is excluded.
        ""LEVEL"" -> E at position 2 and 4? 
            L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at 2 and 4. But we don't know if E is at 4? We know E is not at 4 from guess 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E (because in ""spiel"", we put E at 4 and it was marked as '-', meaning E is not at 4). So in ""LEVEL"", if we put it, the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct? But we are not sure.

        However, we are making a guess to test, so we can use ""LEVEL"" to test multiple things? But it has two E's and two L's.

    Alternatively, let's find a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, ends with L, and uses only available letters.

    Since we are struggling, let's list possible words:

    E at 1: 
        E _ _ _ L
        Examples: 
          ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXILE"" -> X and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""EMAIL"" -> A and I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELBOW"" -> but ends with W, not L -> invalid.
          ""ENDED"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""EQUAL"" -> Q, U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

        It's hard. Maybe E at 1 is not common with L at the end without the excluded letters.

    E at 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L at 1 and 5, E at 2 and 4 -> but E at 4 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 4), so if the word has E at 4, it would be wrong. But in ""LEVEL"", there is an E at 2 and at 4. We don't know if the word has two E's. But we can try it? 
          However, we are avoiding excluded letters: L is allowed (we know it's in the word), V is not excluded. So ""LEVEL"" is a candidate? But we have to consider that the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct.

          But note: the feedback for E in the secret word: we only know there is at least one E. It could be that the word has two E's, one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we know from guess 2 that position 4 is not E. So the E at position 4 in ""LEVEL"" would be marked as '-' (if the word has an E at 4) or 'x' (if not). But we know the secret word does not have E at 4, so if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at 4 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not present? But wait, if the word has two E's, one at 2 and one at 4, then the E at 4 would be present but in the wrong position? No, because we know E is not at position 4, so the secret word cannot have E at 4. Therefore, if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at position 4 would be an extra E that is not in the word? Or if the word has only one E (at position 2), then the E at 4 would be incorrect.

          Actually, the feedback for ""spiel"" told us that the letter E in position 4 is not the correct position for E. It does not tell us that there is no E at position 4 in the secret word? It tells us that the secret word has E, but not at position 4. So the secret word has E in some other position, but it might have another E? We don't know.

          However, to avoid complexity, let's try to find a word with only one E.

    E at 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""HOTEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""WHEEL"" -> E at 3 and 4? W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed -> so if we use it, the E at 4 would be wrong.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5? 
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> E at 4 is not allowed.

        How about ""METAL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""BETEL"" -> E at 2? B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.

        ""OCTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""DUTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.

        It's difficult.

    After re-examining, I recall that we don't necessarily have to fix the L at the end in our guess. We can try a word that doesn't have L at the end to test other positions for E and other letters. But we know L is at position 5, so if we don't put L at the end, we might get feedback on L again? But we already know L is at position 5, so if we put L in a different position, it would be marked as '-' (if it's present but wrong position) or 'x' (if not present, but we know it is present so it would be '-').

    However, to maximize information, we might want to test more letters without fixing the known L.

    We know:
      - The secret word has E and L (with L at position 5).
      - E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
      - Excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    We can try a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also has L but not at the end (so we can test where L is not, but we already know it's at 5, so putting it elsewhere would be a minus). And we can test other new letters.

    For example, we can try ""BELOW"" again? But we didn't try it before. But ""BELOW"" has E at position 2 and ends with W, not L. And we know L is at position 5, so we can't put L at 5 in this guess? We can, but we are not required to.

    How about ""TABLE""? But A is excluded.

    How about ""LATHE""? But A excluded.

    How about ""TOWEL""? 
        T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4. So that would be a bad choice.

    How about ""DWELL""? 
        D, W, E, L, L -> E at position 3, and L at 4 and 5. But we know L is at position 5, so the L at 4 would be a minus? And we are testing D, W.

    But ""DWELL"" has two L's, which is acceptable.

    However, we are not sure about the position of E: we are putting it at 3, which is a possibility.

    But we also have to avoid the excluded letters.

    Another idea: ""MOTEL"" -> M, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    How about ""HOTEL"" -> same.

    Let's try to find a word with E at position 1: 
        ""LEAVE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEPER"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEGAL"" -> A and G? A excluded -> invalid.
        ""LEMEL"" -> not a word.

    E at position 2:
        ""WEIGH"" -> not ending with L, and no L -> but we know L is in the word, so we should include L? Not necessarily, but if we don't include L, we will get feedback that L is present (but not in the word we guessed) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about the position of L.

    We know L is at position 5, so we can focus on the first four letters.

    Let me think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also include other common letters, and avoid the excluded ones.

    We can try ""FIGHT"" -> but no E and no L.

    We must include E because we are trying to find its position.

    How about ""LIGHT""? -> no E.

    We must include E.

    How about ""THEFT"" -> no L.

    We are not required to include L in the guess, but we know L is in the word, so if we don't include it, we'll get a '-' for L in the feedback? No, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. If we don't guess L, we won't get feedback on L. But we already know L is at position 5, so it's not critical to include it.

    However, to make progress on the other letters, we can guess a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and doesn't include L.

    For example, ""THEFT"": 
        T, H, E, F, T -> E at position 3. 
        But it has two T's? And no L. 
        We can use this to test T, H, F.

    But then we won't get information about the other letters in the secret word.

    Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" -> no E.

    How about ""DOZEN"" -> N excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""BOXED"" -> no L, and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be '-', but we already know that.

    Let's choose a word with E at position 1: 
        ""EVERY"" -> E, V, E, R, Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBER"" -> E, M, B, E, R -> R excluded -> invalid.
        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> no R, no A, no C, no S, no P, no I, no N. And R is excluded, so this is valid? 
        ""EMBED"": E at 1 and 4? But we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so the E at position 4 in ""EMBED"" would be a problem.

        However, we are guessing to test. The secret word has E, but not at 4 or 5. So if we guess ""EMBED"", the E at 1 might be correct or not, and the E at 4 will be marked as '-' or 'x'? Since the secret word has E but not at 4, the E at 4 in the guess will be marked as '-' only if there is another occurrence of E that is not at 4? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If it's not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know the word has at least one E, but it might have two.

        This is getting complicated.

    Given the complexity, let's go back to the known information and try to list possible words.

    The secret word: 
        Position 5: L
        Contains E (not at 4 or 5, so at 1, 2, or 3)
        Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I

    So the word is in the form: 
        [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]L

    With letter1, letter2, or letter3 being E.

    And letter4 is not E (because E is not at 4).

    And the letters are from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, S, P, I.

    Common letters left: B, D, E, G, H, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

    We can try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses common letters.

    For example, with E at position 1:
        E _ _ _ L
        Possible words: 
          ""EQUAL"" -> Q and A -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EVERY"" -> V, E, R, Y -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXCEL"" -> X, C -> C excluded -> invalid.
          ""EXPEL"" -> X, P -> P excluded -> invalid.
          ""EASEL"" -> A, S -> both excluded -> invalid.
          ""EAGLE"" -> A, G -> A excluded -> invalid.
          ""EDGEL"" -> not a word.
          ""EIGHT"" -> I, G, H, T -> I excluded -> invalid.
          ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we have L at position 2 and 5? And E at 1 and 5? But position 5 is L, not E. And we have two E's? 
          ""ELUDE"": positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:U, 4:D, 5:E -> but we need position 5 to be L, so not.

        I can't find a common word with E at 1 and ending with L without the excluded letters.

    E at position 2:
        _ E _ _ L
        Examples:
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5, and E at 2 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed, so this word would have E at 4 which is invalid for the secret word. So ""LEVEL"" cannot be the secret word because it has E at position 4, which we know is not allowed.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.
          ""BETEL"" -> B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> invalid.
          ""REBEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> Y, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.
          ""NEWEL"" -> N, E, W, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

        How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded -> invalid.
        "" pencil"" -> not 5 letters.

        It's hard.

    E at position 3:
        _ _ E _ L
        Examples:
          ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4 -> E at 4 not allowed.
          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and L at 4 and 5. This is a word. And it doesn't use excluded letters? Q, U, E, L, L. Q and U are allowed (not excluded). 
          ""QUELl"" is a word (a crosspiece in a window frame or a verb meaning to die down).

          But let's check: positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> so E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5. 
          But we know that in the secret word, position 5 is L, and position 4 is not E (which is satisfied because position 4 is L, not E). 
          However, we have L at position 4, which might be correct or not? We don't know about position 4 yet.

          The secret word has L only at position 5? Or could it have L at position 4 as well? We don't know.

          ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.

          Another example: ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> positions: 1:D, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> E at 3.

          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.

          ""CREEL"" -> C and R excluded -> invalid.

          "" kneel"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.

          ""SPIEL"" -> already guessed.

        So possible words: ""QUELL"", ""DWELL"", and perhaps others.

        "" hotel"" -> not.

        "" motel"" -> not.

        "" barrel"" -> not 5 letters.

        So among these, ""DWELL"" uses more common letters than ""QUELL"".

    Given the above, we can try ""DWELL"" as the next guess.

    But note: ""DWELL"" has two L's. We know L is at position 5, but it might also be at position 4? We don't know.

    If we guess ""DWELL"", the feedback might be:

        D: ? 
        W: ?
        E: ? (at position 3)
        L: at position 4 and 5.

    We know position 5 is L, so that will be ✓.
    Position 4 is L: if the secret word has L at position 4, then it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be '-' or 'x'? But if the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 in the guess would be '-' (because L is in the word but not at position 4) or 'x' if there is only one L and it's at 5? 

    According to Wordle rules, if there is only one L in the secret word, and we guess two L's, then one of them will be ✓ (if in the correct position) and the other will be 'x' (because there's only one). But if there are two L's, then both could be ✓ or one ✓ and one '-'.

    We don't know if there is more than one L.

    Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and doesn't have L at position 4, to avoid confusion.

    How about "" power"" -> not 5 letters ending with L.

    Another word: ""Hovel"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L -> but E at position 4 is not allowed, so invalid for our guess because we know E is not at 4.

    How about "" rowel"" -> R excluded.

    "" towel"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" vowel"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.

    "" dowel"" -> D, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    So it's hard to avoid.

    Perhaps ""DWELL"" is a reasonable guess.

    Or ""QUELL"".

    Let's choose ""DWELL"" because it uses more common letters.

    Guess: dwell

    But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L's.

    Another possibility: ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.

    After careful thought, I recall that we have not used T, O, H, M, U, etc.

    How about we try a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, and includes T, O, H, and also includes L at position 5? 

    For example, "" hotel"" is not.

    How about "" moth"" -> not 5 letters.

    Let's try to construct: 
        We want: _ _ _ _ L, with one of the first three being E, and the fourth not E.

        With common letters: say, T, O, H.

        For example, if E at 1: ""TE? ? L"" -> ""tepal"" -> not common, and A.
                       ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.

        E at 2: ""? E? ? L"" -> ""METAL"" -> A excluded.
                 "" method"" -> not 5 letters.

        E at 3: ""??E?L"" -> ""THEWL"" -> not a common word.
                 ""TOKEN"" -> not ending with L.

        "" model"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.

    Given the difficulty, I think we should guess ""DWELL"" or ""QUELL"". Let's choose ""DWELL"".

    But we have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are at try 3.

    Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't end with L but has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and also includes L in a different position to see if there is another L.

    For example, ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2, L at position 3.

    This way, we can test:
        B, E, L, O, W.
        We know L is in the word, but if we put it at position 3, and the secret word has L only at position 5, then L will be marked as '-' (present but not at 3).
        E at position 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, it will be '?', or if not, then '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so it will be '-' if not at 2, or '✓' if at 2.

    This might give us information about the position of E and also test B, O, W.

    So let's consider ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    This guess: 
        B at 1, E at 2, L at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

    We know that in the secret word:
        - L is at position 5, so W at 5 will be 'x' (because it's not L) and L at position 3 will be '-' (because L is in the word but not at 3, since it's at 5).
        - E at 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, then '✓', else '-'.
        - B and O: we don't know.

    But we can get information about B and O.

    So this guess might be informative.

    Let's compare with ""DWELL"":

        ""DWELL"": tests D, W, E, L (at 4 and 5). We know L at 5 will be '✓', and L at 4 will be 'x' or '-' or '✓' (if there is L at 4). E at 3 will be '✓' if E is at 3, else '-' or 'x'? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 3, then '-'.

    Both are valid.

    I think ""BELOW"" is better because it tests more new letters (B, O, W) and doesn't repeat L, so less ambiguity.

    So I'll go with ""BELOW"".

    Guess: below

    Format: <guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at position 4 or 5** (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, N, S, P, I.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., B, O, W, D, T) to gather more information.
- Since L is confirmed at position 5, the guess does not need to end with L, but placing L elsewhere can provide positional feedback.

Selected **""below""** because:
- Places **E at position 2** (testing a new position for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **B, O, W**.
- Includes **L at position 3** to check if it appears elsewhere (though we know it must be at position 5, this may reveal if there are multiple L's).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

<guess>below</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)
Guess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""below"":
  B(x) -> B is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 2.
  L(-) -> L is in the word but not at position 3 (we already know L is at position 5, so this is consistent).
  O(x) -> O is not in the word.
  W(x) -> W is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, B, O, W (all marked 'x' in previous guesses)
- Confirmed: 
    - L is at position 5 (from guess 2: L(✓) at position 5)
    - E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3.

The secret word pattern: 
    Position 1: ? (could be E or another letter)
    Position 2: ? (cannot be E, and not any excluded letter)
    Position 3: ? (could be E or another letter, but note: if E is at 3, then position 1 is not E; if E is at 1, then position 3 is not E)
    Position 4: ? (cannot be E, and not excluded)
    Position 5: L

Excluded letters: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W

Available letters: D, E, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y, and possibly others.

We must include E in position 1 or 3.

We have two cases:
  Case 1: E at position 1 -> word pattern: E _ _ _ L
  Case 2: E at position 3 -> word pattern: _ _ E _ L

We need to choose a guess that helps distinguish between these cases and tests new letters.

We can try to cover both cases by choosing a word that has E at position 1 and also tests common letters for the other positions.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E at position 3 to see if it gets a check.

But let's think of words that fit one of the patterns and use common available letters.

First, for case 1 (E at 1): 
    E _ _ _ L
    We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with available letters, avoiding excluded ones.

    Possible words:
        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded -> invalid.
        ""EDGED"" -> D and G, but ends with D? We need L at the end -> invalid.
        ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""EVENT"" -> V and T, but ends with T -> invalid.
        ""EXILE"" -> I and X? I excluded -> invalid.
        ""EQUAL"" -> U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.

    How about ""EMMET""? -> E, M, M, E, T -> but we need L at the end -> invalid.

    We need the word to end with L.

    So: E _ _ _ L

    Examples:
        ""EXPEL"" -> X and P excluded -> invalid.
        ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
        ""EVERL"" -> not a word.
        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.

    It's hard to find a common word.

    How about ""EQUAL"" -> but A excluded.

    Another: ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.

    This case might be less likely.

Case 2: E at position 3: _ _ E _ L

    Examples:
        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is L, so position 4 would be L as well? 
        ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> but D and W are excluded (from guess 3: D and W were not tested in guess 3? Wait, in guess 3 we had B, E, L, O, W -> W was marked 'x', so W is excluded. D was not tested? But we don't know about D.

        In guess 3, we tested B, E, L, O, W. D was not tested.

        But ""DWELL"" has D and W. W is excluded (from guess 3: W(x)), so we cannot use W.

        ""QUELL"": Q and U are not excluded, but we don't know about them.

        Other words:
          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.
          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.
          ""KNEEL"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.
          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> W excluded -> invalid.
          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so this word would have E at 4 which is not allowed. So it cannot be the secret word.
          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> O excluded (from guess 3: O(x)) -> invalid.
          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> O excluded -> invalid.
          ""YODEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A and P excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TABLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""FABLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""GAVEL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""NOVEL"" -> O and N excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""HOVEL"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""DOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""MOTEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""VOWEL"" -> O and W excluded -> invalid.

        How about ""TIGER"" -> not ending with L.

        This is difficult.

    Let's list available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y, E (but E must be at 1 or 3), and L (at 5).

    We need a word of the form _ _ E _ L.

    With available letters for the first two and the fourth.

    Possibilities:
        - First two: try common consonants: T, H, M, D, etc.
        - Fourth: try common: T, D, H, etc.

    Examples:
        ""THE"" + letter + ""L"" -> ""THE?L"" -> ""THETL"" not a word.
        ""THENL"" not a word.
        ""THECL"" not.

        ""THEEL"" -> not a word.

        ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

        ""FETAL"" -> A excluded.

        ""HEMAL"" -> A excluded.

        ""DEMUR"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HEDYL"" -> not a word.

        ""MEDIA"" -> not ending with L.

        ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.

        ""HELLO"" -> not ending with L.

        ""JELLY"" -> not ending with L.

        ""KELLY"" -> K, E, L, L, Y -> but we need E at 3? K at 1, E at 2, L at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> not matching pattern.

        We need E at position 3.

        How about ""TEXEL"" -> T, E, X, E, L -> but E at position 2 and 4? And X is not excluded? But we need E at 3. This has E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""LYTEL"" -> not a word.

        ""BYTEL"" -> not.

        ""HYMEL"" -> not.

        ""GEMEL"" -> G, E, M, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""HEVEL"" -> not.

        ""REVEL"" -> R excluded.

        ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded.

        ""KEVEL"" -> K, E, V, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> not.

        ""BEVEL"" -> B excluded.

        ""LEVEL"" -> not valid because of E at 4.

        After research, I recall ""towel"" is a word but O and W excluded.

        Another idea: ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

        How about ""HUTCH"" -> not.

        I am considering: ""FECAL"" -> A excluded.

        This is very challenging.

    Given the difficulty, perhaps case 1 (E at 1) is more likely, and we should try to find a word for that.

    Case 1: E at 1, then _ _ _ L at the end.

    We need: E ? ? ? L

    Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y.

    Examples:
        ""EQUAL"" -> A excluded.
        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.
        ""EIGHT"" -> I and G, H, T -> I excluded.
        ""EIGHT"" is not valid.

        ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.

        ""EDGES"" -> S excluded.

        ""EGRET"" -> R excluded.

        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded.

        ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we need L at position 5, so this ends with E, not L.

        ""ELINT"" -> not ending with L.

        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> B excluded and not ending with L.

        ""EMPTY"" -> P excluded.

        ""ENVOY"" -> N excluded.

        ""EPOCH"" -> P and O excluded.

        ""ETHYL"" -> E, T, H, Y, L -> this is a word! 
            Positions: 1:E, 2:T, 3:H, 4:Y, 5:L -> so E at 1, and L at 5.

        And it uses T, H, Y, which are available.

        So ""ETHYL"" is a valid guess.

        Also, it doesn't use any excluded letters.

    So we can guess ""ETHYL"".

    This tests:
        E at position 1: if the secret word has E at 1, then we get a check.
        T at 2, H at 3, Y at 4: we don't know.

    If the secret word is ""ETHYL"", then we win.

    If not, we get feedback on T, H, Y.

    But note: we are not sure if E is at 1 or 3. If we guess ""ETHYL"" and E is not at 1, then we'll know E must be at 3.

    So this guess can help distinguish.

    Alternatively, we could guess a word that has E at position 3 to test that case.

    For example, for case 2: _ _ E _ L, we can try ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> but we need L at the end, so not.

    Or ""THYML"" -> not a word.

    ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

    ""HUTCH"" -> not.

    So ""ETHYL"" seems a good choice.

    Let's go with ""ETHYL"".

    Guess: ethyl

    Format: <guess>ethyl</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W (all marked 'x' in previous guesses).
- **Confirmed Letters**:
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.
  - **E** is in the word but **not at positions 2, 4, or 5** (so it must be at position 1 or 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** in position 1 or 3.
- Must **avoid** all excluded letters (A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, H, Y, D, M, G) to gather more information.
- The word must end with **L** (position 5 is fixed).

Selected **""ethyl""** because:
- Places **E at position 1** (testing one of the two possible positions for E).
- Tests new high-frequency letters: **T, H, Y**.
- Ends with **L** (position 5 is confirmed).
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- If E is correct at position 1, this could solve the puzzle; if not, it confirms E must be at position 3.

But A is excluded, so we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A. So let\'s think of words without A, C, R, N.\n\n Another common word: ""POISE"" - but it has O, I, S, E. However, we don\'t know about O, I, S.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" - but E is at the end again, and we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for E was (-) meaning it\'s in the word but not at the 5th position.

And it avoids A, C, R, N.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, P, I, L.\n\n However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that E is present and not at the end.

Actually, the positions are:\n\n Position 1: S\n Position 2: P\n Position 3: I\n Position 4: E\n Position 5: L\n\n So E is at the 4th position, which is not the 5th.

But it has two E\'s. And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are putting E at the 2nd and 5th. The 5th is the end, which we know is wrong for E, so the E at the 5th would be incorrect.

But F, E, I, S, T -> no A, C, R, N.\n\n Words with E at position 3:\n   ""CHEAP"" -> C and A excluded -> invalid.\n   ""TREAD"" -> R and A excluded -> invalid.\n   ""STEAM"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n Words with E at position 4:\n   ""SPIKE"" -> E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and then the fifth is K. So E is at 4, which is not the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So E at 4 is acceptable.\n\n   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> but E is at the 5th? Wait, no: \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: K -> wait, no: the word is S-P-I-K-E? \n        Actually, ""spike"" is S-P-I-K-E, so:\n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: K\n        Position 5: E -> so E is at the end. We must avoid.\n\n   We need E at position 4 and then a letter at 5 that is not E? But we are putting E at 4, so the fifth is another letter.\n\n   How about ""SPIEL"": \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: P\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: L -> so E is at position 4, which is not the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   Similarly, ""SHIED"": \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: H\n        Position 3: I\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: D\n\n   Or ""PLIED"": P, L, I, E, D -> E at position 4.\n\n   Or ""TRIED"" -> but R is excluded.\n\n   So we can use ""SPIEL"", ""SHIED"", or ""PLIED"".\n\n   Let\'s choose one that has common letters. \n\n   ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. \n   ""SHIED"" uses S, H, I, E, D.\n\n   Both are valid.\n\n   We can also consider ""OWLED"" but it\'s not common.\n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end.\n\n   How about ""BELOW""? \n        B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And no A, C, R, N.\n\n   This is also a possibility.\n\n   We have several options: \n     Option 1: ""EIGHT"" (E at 1)\n     Option 2: ""BELOW"" (E at 2)\n     Option 3: ""SPIEL"" (E at 4)\n\n   We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": tests E, I, G, H, T -> 5 new letters.\n   ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> 5 new letters.\n   ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> 5 new letters, but E is repeated? No, only one E.\n\n   However, we already know E is in the word, so we are using that to our advantage.\n\n   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. So putting E in different positions might help.\n\n   Since we know E is not at position 5, we can try to put it at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the other positions.\n\n   Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it has E at position 2 and tests B, L, O, W which are common.\n\n   But we can also choose ""SPIEL"" to test S and P.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other common letters like T, S, L.\n\n   How about ""STOLE""? But E at the end -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""STEEL""? Two E\'s and E at the end -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""SETUP""? But U and P, and E at position 2. But ""setup"" is 5 letters: S-E-T-U-P. That\'s valid. But we don\'t know about S, T, U, P.\n\n   However, we are avoiding A, C, R, N.\n\n   But note: we have only one E so far, and we are putting E at position 2. This is acceptable.\n\n   But ""SETUP"" might be less common.\n\n   I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\n   Let me decide: ""BELOW""\n\n   B E L O W\n\n   If we get feedback:\n     If E is at position 2, we get a check for E? Or if it\'s in the word but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   But we know E is in the word, so we will get at least a minus for E.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other vowels.\n\n   Since we know A is out, we can test I and O.\n\n   ""BELOW"" has O.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n   But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""below"" is a valid word.\n\n   So second guess: ""BELOW""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   However, note that we are not required to get the word in the second guess, just to get more information.\n\n   Let me write the guess: below\n\n   But wait, what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""BELOW"", the E at position 2 would be a minus, and we wouldn\'t know about position 1.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a word that has E at position 1 and also tests other letters.\n\n   How about ""EIGHT"" as I thought earlier? It tests E at position 1.\n\n   But we don\'t know if E is at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.\n\n   We can try to cover more ground by choosing a word that has E in a position that we haven\'t used and also tests more common letters.\n\n   Another idea: ""TOUCH"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n   We must include E.\n\n   How about ""THEIR""? \n        T, H, E, I, R -> but R is excluded. So invalid.\n\n   How about ""THIEF""? \n        T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4. And no A, C, R, N.\n\n   This is a valid word.\n\n   But we are testing F, which is less common.\n\n   How about ""SHINE""? \n        S, H, I, N, E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.\n\n   Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.\n\n   After reconsideration, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice because:\n     - It has E at position 4 (a new position, not the end)\n     - It tests S, P, I, L (all common) and we know E is present.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""SPIEL"".\n\n   Guess: spiel\n\n   Format: <guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed present), but **not in the 5th position**.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) and position E in a new location (positions 1–4) to gather more information.\n\nSelected ""**spiel**"" because:\n- Places E in the **4th position** (a new location to test).\n- Uses new high-frequency letters: S, P, I, L.\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word.

So we should avoid C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, U, D, M, H, G, B, Y, etc.\n\nWe know the word has E and L (with L at the end). So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ L\n\nAnd E is in one of the first three positions.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits this pattern and uses new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- E at position 1: e.g., ""E? ? ? L"" -> words like ""EXCEL"" but C is excluded -> invalid. Or ""EAGLE"" but A and E (A is excluded) -> invalid. \n  We need without A, C, R, N, S, P, I.\n\n  How about ""EIGHT"" -> but H and G are allowed? But ""EIGHT"" ends with T, not L. We need to end with L.\n\n  So we need words ending with L and starting with E? But we don\'t know if E is at position 1.\n\n  Let\'s think of words ending with L that have E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\n  Examples:\n    Position 1: ""EXCEL"" (invalid due to C), ""EASEL"" (A and S excluded), ""EERIE"" (not ending with L) -> not working.\n\n    Position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but double L? And we have L at the end, but in ""HELLO"", the L is at position 4 and 5? Actually: H-E-L-L-O -> not ending with L? It ends with O. We need ending with L.\n\n    How about ""BELL"" -> too short.\n\n    We need 5 letters: _ _ _ _ L\n\n    With E at position 2: ? E ? ? L\n\n    Examples: ""LEVEL"" -> but V and E, and also E at position 1 and 3? But we don\'t know about V. However, we have to avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, I. V is allowed.\n\n    But ""LEVEL"": \n        Position 1: L -> but we already have L at the end, and if L is at position 1, that\'s allowed? But we don\'t know if L is at position 1. Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only one? We don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s.\n\n    Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had one E and it was not at the end, and in ""spiel"" we had one E and it was not at the 4th. But it could be that the word has two E\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us the count, only that E is present. So it could have more than one.\n\n    However, to keep it simple, let\'s assume we are looking for words with E and L (with L at the end) and without the excluded letters.\n\n    Words with E at position 2 and ending with L: \n        ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> but J is not very common, and two E\'s? \n        ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> two E\'s and two L\'s? \n\n    But we don\'t know if the word has multiple letters.\n\n    Alternatively, E at position 3: ? ? E ? L\n\n    Examples: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait: \n        H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at position 4. But we already know from guess 2 that E is not at position 4 (because in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got \'-\'). So E cannot be at position 4.\n\n    Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 3, but we just saw that position 4 is not allowed (from guess 2). And position 5 is L, so E cannot be at 5. So positions 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.\n\n    But we also learned from guess 1 that E is not at position 5 (which we already knew) and from guess 2 that E is not at position 4.\n\n    So E must be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\n    Now, for the word ""HOTEL"", if we consider it, E is at position 4, which we now know is impossible. So we cannot use that.\n\n    How about E at position 3: \n        Example: ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at position 4? \n        M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5) -> again E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n    We need E at position 3: meaning the third letter is E.\n\n    So pattern: _ _ E _ L\n\n    Examples: \n        ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> two E\'s? \n        ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> but we have L at the end and also at position 4? And Q and U are less common.\n\n    How about ""HOTEL"" is not because E is at 4.\n\n    Another example: ""LABEL"" -> but L is at position 1 and 5? And A is excluded.\n\n    How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.\n\n    We need words ending with L and having E at position 3.\n\n    Let me think: \n        ""REBEL"" -> R is excluded.\n        ""LEVEL"" -> E at position 2 and 4? \n            L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so E is at 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if E is at 4? We know E is not at 4 from guess 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E (because in ""spiel"", we put E at 4 and it was marked as \'-\', meaning E is not at 4). So in ""LEVEL"", if we put it, the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct? But we are not sure.\n\n        However, we are making a guess to test, so we can use ""LEVEL"" to test multiple things? But it has two E\'s and two L\'s.\n\n    Alternatively, let\'s find a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, ends with L, and uses only available letters.\n\n    Since we are struggling, let\'s list possible words:\n\n    E at 1: \n        E _ _ _ L\n        Examples: \n          ""EAGLE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EASEL"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EXILE"" -> X and I excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EMAIL"" -> A and I excluded -> invalid.\n          ""ELBOW"" -> but ends with W, not L -> invalid.\n          ""ENDED"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        How about ""EQUAL"" -> Q, U, A -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n        It\'s hard. Maybe E at 1 is not common with L at the end without the excluded letters.\n\n    E at 2:\n        _ E _ _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""LEVEL"" -> L at 1 and 5, E at 2 and 4 -> but E at 4 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 4), so if the word has E at 4, it would be wrong. But in ""LEVEL"", there is an E at 2 and at 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. But we can try it? \n          However, we are avoiding excluded letters: L is allowed (we know it\'s in the word), V is not excluded. So ""LEVEL"" is a candidate? But we have to consider that the E at position 4 would be incorrect, but the E at position 2 might be correct.\n\n          But note: the feedback for E in the secret word: we only know there is at least one E. It could be that the word has two E\'s, one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we know from guess 2 that position 4 is not E. So the E at position 4 in ""LEVEL"" would be marked as \'-\' (if the word has an E at 4) or \'x\' (if not). But we know the secret word does not have E at 4, so if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at 4 would be marked as \'x\' (because it\'s not present? But wait, if the word has two E\'s, one at 2 and one at 4, then the E at 4 would be present but in the wrong position? No, because we know E is not at position 4, so the secret word cannot have E at 4. Therefore, if we guess ""LEVEL"", the E at position 4 would be an extra E that is not in the word? Or if the word has only one E (at position 2), then the E at 4 would be incorrect.\n\n          Actually, the feedback for ""spiel"" told us that the letter E in position 4 is not the correct position for E. It does not tell us that there is no E at position 4 in the secret word? It tells us that the secret word has E, but not at position 4. So the secret word has E in some other position, but it might have another E? We don\'t know.\n\n          However, to avoid complexity, let\'s try to find a word with only one E.\n\n    E at 3:\n        _ _ E _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""HOTEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""MODEL"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""WHEEL"" -> E at 3 and 4? W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed -> so if we use it, the E at 4 would be wrong.\n          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5? \n          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> E at 4 is not allowed.\n\n        How about ""METAL"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""BETEL"" -> E at 2? B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.\n\n        ""OCTEL"" -> not a word.\n\n        ""DUTEL"" -> not a word.\n\n        ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.\n\n        It\'s difficult.\n\n    After re-examining, I recall that we don\'t necessarily have to fix the L at the end in our guess. We can try a word that doesn\'t have L at the end to test other positions for E and other letters. But we know L is at position 5, so if we don\'t put L at the end, we might get feedback on L again? But we already know L is at position 5, so if we put L in a different position, it would be marked as \'-\' (if it\'s present but wrong position) or \'x\' (if not present, but we know it is present so it would be \'-\').\n\n    However, to maximize information, we might want to test more letters without fixing the known L.\n\n    We know:\n      - The secret word has E and L (with L at position 5).\n      - E is in position 1, 2, or 3.\n      - Excluded: C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\n    We can try a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also has L but not at the end (so we can test where L is not, but we already know it\'s at 5, so putting it elsewhere would be a minus). And we can test other new letters.\n\n    For example, we can try ""BELOW"" again? But we didn\'t try it before. But ""BELOW"" has E at position 2 and ends with W, not L. And we know L is at position 5, so we can\'t put L at 5 in this guess? We can, but we are not required to.\n\n    How about ""TABLE""? But A is excluded.\n\n    How about ""LATHE""? But A excluded.\n\n    How about ""TOWEL""? \n        T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4. So that would be a bad choice.\n\n    How about ""DWELL""? \n        D, W, E, L, L -> E at position 3, and L at 4 and 5. But we know L is at position 5, so the L at 4 would be a minus? And we are testing D, W.\n\n    But ""DWELL"" has two L\'s, which is acceptable.\n\n    However, we are not sure about the position of E: we are putting it at 3, which is a possibility.\n\n    But we also have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\n    Another idea: ""MOTEL"" -> M, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.\n\n    How about ""HOTEL"" -> same.\n\n    Let\'s try to find a word with E at position 1: \n        ""LEAVE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""LEPER"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n        ""LEGAL"" -> A and G? A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""LEMEL"" -> not a word.\n\n    E at position 2:\n        ""WEIGH"" -> not ending with L, and no L -> but we know L is in the word, so we should include L? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t include L, we will get feedback that L is present (but not in the word we guessed) but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information about the position of L.\n\n    We know L is at position 5, so we can focus on the first four letters.\n\n    Let me think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3, and also include other common letters, and avoid the excluded ones.\n\n    We can try ""FIGHT"" -> but no E and no L.\n\n    We must include E because we are trying to find its position.\n\n    How about ""LIGHT""? -> no E.\n\n    We must include E.\n\n    How about ""THEFT"" -> no L.\n\n    We are not required to include L in the guess, but we know L is in the word, so if we don\'t include it, we\'ll get a \'-\' for L in the feedback? No, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. If we don\'t guess L, we won\'t get feedback on L. But we already know L is at position 5, so it\'s not critical to include it.\n\n    However, to make progress on the other letters, we can guess a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and doesn\'t include L.\n\n    For example, ""THEFT"": \n        T, H, E, F, T -> E at position 3. \n        But it has two T\'s? And no L. \n        We can use this to test T, H, F.\n\n    But then we won\'t get information about the other letters in the secret word.\n\n    Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" -> no E.\n\n    How about ""DOZEN"" -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n    How about ""BOXED"" -> no L, and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be \'-\', but we already know that.\n\n    Let\'s choose a word with E at position 1: \n        ""EVERY"" -> E, V, E, R, Y -> R is excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> N excluded -> invalid.\n        ""EMBER"" -> E, M, B, E, R -> R excluded -> invalid.\n        ""EMBED"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> no R, no A, no C, no S, no P, no I, no N. And R is excluded, so this is valid? \n        ""EMBED"": E at 1 and 4? But we know E is not at position 4 (from guess 2), so the E at position 4 in ""EMBED"" would be a problem.\n\n        However, we are guessing to test. The secret word has E, but not at 4 or 5. So if we guess ""EMBED"", the E at 1 might be correct or not, and the E at 4 will be marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Since the secret word has E but not at 4, the E at 4 in the guess will be marked as \'-\' only if there is another occurrence of E that is not at 4? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s \'-\'. If it\'s not in the word at all, it\'s \'x\'. But we know the word has at least one E, but it might have two.\n\n        This is getting complicated.\n\n    Given the complexity, let\'s go back to the known information and try to list possible words.\n\n    The secret word: \n        Position 5: L\n        Contains E (not at 4 or 5, so at 1, 2, or 3)\n        Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, I\n\n    So the word is in the form: \n        [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]L\n\n    With letter1, letter2, or letter3 being E.\n\n    And letter4 is not E (because E is not at 4).\n\n    And the letters are from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\n    Common letters left: B, D, E, G, H, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\n    We can try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses common letters.\n\n    For example, with E at position 1:\n        E _ _ _ L\n        Possible words: \n          ""EQUAL"" -> Q and A -> A excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EVERY"" -> V, E, R, Y -> R excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EXCEL"" -> X, C -> C excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EXPEL"" -> X, P -> P excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EASEL"" -> A, S -> both excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EAGLE"" -> A, G -> A excluded -> invalid.\n          ""EDGEL"" -> not a word.\n          ""EIGHT"" -> I, G, H, T -> I excluded -> invalid.\n          ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2? E, L, U, D, E -> but we have L at position 2 and 5? And E at 1 and 5? But position 5 is L, not E. And we have two E\'s? \n          ""ELUDE"": positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:U, 4:D, 5:E -> but we need position 5 to be L, so not.\n\n        I can\'t find a common word with E at 1 and ending with L without the excluded letters.\n\n    E at position 2:\n        _ E _ _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""LEVEL"" -> L, E, V, E, L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5, and E at 2 and 4. But E at 4 is not allowed, so this word would have E at 4 which is invalid for the secret word. So ""LEVEL"" cannot be the secret word because it has E at position 4, which we know is not allowed.\n          ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> again E at 4 not allowed.\n          ""BETEL"" -> B, E, T, E, L -> E at 2 and 4 -> invalid.\n          ""REBEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n          ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""MODEL"" -> M, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""YODEL"" -> Y, O, D, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n          ""NEWEL"" -> N, E, W, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.\n          ""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n        How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> I excluded -> invalid.\n        "" pencil"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        It\'s hard.\n\n    E at position 3:\n        _ _ E _ L\n        Examples:\n          ""WHEEL"" -> W, H, E, E, L -> E at 3 and 4 -> E at 4 not allowed.\n          ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> E at 3, and L at 4 and 5. This is a word. And it doesn\'t use excluded letters? Q, U, E, L, L. Q and U are allowed (not excluded). \n          ""QUELl"" is a word (a crosspiece in a window frame or a verb meaning to die down).\n\n          But let\'s check: positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> so E at 3, and then L at 4 and 5. \n          But we know that in the secret word, position 5 is L, and position 4 is not E (which is satisfied because position 4 is L, not E). \n          However, we have L at position 4, which might be correct or not? We don\'t know about position 4 yet.\n\n          The secret word has L only at position 5? Or could it have L at position 4 as well? We don\'t know.\n\n          ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.\n\n          Another example: ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> positions: 1:D, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> E at 3.\n\n          ""TWEET"" -> not ending with L.\n\n          ""GREET"" -> not ending with L.\n\n          ""CREEL"" -> C and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n          "" kneel"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n          ""SPIEL"" -> already guessed.\n\n        So possible words: ""QUELL"", ""DWELL"", and perhaps others.\n\n        "" hotel"" -> not.\n\n        "" motel"" -> not.\n\n        "" barrel"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        So among these, ""DWELL"" uses more common letters than ""QUELL"".\n\n    Given the above, we can try ""DWELL"" as the next guess.\n\n    But note: ""DWELL"" has two L\'s. We know L is at position 5, but it might also be at position 4? We don\'t know.\n\n    If we guess ""DWELL"", the feedback might be:\n\n        D: ? \n        W: ?\n        E: ? (at position 3)\n        L: at position 4 and 5.\n\n    We know position 5 is L, so that will be ✓.\n    Position 4 is L: if the secret word has L at position 4, then it would be ✓, but if not, then it might be \'-\' or \'x\'? But if the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 in the guess would be \'-\' (because L is in the word but not at position 4) or \'x\' if there is only one L and it\'s at 5? \n\n    According to Wordle rules, if there is only one L in the secret word, and we guess two L\'s, then one of them will be ✓ (if in the correct position) and the other will be \'x\' (because there\'s only one). But if there are two L\'s, then both could be ✓ or one ✓ and one \'-\'.\n\n    We don\'t know if there is more than one L.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and doesn\'t have L at position 4, to avoid confusion.\n\n    How about "" power"" -> not 5 letters ending with L.\n\n    Another word: ""Hovel"" -> H, O, V, E, L -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L -> but E at position 4 is not allowed, so invalid for our guess because we know E is not at 4.\n\n    How about "" rowel"" -> R excluded.\n\n    "" towel"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.\n\n    "" vowel"" -> V, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4 -> invalid.\n\n    "" dowel"" -> D, O, W, E, L -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n    So it\'s hard to avoid.\n\n    Perhaps ""DWELL"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n    Or ""QUELL"".\n\n    Let\'s choose ""DWELL"" because it uses more common letters.\n\n    Guess: dwell\n\n    But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L\'s.\n\n    Another possibility: ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.\n\n    After careful thought, I recall that we have not used T, O, H, M, U, etc.\n\n    How about we try a word that has E at position 1, 2, or 3, and includes T, O, H, and also includes L at position 5? \n\n    For example, "" hotel"" is not.\n\n    How about "" moth"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n    Let\'s try to construct: \n        We want: _ _ _ _ L, with one of the first three being E, and the fourth not E.\n\n        With common letters: say, T, O, H.\n\n        For example, if E at 1: ""TE? ? L"" -> ""tepal"" -> not common, and A.\n                       ""TEPID"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        E at 2: ""? E? ? L"" -> ""METAL"" -> A excluded.\n                 "" method"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        E at 3: ""??E?L"" -> ""THEWL"" -> not a common word.\n                 ""TOKEN"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        "" model"" -> E at 4 -> invalid.\n\n    Given the difficulty, I think we should guess ""DWELL"" or ""QUELL"". Let\'s choose ""DWELL"".\n\n    But we have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are at try 3.\n\n    Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t end with L but has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and tests new letters, and also includes L in a different position to see if there is another L.\n\n    For example, ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2, L at position 3.\n\n    This way, we can test:\n        B, E, L, O, W.\n        We know L is in the word, but if we put it at position 3, and the secret word has L only at position 5, then L will be marked as \'-\' (present but not at 3).\n        E at position 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, it will be \'?\', or if not, then \'-\' or \'x\'? But we know E is in the word, so it will be \'-\' if not at 2, or \'✓\' if at 2.\n\n    This might give us information about the position of E and also test B, O, W.\n\n    So let\'s consider ""BELOW"".\n\n    Guess: below\n\n    This guess: \n        B at 1, E at 2, L at 3, O at 4, W at 5.\n\n    We know that in the secret word:\n        - L is at position 5, so W at 5 will be \'x\' (because it\'s not L) and L at position 3 will be \'-\' (because L is in the word but not at 3, since it\'s at 5).\n        - E at 2: if the secret word has E at position 2, then \'✓\', else \'-\'.\n        - B and O: we don\'t know.\n\n    But we can get information about B and O.\n\n    So this guess might be informative.\n\n    Let\'s compare with ""DWELL"":\n\n        ""DWELL"": tests D, W, E, L (at 4 and 5). We know L at 5 will be \'✓\', and L at 4 will be \'x\' or \'-\' or \'✓\' (if there is L at 4). E at 3 will be \'✓\' if E is at 3, else \'-\' or \'x\'? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 3, then \'-\'.\n\n    Both are valid.\n\n    I think ""BELOW"" is better because it tests more new letters (B, O, W) and doesn\'t repeat L, so less ambiguity.\n\n    So I\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n    Guess: below\n\n    Format: <guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I (not in the word at all).\n- **Confirmed Letters**: \n  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.\n  - **E** is in the word but **not at position 4 or 5** (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, N, S, P, I.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., B, O, W, D, T) to gather more information.\n- Since L is confirmed at position 5, the guess does not need to end with L, but placing L elsewhere can provide positional feedback.\n\nSelected **""below""** because:\n- Places **E at position 2** (testing a new position for E).\n- Tests new high-frequency letters: **B, O, W**.\n- Includes **L at position 3** to check if it appears elsewhere (though we know it must be at position 5, this may reveal if there are multiple L\'s).\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\nGuess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""below"":\n  B(x) -> B is not in the word.\n  E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 2.\n  L(-) -> L is in the word but not at position 3 (we already know L is at position 5, so this is consistent).\n  O(x) -> O is not in the word.\n  W(x) -> W is not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, B, O, W (all marked \'x\' in previous guesses)\n- Confirmed: \n    - L is at position 5 (from guess 2: L(✓) at position 5)\n    - E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1).

L\n\n    Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, Y.\n\n    Examples:\n        ""EQUAL"" -> A excluded.\n        ""EVILL"" -> not a word.\n        ""EIGHT"" -> I and G, H, T -> I excluded.\n        ""EIGHT"" is not valid.\n\n        ""EDUCE"" -> not ending with L.\n\n        ""EDGES"" -> S excluded.\n\n        ""EGRET"" -> R excluded.\n\n        ""EJECT"" -> J and C excluded.\n\n        ""ELUDE"" -> L at position 2?

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""ethyl"":
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 1.
  T(x) -> T is not in the word.
  H(x) -> H is not in the word.
  Y(x) -> Y is not in the word.
  L(✓) -> L is at position 5 (already known).

So now we know:
- E is not at position 1 (and not at 2, 4, or 5). Therefore, E must be at position 3.
- T, H, Y are not in the word.

Previously excluded letters: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W, T, H, Y.

Now excluded: A, B, C, H, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, W, Y.

Available letters: D, F, G, K, M, U, V, and E (which we now know is at position 3), and L (at 5).

The secret word pattern: 
  Position 1: ? (must be one of the available letters, not E)
  Position 2: ? (available letters, not E)
  Position 3: E (now confirmed)
  Position 4: ? (available letters, not E and not L? but L is at 5, so position 4 can be L only if there are two L's? But we don't know)
  Position 5: L

So the word is: _ _ E _ L

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Available letters for positions 1, 2, 4: D, F, G, K, M, U, V.

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1][letter2]E[letter4]L

We can try to find such words.

Possible words:
  - ""LEVEL"": but we know E is at position 3? In ""LEVEL"": L, E, V, E, L -> E at position 2 and 4. But we need E at position 3. Also, we have E at 4 which is not allowed (from guess 2). And L is at 1 and 5. But we have L at 5, so if there is L at 1, that's allowed. However, in ""LEVEL"", position 3 is V, not E. So not.

  - ""JEWEL"": J is not available? J is not in the available list? We haven't excluded J, but we didn't test it. But we are limited to the available letters we listed: D, F, G, K, M, U, V. J is not in that list? We didn't use J, so it's not excluded, but we are focusing on common letters. However, we should consider all non-excluded letters.

  Let me list all non-excluded letters (not in the excluded list): 
    Excluded: A, B, C, H, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, W, Y
    So available: D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z

  But we know E is at position 3 and L at 5, so for positions 1,2,4: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

  However, we want common letters.

  Words: 
    ""LEVEL"" -> not, because position 3 is V, not E.
    ""MODEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.
    ""HOTEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.
    ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> this fits: _ _ E _ L -> Q U E L L.

  ""QUELL"" is a word (meaning: to suppress or subdue).

  But we have L at position 4 and 5. We know L is at 5, so if there is L at 4, that's allowed (double L).

  Other words:
    ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> but W is excluded -> invalid.
    ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> W excluded -> invalid.
    ""NEWEL"" -> N excluded -> invalid.
    ""REVEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
    ""BEVEL"" -> B excluded -> invalid.

  How about ""FECAL"" -> A and C excluded -> invalid.

  ""KNEEL"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.

  ""VEXEL"" -> not a common word.

  ""JUMEL"" -> not common.

  ""MOTEL"" -> O excluded.

  ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

  ""GAVEL"" -> A excluded.

  ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.

  ""HYMEL"" -> not a word.

  ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

  ""PEDAL"" -> P and A excluded.

  ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.

  ""VEGEL"" -> not a word.

  ""VIGIL"" -> I excluded.

  ""VODAL"" -> not a word.

  ""FUGAL"" -> A excluded.

  ""FUGUE"" -> not ending with L.

  ""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> O excluded -> invalid.

  ""MOULE"" -> O excluded.

  ""QUEME"" -> not ending with L.

  So ""QUELL"" seems a valid option.

  Another possibility: ""DUEL"" is 4 letters.

  ""DWELL"" is invalid because of W.

  ""GUILD"" -> not ending with L.

  ""BUILD"" -> B excluded.

  ""MUDDL"" -> not a word.

  ""MUDEL"" -> not a word.

  ""KUDZU"" -> not ending with L.

  ""QUILL"" -> Q, U, I, L, L -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""QUAFF"" -> not ending with L.

  So ""QUELL"" is a candidate.

  Another word: ""JELLY"" -> not ending with L? J, E, L, L, Y -> but we need E at position 3: so positions: 1:J, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> not matching (we need E at 3, but here E is at 2).

  How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.

  ""JUMBLE"" -> 6 letters.

  ""QUELL"" is 5 letters and fits: Q at 1, U at 2, E at 3, L at 4, L at 5.

  We haven't tested Q and U.

  We can try ""QUELL"".

  But note: we have only 2 guesses left.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more new letters, but we only have positions 1,2,4 to fill, and we know E at 3 and L at 5.

  We can try ""GULEL"" -> not a word.

  Or ""FUMEL"" -> not.

  Another word: ""MUTED"" -> not ending with L.

  ""MUTEL"" -> not a word.

  ""VEXED"" -> not.

  ""VEGEL"" -> not.

  After research, I find that ""QUELL"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

  We can also consider ""DUVET"" but it doesn't end with L.

  Another word: ""JUMAR"" -> not.

  Given the options, ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.

  But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L's. If we guess ""QUELL"", and the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 will be marked as 'x' (because there's only one L and it's at 5). But if it has two L's, then it might be correct.

  We can also try ""JEWEL"", but W is excluded.

  Or ""LEVEL"", but it doesn't have E at position 3.

  So I think ""QUELL"" is the best bet.

### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E is in the word, not at position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: spiel**  
   - S, P, I: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E not at position 4**.  
   - L: Correct position (✓) → **L is at position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3: below**  
   - B, O, W: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E not at position 2**.  
   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is not at position 3** (but we know it's at position 5).  

4. **Guess 4: ethyl**  
   - T, H, Y: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E not at position 1**.  
   - L: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **L at position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
- **E must be at position 3**:  
  - E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback).  
  - Only position 3 remains → **Secret word pattern: `_ _ E _ L`**.  
- **Excluded letters (absent)**: A, B, C, H, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, W, Y.  
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z (and E, L are confirmed but positioned).  
- **Focus**: Test high-frequency available letters (D, F, G, M, U, V) in positions 1, 2, and 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words fitting `_ _ E _ L`** with E at position 3 and L at position 5.  
- **Test new letters**: Use untested common letters (e.g., D, F, G, M, U, V) to gather maximum information.  
- **Avoid excluded letters** and reuse known information (E at 3, L at 5).  

### Selected Guess: **QUELL**
- **Why QUELL?**  
  - Fits pattern: `Q U E L L` → Positions: 1(Q), 2(U), 3(E), 4(L), 5(L).  
  - Tests **Q and U** (new high-frequency letters not yet tried).  
  - **L at position 4**: Checks if L appears elsewhere (if feedback shows L is correct at position 4, it confirms two L's; if not, L is only at position 5).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- **Expected Feedback**:  
  - If E is correctly placed at position 3, it will show (✓).  
  - Feedback on Q, U, and the second L will reveal if they exist in the word and their positions.  

<guess>quell</guess>",quell,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""ethyl"":
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 1.
  T(x) -> T is not in the word.
  H(x) -> H is not in the word.
  Y(x) -> Y is not in the word.
  L(✓) -> L is at position 5 (already known).

So now we know:
- E is not at position 1 (and not at 2, 4, or 5). Therefore, E must be at position 3.
- T, H, Y are not in the word.

Previously excluded letters: A, B, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, W, T, H, Y.

Now excluded: A, B, C, H, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, W, Y.

Available letters: D, F, G, K, M, U, V, and E (which we now know is at position 3), and L (at 5).

The secret word pattern: 
  Position 1: ? (must be one of the available letters, not E)
  Position 2: ? (available letters, not E)
  Position 3: E (now confirmed)
  Position 4: ? (available letters, not E and not L? but L is at 5, so position 4 can be L only if there are two L's? But we don't know)
  Position 5: L

So the word is: _ _ E _ L

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Available letters for positions 1, 2, 4: D, F, G, K, M, U, V.

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1][letter2]E[letter4]L

We can try to find such words.

Possible words:
  - ""LEVEL"": but we know E is at position 3? In ""LEVEL"": L, E, V, E, L -> E at position 2 and 4. But we need E at position 3. Also, we have E at 4 which is not allowed (from guess 2). And L is at 1 and 5. But we have L at 5, so if there is L at 1, that's allowed. However, in ""LEVEL"", position 3 is V, not E. So not.

  - ""JEWEL"": J is not available? J is not in the available list? We haven't excluded J, but we didn't test it. But we are limited to the available letters we listed: D, F, G, K, M, U, V. J is not in that list? We didn't use J, so it's not excluded, but we are focusing on common letters. However, we should consider all non-excluded letters.

  Let me list all non-excluded letters (not in the excluded list): 
    Excluded: A, B, C, H, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, W, Y
    So available: D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z

  But we know E is at position 3 and L at 5, so for positions 1,2,4: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

  However, we want common letters.

  Words: 
    ""LEVEL"" -> not, because position 3 is V, not E.
    ""MODEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.
    ""HOTEL"" -> O excluded -> invalid.
    ""QUELL"" -> Q, U, E, L, L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L -> this fits: _ _ E _ L -> Q U E L L.

  ""QUELL"" is a word (meaning: to suppress or subdue).

  But we have L at position 4 and 5. We know L is at 5, so if there is L at 4, that's allowed (double L).

  Other words:
    ""DWELL"" -> D, W, E, L, L -> but W is excluded -> invalid.
    ""JEWEL"" -> J, E, W, E, L -> W excluded -> invalid.
    ""NEWEL"" -> N excluded -> invalid.
    ""REVEL"" -> R excluded -> invalid.
    ""BEVEL"" -> B excluded -> invalid.

  How about ""FECAL"" -> A and C excluded -> invalid.

  ""KNEEL"" -> K, N, E, E, L -> N excluded -> invalid.

  ""VEXEL"" -> not a common word.

  ""JUMEL"" -> not common.

  ""MOTEL"" -> O excluded.

  ""DUVET"" -> not ending with L.

  ""GAVEL"" -> A excluded.

  ""HAZEL"" -> A and Z? A excluded.

  ""HYMEL"" -> not a word.

  ""METAL"" -> A excluded.

  ""PEDAL"" -> P and A excluded.

  ""MEDAL"" -> A excluded.

  ""VEGEL"" -> not a word.

  ""VIGIL"" -> I excluded.

  ""VODAL"" -> not a word.

  ""FUGAL"" -> A excluded.

  ""FUGUE"" -> not ending with L.

  ""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> O excluded -> invalid.

  ""MOULE"" -> O excluded.

  ""QUEME"" -> not ending with L.

  So ""QUELL"" seems a valid option.

  Another possibility: ""DUEL"" is 4 letters.

  ""DWELL"" is invalid because of W.

  ""GUILD"" -> not ending with L.

  ""BUILD"" -> B excluded.

  ""MUDDL"" -> not a word.

  ""MUDEL"" -> not a word.

  ""KUDZU"" -> not ending with L.

  ""QUILL"" -> Q, U, I, L, L -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""QUAFF"" -> not ending with L.

  So ""QUELL"" is a candidate.

  Another word: ""JELLY"" -> not ending with L? J, E, L, L, Y -> but we need E at position 3: so positions: 1:J, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> not matching (we need E at 3, but here E is at 2).

  How about ""JETTY"" -> not ending with L.

  ""JUMBLE"" -> 6 letters.

  ""QUELL"" is 5 letters and fits: Q at 1, U at 2, E at 3, L at 4, L at 5.

  We haven't tested Q and U.

  We can try ""QUELL"".

  But note: we have only 2 guesses left.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more new letters, but we only have positions 1,2,4 to fill, and we know E at 3 and L at 5.

  We can try ""GULEL"" -> not a word.

  Or ""FUMEL"" -> not.

  Another word: ""MUTED"" -> not ending with L.

  ""MUTEL"" -> not a word.

  ""VEXED"" -> not.

  ""VEGEL"" -> not.

  After research, I find that ""QUELL"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

  We can also consider ""DUVET"" but it doesn't end with L.

  Another word: ""JUMAR"" -> not.

  Given the options, ""QUELL"" is a valid guess.

  But note: we are not sure if the secret word has two L's. If we guess ""QUELL"", and the secret word has only one L (at position 5), then the L at position 4 will be marked as 'x' (because there's only one L and it's at 5). But if it has two L's, then it might be correct.

  We can also try ""JEWEL"", but W is excluded.

  Or ""LEVEL"", but it doesn't have E at position 3.

  So I think ""QUELL"" is the best bet.

1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E is in the word, not at position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: spiel**  
   - S, P, I: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E not at position 4**.  
   - L: Correct position (✓) → **L is at position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3: below**  
   - B, O, W: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E not at position 2**.  
   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is not at position 3** (but we know it's at position 5).  

4. **Guess 4: ethyl**  
   - T, H, Y: Absent (x)  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → **E not at position 1**.  
   - L: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **L at position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
- **E must be at position 3**:  
  - E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback).  
  - Only position 3 remains → **Secret word pattern: `_ _ E _ L`**.  
- **Excluded letters (absent)**: A, B, C, H, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, W, Y.  
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z (and E, L are confirmed but positioned).  
- **Focus**: Test high-frequency available letters (D, F, G, M, U, V) in positions 1, 2, and 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
