We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in:
C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all.
- R: is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in ""crane"").
- A: is in the word but not in the third position.
- N: not in the word.
- E: not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The word contains the letters R and A, but they are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- We have eliminated C, N, and E. So the word cannot have these letters.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

We need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are present), and avoids C, N, E.

Additionally, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we should try to place R and A in different positions.

Let's try to think of words that include R and A, and use other common consonants. Avoid positions 2 for R and position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback tells us that in the guess ""crane"", R (in position 2) is not correct, so R might be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, the feedback is:

Position: 1: C (x) -> not in word
         2: R (-) -> in word, not here
         3: A (-) -> in word, not here
         4: N (x) -> not in word
         5: E (x) -> not in word

So R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.

Also, R and A are definitely in the word.

Since we have eliminated C, N, E, we can use other letters.

Common vowels: We have A already, and E is out. So other vowels: O, I, U? But we don't know yet.

Let's list possible letters: We avoid C, N, E. Also, since R and A are already present, we need to include at least one R and one A (but note: the word might have duplicate letters? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but the feedback might show duplicates appropriately. However, without any duplication indicated so far, we'll assume no duplicates for now until we see feedback that suggests otherwise).

In feedback, we have one R and one A marked as present, so likely the word has exactly one R and one A? It might have more, but we don't know.

So for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we can try R in other positions and A in other positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5? But note: position 1 was C (not present) so R could be in 1? However, we don't know if position 1 is available. Similarly, position 4 and 5 are open.

Similarly for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

Common words: 
- Words starting with R: like ""RADAR"" but that has duplicate letters and we haven't tested D? Also, A is in position 2, which we haven't tested for A? However, in our previous guess, A was in position 3 and found wrong, but A can be in position 2 now? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A.

Similarly, R can be in any position except 2? But note: we only know that in position 2 it was wrong, but it might be in 1,3,4,5.

But wait, if we put R in position 1, that might be good because we haven't tested position 1 with R? Also, we know that position 1 was C which is absent, but a new letter might be there.

Similarly, we can try to test other letters.

What are the most common letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried T, L, S, O, I, etc.

A good strategy is to test new letters to get more information.

So we need to cover new positions and letters.

We know:
- Positions that we tried: 
  Position 1: tried C (not in word) -> so avoid C there, but any other letter is possible.
  Position 2: tried R (but R is in word, just not here) -> we can try another letter at position 2? Or even R again? But let's try a new letter.

But we must include R and A in the word. So they must be somewhere.

We can form a word that uses R and A and three new letters to get more data.

Let's try:

Option: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? Then we need letters for 2,3,5.

For example: R _ _ A _

Now, we avoid C, N, E.

What letters can we use? Let's use common letters: T, L, S, O, etc.

Word: ""RATIO"" - but note we haven't tested O? Also, T and I.

But we must check if it's valid: R A T I O -> wait, but we want R in 1 and A in 4? In ""RATIO"", positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> but we cannot put A in position 2? Because we are free to try. Actually, we know A is in the word but not in position 3? Position 2 is new.

But in feedback from first guess, for A: we know that if we put A in position 3 it was wrong, but other positions are okay. So putting A in position 2 is possible.

But note: we must be cautious because we are still investigating.

Another idea: since R was in position 2 originally, we know R is not there. Similarly, A is not in 3. So for our new guess, we can avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? That's already enforced because we know it's wrong? Actually, no: we can put R in position 2 again, but we expect it to be wrong? It would be inefficient because we know it's wrong.

So better not to put A in position 3 again? And not R in position 2? Actually, we can avoid those to maximize chance of getting correct positions.

Moreover, we want to test positions we haven't tested? For example, position 1,4,5.

But we tested position 1 with C (absent) but any other letter could be there.

So, for our next guess, we want to put R in a position that we haven't tested: such as 1,4, or 5? Similarly for A: positions 1,2,4,5. We haven't tested position 1 at all? Only with C which is absent.

Actually, we tested each position:

We know:
- Position 1: letter was C (not in word) -> so if we put a letter and it's correct, we get ✓, if present but wrong position, -, etc.

But we only tested with C and got x, so the correct letter for position1 is any from the alphabet without C,E,N? And not R? Because R we have not tested in position1? So let's try R at position1? That's a candidate.

Similarly, we can try A at position2? Because in first guess position2 was R (which gave -, meaning R is in word but not here) so now if we put A in position2 and it's present, it's either ✓ or -? And if we get ✓, that position2 is A.

So it's a good idea?

Let's design:

We want to try R at position1 and A at position2? But wait, we know that R is in the word? If we put R at position1, two possibilities: either correct position (then ✓) or if not, then - if wrong position? But we don't know whether R is in position1? It might be.

But also, we have to keep in mind that we haven't tested position1 with any other letter? So if we put a new letter, we might get information.

Therefore, perhaps better to try R in a new position? We have positions 1,4,5 available that haven't had R? Because we only tried R in position2? So we can try R at position1? That way, if we get ✓, great. If not, then we know R must be in positions 4 or 5? Because we'll test positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, not quite? We are testing only the positions we put.

But we can only try one position per guess.

So let's try R at position1? And put A at position4? Then we can try a new letter at position2 and position3? For example, common letters.

But we don't know the vowel situation: we have A present? And we've eliminated E? So maybe try I or O? Or consonants like T, S, L.

So, candidate: R _ _ A _

Fill the blanks: let's choose common letters. For position2: say T? Position3: L? Position5: Y? ""RATAL""? Not a word. Or ""RALPH""? Not likely? Other: ""RATIO"" but then A would be in position2? And no A in position4? Let me spell it:

If we want R at1, then A at4? So word: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3) but wait, we want A at4? In ""ROAST"" A is at3? We must avoid position3 for A? Because we know A cannot be in position3? So we shouldn't put A in position3? Actually, we can if we want to test? But if we know A is not in position3? Because of previous feedback? So we shouldn't put A in position3? It might be inefficient? Actually, it's not? Because if we put A in position3, we know it will be a '-' if it is the same letter? Or if the word has two A's? Then maybe ✓ for one? But let's avoid complexity for now.

To avoid position3 for A? We can do.

So for ""ROAST"": R in1, O in2, A in3, S in4, T in5? But A in position3? We know from feedback that A is not in position3? Because the '-' for A in position3? Actually, wait: The '-' for A in position3 only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position? So if we put A in position3 again, we expect it to be wrong again? So unless the word has two A's? But we don't know? So to be efficient, we should avoid putting A in position3? Because if we do, it will show as '-' (if A is in word but not there) or if there is another A? But unlikely? So let's avoid.

Therefore, we need A in position other than 3? So acceptable positions: 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R: avoid position2? So acceptable: 1,3,4,5.

We are free to choose.

So candidate: R at position1 and A at position4? That's good. Then we need letters for position2,3,5.

We must avoid C,N,E. And choose common letters.

Let me try: position2: T? Then position3: L? Position5: S -> ""RATALS""? Not a word? ""RATAS"" not a word. 

Alternative: ""RABID"" -> R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), D(5)? But we want A at4? Not here.

We need A at position4? So:

Word: R at1, position4: A. So pattern: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""RODIA""? Not common? ""ROBIN"" -> R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word? So not.

Another: ""ROAST"" but as above? If we move A? Wait, we want A at4? So that would require changing ""ROAST"" to? Not easily.

Maybe ""ROYAL"": R(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> yes, ROYAL.

And it doesn't have C,N,E? Good.

Also, includes A at position4, R at position1.

Now, with this guess:
- We test R at position1: either ✓ if it's the correct position, or - if not? But since R must be present? Either way we get information on position1? If R is here, then ✓. If not, then we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5? Because we're testing position1? And we avoid position2.

Similarly, A at position4: if ✓, then good? Or - if wrong.

Also, we test O, Y, L? Which are new letters? So we get information?

It might be a good choice?

Another common word? Let's see: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but A is at2? Which is acceptable? But we had R at position2? Now we put A at position2? So we are testing A at position2? Which we don't have information? Also, R at1? Similarly.

But in ""RAILS"", A at position2? We have to test? And L at4? So it tests position2? Also, we avoid position3 for A? So it's okay.

But ""ROYAL"" seems fine? And it includes A in position4? Which might be a position we haven't tested? Or in the previous guess we tested position4 with N (which was absent)? So position4? It was N? So we know position4? We can try A at4? To see if it's correct? If we get ✓ for A? Then we have the fourth letter.

Similarly, in ""RAILS"", at position4 is L? Which is a new test? So both are possible? But let's pick the one that covers more new letters.

Actually, both have two vowels? ROYAL has O and A? RAILS has A and I? Both have four new letters? Because R we are testing? And except R and A, the rest are new? Wait, R and A are already present? But we are testing new positions and new letters? So O, Y, L in ROYAL? And in RAILS? I, L, S? 

It might be better? How about ""PARTY""? P-A-R-T-Y? Then R is at3? And A at2? But we have to include R? In PARTY, R is at position3? Which we haven't tested? We could try? Then we test P and T and Y? But P is less common? So perhaps ROYAL is more common?

Given that we have eliminated E? We can try words with O and Y? Or L.

But ROYAL is a valid word? Another word: ""ROAST"" if we put A in position4? We can't? So I'll stick to ROYAL? But let me confirm: ROYAL is accepted? Yes, it is a valid word.

So guess: royal

But let me check: r o y a l -> positions: 1:r, 2:o, 3:y, 4:a, 5:l

This will let us test:
- Position1 with R: could be ✓ or -
- Position4 with A: could be ✓ or -
- We also test letters O, Y, L? If any are in the word? And their positions.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down? Also, if R is not in position1? Then R must be in position3 or4 or5? But position4? We have A? So if R is not at1? Then later we can adjust? Similarly.

Alternative: ""STRAY"" -> S,T,R,A,Y? But positions: S at1, T at2, R at3? But we know R? and avoid position2 for R? Also, A at4? S at1: which we haven't tested? But we haven't eliminated S? Also, avoids C,N,E.

But R at3? Which is new? So it tests position1? And position3? 

Moreover, STRAY: positions:
1:S
2:T
3:R
4:A
5:Y

Now, we avoid position3 for R? Wait no: in first guess R was in position2? So we don't know about position3? We can put R there? And similarly A in position4? It avoids putting R in position2? And A in position3? So acceptable? Also, we test new letters: S, T, Y? 

Also, is STRAY valid? Yes.

But let's compare: ROYAL and STRAY? Both valid?

ROYAL: tests R at1? STRAY: tests R at3? Both test A at4? So which one?

Let's see the letters: STRAY has T and S? Common letters? ROYAL has O and Y? Y is less common? So perhaps STRAY is better? Because S and T are more frequent than O and Y.

In fact, maybe STRAY? We can get more information? Also, we know that position4? We previously had N (eliminated) so we can test position4 with A? And position1? We had C? So if we put S in position1? We test letter S? And if we get ✓ or -.

Similarly, T in position2? Position2 was R? But R gave '-', meaning R is in word not there? So position2? If T is the correct letter? Then ✓? Or if T is present elsewhere? Then '-'.

Thus, STRAY might be better because S and T are high frequency.

Therefore, I'll go with STRAY.

So guess: ""stray""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, N, and E are **not in the word** (x).  
- R and A **are in the word** but were in the **wrong positions** (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

For the next guess:  
- I need to include R and A since they are confirmed present.  
- I should avoid C, N, E.  
- R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3. Optimally, I should test new positions for these letters to gather information.  
- I should also test new common letters (like S, T, Y) to maximize coverage of the alphabet.  

The word **""stray""** fits well:  
- It includes R and A.  
- R is placed in **position 3** (new, untested position).  
- A is placed in **position 4** (position 4 was tested with N in the first guess, which was absent).  
- S is tested in position 1 (previously C, which was absent).  
- T is tested in position 2 (previously R, which was present but misplaced).  
- Y is tested in position 5 (new position).  
- Avoids C, N, E.  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for key letters and introduces high-frequency consonants like S and T.  

<guess>stray</guess>",stray,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in:
C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all.
- R: is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in ""crane"").
- A: is in the word but not in the third position.
- N: not in the word.
- E: not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The word contains the letters R and A, but they are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- We have eliminated C, N, and E. So the word cannot have these letters.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

We need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are present), and avoids C, N, E.

Additionally, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we should try to place R and A in different positions.

Let's try to think of words that include R and A, and use other common consonants. Avoid positions 2 for R and position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback tells us that in the guess ""crane"", R (in position 2) is not correct, so R might be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, the feedback is:

Position: 1: C (x) -> not in word
         2: R (-) -> in word, not here
         3: A (-) -> in word, not here
         4: N (x) -> not in word
         5: E (x) -> not in word

So R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.

Also, R and A are definitely in the word.

Since we have eliminated C, N, E, we can use other letters.

Common vowels: We have A already, and E is out. So other vowels: O, I, U? But we don't know yet.

Let's list possible letters: We avoid C, N, E. Also, since R and A are already present, we need to include at least one R and one A (but note: the word might have duplicate letters? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but the feedback might show duplicates appropriately. However, without any duplication indicated so far, we'll assume no duplicates for now until we see feedback that suggests otherwise).

In feedback, we have one R and one A marked as present, so likely the word has exactly one R and one A? It might have more, but we don't know.

So for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we can try R in other positions and A in other positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5? But note: position 1 was C (not present) so R could be in 1? However, we don't know if position 1 is available. Similarly, position 4 and 5 are open.

Similarly for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

Common words: 
- Words starting with R: like ""RADAR"" but that has duplicate letters and we haven't tested D? Also, A is in position 2, which we haven't tested for A? However, in our previous guess, A was in position 3 and found wrong, but A can be in position 2 now? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A.

Similarly, R can be in any position except 2? But note: we only know that in position 2 it was wrong, but it might be in 1,3,4,5.

But wait, if we put R in position 1, that might be good because we haven't tested position 1 with R? Also, we know that position 1 was C which is absent, but a new letter might be there.

Similarly, we can try to test other letters.

What are the most common letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried T, L, S, O, I, etc.

A good strategy is to test new letters to get more information.

So we need to cover new positions and letters.

We know:
- Positions that we tried: 
  Position 1: tried C (not in word) -> so avoid C there, but any other letter is possible.
  Position 2: tried R (but R is in word, just not here) -> we can try another letter at position 2? Or even R again? But let's try a new letter.

But we must include R and A in the word. So they must be somewhere.

We can form a word that uses R and A and three new letters to get more data.

Let's try:

Option: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? Then we need letters for 2,3,5.

For example: R _ _ A _

Now, we avoid C, N, E.

What letters can we use? Let's use common letters: T, L, S, O, etc.

Word: ""RATIO"" - but note we haven't tested O? Also, T and I.

But we must check if it's valid: R A T I O -> wait, but we want R in 1 and A in 4? In ""RATIO"", positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> but we cannot put A in position 2? Because we are free to try. Actually, we know A is in the word but not in position 3? Position 2 is new.

But in feedback from first guess, for A: we know that if we put A in position 3 it was wrong, but other positions are okay. So putting A in position 2 is possible.

But note: we must be cautious because we are still investigating.

Another idea: since R was in position 2 originally, we know R is not there. Similarly, A is not in 3. So for our new guess, we can avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? That's already enforced because we know it's wrong? Actually, no: we can put R in position 2 again, but we expect it to be wrong? It would be inefficient because we know it's wrong.

So better not to put A in position 3 again? And not R in position 2? Actually, we can avoid those to maximize chance of getting correct positions.

Moreover, we want to test positions we haven't tested? For example, position 1,4,5.

But we tested position 1 with C (absent) but any other letter could be there.

So, for our next guess, we want to put R in a position that we haven't tested: such as 1,4, or 5? Similarly for A: positions 1,2,4,5. We haven't tested position 1 at all? Only with C which is absent.

Actually, we tested each position:

We know:
- Position 1: letter was C (not in word) -> so if we put a letter and it's correct, we get ✓, if present but wrong position, -, etc.

But we only tested with C and got x, so the correct letter for position1 is any from the alphabet without C,E,N? And not R? Because R we have not tested in position1? So let's try R at position1? That's a candidate.

Similarly, we can try A at position2? Because in first guess position2 was R (which gave -, meaning R is in word but not here) so now if we put A in position2 and it's present, it's either ✓ or -? And if we get ✓, that position2 is A.

So it's a good idea?

Let's design:

We want to try R at position1 and A at position2? But wait, we know that R is in the word? If we put R at position1, two possibilities: either correct position (then ✓) or if not, then - if wrong position? But we don't know whether R is in position1? It might be.

But also, we have to keep in mind that we haven't tested position1 with any other letter? So if we put a new letter, we might get information.

Therefore, perhaps better to try R in a new position? We have positions 1,4,5 available that haven't had R? Because we only tried R in position2? So we can try R at position1? That way, if we get ✓, great. If not, then we know R must be in positions 4 or 5? Because we'll test positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, not quite? We are testing only the positions we put.

But we can only try one position per guess.

So let's try R at position1? And put A at position4? Then we can try a new letter at position2 and position3? For example, common letters.

But we don't know the vowel situation: we have A present? And we've eliminated E? So maybe try I or O? Or consonants like T, S, L.

So, candidate: R _ _ A _

Fill the blanks: let's choose common letters. For position2: say T? Position3: L? Position5: Y? ""RATAL""? Not a word. Or ""RALPH""? Not likely? Other: ""RATIO"" but then A would be in position2? And no A in position4? Let me spell it:

If we want R at1, then A at4? So word: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3) but wait, we want A at4? In ""ROAST"" A is at3? We must avoid position3 for A? Because we know A cannot be in position3? So we shouldn't put A in position3? Actually, we can if we want to test? But if we know A is not in position3? Because of previous feedback? So we shouldn't put A in position3? It might be inefficient? Actually, it's not? Because if we put A in position3, we know it will be a '-' if it is the same letter? Or if the word has two A's? Then maybe ✓ for one? But let's avoid complexity for now.

To avoid position3 for A? We can do.

So for ""ROAST"": R in1, O in2, A in3, S in4, T in5? But A in position3? We know from feedback that A is not in position3? Because the '-' for A in position3? Actually, wait: The '-' for A in position3 only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position? So if we put A in position3 again, we expect it to be wrong again? So unless the word has two A's? But we don't know? So to be efficient, we should avoid putting A in position3? Because if we do, it will show as '-' (if A is in word but not there) or if there is another A? But unlikely? So let's avoid.

Therefore, we need A in position other than 3? So acceptable positions: 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R: avoid position2? So acceptable: 1,3,4,5.

We are free to choose.

So candidate: R at position1 and A at position4? That's good. Then we need letters for position2,3,5.

We must avoid C,N,E. And choose common letters.

Let me try: position2: T? Then position3: L? Position5: S -> ""RATALS""? Not a word? ""RATAS"" not a word. 

Alternative: ""RABID"" -> R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), D(5)? But we want A at4? Not here.

We need A at position4? So:

Word: R at1, position4: A. So pattern: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""RODIA""? Not common? ""ROBIN"" -> R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word? So not.

Another: ""ROAST"" but as above? If we move A? Wait, we want A at4? So that would require changing ""ROAST"" to? Not easily.

Maybe ""ROYAL"": R(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> yes, ROYAL.

And it doesn't have C,N,E? Good.

Also, includes A at position4, R at position1.

Now, with this guess:
- We test R at position1: either ✓ if it's the correct position, or - if not? But since R must be present? Either way we get information on position1? If R is here, then ✓. If not, then we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5? Because we're testing position1? And we avoid position2.

Similarly, A at position4: if ✓, then good? Or - if wrong.

Also, we test O, Y, L? Which are new letters? So we get information?

It might be a good choice?

Another common word? Let's see: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but A is at2? Which is acceptable? But we had R at position2? Now we put A at position2? So we are testing A at position2? Which we don't have information? Also, R at1? Similarly.

But in ""RAILS"", A at position2? We have to test? And L at4? So it tests position2? Also, we avoid position3 for A? So it's okay.

But ""ROYAL"" seems fine? And it includes A in position4? Which might be a position we haven't tested? Or in the previous guess we tested position4 with N (which was absent)? So position4? It was N? So we know position4? We can try A at4? To see if it's correct? If we get ✓ for A? Then we have the fourth letter.

Similarly, in ""RAILS"", at position4 is L? Which is a new test? So both are possible? But let's pick the one that covers more new letters.

Actually, both have two vowels? ROYAL has O and A? RAILS has A and I? Both have four new letters? Because R we are testing? And except R and A, the rest are new? Wait, R and A are already present? But we are testing new positions and new letters? So O, Y, L in ROYAL? And in RAILS? I, L, S? 

It might be better? How about ""PARTY""? P-A-R-T-Y? Then R is at3? And A at2? But we have to include R? In PARTY, R is at position3? Which we haven't tested? We could try? Then we test P and T and Y? But P is less common? So perhaps ROYAL is more common?

Given that we have eliminated E? We can try words with O and Y? Or L.

But ROYAL is a valid word? Another word: ""ROAST"" if we put A in position4? We can't? So I'll stick to ROYAL? But let me confirm: ROYAL is accepted? Yes, it is a valid word.

So guess: royal

But let me check: r o y a l -> positions: 1:r, 2:o, 3:y, 4:a, 5:l

This will let us test:
- Position1 with R: could be ✓ or -
- Position4 with A: could be ✓ or -
- We also test letters O, Y, L? If any are in the word? And their positions.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down? Also, if R is not in position1? Then R must be in position3 or4 or5? But position4? We have A? So if R is not at1? Then later we can adjust? Similarly.

Alternative: ""STRAY"" -> S,T,R,A,Y? But positions: S at1, T at2, R at3? But we know R? and avoid position2 for R? Also, A at4? S at1: which we haven't tested? But we haven't eliminated S? Also, avoids C,N,E.

But R at3? Which is new? So it tests position1? And position3? 

Moreover, STRAY: positions:
1:S
2:T
3:R
4:A
5:Y

Now, we avoid position3 for R? Wait no: in first guess R was in position2? So we don't know about position3? We can put R there? And similarly A in position4? It avoids putting R in position2? And A in position3? So acceptable? Also, we test new letters: S, T, Y? 

Also, is STRAY valid? Yes.

But let's compare: ROYAL and STRAY? Both valid?

ROYAL: tests R at1? STRAY: tests R at3? Both test A at4? So which one?

Let's see the letters: STRAY has T and S? Common letters? ROYAL has O and Y? Y is less common? So perhaps STRAY is better? Because S and T are more frequent than O and Y.

In fact, maybe STRAY? We can get more information? Also, we know that position4? We previously had N (eliminated) so we can test position4 with A? And position1? We had C? So if we put S in position1? We test letter S? And if we get ✓ or -.

Similarly, T in position2? Position2 was R? But R gave '-', meaning R is in word not there? So position2? If T is the correct letter? Then ✓? Or if T is present elsewhere? Then '-'.

Thus, STRAY might be better because S and T are high frequency.

Therefore, I'll go with STRAY.

So guess: ""stray""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, N, and E are **not in the word** (x).  
- R and A **are in the word** but were in the **wrong positions** (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

For the next guess:  
- I need to include R and A since they are confirmed present.  
- I should avoid C, N, E.  
- R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3. Optimally, I should test new positions for these letters to gather information.  
- I should also test new common letters (like S, T, Y) to maximize coverage of the alphabet.  

The word **""stray""** fits well:  
- It includes R and A.  
- R is placed in **position 3** (new, untested position).  
- A is placed in **position 4** (position 4 was tested with N in the first guess, which was absent).  
- S is tested in position 1 (previously C, which was absent).  
- T is tested in position 2 (previously R, which was present but misplaced).  
- Y is tested in position 5 (new position).  
- Avoids C, N, E.  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for key letters and introduces high-frequency consonants like S and T.",Guess 2: stray -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,rabbi,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in:
C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all.
- R: is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in ""crane"").
- A: is in the word but not in the third position.
- N: not in the word.
- E: not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The word contains the letters R and A, but they are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- We have eliminated C, N, and E. So the word cannot have these letters.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

We need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are present), and avoids C, N, E.

Additionally, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we should try to place R and A in different positions.

Let's try to think of words that include R and A, and use other common consonants. Avoid positions 2 for R and position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback tells us that in the guess ""crane"", R (in position 2) is not correct, so R might be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, the feedback is:

Position: 1: C (x) -> not in word
         2: R (-) -> in word, not here
         3: A (-) -> in word, not here
         4: N (x) -> not in word
         5: E (x) -> not in word

So R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.

Also, R and A are definitely in the word.

Since we have eliminated C, N, E, we can use other letters.

Common vowels: We have A already, and E is out. So other vowels: O, I, U? But we don't know yet.

Let's list possible letters: We avoid C, N, E. Also, since R and A are already present, we need to include at least one R and one A (but note: the word might have duplicate letters? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but the feedback might show duplicates appropriately. However, without any duplication indicated so far, we'll assume no duplicates for now until we see feedback that suggests otherwise).

In feedback, we have one R and one A marked as present, so likely the word has exactly one R and one A? It might have more, but we don't know.

So for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we can try R in other positions and A in other positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5? But note: position 1 was C (not present) so R could be in 1? However, we don't know if position 1 is available. Similarly, position 4 and 5 are open.

Similarly for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

Common words: 
- Words starting with R: like ""RADAR"" but that has duplicate letters and we haven't tested D? Also, A is in position 2, which we haven't tested for A? However, in our previous guess, A was in position 3 and found wrong, but A can be in position 2 now? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A.

Similarly, R can be in any position except 2? But note: we only know that in position 2 it was wrong, but it might be in 1,3,4,5.

But wait, if we put R in position 1, that might be good because we haven't tested position 1 with R? Also, we know that position 1 was C which is absent, but a new letter might be there.

Similarly, we can try to test other letters.

What are the most common letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried T, L, S, O, I, etc.

A good strategy is to test new letters to get more information.

So we need to cover new positions and letters.

We know:
- Positions that we tried: 
  Position 1: tried C (not in word) -> so avoid C there, but any other letter is possible.
  Position 2: tried R (but R is in word, just not here) -> we can try another letter at position 2? Or even R again? But let's try a new letter.

But we must include R and A in the word. So they must be somewhere.

We can form a word that uses R and A and three new letters to get more data.

Let's try:

Option: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? Then we need letters for 2,3,5.

For example: R _ _ A _

Now, we avoid C, N, E.

What letters can we use? Let's use common letters: T, L, S, O, etc.

Word: ""RATIO"" - but note we haven't tested O? Also, T and I.

But we must check if it's valid: R A T I O -> wait, but we want R in 1 and A in 4? In ""RATIO"", positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> but we cannot put A in position 2? Because we are free to try. Actually, we know A is in the word but not in position 3? Position 2 is new.

But in feedback from first guess, for A: we know that if we put A in position 3 it was wrong, but other positions are okay. So putting A in position 2 is possible.

But note: we must be cautious because we are still investigating.

Another idea: since R was in position 2 originally, we know R is not there. Similarly, A is not in 3. So for our new guess, we can avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? That's already enforced because we know it's wrong? Actually, no: we can put R in position 2 again, but we expect it to be wrong? It would be inefficient because we know it's wrong.

So better not to put A in position 3 again? And not R in position 2? Actually, we can avoid those to maximize chance of getting correct positions.

Moreover, we want to test positions we haven't tested? For example, position 1,4,5.

But we tested position 1 with C (absent) but any other letter could be there.

So, for our next guess, we want to put R in a position that we haven't tested: such as 1,4, or 5? Similarly for A: positions 1,2,4,5. We haven't tested position 1 at all? Only with C which is absent.

Actually, we tested each position:

We know:
- Position 1: letter was C (not in word) -> so if we put a letter and it's correct, we get ✓, if present but wrong position, -, etc.

But we only tested with C and got x, so the correct letter for position1 is any from the alphabet without C,E,N? And not R? Because R we have not tested in position1? So let's try R at position1? That's a candidate.

Similarly, we can try A at position2? Because in first guess position2 was R (which gave -, meaning R is in word but not here) so now if we put A in position2 and it's present, it's either ✓ or -? And if we get ✓, that position2 is A.

So it's a good idea?

Let's design:

We want to try R at position1 and A at position2? But wait, we know that R is in the word? If we put R at position1, two possibilities: either correct position (then ✓) or if not, then - if wrong position? But we don't know whether R is in position1? It might be.

But also, we have to keep in mind that we haven't tested position1 with any other letter? So if we put a new letter, we might get information.

Therefore, perhaps better to try R in a new position? We have positions 1,4,5 available that haven't had R? Because we only tried R in position2? So we can try R at position1? That way, if we get ✓, great. If not, then we know R must be in positions 4 or 5? Because we'll test positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, not quite? We are testing only the positions we put.

But we can only try one position per guess.

So let's try R at position1? And put A at position4? Then we can try a new letter at position2 and position3? For example, common letters.

But we don't know the vowel situation: we have A present? And we've eliminated E? So maybe try I or O? Or consonants like T, S, L.

So, candidate: R _ _ A _

Fill the blanks: let's choose common letters. For position2: say T? Position3: L? Position5: Y? ""RATAL""? Not a word. Or ""RALPH""? Not likely? Other: ""RATIO"" but then A would be in position2? And no A in position4? Let me spell it:

If we want R at1, then A at4? So word: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3) but wait, we want A at4? In ""ROAST"" A is at3? We must avoid position3 for A? Because we know A cannot be in position3? So we shouldn't put A in position3? Actually, we can if we want to test? But if we know A is not in position3? Because of previous feedback? So we shouldn't put A in position3? It might be inefficient? Actually, it's not? Because if we put A in position3, we know it will be a '-' if it is the same letter? Or if the word has two A's? Then maybe ✓ for one? But let's avoid complexity for now.

To avoid position3 for A? We can do.

So for ""ROAST"": R in1, O in2, A in3, S in4, T in5? But A in position3? We know from feedback that A is not in position3? Because the '-' for A in position3? Actually, wait: The '-' for A in position3 only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position? So if we put A in position3 again, we expect it to be wrong again? So unless the word has two A's? But we don't know? So to be efficient, we should avoid putting A in position3? Because if we do, it will show as '-' (if A is in word but not there) or if there is another A? But unlikely? So let's avoid.

Therefore, we need A in position other than 3? So acceptable positions: 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R: avoid position2? So acceptable: 1,3,4,5.

We are free to choose.

So candidate: R at position1 and A at position4? That's good. Then we need letters for position2,3,5.

We must avoid C,N,E. And choose common letters.

Let me try: position2: T? Then position3: L? Position5: S -> ""RATALS""? Not a word? ""RATAS"" not a word. 

Alternative: ""RABID"" -> R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), D(5)? But we want A at4? Not here.

We need A at position4? So:

Word: R at1, position4: A. So pattern: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""RODIA""? Not common? ""ROBIN"" -> R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word? So not.

Another: ""ROAST"" but as above? If we move A? Wait, we want A at4? So that would require changing ""ROAST"" to? Not easily.

Maybe ""ROYAL"": R(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> yes, ROYAL.

And it doesn't have C,N,E? Good.

Also, includes A at position4, R at position1.

Now, with this guess:
- We test R at position1: either ✓ if it's the correct position, or - if not? But since R must be present? Either way we get information on position1? If R is here, then ✓. If not, then we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5? Because we're testing position1? And we avoid position2.

Similarly, A at position4: if ✓, then good? Or - if wrong.

Also, we test O, Y, L? Which are new letters? So we get information?

It might be a good choice?

Another common word? Let's see: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but A is at2? Which is acceptable? But we had R at position2? Now we put A at position2? So we are testing A at position2? Which we don't have information? Also, R at1? Similarly.

But in ""RAILS"", A at position2? We have to test? And L at4? So it tests position2? Also, we avoid position3 for A? So it's okay.

But ""ROYAL"" seems fine? And it includes A in position4? Which might be a position we haven't tested? Or in the previous guess we tested position4 with N (which was absent)? So position4? It was N? So we know position4? We can try A at4? To see if it's correct? If we get ✓ for A? Then we have the fourth letter.

Similarly, in ""RAILS"", at position4 is L? Which is a new test? So both are possible? But let's pick the one that covers more new letters.

Actually, both have two vowels? ROYAL has O and A? RAILS has A and I? Both have four new letters? Because R we are testing? And except R and A, the rest are new? Wait, R and A are already present? But we are testing new positions and new letters? So O, Y, L in ROYAL? And in RAILS? I, L, S? 

It might be better? How about ""PARTY""? P-A-R-T-Y? Then R is at3? And A at2? But we have to include R? In PARTY, R is at position3? Which we haven't tested? We could try? Then we test P and T and Y? But P is less common? So perhaps ROYAL is more common?

Given that we have eliminated E? We can try words with O and Y? Or L.

But ROYAL is a valid word? Another word: ""ROAST"" if we put A in position4? We can't? So I'll stick to ROYAL? But let me confirm: ROYAL is accepted? Yes, it is a valid word.

So guess: royal

But let me check: r o y a l -> positions: 1:r, 2:o, 3:y, 4:a, 5:l

This will let us test:
- Position1 with R: could be ✓ or -
- Position4 with A: could be ✓ or -
- We also test letters O, Y, L? If any are in the word? And their positions.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down? Also, if R is not in position1? Then R must be in position3 or4 or5? But position4? We have A? So if R is not at1? Then later we can adjust? Similarly.

Alternative: ""STRAY"" -> S,T,R,A,Y? But positions: S at1, T at2, R at3? But we know R? and avoid position2 for R? Also, A at4? S at1: which we haven't tested? But we haven't eliminated S? Also, avoids C,N,E.

But R at3? Which is new? So it tests position1? And position3? 

Moreover, STRAY: positions:
1:S
2:T
3:R
4:A
5:Y

Now, we avoid position3 for R? Wait no: in first guess R was in position2? So we don't know about position3? We can put R there? And similarly A in position4? It avoids putting R in position2? And A in position3? So acceptable? Also, we test new letters: S, T, Y? 

Also, is STRAY valid? Yes.

But let's compare: ROYAL and STRAY? Both valid?

ROYAL: tests R at1? STRAY: tests R at3? Both test A at4? So which one?

Let's see the letters: STRAY has T and S? Common letters? ROYAL has O and Y? Y is less common? So perhaps STRAY is better? Because S and T are more frequent than O and Y.

In fact, maybe STRAY? We can get more information? Also, we know that position4? We previously had N (eliminated) so we can test position4 with A? And position1? We had C? So if we put S in position1? We test letter S? And if we get ✓ or -.

Similarly, T in position2? Position2 was R? But R gave '-', meaning R is in word not there? So position2? If T is the correct letter? Then ✓? Or if T is present elsewhere? Then '-'.

Thus, STRAY might be better because S and T are high frequency.

Therefore, I'll go with STRAY.

So guess: ""stray""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, N, and E are **not in the word** (x).  
- R and A **are in the word** but were in the **wrong positions** (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

For the next guess:  
- I need to include R and A since they are confirmed present.  
- I should avoid C, N, E.  
- R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3. Optimally, I should test new positions for these letters to gather information.  
- I should also test new common letters (like S, T, Y) to maximize coverage of the alphabet.  

The word **""stray""** fits well:  
- It includes R and A.  
- R is placed in **position 3** (new, untested position).  
- A is placed in **position 4** (position 4 was tested with N in the first guess, which was absent).  
- S is tested in position 1 (previously C, which was absent).  
- T is tested in position 2 (previously R, which was present but misplaced).  
- Y is tested in position 5 (new position).  
- Avoids C, N, E.  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for key letters and introduces high-frequency consonants like S and T.

So the word cannot have these letters.\n\nWe also know the secret word is 5 letters.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are present), and avoids C, N, E.\n\nAdditionally, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we should try to place R and A in different positions.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that include R and A, and use other common consonants. Avoid positions 2 for R and position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback tells us that in the guess ""crane"", R (in position 2) is not correct, so R might be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, the feedback is:\n\nPosition: 1: C (x) -> not in word\n         2: R (-) -> in word, not here\n         3: A (-) -> in word, not here\n         4: N (x) -> not in word\n         5: E (x) -> not in word\n\nSo R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.\n\nAlso, R and A are definitely in the word.\n\nSince we have eliminated C, N, E, we can use other letters.\n\nCommon vowels: We have A already, and E is out. So other vowels: O, I, U? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters: We avoid C, N, E. Also, since R and A are already present, we need to include at least one R and one A (but note: the word might have duplicate letters? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but the feedback might show duplicates appropriately. However, without any duplication indicated so far, we\'ll assume no duplicates for now until we see feedback that suggests otherwise).\n\nIn feedback, we have one R and one A marked as present, so likely the word has exactly one R and one A? It might have more, but we don\'t know.\n\nSo for our next guess, we want to:\n1. Include R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we can try R in other positions and A in other positions.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5? But note: position 1 was C (not present) so R could be in 1? However, we don\'t know if position 1 is available. Similarly, position 4 and 5 are open.\n\nSimilarly for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nBut we also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.\n\nCommon words: \n- Words starting with R: like ""RADAR"" but that has duplicate letters and we haven\'t tested D? Also, A is in position 2, which we haven\'t tested for A? However, in our previous guess, A was in position 3 and found wrong, but A can be in position 2 now? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A.\n\nSimilarly, R can be in any position except 2? But note: we only know that in position 2 it was wrong, but it might be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nBut wait, if we put R in position 1, that might be good because we haven\'t tested position 1 with R? Also, we know that position 1 was C which is absent, but a new letter might be there.\n\nSimilarly, we can try to test other letters.\n\nWhat are the most common letters we haven\'t tried? We haven\'t tried T, L, S, O, I, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to test new letters to get more information.\n\nSo we need to cover new positions and letters.\n\nWe know:\n- Positions that we tried: \n  Position 1: tried C (not in word) -> so avoid C there, but any other letter is possible.\n  Position 2: tried R (but R is in word, just not here) -> we can try another letter at position 2? Or even R again? But let\'s try a new letter.\n\nBut we must include R and A in the word. So they must be somewhere.\n\nWe can form a word that uses R and A and three new letters to get more data.\n\nLet\'s try:\n\nOption: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? Then we need letters for 2,3,5.\n\nFor example: R _ _ A _\n\nNow, we avoid C, N, E.\n\nWhat letters can we use? Let\'s use common letters: T, L, S, O, etc.\n\nWord: ""RATIO"" - but note we haven\'t tested O? Also, T and I.\n\nBut we must check if it\'s valid: R A T I O -> wait, but we want R in 1 and A in 4? In ""RATIO"", positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> but we cannot put A in position 2? Because we are free to try. Actually, we know A is in the word but not in position 3? Position 2 is new.\n\nBut in feedback from first guess, for A: we know that if we put A in position 3 it was wrong, but other positions are okay. So putting A in position 2 is possible.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because we are still investigating.\n\nAnother idea: since R was in position 2 originally, we know R is not there. Similarly, A is not in 3. So for our new guess, we can avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? That\'s already enforced because we know it\'s wrong? Actually, no: we can put R in position 2 again, but we expect it to be wrong? It would be inefficient because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo better not to put A in position 3 again? And not R in position 2? Actually, we can avoid those to maximize chance of getting correct positions.\n\nMoreover, we want to test positions we haven\'t tested? For example, position 1,4,5.\n\nBut we tested position 1 with C (absent) but any other letter could be there.\n\nSo, for our next guess, we want to put R in a position that we haven\'t tested: such as 1,4, or 5? Similarly for A: positions 1,2,4,5. We haven\'t tested position 1 at all? Only with C which is absent.\n\nActually, we tested each position:\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: letter was C (not in word) -> so if we put a letter and it\'s correct, we get ✓, if present but wrong position, -, etc.\n\nBut we only tested with C and got x, so the correct letter for position1 is any from the alphabet without C,E,N? And not R? Because R we have not tested in position1? So let\'s try R at position1? That\'s a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, we can try A at position2? Because in first guess position2 was R (which gave -, meaning R is in word but not here) so now if we put A in position2 and it\'s present, it\'s either ✓ or -? And if we get ✓, that position2 is A.\n\nSo it\'s a good idea?\n\nLet\'s design:\n\nWe want to try R at position1 and A at position2? But wait, we know that R is in the word? If we put R at position1, two possibilities: either correct position (then ✓) or if not, then - if wrong position? But we don\'t know whether R is in position1? It might be.\n\nBut also, we have to keep in mind that we haven\'t tested position1 with any other letter? So if we put a new letter, we might get information.\n\nTherefore, perhaps better to try R in a new position? We have positions 1,4,5 available that haven\'t had R? Because we only tried R in position2? So we can try R at position1? That way, if we get ✓, great. If not, then we know R must be in positions 4 or 5? Because we\'ll test positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, not quite? We are testing only the positions we put.\n\nBut we can only try one position per guess.\n\nSo let\'s try R at position1? And put A at position4? Then we can try a new letter at position2 and position3? For example, common letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know the vowel situation: we have A present? And we\'ve eliminated E? So maybe try I or O? Or consonants like T, S, L.\n\nSo, candidate: R _ _ A _\n\nFill the blanks: let\'s choose common letters. For position2: say T? Position3: L? Position5: Y? ""RATAL""? Not a word. Or ""RALPH""? Not likely? Other: ""RATIO"" but then A would be in position2? And no A in position4? Let me spell it:\n\nIf we want R at1, then A at4? So word: R _ _ A _\n\nPossible words: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3) but wait, we want A at4? In ""ROAST"" A is at3? We must avoid position3 for A? Because we know A cannot be in position3? So we shouldn\'t put A in position3? Actually, we can if we want to test? But if we know A is not in position3? Because of previous feedback? So we shouldn\'t put A in position3? It might be inefficient? Actually, it\'s not? Because if we put A in position3, we know it will be a \'-\' if it is the same letter? Or if the word has two A\'s? Then maybe ✓ for one? But let\'s avoid complexity for now.\n\nTo avoid position3 for A? We can do.\n\nSo for ""ROAST"": R in1, O in2, A in3, S in4, T in5? But A in position3? We know from feedback that A is not in position3? Because the \'-\' for A in position3? Actually, wait: The \'-\' for A in position3 only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position? So if we put A in position3 again, we expect it to be wrong again? So unless the word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know? So to be efficient, we should avoid putting A in position3? Because if we do, it will show as \'-\' (if A is in word but not there) or if there is another A? But unlikely? So let\'s avoid.\n\nTherefore, we need A in position other than 3? So acceptable positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for R: avoid position2? So acceptable: 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe are free to choose.\n\nSo candidate: R at position1 and A at position4? That\'s good. Then we need letters for position2,3,5.\n\nWe must avoid C,N,E. And choose common letters.\n\nLet me try: position2: T? Then position3: L? Position5: S -> ""RATALS""? Not a word? ""RATAS"" not a word. \n\nAlternative: ""RABID"" -> R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), D(5)? But we want A at4? Not here.\n\nWe need A at position4? So:\n\nWord: R at1, position4: A. So pattern: R _ _ A _\n\nPossible words: ""RODIA""? Not common? ""ROBIN"" -> R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word? So not.\n\nAnother: ""ROAST"" but as above? If we move A? Wait, we want A at4? So that would require changing ""ROAST"" to? Not easily.\n\nMaybe ""ROYAL"": R(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> yes, ROYAL.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t have C,N,E? Good.\n\nAlso, includes A at position4, R at position1.\n\nNow, with this guess:\n- We test R at position1: either ✓ if it\'s the correct position, or - if not? But since R must be present? Either way we get information on position1? If R is here, then ✓. If not, then we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5? Because we\'re testing position1? And we avoid position2.\n\nSimilarly, A at position4: if ✓, then good? Or - if wrong.\n\nAlso, we test O, Y, L? Which are new letters? So we get information?\n\nIt might be a good choice?\n\nAnother common word? Let\'s see: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but A is at2? Which is acceptable? But we had R at position2? Now we put A at position2? So we are testing A at position2? Which we don\'t have information? Also, R at1? Similarly.\n\nBut in ""RAILS"", A at position2? We have to test? And L at4? So it tests position2? Also, we avoid position3 for A? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""ROYAL"" seems fine? And it includes A in position4? Which might be a position we haven\'t tested? Or in the previous guess we tested position4 with N (which was absent)? So position4? It was N? So we know position4? We can try A at4? To see if it\'s correct? If we get ✓ for A? Then we have the fourth letter.\n\nSimilarly, in ""RAILS"", at position4 is L? Which is a new test? So both are possible? But let\'s pick the one that covers more new letters.\n\nActually, both have two vowels? ROYAL has O and A? RAILS has A and I? Both have four new letters? Because R we are testing? And except R and A, the rest are new? Wait, R and A are already present? But we are testing new positions and new letters? So O, Y, L in ROYAL? And in RAILS? I, L, S? \n\nIt might be better? How about ""PARTY""? P-A-R-T-Y? Then R is at3? And A at2? But we have to include R? In PARTY, R is at position3? Which we haven\'t tested? We could try? Then we test P and T and Y? But P is less common? So perhaps ROYAL is more common?\n\nGiven that we have eliminated E? We can try words with O and Y? Or L.\n\nBut ROYAL is a valid word? Another word: ""ROAST"" if we put A in position4? We can\'t? So I\'ll stick to ROYAL? But let me confirm: ROYAL is accepted? Yes, it is a valid word.\n\nSo guess: royal\n\nBut let me check: r o y a l -> positions: 1:r, 2:o, 3:y, 4:a, 5:l\n\nThis will let us test:\n- Position1 with R: could be ✓ or -\n- Position4 with A: could be ✓ or -\n- We also test letters O, Y, L? If any are in the word? And their positions.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down? Also, if R is not in position1? Then R must be in position3 or4 or5? But position4? We have A? So if R is not at1? Then later we can adjust? Similarly.\n\nAlternative: ""STRAY"" -> S,T,R,A,Y? But positions: S at1, T at2, R at3? But we know R? and avoid position2 for R? Also, A at4? S at1: which we haven\'t tested? But we haven\'t eliminated S? Also, avoids C,N,E.\n\nBut R at3? Which is new? So it tests position1? And position3? \n\nMoreover, STRAY: positions:\n1:S\n2:T\n3:R\n4:A\n5:Y\n\nNow, we avoid position3 for R? Wait no: in first guess R was in position2? So we don\'t know about position3? We can put R there? And similarly A in position4? It avoids putting R in position2? And A in position3? So acceptable? Also, we test new letters: S, T, Y? \n\nAlso, is STRAY valid? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ROYAL and STRAY? Both valid?\n\nROYAL: tests R at1? STRAY: tests R at3? Both test A at4? So which one?\n\nLet\'s see the letters: STRAY has T and S? Common letters? ROYAL has O and Y? Y is less common? So perhaps STRAY is better? Because S and T are more frequent than O and Y.\n\nIn fact, maybe STRAY? We can get more information? Also, we know that position4? We previously had N (eliminated) so we can test position4 with A? And position1? We had C? So if we put S in position1? We test letter S? And if we get ✓ or -.\n\nSimilarly, T in position2? Position2 was R? But R gave \'-\', meaning R is in word not there? So position2? If T is the correct letter? Then ✓? Or if T is present elsewhere? Then \'-\'.\n\nThus, STRAY might be better because S and T are high frequency.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with STRAY.\n\nSo guess: ""stray""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, N, and E are **not in the word** (x).  \n- R and A **are in the word** but were in the **wrong positions** (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- I need to include R and A since they are confirmed present.  \n- I should avoid C, N, E.  \n- R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- This means: R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: stray -> S(x), T(x), R(-), A(-), Y(x)
- This means: S, T, Y are not in the word. R and A are still in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Because R was in position 3? And A in position 4? Both gave '-', meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

From guess 2: 
- Position 1: S (x) -> not in word
- Position 2: T (x) -> not in word
- Position 3: R (-) -> R is in word, but not in position 3
- Position 4: A (-) -> A is in word, but not in position 4
- Position 5: Y (x) -> not in word

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: R and A (for sure, since both have been marked present twice)
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E from first guess; S, T, Y from second guess. So eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y.
- We also know positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 3 (from second guess).
  - A cannot be in position 3 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).

Possible positions for R: only positions 1, 4, 5 left? Because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out? Let's confirm:
  - First guess: R in position 2 -> wrong position? But the '-' means R is present? And not at position2? So R could be in 1,3,4,5? Then in second guess: R in position3 -> wrong position? So now we know R is not in position3? So R must be in position 1,4, or5? Similarly, A? First guess: position3 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position3? Second guess: position4 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position4? Also, positions tested: A can be in positions 1,2,5? Because we haven't tried these? Or if we tried? Position1? We tried C and S? Not A? Position2? We tried R and T? Not A? Position5? We tried E and Y? Not A? So possible positions for A: 1,2,5.

Additionally, the word has three more letters? Because we only have two letters? R and A? And five positions? So three additional distinct letters? Or duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates? So likely no duplicates? We proceed with that assumption until proven otherwise.

We have eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y. So the remaining letters? We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet? Except these? So possible remaining letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But of course? We only use common letters? For Wordle.

We know the word contains R and A? And we need to place them?

Moreover, we haven't tested positions 1 and 5? With R? Similarly for A? But position1? We tried S? Got x? And position5? We tried Y? Got x? So these positions? We can put existing letters? Or new ones?

But we must include R? So R must be in 1,4,5? And A in positions 1,2,5? But if R is in1? Then A cannot be in1? Similarly? If R in5? Then A cannot be in5? So the positions?

Also? We have three more letters? So we need to cover all positions.

Possible placements?

Let me consider positions for R:

Option 1: R in position1. Then A can be in position2 or5? Because if A is in1? Then conflict? So A cannot be in1? So A must be in2 or5.

If R in position1? Then positions 1(R),2(?),3(?),4(?),5(?) with A in either 2 or5.

Similarly? If R in position4? Then A cannot be in4? So A in1,2,5? But? Position4: R? Then the others?

Similarly? R in position5? Then A in1 or2? Because if A in5? Conflict.

So? Now? For our next guess? We want to test possibilities? And include new letters? To narrow down? Also? we haven't tested positions 3? Much? Position3 was R? But wrong? Or we had A in position3? But wrong? So we have tested new letters? In position3? Only in first guess?

But now? Position3: we haven't put any other letter? Only in the first guess: A? And second: R? But both wrong? So we need to try a new letter? In position3? Or elsewhere?

Similarly? Position2? In first guess: R (which was present? But not there)? Second: T (absent)? So we haven't tested with other letters? But we know T is absent? So we can try new letter? In position2.

Similarly? position3: similarly? new letter.

The strategy is to try a word that contains R and A? Placed in one of the possible configurations? Along with other common letters? Avoiding the eliminated ones.

Moreover? We want maximum information? So perhaps test R? In a new position? And test A? In a new position? That we haven't tried? For R? Possibilities: position4 or5? Because we tried position2 and3? And if we don't try position1 this time? Then we leave it? For another guess? But we only have 4 guesses left? So we need efficient.

Similarly? For A? We haven't tried positions 1, 2, 5? So we should cover one of them? Preferably not both at once? To isolate?

But let's form a word? Say? put R in position1? And A in position5? For example? Then positions 2,3,4? Need letters.

So pattern: R _ _ _ A

Now? We avoid the eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? And choose common letters? For positions 2,3,4? Say? L, O? P? Etc.

For example: ""ROBOT"" has O,B,O,T? But T eliminated? So no? ""ROGUE""? But E eliminated? And U? ""RODEO""? Eliminated E? and O? But E gone? How about ""ROBIN""? N eliminated? Bad.

Let's list common letters? Like O? L? I? B? etc.

Word: R O L A? But we need position4? Before A? In the pattern? Positions: R(1), O(2), L(3), something(4), A(5)? But we need a word? ""ROLLA""? Not valid? ""ROMAN""? M,A? ""ROMAN"": R(1),O(2),M(3),A(4)? But wait? We put A in position4? But we know A cannot be in position4? From second guess? Because feedback from ""stray"" for A in position4: '-'? Meaning A is in word but not at position4? So if we put A in position4 now? It would be wrong again? Because it was just tried and found not position4? So we must not put A in position4? Similarly R in position4? We are not putting A at4? But we are putting A at5? So that's okay? But in pattern R _ _ _ A? We haven't specified position4? Which must be a letter? So for ""ROMAN""? But ""ROMAN"" has A in position4? Which is forbidden? So we avoid? Similarly? we want A in5? So words ending with A? And starting with R? But avoid eliminated letters.

Possible words: ""RADIO""? But A at2? and D,I,O? Also? position4: I? position5: O? No? ""RADIO"": R(1),A(2),D(3),I(4),O(5). So A is at position2? Which is acceptable? And O at5? So that fits? Can we use ""radio""? But eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? So D,I,O? Are not eliminated? So valid? We can.

But in ""radio"": R in1? A in2? So if R is in1? And A in2? Then positions 3:D? 4:I? 5:O?

Now? if R is not actually in position1? Then we get '-' for R? And if A is not in2? Then get '-' for A? But if they are? Then ✓.

But also? we get information on D,I,O? Which are new.

Alternatively? consider other placements? For example? put R in position5? Then A in position2? So pattern: _ _ A _ R? Words like ""GUARD""? But U,A,R,D? Eliminated? Guard has U? which we haven't tested? But G? Also? We can try? But D? Perhaps? Not high frequency? Or ""HEARD""? H,E,A,R,D? But E eliminated? Bad? ""LIARD""? Not word? Other? ""BAKER""? E eliminated? ""MAKER""? E? Bad.

""RABBI""? Duplicate B? And I? Not common.

So ""radio"" seems good? Another: ""RAMBO""? M,B,O? Avoid E? O? But O is fine? But ""RAMBO""? Is B common? Perhaps? But let's?

Or ""RAPID""? P,I? But eliminated? We have? No? E? E eliminated? So valid? R,A,P,I,D? Positions: R(1),A(2),P(3),I(4),D(5). So A in2? But if we put A in2? And if A is indeed in position2? Then feedback will be ✓? Otherwise? -.

But we don't know? Yet.

Similarly? R in1? If ✓? Then great.

So ""radio"" is a valid choice? Let's go with that? But first? let me think about positions? We know A cannot be in4? But in ""radio""? A is in2? Not 4? So okay? Similarly? R cannot be in2 or3? And it is in1? Which is new? So acceptable.

But also? in position2? First guess? We had R? Which was wrong? Now we put A? So we test position2 with A? If correct? Then ✓? Otherwise? -? Meaning A is elsewhere.

Similarly? position1? We put R? So test position1? With R.

Thus? ""radio"" tests two new positions? And uses D,I,O? Which are new? Avoid eliminated? So good?

But note? We have eliminated E? So no 'e'? So radio is without E? Good.

Therefore? next guess: radio

Another possibility: if we want to test R in position4? But we haven't done? So try? For example? word: B A R O N? But N eliminated? And O? Not? But if we put R in position4? Then A? In say position2? So word: B A R O N? Invalid because N eliminated? Perhaps ""FARCE""? But C eliminated? So ""FAR"" something? Without C? And E gone? ""FARM""? But M? Then F(1),A(2),R(3)? Oops? R in position3? But position3 was tried? And R was there? But we know R cannot be in position3? Because second guess? R in position3 gave '-'? Meaning not position3? So if we put R in position3 again? It would be wasteful? So we avoid?

Therefore? better not to put R? In already tried positions? Similarly? for A? avoid positions 3 and4? So positions we have tried? With letters? We know? So we avoid? So acceptable positions? For R: only 1,5? Because 4? We haven't tried? But we also? Let me see? In first guess? R in position2? Position4? Was N? Eliminated? But position4? In second guess? We put A? Which was wrong? So position4? We have tried? But? Only with A? So R? Not tried? So we can put R in position4? For example.

Similarly? for A? Positions 1,2,5.

If we put R in position4? Then A? For example? in position2? Then word: _ A _ R ? 

Positions: 1? some letter? 2:A? 3? some? 4:R? 5? some.

So? For example? ""PAIRS""? But S? Eliminated? ""MAIRD""? Not word? ""HAIR""? Only 4 letters? ""FAIRD""? Not? ""LAIRD""? Not common? ""GAUZE""? E eliminated? ""QUAKE""? E gone? ""BAJRA""? Not English? Or ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? So positions: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R? Wait? R in position5? Not position4? We want R in position4? So pattern: for R in position4? So word must have fourth letter R? And A in position2? First letter? Whatever? Third? Whatever? Fifth? Whatever? Avoid eliminated? So ""MAJOR"" would be: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R(5) -> R is in position5? Not 4.

To have R in4: ""CHAIR""? C eliminated? ""FAIRY""? Y eliminated? ""FLAIR""? L, A, I? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3)? But A cannot be in position3? Because of first guess? So if we put A in3? Then we know it's wrong? But we can try? But inefficient? Because we know A is not in3? So we don't want A in3? Similarly? In our new word? we want A not in3 or4? So if we put R in4? Then we still need A? which must be in1,2, or5? So we put A? For example? in position2? Then avoid position3? For A? 

So word: _ A _ R ? 

So: position1: letter? position2: A? position3: letter (but not A? because if A? it's wrong)? position4: R? position5: letter.

Now? position3? Must be a new letter? Since we cannot put A? So? For example? ""GAZER""? E and R? But E eliminated? ""PALER""? E? Bad? ""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? Positions: V(1),A(2),L(3),I(4),D(5)? Then R? is not included? But we need R? So must include R? But where? Position4? But we have I? So not? Unless we put R in4? But in this word? we don't have R? 

How about ""HAIRY""? H,A,I,R,Y? But Y eliminated? Bad? ""BAIRN""? N eliminated? 

It seems difficult? Without duplication? So perhaps ""radio""? With R in1 and A in2? Is better? Because it forms a common word? And tests new positions? 

Other common words? Such as ""RABID""? B,I,Y? But Y eliminated? No? In ""RABID""? R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5)? So no Y? Eliminated are C,E,N,S,T,Y? So B,I,D? Are all allowed? Then? ""RABID""? 

Similarly? ""RAPID""? as above? 

Both are valid? 

So I'll go with ""RABID""? Or ""RAPID""? Let's see? 

""RABID"": R in position1? A in position2? B in3? I in4? D in5? 

If correct? We get solves? Otherwise? feedback will tell? 

But also? we test B and I and D? Not eliminated? 

So I think it's acceptable? 

But earlier I thought ""radio""? Now? comparing? ""RABID"" vs ""RADIO""? 

""RABID"": letters B,I,D? 
""RADIO"": letters D,I,O? Both fine? 

Perhaps no preference? But O is a vowel? More common? But D is consonant? Not sure? 

Since we have missing letters? Better to test vowels? So ""radio"" with O? Might be better? 

Therefore? I'll choose ""radio""? 

So guess: ""radio""

But let me ensure? 

First? R in position1? If R is not in1? Then feedback will be '-'? Meaning R? in word? But wrong position? Then R must be in position5? Because positions 2,3,4? Are ruled? R cannot be in2? Cannot be in3? And we thought position4? But if we put R in4? In a future guess? But now? if we get '-'? For R in1? Then R must be in position4 or5? But we haven't tried position4? And position5 hasn't been tried with R? 

Similarly? A in position2? If not? Then A must be in position5? Because positions 3 and4? Cannot? And position1? We haven't tried? But A can be in1? If not? We'll have to try later? 

So? ""radio"" is a good guess? 

Therefore? I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, S, T, Y (since both guesses showed ""x"" for these).
- **Confirmed Letters**: R and A are in the word.  
- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
- **Strategy**: Test R in an untried position (1) and A in an untested position (2) while introducing new common vowels/consonants (O, I, D) to gather more information. The word ""radio"" fits:
  - Places R in position 1 (testing if correct or narrowing its position).
  - Places A in position 2 (testing if correct or indicating it must be in position 5 later).
  - Uses valid letters (D, I, O) not yet tested and avoids eliminated letters.

This guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and new letters efficiently with 4 tries remaining.

<guess>radio</guess>",radio,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- This means: R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: stray -> S(x), T(x), R(-), A(-), Y(x)
- This means: S, T, Y are not in the word. R and A are still in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Because R was in position 3? And A in position 4? Both gave '-', meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

From guess 2: 
- Position 1: S (x) -> not in word
- Position 2: T (x) -> not in word
- Position 3: R (-) -> R is in word, but not in position 3
- Position 4: A (-) -> A is in word, but not in position 4
- Position 5: Y (x) -> not in word

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: R and A (for sure, since both have been marked present twice)
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E from first guess; S, T, Y from second guess. So eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y.
- We also know positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 3 (from second guess).
  - A cannot be in position 3 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).

Possible positions for R: only positions 1, 4, 5 left? Because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out? Let's confirm:
  - First guess: R in position 2 -> wrong position? But the '-' means R is present? And not at position2? So R could be in 1,3,4,5? Then in second guess: R in position3 -> wrong position? So now we know R is not in position3? So R must be in position 1,4, or5? Similarly, A? First guess: position3 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position3? Second guess: position4 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position4? Also, positions tested: A can be in positions 1,2,5? Because we haven't tried these? Or if we tried? Position1? We tried C and S? Not A? Position2? We tried R and T? Not A? Position5? We tried E and Y? Not A? So possible positions for A: 1,2,5.

Additionally, the word has three more letters? Because we only have two letters? R and A? And five positions? So three additional distinct letters? Or duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates? So likely no duplicates? We proceed with that assumption until proven otherwise.

We have eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y. So the remaining letters? We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet? Except these? So possible remaining letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But of course? We only use common letters? For Wordle.

We know the word contains R and A? And we need to place them?

Moreover, we haven't tested positions 1 and 5? With R? Similarly for A? But position1? We tried S? Got x? And position5? We tried Y? Got x? So these positions? We can put existing letters? Or new ones?

But we must include R? So R must be in 1,4,5? And A in positions 1,2,5? But if R is in1? Then A cannot be in1? Similarly? If R in5? Then A cannot be in5? So the positions?

Also? We have three more letters? So we need to cover all positions.

Possible placements?

Let me consider positions for R:

Option 1: R in position1. Then A can be in position2 or5? Because if A is in1? Then conflict? So A cannot be in1? So A must be in2 or5.

If R in position1? Then positions 1(R),2(?),3(?),4(?),5(?) with A in either 2 or5.

Similarly? If R in position4? Then A cannot be in4? So A in1,2,5? But? Position4: R? Then the others?

Similarly? R in position5? Then A in1 or2? Because if A in5? Conflict.

So? Now? For our next guess? We want to test possibilities? And include new letters? To narrow down? Also? we haven't tested positions 3? Much? Position3 was R? But wrong? Or we had A in position3? But wrong? So we have tested new letters? In position3? Only in first guess?

But now? Position3: we haven't put any other letter? Only in the first guess: A? And second: R? But both wrong? So we need to try a new letter? In position3? Or elsewhere?

Similarly? Position2? In first guess: R (which was present? But not there)? Second: T (absent)? So we haven't tested with other letters? But we know T is absent? So we can try new letter? In position2.

Similarly? position3: similarly? new letter.

The strategy is to try a word that contains R and A? Placed in one of the possible configurations? Along with other common letters? Avoiding the eliminated ones.

Moreover? We want maximum information? So perhaps test R? In a new position? And test A? In a new position? That we haven't tried? For R? Possibilities: position4 or5? Because we tried position2 and3? And if we don't try position1 this time? Then we leave it? For another guess? But we only have 4 guesses left? So we need efficient.

Similarly? For A? We haven't tried positions 1, 2, 5? So we should cover one of them? Preferably not both at once? To isolate?

But let's form a word? Say? put R in position1? And A in position5? For example? Then positions 2,3,4? Need letters.

So pattern: R _ _ _ A

Now? We avoid the eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? And choose common letters? For positions 2,3,4? Say? L, O? P? Etc.

For example: ""ROBOT"" has O,B,O,T? But T eliminated? So no? ""ROGUE""? But E eliminated? And U? ""RODEO""? Eliminated E? and O? But E gone? How about ""ROBIN""? N eliminated? Bad.

Let's list common letters? Like O? L? I? B? etc.

Word: R O L A? But we need position4? Before A? In the pattern? Positions: R(1), O(2), L(3), something(4), A(5)? But we need a word? ""ROLLA""? Not valid? ""ROMAN""? M,A? ""ROMAN"": R(1),O(2),M(3),A(4)? But wait? We put A in position4? But we know A cannot be in position4? From second guess? Because feedback from ""stray"" for A in position4: '-'? Meaning A is in word but not at position4? So if we put A in position4 now? It would be wrong again? Because it was just tried and found not position4? So we must not put A in position4? Similarly R in position4? We are not putting A at4? But we are putting A at5? So that's okay? But in pattern R _ _ _ A? We haven't specified position4? Which must be a letter? So for ""ROMAN""? But ""ROMAN"" has A in position4? Which is forbidden? So we avoid? Similarly? we want A in5? So words ending with A? And starting with R? But avoid eliminated letters.

Possible words: ""RADIO""? But A at2? and D,I,O? Also? position4: I? position5: O? No? ""RADIO"": R(1),A(2),D(3),I(4),O(5). So A is at position2? Which is acceptable? And O at5? So that fits? Can we use ""radio""? But eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? So D,I,O? Are not eliminated? So valid? We can.

But in ""radio"": R in1? A in2? So if R is in1? And A in2? Then positions 3:D? 4:I? 5:O?

Now? if R is not actually in position1? Then we get '-' for R? And if A is not in2? Then get '-' for A? But if they are? Then ✓.

But also? we get information on D,I,O? Which are new.

Alternatively? consider other placements? For example? put R in position5? Then A in position2? So pattern: _ _ A _ R? Words like ""GUARD""? But U,A,R,D? Eliminated? Guard has U? which we haven't tested? But G? Also? We can try? But D? Perhaps? Not high frequency? Or ""HEARD""? H,E,A,R,D? But E eliminated? Bad? ""LIARD""? Not word? Other? ""BAKER""? E eliminated? ""MAKER""? E? Bad.

""RABBI""? Duplicate B? And I? Not common.

So ""radio"" seems good? Another: ""RAMBO""? M,B,O? Avoid E? O? But O is fine? But ""RAMBO""? Is B common? Perhaps? But let's?

Or ""RAPID""? P,I? But eliminated? We have? No? E? E eliminated? So valid? R,A,P,I,D? Positions: R(1),A(2),P(3),I(4),D(5). So A in2? But if we put A in2? And if A is indeed in position2? Then feedback will be ✓? Otherwise? -.

But we don't know? Yet.

Similarly? R in1? If ✓? Then great.

So ""radio"" is a valid choice? Let's go with that? But first? let me think about positions? We know A cannot be in4? But in ""radio""? A is in2? Not 4? So okay? Similarly? R cannot be in2 or3? And it is in1? Which is new? So acceptable.

But also? in position2? First guess? We had R? Which was wrong? Now we put A? So we test position2 with A? If correct? Then ✓? Otherwise? -? Meaning A is elsewhere.

Similarly? position1? We put R? So test position1? With R.

Thus? ""radio"" tests two new positions? And uses D,I,O? Which are new? Avoid eliminated? So good?

But note? We have eliminated E? So no 'e'? So radio is without E? Good.

Therefore? next guess: radio

Another possibility: if we want to test R in position4? But we haven't done? So try? For example? word: B A R O N? But N eliminated? And O? Not? But if we put R in position4? Then A? In say position2? So word: B A R O N? Invalid because N eliminated? Perhaps ""FARCE""? But C eliminated? So ""FAR"" something? Without C? And E gone? ""FARM""? But M? Then F(1),A(2),R(3)? Oops? R in position3? But position3 was tried? And R was there? But we know R cannot be in position3? Because second guess? R in position3 gave '-'? Meaning not position3? So if we put R in position3 again? It would be wasteful? So we avoid?

Therefore? better not to put R? In already tried positions? Similarly? for A? avoid positions 3 and4? So positions we have tried? With letters? We know? So we avoid? So acceptable positions? For R: only 1,5? Because 4? We haven't tried? But we also? Let me see? In first guess? R in position2? Position4? Was N? Eliminated? But position4? In second guess? We put A? Which was wrong? So position4? We have tried? But? Only with A? So R? Not tried? So we can put R in position4? For example.

Similarly? for A? Positions 1,2,5.

If we put R in position4? Then A? For example? in position2? Then word: _ A _ R ? 

Positions: 1? some letter? 2:A? 3? some? 4:R? 5? some.

So? For example? ""PAIRS""? But S? Eliminated? ""MAIRD""? Not word? ""HAIR""? Only 4 letters? ""FAIRD""? Not? ""LAIRD""? Not common? ""GAUZE""? E eliminated? ""QUAKE""? E gone? ""BAJRA""? Not English? Or ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? So positions: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R? Wait? R in position5? Not position4? We want R in position4? So pattern: for R in position4? So word must have fourth letter R? And A in position2? First letter? Whatever? Third? Whatever? Fifth? Whatever? Avoid eliminated? So ""MAJOR"" would be: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R(5) -> R is in position5? Not 4.

To have R in4: ""CHAIR""? C eliminated? ""FAIRY""? Y eliminated? ""FLAIR""? L, A, I? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3)? But A cannot be in position3? Because of first guess? So if we put A in3? Then we know it's wrong? But we can try? But inefficient? Because we know A is not in3? So we don't want A in3? Similarly? In our new word? we want A not in3 or4? So if we put R in4? Then we still need A? which must be in1,2, or5? So we put A? For example? in position2? Then avoid position3? For A? 

So word: _ A _ R ? 

So: position1: letter? position2: A? position3: letter (but not A? because if A? it's wrong)? position4: R? position5: letter.

Now? position3? Must be a new letter? Since we cannot put A? So? For example? ""GAZER""? E and R? But E eliminated? ""PALER""? E? Bad? ""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? Positions: V(1),A(2),L(3),I(4),D(5)? Then R? is not included? But we need R? So must include R? But where? Position4? But we have I? So not? Unless we put R in4? But in this word? we don't have R? 

How about ""HAIRY""? H,A,I,R,Y? But Y eliminated? Bad? ""BAIRN""? N eliminated? 

It seems difficult? Without duplication? So perhaps ""radio""? With R in1 and A in2? Is better? Because it forms a common word? And tests new positions? 

Other common words? Such as ""RABID""? B,I,Y? But Y eliminated? No? In ""RABID""? R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5)? So no Y? Eliminated are C,E,N,S,T,Y? So B,I,D? Are all allowed? Then? ""RABID""? 

Similarly? ""RAPID""? as above? 

Both are valid? 

So I'll go with ""RABID""? Or ""RAPID""? Let's see? 

""RABID"": R in position1? A in position2? B in3? I in4? D in5? 

If correct? We get solves? Otherwise? feedback will tell? 

But also? we test B and I and D? Not eliminated? 

So I think it's acceptable? 

But earlier I thought ""radio""? Now? comparing? ""RABID"" vs ""RADIO""? 

""RABID"": letters B,I,D? 
""RADIO"": letters D,I,O? Both fine? 

Perhaps no preference? But O is a vowel? More common? But D is consonant? Not sure? 

Since we have missing letters? Better to test vowels? So ""radio"" with O? Might be better? 

Therefore? I'll choose ""radio""? 

So guess: ""radio""

But let me ensure? 

First? R in position1? If R is not in1? Then feedback will be '-'? Meaning R? in word? But wrong position? Then R must be in position5? Because positions 2,3,4? Are ruled? R cannot be in2? Cannot be in3? And we thought position4? But if we put R in4? In a future guess? But now? if we get '-'? For R in1? Then R must be in position4 or5? But we haven't tried position4? And position5 hasn't been tried with R? 

Similarly? A in position2? If not? Then A must be in position5? Because positions 3 and4? Cannot? And position1? We haven't tried? But A can be in1? If not? We'll have to try later? 

So? ""radio"" is a good guess? 

Therefore? I'll go with that.Based on the previous feedback:
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, S, T, Y (since both guesses showed ""x"" for these).
- **Confirmed Letters**: R and A are in the word.  
- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
- **Strategy**: Test R in an untried position (1) and A in an untested position (2) while introducing new common vowels/consonants (O, I, D) to gather more information. The word ""radio"" fits:
  - Places R in position 1 (testing if correct or narrowing its position).
  - Places A in position 2 (testing if correct or indicating it must be in position 5 later).
  - Uses valid letters (D, I, O) not yet tested and avoids eliminated letters.

This guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and new letters efficiently with 4 tries remaining.",Guess 3: radio -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,rabbi,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in:
C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all.
- R: is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in ""crane"").
- A: is in the word but not in the third position.
- N: not in the word.
- E: not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The word contains the letters R and A, but they are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- We have eliminated C, N, and E. So the word cannot have these letters.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

We need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are present), and avoids C, N, E.

Additionally, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we should try to place R and A in different positions.

Let's try to think of words that include R and A, and use other common consonants. Avoid positions 2 for R and position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback tells us that in the guess ""crane"", R (in position 2) is not correct, so R might be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, the feedback is:

Position: 1: C (x) -> not in word
         2: R (-) -> in word, not here
         3: A (-) -> in word, not here
         4: N (x) -> not in word
         5: E (x) -> not in word

So R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.

Also, R and A are definitely in the word.

Since we have eliminated C, N, E, we can use other letters.

Common vowels: We have A already, and E is out. So other vowels: O, I, U? But we don't know yet.

Let's list possible letters: We avoid C, N, E. Also, since R and A are already present, we need to include at least one R and one A (but note: the word might have duplicate letters? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but the feedback might show duplicates appropriately. However, without any duplication indicated so far, we'll assume no duplicates for now until we see feedback that suggests otherwise).

In feedback, we have one R and one A marked as present, so likely the word has exactly one R and one A? It might have more, but we don't know.

So for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we can try R in other positions and A in other positions.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5? But note: position 1 was C (not present) so R could be in 1? However, we don't know if position 1 is available. Similarly, position 4 and 5 are open.

Similarly for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

But we also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

Common words: 
- Words starting with R: like ""RADAR"" but that has duplicate letters and we haven't tested D? Also, A is in position 2, which we haven't tested for A? However, in our previous guess, A was in position 3 and found wrong, but A can be in position 2 now? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A.

Similarly, R can be in any position except 2? But note: we only know that in position 2 it was wrong, but it might be in 1,3,4,5.

But wait, if we put R in position 1, that might be good because we haven't tested position 1 with R? Also, we know that position 1 was C which is absent, but a new letter might be there.

Similarly, we can try to test other letters.

What are the most common letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried T, L, S, O, I, etc.

A good strategy is to test new letters to get more information.

So we need to cover new positions and letters.

We know:
- Positions that we tried: 
  Position 1: tried C (not in word) -> so avoid C there, but any other letter is possible.
  Position 2: tried R (but R is in word, just not here) -> we can try another letter at position 2? Or even R again? But let's try a new letter.

But we must include R and A in the word. So they must be somewhere.

We can form a word that uses R and A and three new letters to get more data.

Let's try:

Option: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? Then we need letters for 2,3,5.

For example: R _ _ A _

Now, we avoid C, N, E.

What letters can we use? Let's use common letters: T, L, S, O, etc.

Word: ""RATIO"" - but note we haven't tested O? Also, T and I.

But we must check if it's valid: R A T I O -> wait, but we want R in 1 and A in 4? In ""RATIO"", positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> but we cannot put A in position 2? Because we are free to try. Actually, we know A is in the word but not in position 3? Position 2 is new.

But in feedback from first guess, for A: we know that if we put A in position 3 it was wrong, but other positions are okay. So putting A in position 2 is possible.

But note: we must be cautious because we are still investigating.

Another idea: since R was in position 2 originally, we know R is not there. Similarly, A is not in 3. So for our new guess, we can avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? That's already enforced because we know it's wrong? Actually, no: we can put R in position 2 again, but we expect it to be wrong? It would be inefficient because we know it's wrong.

So better not to put A in position 3 again? And not R in position 2? Actually, we can avoid those to maximize chance of getting correct positions.

Moreover, we want to test positions we haven't tested? For example, position 1,4,5.

But we tested position 1 with C (absent) but any other letter could be there.

So, for our next guess, we want to put R in a position that we haven't tested: such as 1,4, or 5? Similarly for A: positions 1,2,4,5. We haven't tested position 1 at all? Only with C which is absent.

Actually, we tested each position:

We know:
- Position 1: letter was C (not in word) -> so if we put a letter and it's correct, we get ✓, if present but wrong position, -, etc.

But we only tested with C and got x, so the correct letter for position1 is any from the alphabet without C,E,N? And not R? Because R we have not tested in position1? So let's try R at position1? That's a candidate.

Similarly, we can try A at position2? Because in first guess position2 was R (which gave -, meaning R is in word but not here) so now if we put A in position2 and it's present, it's either ✓ or -? And if we get ✓, that position2 is A.

So it's a good idea?

Let's design:

We want to try R at position1 and A at position2? But wait, we know that R is in the word? If we put R at position1, two possibilities: either correct position (then ✓) or if not, then - if wrong position? But we don't know whether R is in position1? It might be.

But also, we have to keep in mind that we haven't tested position1 with any other letter? So if we put a new letter, we might get information.

Therefore, perhaps better to try R in a new position? We have positions 1,4,5 available that haven't had R? Because we only tried R in position2? So we can try R at position1? That way, if we get ✓, great. If not, then we know R must be in positions 4 or 5? Because we'll test positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, not quite? We are testing only the positions we put.

But we can only try one position per guess.

So let's try R at position1? And put A at position4? Then we can try a new letter at position2 and position3? For example, common letters.

But we don't know the vowel situation: we have A present? And we've eliminated E? So maybe try I or O? Or consonants like T, S, L.

So, candidate: R _ _ A _

Fill the blanks: let's choose common letters. For position2: say T? Position3: L? Position5: Y? ""RATAL""? Not a word. Or ""RALPH""? Not likely? Other: ""RATIO"" but then A would be in position2? And no A in position4? Let me spell it:

If we want R at1, then A at4? So word: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3) but wait, we want A at4? In ""ROAST"" A is at3? We must avoid position3 for A? Because we know A cannot be in position3? So we shouldn't put A in position3? Actually, we can if we want to test? But if we know A is not in position3? Because of previous feedback? So we shouldn't put A in position3? It might be inefficient? Actually, it's not? Because if we put A in position3, we know it will be a '-' if it is the same letter? Or if the word has two A's? Then maybe ✓ for one? But let's avoid complexity for now.

To avoid position3 for A? We can do.

So for ""ROAST"": R in1, O in2, A in3, S in4, T in5? But A in position3? We know from feedback that A is not in position3? Because the '-' for A in position3? Actually, wait: The '-' for A in position3 only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position? So if we put A in position3 again, we expect it to be wrong again? So unless the word has two A's? But we don't know? So to be efficient, we should avoid putting A in position3? Because if we do, it will show as '-' (if A is in word but not there) or if there is another A? But unlikely? So let's avoid.

Therefore, we need A in position other than 3? So acceptable positions: 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R: avoid position2? So acceptable: 1,3,4,5.

We are free to choose.

So candidate: R at position1 and A at position4? That's good. Then we need letters for position2,3,5.

We must avoid C,N,E. And choose common letters.

Let me try: position2: T? Then position3: L? Position5: S -> ""RATALS""? Not a word? ""RATAS"" not a word. 

Alternative: ""RABID"" -> R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), D(5)? But we want A at4? Not here.

We need A at position4? So:

Word: R at1, position4: A. So pattern: R _ _ A _

Possible words: ""RODIA""? Not common? ""ROBIN"" -> R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word? So not.

Another: ""ROAST"" but as above? If we move A? Wait, we want A at4? So that would require changing ""ROAST"" to? Not easily.

Maybe ""ROYAL"": R(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> yes, ROYAL.

And it doesn't have C,N,E? Good.

Also, includes A at position4, R at position1.

Now, with this guess:
- We test R at position1: either ✓ if it's the correct position, or - if not? But since R must be present? Either way we get information on position1? If R is here, then ✓. If not, then we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5? Because we're testing position1? And we avoid position2.

Similarly, A at position4: if ✓, then good? Or - if wrong.

Also, we test O, Y, L? Which are new letters? So we get information?

It might be a good choice?

Another common word? Let's see: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but A is at2? Which is acceptable? But we had R at position2? Now we put A at position2? So we are testing A at position2? Which we don't have information? Also, R at1? Similarly.

But in ""RAILS"", A at position2? We have to test? And L at4? So it tests position2? Also, we avoid position3 for A? So it's okay.

But ""ROYAL"" seems fine? And it includes A in position4? Which might be a position we haven't tested? Or in the previous guess we tested position4 with N (which was absent)? So position4? It was N? So we know position4? We can try A at4? To see if it's correct? If we get ✓ for A? Then we have the fourth letter.

Similarly, in ""RAILS"", at position4 is L? Which is a new test? So both are possible? But let's pick the one that covers more new letters.

Actually, both have two vowels? ROYAL has O and A? RAILS has A and I? Both have four new letters? Because R we are testing? And except R and A, the rest are new? Wait, R and A are already present? But we are testing new positions and new letters? So O, Y, L in ROYAL? And in RAILS? I, L, S? 

It might be better? How about ""PARTY""? P-A-R-T-Y? Then R is at3? And A at2? But we have to include R? In PARTY, R is at position3? Which we haven't tested? We could try? Then we test P and T and Y? But P is less common? So perhaps ROYAL is more common?

Given that we have eliminated E? We can try words with O and Y? Or L.

But ROYAL is a valid word? Another word: ""ROAST"" if we put A in position4? We can't? So I'll stick to ROYAL? But let me confirm: ROYAL is accepted? Yes, it is a valid word.

So guess: royal

But let me check: r o y a l -> positions: 1:r, 2:o, 3:y, 4:a, 5:l

This will let us test:
- Position1 with R: could be ✓ or -
- Position4 with A: could be ✓ or -
- We also test letters O, Y, L? If any are in the word? And their positions.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down? Also, if R is not in position1? Then R must be in position3 or4 or5? But position4? We have A? So if R is not at1? Then later we can adjust? Similarly.

Alternative: ""STRAY"" -> S,T,R,A,Y? But positions: S at1, T at2, R at3? But we know R? and avoid position2 for R? Also, A at4? S at1: which we haven't tested? But we haven't eliminated S? Also, avoids C,N,E.

But R at3? Which is new? So it tests position1? And position3? 

Moreover, STRAY: positions:
1:S
2:T
3:R
4:A
5:Y

Now, we avoid position3 for R? Wait no: in first guess R was in position2? So we don't know about position3? We can put R there? And similarly A in position4? It avoids putting R in position2? And A in position3? So acceptable? Also, we test new letters: S, T, Y? 

Also, is STRAY valid? Yes.

But let's compare: ROYAL and STRAY? Both valid?

ROYAL: tests R at1? STRAY: tests R at3? Both test A at4? So which one?

Let's see the letters: STRAY has T and S? Common letters? ROYAL has O and Y? Y is less common? So perhaps STRAY is better? Because S and T are more frequent than O and Y.

In fact, maybe STRAY? We can get more information? Also, we know that position4? We previously had N (eliminated) so we can test position4 with A? And position1? We had C? So if we put S in position1? We test letter S? And if we get ✓ or -.

Similarly, T in position2? Position2 was R? But R gave '-', meaning R is in word not there? So position2? If T is the correct letter? Then ✓? Or if T is present elsewhere? Then '-'.

Thus, STRAY might be better because S and T are high frequency.

Therefore, I'll go with STRAY.

So guess: ""stray""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, N, and E are **not in the word** (x).  
- R and A **are in the word** but were in the **wrong positions** (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

For the next guess:  
- I need to include R and A since they are confirmed present.  
- I should avoid C, N, E.  
- R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3. Optimally, I should test new positions for these letters to gather information.  
- I should also test new common letters (like S, T, Y) to maximize coverage of the alphabet.  

The word **""stray""** fits well:  
- It includes R and A.  
- R is placed in **position 3** (new, untested position).  
- A is placed in **position 4** (position 4 was tested with N in the first guess, which was absent).  
- S is tested in position 1 (previously C, which was absent).  
- T is tested in position 2 (previously R, which was present but misplaced).  
- Y is tested in position 5 (new position).  
- Avoids C, N, E.  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for key letters and introduces high-frequency consonants like S and T.

<guess>stray</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stray -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- This means: R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: stray -> S(x), T(x), R(-), A(-), Y(x)
- This means: S, T, Y are not in the word. R and A are still in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Because R was in position 3? And A in position 4? Both gave '-', meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

From guess 2: 
- Position 1: S (x) -> not in word
- Position 2: T (x) -> not in word
- Position 3: R (-) -> R is in word, but not in position 3
- Position 4: A (-) -> A is in word, but not in position 4
- Position 5: Y (x) -> not in word

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: R and A (for sure, since both have been marked present twice)
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E from first guess; S, T, Y from second guess. So eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y.
- We also know positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 3 (from second guess).
  - A cannot be in position 3 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess).

Possible positions for R: only positions 1, 4, 5 left? Because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out? Let's confirm:
  - First guess: R in position 2 -> wrong position? But the '-' means R is present? And not at position2? So R could be in 1,3,4,5? Then in second guess: R in position3 -> wrong position? So now we know R is not in position3? So R must be in position 1,4, or5? Similarly, A? First guess: position3 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position3? Second guess: position4 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position4? Also, positions tested: A can be in positions 1,2,5? Because we haven't tried these? Or if we tried? Position1? We tried C and S? Not A? Position2? We tried R and T? Not A? Position5? We tried E and Y? Not A? So possible positions for A: 1,2,5.

Additionally, the word has three more letters? Because we only have two letters? R and A? And five positions? So three additional distinct letters? Or duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates? So likely no duplicates? We proceed with that assumption until proven otherwise.

We have eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y. So the remaining letters? We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet? Except these? So possible remaining letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But of course? We only use common letters? For Wordle.

We know the word contains R and A? And we need to place them?

Moreover, we haven't tested positions 1 and 5? With R? Similarly for A? But position1? We tried S? Got x? And position5? We tried Y? Got x? So these positions? We can put existing letters? Or new ones?

But we must include R? So R must be in 1,4,5? And A in positions 1,2,5? But if R is in1? Then A cannot be in1? Similarly? If R in5? Then A cannot be in5? So the positions?

Also? We have three more letters? So we need to cover all positions.

Possible placements?

Let me consider positions for R:

Option 1: R in position1. Then A can be in position2 or5? Because if A is in1? Then conflict? So A cannot be in1? So A must be in2 or5.

If R in position1? Then positions 1(R),2(?),3(?),4(?),5(?) with A in either 2 or5.

Similarly? If R in position4? Then A cannot be in4? So A in1,2,5? But? Position4: R? Then the others?

Similarly? R in position5? Then A in1 or2? Because if A in5? Conflict.

So? Now? For our next guess? We want to test possibilities? And include new letters? To narrow down? Also? we haven't tested positions 3? Much? Position3 was R? But wrong? Or we had A in position3? But wrong? So we have tested new letters? In position3? Only in first guess?

But now? Position3: we haven't put any other letter? Only in the first guess: A? And second: R? But both wrong? So we need to try a new letter? In position3? Or elsewhere?

Similarly? Position2? In first guess: R (which was present? But not there)? Second: T (absent)? So we haven't tested with other letters? But we know T is absent? So we can try new letter? In position2.

Similarly? position3: similarly? new letter.

The strategy is to try a word that contains R and A? Placed in one of the possible configurations? Along with other common letters? Avoiding the eliminated ones.

Moreover? We want maximum information? So perhaps test R? In a new position? And test A? In a new position? That we haven't tried? For R? Possibilities: position4 or5? Because we tried position2 and3? And if we don't try position1 this time? Then we leave it? For another guess? But we only have 4 guesses left? So we need efficient.

Similarly? For A? We haven't tried positions 1, 2, 5? So we should cover one of them? Preferably not both at once? To isolate?

But let's form a word? Say? put R in position1? And A in position5? For example? Then positions 2,3,4? Need letters.

So pattern: R _ _ _ A

Now? We avoid the eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? And choose common letters? For positions 2,3,4? Say? L, O? P? Etc.

For example: ""ROBOT"" has O,B,O,T? But T eliminated? So no? ""ROGUE""? But E eliminated? And U? ""RODEO""? Eliminated E? and O? But E gone? How about ""ROBIN""? N eliminated? Bad.

Let's list common letters? Like O? L? I? B? etc.

Word: R O L A? But we need position4? Before A? In the pattern? Positions: R(1), O(2), L(3), something(4), A(5)? But we need a word? ""ROLLA""? Not valid? ""ROMAN""? M,A? ""ROMAN"": R(1),O(2),M(3),A(4)? But wait? We put A in position4? But we know A cannot be in position4? From second guess? Because feedback from ""stray"" for A in position4: '-'? Meaning A is in word but not at position4? So if we put A in position4 now? It would be wrong again? Because it was just tried and found not position4? So we must not put A in position4? Similarly R in position4? We are not putting A at4? But we are putting A at5? So that's okay? But in pattern R _ _ _ A? We haven't specified position4? Which must be a letter? So for ""ROMAN""? But ""ROMAN"" has A in position4? Which is forbidden? So we avoid? Similarly? we want A in5? So words ending with A? And starting with R? But avoid eliminated letters.

Possible words: ""RADIO""? But A at2? and D,I,O? Also? position4: I? position5: O? No? ""RADIO"": R(1),A(2),D(3),I(4),O(5). So A is at position2? Which is acceptable? And O at5? So that fits? Can we use ""radio""? But eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? So D,I,O? Are not eliminated? So valid? We can.

But in ""radio"": R in1? A in2? So if R is in1? And A in2? Then positions 3:D? 4:I? 5:O?

Now? if R is not actually in position1? Then we get '-' for R? And if A is not in2? Then get '-' for A? But if they are? Then ✓.

But also? we get information on D,I,O? Which are new.

Alternatively? consider other placements? For example? put R in position5? Then A in position2? So pattern: _ _ A _ R? Words like ""GUARD""? But U,A,R,D? Eliminated? Guard has U? which we haven't tested? But G? Also? We can try? But D? Perhaps? Not high frequency? Or ""HEARD""? H,E,A,R,D? But E eliminated? Bad? ""LIARD""? Not word? Other? ""BAKER""? E eliminated? ""MAKER""? E? Bad.

""RABBI""? Duplicate B? And I? Not common.

So ""radio"" seems good? Another: ""RAMBO""? M,B,O? Avoid E? O? But O is fine? But ""RAMBO""? Is B common? Perhaps? But let's?

Or ""RAPID""? P,I? But eliminated? We have? No? E? E eliminated? So valid? R,A,P,I,D? Positions: R(1),A(2),P(3),I(4),D(5). So A in2? But if we put A in2? And if A is indeed in position2? Then feedback will be ✓? Otherwise? -.

But we don't know? Yet.

Similarly? R in1? If ✓? Then great.

So ""radio"" is a valid choice? Let's go with that? But first? let me think about positions? We know A cannot be in4? But in ""radio""? A is in2? Not 4? So okay? Similarly? R cannot be in2 or3? And it is in1? Which is new? So acceptable.

But also? in position2? First guess? We had R? Which was wrong? Now we put A? So we test position2 with A? If correct? Then ✓? Otherwise? -? Meaning A is elsewhere.

Similarly? position1? We put R? So test position1? With R.

Thus? ""radio"" tests two new positions? And uses D,I,O? Which are new? Avoid eliminated? So good?

But note? We have eliminated E? So no 'e'? So radio is without E? Good.

Therefore? next guess: radio

Another possibility: if we want to test R in position4? But we haven't done? So try? For example? word: B A R O N? But N eliminated? And O? Not? But if we put R in position4? Then A? In say position2? So word: B A R O N? Invalid because N eliminated? Perhaps ""FARCE""? But C eliminated? So ""FAR"" something? Without C? And E gone? ""FARM""? But M? Then F(1),A(2),R(3)? Oops? R in position3? But position3 was tried? And R was there? But we know R cannot be in position3? Because second guess? R in position3 gave '-'? Meaning not position3? So if we put R in position3 again? It would be wasteful? So we avoid?

Therefore? better not to put R? In already tried positions? Similarly? for A? avoid positions 3 and4? So positions we have tried? With letters? We know? So we avoid? So acceptable positions? For R: only 1,5? Because 4? We haven't tried? But we also? Let me see? In first guess? R in position2? Position4? Was N? Eliminated? But position4? In second guess? We put A? Which was wrong? So position4? We have tried? But? Only with A? So R? Not tried? So we can put R in position4? For example.

Similarly? for A? Positions 1,2,5.

If we put R in position4? Then A? For example? in position2? Then word: _ A _ R ? 

Positions: 1? some letter? 2:A? 3? some? 4:R? 5? some.

So? For example? ""PAIRS""? But S? Eliminated? ""MAIRD""? Not word? ""HAIR""? Only 4 letters? ""FAIRD""? Not? ""LAIRD""? Not common? ""GAUZE""? E eliminated? ""QUAKE""? E gone? ""BAJRA""? Not English? Or ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? So positions: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R? Wait? R in position5? Not position4? We want R in position4? So pattern: for R in position4? So word must have fourth letter R? And A in position2? First letter? Whatever? Third? Whatever? Fifth? Whatever? Avoid eliminated? So ""MAJOR"" would be: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R(5) -> R is in position5? Not 4.

To have R in4: ""CHAIR""? C eliminated? ""FAIRY""? Y eliminated? ""FLAIR""? L, A, I? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3)? But A cannot be in position3? Because of first guess? So if we put A in3? Then we know it's wrong? But we can try? But inefficient? Because we know A is not in3? So we don't want A in3? Similarly? In our new word? we want A not in3 or4? So if we put R in4? Then we still need A? which must be in1,2, or5? So we put A? For example? in position2? Then avoid position3? For A? 

So word: _ A _ R ? 

So: position1: letter? position2: A? position3: letter (but not A? because if A? it's wrong)? position4: R? position5: letter.

Now? position3? Must be a new letter? Since we cannot put A? So? For example? ""GAZER""? E and R? But E eliminated? ""PALER""? E? Bad? ""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? Positions: V(1),A(2),L(3),I(4),D(5)? Then R? is not included? But we need R? So must include R? But where? Position4? But we have I? So not? Unless we put R in4? But in this word? we don't have R? 

How about ""HAIRY""? H,A,I,R,Y? But Y eliminated? Bad? ""BAIRN""? N eliminated? 

It seems difficult? Without duplication? So perhaps ""radio""? With R in1 and A in2? Is better? Because it forms a common word? And tests new positions? 

Other common words? Such as ""RABID""? B,I,Y? But Y eliminated? No? In ""RABID""? R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5)? So no Y? Eliminated are C,E,N,S,T,Y? So B,I,D? Are all allowed? Then? ""RABID""? 

Similarly? ""RAPID""? as above? 

Both are valid? 

So I'll go with ""RABID""? Or ""RAPID""? Let's see? 

""RABID"": R in position1? A in position2? B in3? I in4? D in5? 

If correct? We get solves? Otherwise? feedback will tell? 

But also? we test B and I and D? Not eliminated? 

So I think it's acceptable? 

But earlier I thought ""radio""? Now? comparing? ""RABID"" vs ""RADIO""? 

""RABID"": letters B,I,D? 
""RADIO"": letters D,I,O? Both fine? 

Perhaps no preference? But O is a vowel? More common? But D is consonant? Not sure? 

Since we have missing letters? Better to test vowels? So ""radio"" with O? Might be better? 

Therefore? I'll choose ""radio""? 

So guess: ""radio""

But let me ensure? 

First? R in position1? If R is not in1? Then feedback will be '-'? Meaning R? in word? But wrong position? Then R must be in position5? Because positions 2,3,4? Are ruled? R cannot be in2? Cannot be in3? And we thought position4? But if we put R in4? In a future guess? But now? if we get '-'? For R in1? Then R must be in position4 or5? But we haven't tried position4? And position5 hasn't been tried with R? 

Similarly? A in position2? If not? Then A must be in position5? Because positions 3 and4? Cannot? And position1? We haven't tried? But A can be in1? If not? We'll have to try later? 

So? ""radio"" is a good guess? 

Therefore? I'll go with that.Based on the previous feedback:
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, S, T, Y (since both guesses showed ""x"" for these).
- **Confirmed Letters**: R and A are in the word.  
- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
- **Strategy**: Test R in an untried position (1) and A in an untested position (2) while introducing new common vowels/consonants (O, I, D) to gather more information. The word ""radio"" fits:
  - Places R in position 1 (testing if correct or narrowing its position).
  - Places A in position 2 (testing if correct or indicating it must be in position 5 later).
  - Uses valid letters (D, I, O) not yet tested and avoids eliminated letters.

This guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and new letters efficiently with 4 tries remaining.

So the word cannot have these letters.\n\nWe also know the secret word is 5 letters.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are present), and avoids C, N, E.\n\nAdditionally, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3, we should try to place R and A in different positions.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that include R and A, and use other common consonants. Avoid positions 2 for R and position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback tells us that in the guess ""crane"", R (in position 2) is not correct, so R might be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, the feedback is:\n\nPosition: 1: C (x) -> not in word\n         2: R (-) -> in word, not here\n         3: A (-) -> in word, not here\n         4: N (x) -> not in word\n         5: E (x) -> not in word\n\nSo R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.\n\nAlso, R and A are definitely in the word.\n\nSince we have eliminated C, N, E, we can use other letters.\n\nCommon vowels: We have A already, and E is out. So other vowels: O, I, U? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters: We avoid C, N, E. Also, since R and A are already present, we need to include at least one R and one A (but note: the word might have duplicate letters? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but the feedback might show duplicates appropriately. However, without any duplication indicated so far, we\'ll assume no duplicates for now until we see feedback that suggests otherwise).\n\nIn feedback, we have one R and one A marked as present, so likely the word has exactly one R and one A? It might have more, but we don\'t know.\n\nSo for our next guess, we want to:\n1. Include R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we can try R in other positions and A in other positions.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5? But note: position 1 was C (not present) so R could be in 1? However, we don\'t know if position 1 is available. Similarly, position 4 and 5 are open.\n\nSimilarly for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nBut we also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.\n\nCommon words: \n- Words starting with R: like ""RADAR"" but that has duplicate letters and we haven\'t tested D? Also, A is in position 2, which we haven\'t tested for A? However, in our previous guess, A was in position 3 and found wrong, but A can be in position 2 now? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A.\n\nSimilarly, R can be in any position except 2? But note: we only know that in position 2 it was wrong, but it might be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nBut wait, if we put R in position 1, that might be good because we haven\'t tested position 1 with R? Also, we know that position 1 was C which is absent, but a new letter might be there.\n\nSimilarly, we can try to test other letters.\n\nWhat are the most common letters we haven\'t tried? We haven\'t tried T, L, S, O, I, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to test new letters to get more information.\n\nSo we need to cover new positions and letters.\n\nWe know:\n- Positions that we tried: \n  Position 1: tried C (not in word) -> so avoid C there, but any other letter is possible.\n  Position 2: tried R (but R is in word, just not here) -> we can try another letter at position 2? Or even R again? But let\'s try a new letter.\n\nBut we must include R and A in the word. So they must be somewhere.\n\nWe can form a word that uses R and A and three new letters to get more data.\n\nLet\'s try:\n\nOption: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? Then we need letters for 2,3,5.\n\nFor example: R _ _ A _\n\nNow, we avoid C, N, E.\n\nWhat letters can we use? Let\'s use common letters: T, L, S, O, etc.\n\nWord: ""RATIO"" - but note we haven\'t tested O? Also, T and I.\n\nBut we must check if it\'s valid: R A T I O -> wait, but we want R in 1 and A in 4? In ""RATIO"", positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:O -> but we cannot put A in position 2? Because we are free to try. Actually, we know A is in the word but not in position 3? Position 2 is new.\n\nBut in feedback from first guess, for A: we know that if we put A in position 3 it was wrong, but other positions are okay. So putting A in position 2 is possible.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because we are still investigating.\n\nAnother idea: since R was in position 2 originally, we know R is not there. Similarly, A is not in 3. So for our new guess, we can avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? That\'s already enforced because we know it\'s wrong? Actually, no: we can put R in position 2 again, but we expect it to be wrong? It would be inefficient because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo better not to put A in position 3 again? And not R in position 2? Actually, we can avoid those to maximize chance of getting correct positions.\n\nMoreover, we want to test positions we haven\'t tested? For example, position 1,4,5.\n\nBut we tested position 1 with C (absent) but any other letter could be there.\n\nSo, for our next guess, we want to put R in a position that we haven\'t tested: such as 1,4, or 5? Similarly for A: positions 1,2,4,5. We haven\'t tested position 1 at all? Only with C which is absent.\n\nActually, we tested each position:\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: letter was C (not in word) -> so if we put a letter and it\'s correct, we get ✓, if present but wrong position, -, etc.\n\nBut we only tested with C and got x, so the correct letter for position1 is any from the alphabet without C,E,N? And not R? Because R we have not tested in position1? So let\'s try R at position1? That\'s a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, we can try A at position2? Because in first guess position2 was R (which gave -, meaning R is in word but not here) so now if we put A in position2 and it\'s present, it\'s either ✓ or -? And if we get ✓, that position2 is A.\n\nSo it\'s a good idea?\n\nLet\'s design:\n\nWe want to try R at position1 and A at position2? But wait, we know that R is in the word? If we put R at position1, two possibilities: either correct position (then ✓) or if not, then - if wrong position? But we don\'t know whether R is in position1? It might be.\n\nBut also, we have to keep in mind that we haven\'t tested position1 with any other letter? So if we put a new letter, we might get information.\n\nTherefore, perhaps better to try R in a new position? We have positions 1,4,5 available that haven\'t had R? Because we only tried R in position2? So we can try R at position1? That way, if we get ✓, great. If not, then we know R must be in positions 4 or 5? Because we\'ll test positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, not quite? We are testing only the positions we put.\n\nBut we can only try one position per guess.\n\nSo let\'s try R at position1? And put A at position4? Then we can try a new letter at position2 and position3? For example, common letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know the vowel situation: we have A present? And we\'ve eliminated E? So maybe try I or O? Or consonants like T, S, L.\n\nSo, candidate: R _ _ A _\n\nFill the blanks: let\'s choose common letters. For position2: say T? Position3: L? Position5: Y? ""RATAL""? Not a word. Or ""RALPH""? Not likely? Other: ""RATIO"" but then A would be in position2? And no A in position4? Let me spell it:\n\nIf we want R at1, then A at4? So word: R _ _ A _\n\nPossible words: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3) but wait, we want A at4? In ""ROAST"" A is at3? We must avoid position3 for A? Because we know A cannot be in position3? So we shouldn\'t put A in position3? Actually, we can if we want to test? But if we know A is not in position3? Because of previous feedback? So we shouldn\'t put A in position3? It might be inefficient? Actually, it\'s not? Because if we put A in position3, we know it will be a \'-\' if it is the same letter? Or if the word has two A\'s? Then maybe ✓ for one? But let\'s avoid complexity for now.\n\nTo avoid position3 for A? We can do.\n\nSo for ""ROAST"": R in1, O in2, A in3, S in4, T in5? But A in position3? We know from feedback that A is not in position3? Because the \'-\' for A in position3? Actually, wait: The \'-\' for A in position3 only tells us that A is in the word but not in the third position? So if we put A in position3 again, we expect it to be wrong again? So unless the word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know? So to be efficient, we should avoid putting A in position3? Because if we do, it will show as \'-\' (if A is in word but not there) or if there is another A? But unlikely? So let\'s avoid.\n\nTherefore, we need A in position other than 3? So acceptable positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for R: avoid position2? So acceptable: 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe are free to choose.\n\nSo candidate: R at position1 and A at position4? That\'s good. Then we need letters for position2,3,5.\n\nWe must avoid C,N,E. And choose common letters.\n\nLet me try: position2: T? Then position3: L? Position5: S -> ""RATALS""? Not a word? ""RATAS"" not a word. \n\nAlternative: ""RABID"" -> R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), D(5)? But we want A at4? Not here.\n\nWe need A at position4? So:\n\nWord: R at1, position4: A. So pattern: R _ _ A _\n\nPossible words: ""RODIA""? Not common? ""ROBIN"" -> R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word? So not.\n\nAnother: ""ROAST"" but as above? If we move A? Wait, we want A at4? So that would require changing ""ROAST"" to? Not easily.\n\nMaybe ""ROYAL"": R(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> yes, ROYAL.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t have C,N,E? Good.\n\nAlso, includes A at position4, R at position1.\n\nNow, with this guess:\n- We test R at position1: either ✓ if it\'s the correct position, or - if not? But since R must be present? Either way we get information on position1? If R is here, then ✓. If not, then we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5? Because we\'re testing position1? And we avoid position2.\n\nSimilarly, A at position4: if ✓, then good? Or - if wrong.\n\nAlso, we test O, Y, L? Which are new letters? So we get information?\n\nIt might be a good choice?\n\nAnother common word? Let\'s see: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but A is at2? Which is acceptable? But we had R at position2? Now we put A at position2? So we are testing A at position2? Which we don\'t have information? Also, R at1? Similarly.\n\nBut in ""RAILS"", A at position2? We have to test? And L at4? So it tests position2? Also, we avoid position3 for A? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""ROYAL"" seems fine? And it includes A in position4? Which might be a position we haven\'t tested? Or in the previous guess we tested position4 with N (which was absent)? So position4? It was N? So we know position4? We can try A at4? To see if it\'s correct? If we get ✓ for A? Then we have the fourth letter.\n\nSimilarly, in ""RAILS"", at position4 is L? Which is a new test? So both are possible? But let\'s pick the one that covers more new letters.\n\nActually, both have two vowels? ROYAL has O and A? RAILS has A and I? Both have four new letters? Because R we are testing? And except R and A, the rest are new? Wait, R and A are already present? But we are testing new positions and new letters? So O, Y, L in ROYAL? And in RAILS? I, L, S? \n\nIt might be better? How about ""PARTY""? P-A-R-T-Y? Then R is at3? And A at2? But we have to include R? In PARTY, R is at position3? Which we haven\'t tested? We could try? Then we test P and T and Y? But P is less common? So perhaps ROYAL is more common?\n\nGiven that we have eliminated E? We can try words with O and Y? Or L.\n\nBut ROYAL is a valid word? Another word: ""ROAST"" if we put A in position4? We can\'t? So I\'ll stick to ROYAL? But let me confirm: ROYAL is accepted? Yes, it is a valid word.\n\nSo guess: royal\n\nBut let me check: r o y a l -> positions: 1:r, 2:o, 3:y, 4:a, 5:l\n\nThis will let us test:\n- Position1 with R: could be ✓ or -\n- Position4 with A: could be ✓ or -\n- We also test letters O, Y, L? If any are in the word? And their positions.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down? Also, if R is not in position1? Then R must be in position3 or4 or5? But position4? We have A? So if R is not at1? Then later we can adjust? Similarly.\n\nAlternative: ""STRAY"" -> S,T,R,A,Y? But positions: S at1, T at2, R at3? But we know R? and avoid position2 for R? Also, A at4? S at1: which we haven\'t tested? But we haven\'t eliminated S? Also, avoids C,N,E.\n\nBut R at3? Which is new? So it tests position1? And position3? \n\nMoreover, STRAY: positions:\n1:S\n2:T\n3:R\n4:A\n5:Y\n\nNow, we avoid position3 for R? Wait no: in first guess R was in position2? So we don\'t know about position3? We can put R there? And similarly A in position4? It avoids putting R in position2? And A in position3? So acceptable? Also, we test new letters: S, T, Y? \n\nAlso, is STRAY valid? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ROYAL and STRAY? Both valid?\n\nROYAL: tests R at1? STRAY: tests R at3? Both test A at4? So which one?\n\nLet\'s see the letters: STRAY has T and S? Common letters? ROYAL has O and Y? Y is less common? So perhaps STRAY is better? Because S and T are more frequent than O and Y.\n\nIn fact, maybe STRAY? We can get more information? Also, we know that position4? We previously had N (eliminated) so we can test position4 with A? And position1? We had C? So if we put S in position1? We test letter S? And if we get ✓ or -.\n\nSimilarly, T in position2? Position2 was R? But R gave \'-\', meaning R is in word not there? So position2? If T is the correct letter? Then ✓? Or if T is present elsewhere? Then \'-\'.\n\nThus, STRAY might be better because S and T are high frequency.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with STRAY.\n\nSo guess: ""stray""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, N, and E are **not in the word** (x).  \n- R and A **are in the word** but were in the **wrong positions** (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- I need to include R and A since they are confirmed present.  \n- I should avoid C, N, E.  \n- R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3. Optimally, I should test new positions for these letters to gather information.  \n- I should also test new common letters (like S, T, Y) to maximize coverage of the alphabet.  \n\nThe word **""stray""** fits well:  \n- It includes R and A.  \n- R is placed in **position 3** (new, untested position).  \n- A is placed in **position 4** (position 4 was tested with N in the first guess, which was absent).  \n- S is tested in position 1 (previously C, which was absent).  \n- T is tested in position 2 (previously R, which was present but misplaced).  \n- Y is tested in position 5 (new position).  \n- Avoids C, N, E.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for key letters and introduces high-frequency consonants like S and T.\n\n<guess>stray</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stray -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n- This means: R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out? Let\'s confirm:\n  - First guess: R in position 2 -> wrong position? But the \'-\' means R is present? And not at position2? So R could be in 1,3,4,5? Then in second guess: R in position3 -> wrong position? So now we know R is not in position3? So R must be in position 1,4, or5? Similarly, A? First guess: position3 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position3? Second guess: position4 -> wrong? So A cannot be in position4? Also, positions tested: A can be in positions 1,2,5? Because we haven\'t tried these? Or if we tried? Position1? We tried C and S? Not A? Position2? We tried R and T? Not A? Position5? We tried E and Y? Not A? So possible positions for A: 1,2,5.\n\nAdditionally, the word has three more letters? Because we only have two letters? R and A? And five positions? So three additional distinct letters? Or duplicates? But we haven\'t seen duplicates? So likely no duplicates? We proceed with that assumption until proven otherwise.\n\nWe have eliminated: C, E, N, S, T, Y. So the remaining letters? We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet? Except these? So possible remaining letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But of course? We only use common letters? For Wordle.\n\nWe know the word contains R and A? And we need to place them?\n\nMoreover, we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 5? With R? Similarly for A? But position1? We tried S? Got x? And position5? We tried Y? Got x? So these positions? We can put existing letters? Or new ones?\n\nBut we must include R? So R must be in 1,4,5? And A in positions 1,2,5? But if R is in1? Then A cannot be in1? Similarly? If R in5? Then A cannot be in5? So the positions?\n\nAlso? We have three more letters? So we need to cover all positions.\n\nPossible placements?\n\nLet me consider positions for R:\n\nOption 1: R in position1. Then A can be in position2 or5? Because if A is in1? Then conflict? So A cannot be in1? So A must be in2 or5.\n\nIf R in position1? Then positions 1(R),2(?),3(?),4(?),5(?) with A in either 2 or5.\n\nSimilarly? If R in position4? Then A cannot be in4? So A in1,2,5? But? Position4: R? Then the others?\n\nSimilarly? R in position5? Then A in1 or2? Because if A in5? Conflict.\n\nSo? Now? For our next guess? We want to test possibilities? And include new letters? To narrow down? Also? we haven\'t tested positions 3? Much? Position3 was R? But wrong? Or we had A in position3? But wrong? So we have tested new letters? In position3? Only in first guess?\n\nBut now? Position3: we haven\'t put any other letter? Only in the first guess: A? And second: R? But both wrong? So we need to try a new letter? In position3? Or elsewhere?\n\nSimilarly? Position2? In first guess: R (which was present? But not there)? Second: T (absent)? So we haven\'t tested with other letters? But we know T is absent? So we can try new letter? In position2.\n\nSimilarly? position3: similarly? new letter.\n\nThe strategy is to try a word that contains R and A? Placed in one of the possible configurations? Along with other common letters? Avoiding the eliminated ones.\n\nMoreover? We want maximum information? So perhaps test R? In a new position? And test A? In a new position? That we haven\'t tried? For R? Possibilities: position4 or5? Because we tried position2 and3? And if we don\'t try position1 this time? Then we leave it? For another guess? But we only have 4 guesses left? So we need efficient.\n\nSimilarly? For A? We haven\'t tried positions 1, 2, 5? So we should cover one of them? Preferably not both at once? To isolate?\n\nBut let\'s form a word? Say? put R in position1? And A in position5? For example? Then positions 2,3,4? Need letters.\n\nSo pattern: R _ _ _ A\n\nNow? We avoid the eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? And choose common letters? For positions 2,3,4? Say? L, O? P? Etc.\n\nFor example: ""ROBOT"" has O,B,O,T? But T eliminated? So no? ""ROGUE""? But E eliminated? And U? ""RODEO""? Eliminated E? and O? But E gone? How about ""ROBIN""? N eliminated? Bad.\n\nLet\'s list common letters? Like O? L? I? B? etc.\n\nWord: R O L A? But we need position4? Before A? In the pattern? Positions: R(1), O(2), L(3), something(4), A(5)? But we need a word? ""ROLLA""? Not valid? ""ROMAN""? M,A? ""ROMAN"": R(1),O(2),M(3),A(4)? But wait? We put A in position4? But we know A cannot be in position4? From second guess? Because feedback from ""stray"" for A in position4: \'-\'? Meaning A is in word but not at position4? So if we put A in position4 now? It would be wrong again? Because it was just tried and found not position4? So we must not put A in position4? Similarly R in position4? We are not putting A at4? But we are putting A at5? So that\'s okay? But in pattern R _ _ _ A? We haven\'t specified position4? Which must be a letter? So for ""ROMAN""? But ""ROMAN"" has A in position4? Which is forbidden? So we avoid? Similarly? we want A in5? So words ending with A? And starting with R? But avoid eliminated letters.\n\nPossible words: ""RADIO""? But A at2? and D,I,O? Also? position4: I? position5: O? No? ""RADIO"": R(1),A(2),D(3),I(4),O(5). So A is at position2? Which is acceptable? And O at5? So that fits? Can we use ""radio""? But eliminated letters? C,E,N,S,T,Y? So D,I,O? Are not eliminated? So valid? We can.\n\nBut in ""radio"": R in1? A in2? So if R is in1? And A in2? Then positions 3:D? 4:I? 5:O?\n\nNow? if R is not actually in position1? Then we get \'-\' for R? And if A is not in2? Then get \'-\' for A? But if they are? Then ✓.\n\nBut also? we get information on D,I,O? Which are new.\n\nAlternatively? consider other placements? For example? put R in position5? Then A in position2? So pattern: _ _ A _ R? Words like ""GUARD""? But U,A,R,D? Eliminated? Guard has U? which we haven\'t tested? But G? Also? We can try? But D? Perhaps? Not high frequency? Or ""HEARD""? H,E,A,R,D? But E eliminated? Bad? ""LIARD""? Not word? Other? ""BAKER""? E eliminated? ""MAKER""? E? Bad.\n\n""RABBI""? Duplicate B? And I? Not common.\n\nSo ""radio"" seems good? Another: ""RAMBO""? M,B,O? Avoid E? O? But O is fine? But ""RAMBO""? Is B common? Perhaps? But let\'s?\n\nOr ""RAPID""? P,I? But eliminated? We have? No? E? E eliminated? So valid? R,A,P,I,D? Positions: R(1),A(2),P(3),I(4),D(5). So A in2? But if we put A in2? And if A is indeed in position2? Then feedback will be ✓? Otherwise? -.\n\nBut we don\'t know? Yet.\n\nSimilarly? R in1? If ✓? Then great.\n\nSo ""radio"" is a valid choice? Let\'s go with that? But first? let me think about positions? We know A cannot be in4? But in ""radio""? A is in2? Not 4? So okay? Similarly? R cannot be in2 or3? And it is in1? Which is new? So acceptable.\n\nBut also? in position2? First guess? We had R? Which was wrong? Now we put A? So we test position2 with A? If correct? Then ✓? Otherwise? -? Meaning A is elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly? position1? We put R? So test position1? With R.\n\nThus? ""radio"" tests two new positions? And uses D,I,O? Which are new? Avoid eliminated? So good?\n\nBut note? We have eliminated E? So no \'e\'? So radio is without E? Good.\n\nTherefore? next guess: radio\n\nAnother possibility: if we want to test R in position4? But we haven\'t done? So try? For example? word: B A R O N? But N eliminated? And O? Not? But if we put R in position4? Then A? In say position2? So word: B A R O N? Invalid because N eliminated? Perhaps ""FARCE""? But C eliminated? So ""FAR"" something? Without C? And E gone? ""FARM""? But M? Then F(1),A(2),R(3)? Oops? R in position3? But position3 was tried? And R was there? But we know R cannot be in position3? Because second guess? R in position3 gave \'-\'? Meaning not position3? So if we put R in position3 again? It would be wasteful? So we avoid?\n\nTherefore? better not to put R? In already tried positions? Similarly? for A? avoid positions 3 and4? So positions we have tried? With letters? We know? So we avoid? So acceptable positions? For R: only 1,5? Because 4? We haven\'t tried? But we also? Let me see? In first guess? R in position2? Position4? Was N? Eliminated? But position4? In second guess? We put A? Which was wrong? So position4? We have tried? But? Only with A? So R? Not tried? So we can put R in position4? For example.\n\nSimilarly? for A? Positions 1,2,5.\n\nIf we put R in position4? Then A? For example? in position2? Then word: _ A _ R ? \n\nPositions: 1? some letter? 2:A? 3? some? 4:R? 5? some.\n\nSo? For example? ""PAIRS""? But S? Eliminated? ""MAIRD""? Not word? ""HAIR""? Only 4 letters? ""FAIRD""? Not? ""LAIRD""? Not common? ""GAUZE""? E eliminated? ""QUAKE""? E gone? ""BAJRA""? Not English? Or ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? So positions: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R? Wait? R in position5? Not position4? We want R in position4? So pattern: for R in position4? So word must have fourth letter R? And A in position2? First letter? Whatever? Third? Whatever? Fifth? Whatever? Avoid eliminated? So ""MAJOR"" would be: M(1),A(2),J(3),O(4),R(5) -> R is in position5? Not 4.\n\nTo have R in4: ""CHAIR""? C eliminated? ""FAIRY""? Y eliminated? ""FLAIR""? L, A, I? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3)? But A cannot be in position3? Because of first guess? So if we put A in3? Then we know it\'s wrong? But we can try? But inefficient? Because we know A is not in3? So we don\'t want A in3? Similarly? In our new word? we want A not in3 or4? So if we put R in4? Then we still need A? which must be in1,2, or5? So we put A? For example? in position2? Then avoid position3? For A? \n\nSo word: _ A _ R ? \n\nSo: position1: letter? position2: A? position3: letter (but not A? because if A? it\'s wrong)? position4: R? position5: letter.\n\nNow? position3? Must be a new letter? Since we cannot put A? So? For example? ""GAZER""? E and R? But E eliminated? ""PALER""? E? Bad? ""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? Positions: V(1),A(2),L(3),I(4),D(5)? Then R? is not included? But we need R? So must include R? But where? Position4? But we have I? So not? Unless we put R in4? But in this word? we don\'t have R? \n\nHow about ""HAIRY""? H,A,I,R,Y? But Y eliminated? Bad? ""BAIRN""? N eliminated? \n\nIt seems difficult? Without duplication? So perhaps ""radio""? With R in1 and A in2? Is better? Because it forms a common word? And tests new positions? \n\nOther common words? Such as ""RABID""? B,I,Y? But Y eliminated? No? In ""RABID""? R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5)? So no Y? Eliminated are C,E,N,S,T,Y? So B,I,D? Are all allowed? Then? ""RABID""? \n\nSimilarly? ""RAPID""? as above? \n\nBoth are valid? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""RABID""? Or ""RAPID""? Let\'s see? \n\n""RABID"": R in position1? A in position2? B in3? I in4? D in5? \n\nIf correct? We get solves? Otherwise? feedback will tell? \n\nBut also? we test B and I and D? Not eliminated? \n\nSo I think it\'s acceptable? \n\nBut earlier I thought ""radio""? Now? comparing? ""RABID"" vs ""RADIO""? \n\n""RABID"": letters B,I,D? \n""RADIO"": letters D,I,O? Both fine? \n\nPerhaps no preference? But O is a vowel? More common? But D is consonant? Not sure? \n\nSince we have missing letters? Better to test vowels? So ""radio"" with O? Might be better? \n\nTherefore? I\'ll choose ""radio""? \n\nSo guess: ""radio""\n\nBut let me ensure? \n\nFirst? R in position1? If R is not in1? Then feedback will be \'-\'? Meaning R? in word? But wrong position? Then R must be in position5? Because positions 2,3,4? Are ruled? R cannot be in2? Cannot be in3? And we thought position4? But if we put R in4? In a future guess? But now? if we get \'-\'? For R in1? Then R must be in position4 or5? But we haven\'t tried position4? And position5 hasn\'t been tried with R? \n\nSimilarly? A in position2? If not? Then A must be in position5? Because positions 3 and4? Cannot? And position1? We haven\'t tried? But A can be in1? If not? We\'ll have to try later? \n\nSo? ""radio"" is a good guess? \n\nTherefore? I\'ll go with that.Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, S, T, Y (since both guesses showed ""x"" for these).\n- **Confirmed Letters**: R and A are in the word.  \n- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.  \n- **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""stray""). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  \n- **Strategy**: Test R in an untried position (1) and A in an untested position (2) while introducing new common vowels/consonants (O, I, D) to gather more information. The word ""radio"" fits:\n  - Places R in position 1 (testing if correct or narrowing its position).\n  - Places A in position 2 (testing if correct or indicating it must be in position 5 later).\n  - Uses valid letters (D, I, O) not yet tested and avoids eliminated letters.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and new letters efficiently with 4 tries remaining.\n\n<guess>radio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stray -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: radio -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - C, N, E are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: stray -> S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x)
  - S, T, Y are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: radio -> R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x)
  - R is correct and in position 1 (✓).
  - A is correct and in position 2 (✓).
  - D is not in the word (x).
  - I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in the guess).
  - O is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The first two letters are R and A: so the word starts with ""RA"".
- I is in the word, but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 3 or 5, since positions 1 and 2 are taken by R and A).
- Eliminated letters: C, E, N, S, T, Y, D, O. (from all feedback so far)
- We also know that the word has I, and one more letter (since we have positions 3,4,5 to fill, and I is one of them, but not in position 4).

The word so far: R A _ _ _

We know I is in the word and not in position 4, so it must be in position 3 or 5.

Also, we have one more letter to find? Actually, two more positions? Positions 3,4,5? But I is one letter? So the word has three more letters? But we only have I confirmed? And we know the word has at least one I? But it might have more? But we don't know? So we assume one I for now? But we have to consider.

Actually, the word has 5 letters: positions 1 and 2 are R and A? Then positions 3,4,5: one of them is I? And the other two are two other letters? Or one letter repeated? But we don't have evidence of duplicates? So we assume distinct? Until we see.

But we have eliminated many letters? So the remaining letters? We have to choose from the alphabet without: C, D, E, N, O, S, T, Y? And also without R and A? Because they are already placed? But we need to find the other letters.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? But we know I is in the word? So we must include I? And one or two more? But we have three positions? But I is one? So two more letters? But we don't know? Actually, we have three positions? And I is one of the letters? So we need to fill positions 3,4,5? With I and two other letters? Or I and one other letter if duplicate? But we don't know? But from feedback? We haven't seen duplicates? So likely distinct? But we must be cautious.

But in the feedback for ""radio"", I was in position4? And got '-'? Meaning I is in the word but not in position4? So if the word has only one I? Then I must be in position3 or5? And position4 is a different letter.

Similarly? If the word has two I's? Then I could be in position3 and5? And position4 is something else? But we don't know? So we have to consider both possibilities? But for now? We can assume one I? And if we get feedback? We adjust.

So? The word: R A ? ? ?

With I in position3 or5? And position4 is a new letter? And if I is in3? Then position5 is new? Or if I in5? Then position3 and4 are new? But position4 is always new? Because we haven't placed I there? And it's not I? Because we know I is not in4? So position4 is a different letter.

So? We need to find a letter for position4? And for position3 and5? But one of them is I? The other is a new letter.

So? We have two new letters to find? Plus I? But I is known? So we need to find two new letters? For positions 3,4,5? But one of 3 or5 is I? So we need one letter for the other of 3 or5? And one for position4? So two new letters? But we don't know what they are? And we have eliminated: C,D,E,N,O,S,T,Y? And the word has no duplicates? So we choose from the remaining.

But we also know that I is in the word? So we must include I? But we are going to? Because we know it's there.

For the next guess? We need to form a word that starts with ""RA""? And then has three letters? With I in position3 or5? And avoid the eliminated letters? And use common letters? To test.

But we have to decide? Do we put I in position3? Or position5? We can try one? And see.

But we want to test? So perhaps try I in position3? Then we can see if it's correct? Or not? And also test a new letter for position4 and5.

Similarly? If we put I in position5? Then we test position3 and4.

But we also need to cover the possibility? So we can choose a word that has I in position3? And another that has I in position5? But we can only do one guess.

So? We can choose a word that tests I in position3? Because if it's correct? Then we have position3? And we only need position4 and5? But if not? Then I must be in position5? And we can adjust.

So? Let's try I in position3? So the word: R A I ? ?

Then we need two letters for position4 and5? Avoid eliminated? And common.

Eliminated: C,D,E,N,O,S,T,Y? So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But we need common? So F,G,H,L,M,P,U? Etc.

Common words: ""RAINY""? But Y eliminated? ""RAISE""? S and E eliminated? ""RAILS""? S eliminated? ""RAJAH""? H? And A duplicate? But we don't know? ""RAIN"" too short? ""RAINBOW"" too long.

""RAIN"" is 4? We need 5? So ""RAINS""? S eliminated? ""RAINY"" Y eliminated? ""RAITA""? T? But T eliminated? ""RAJAR""? Duplicate R? But R is already? And we don't know if duplicate? But in feedback? We haven't seen duplicate? So avoid? Or try? But let's avoid for now.

""RAILE""? E eliminated? ""RAILE"" not word? ""RAKIA""? K,I,A? But A duplicate? ""RAKIA"": R,A,K,I,A? So A in position2 and5? But we have A in position2? And if we put A in5? Then it might be duplicate? But we don't know? And K? Available? But ""RAKIA"" is a word? But let's see? We can try? But we have I in position4? But we want I in position3? In this case? ""RAKIA"": positions: R(1),A(2),K(3),I(4),A(5)? But we know I cannot be in position4? Because from feedback? In ""radio"", I in position4 was wrong? So if we put I in position4 again? It would be wrong? So we avoid? So we must not put I in position4? So in our new word? I must be in position3 or5? Not 4.

So for ""RAI ? ?"", we put I in position3? So pattern: R A I ? ?

Then position4 and5: two new letters? Avoid eliminated? And common.

Possible words: ""RAINBOW"" too long? ""RAINS"" too short? ""RAIN"" too short? ""RAILS"" S eliminated? ""RAILE"" not word? ""RAIRD"" not word? ""RAJAH"" has A? Duplicate? ""RAJAS"" S eliminated? ""RAJES"" E and S? Bad.

""RAFFS"" S? Bad? ""RAFTY"" T and Y? Bad? ""RAGAS"" S? Bad? ""RAGED"" E and D? Bad? ""RAGES"" E and S? Bad? ""RAGIS"" S? Bad? ""RAHUI"" H,U,I? But I is in position5? Not 3? We want I in position3? So ""RAHUI"" would be R(1),A(2),H(3),U(4),I(5)? So I in5? Not 3.

We need I in position3? So words like ""RAILS"" but S eliminated? ""RAINS"" S? Bad? ""RAIRD"" not word? ""RAITA"" T? Bad? ""RAI"" something? 

""RAINY"" is 5 letters? But Y eliminated? ""RAINS"" 5 letters? But S eliminated? ""RAZED"" E and D? Bad? ""RABID"" we tried? But in guess3? We had ""radio""? Not ""rabid""? But ""rabid"" has B and D? D eliminated? In feedback? D is eliminated? So ""rabid"" has D? So not? 

Another: ""RAVEN"" E and N? Bad? ""RAVIN"" N? Bad? ""RAWIN"" W,I,N? N eliminated? ""RAYON"" Y and O? Bad? 

It seems difficult? How about ""RAJAH""? But duplicate A? And H? But let's see: R(1),A(2),J(3),A(4),H(5)? But I is not included? We need to include I? Because we know I is in the word? So we must have I? So if we don't include I? Then we are not using the information? So we must include I? In position3 or5? 

So for pattern R A I ? ? ? We need a word that has I in position3? And two other letters? 

""RAILS"" is R,A,I,L,S? But S eliminated? So not? ""RAINS"" R,A,I,N,S? N and S eliminated? ""RAIDS"" R,A,I,D,S? D and S eliminated? ""RAI"" with F? ""RAIFF""? Not word? ""RAILE"" not? 

""RAI"" with P? ""RAIPE""? Not word? ""RAIPED""? Too long? 

""RAIN"" is 4? So we need 5? How about ""RAIN"" with a suffix? Not? 

Another idea: ""RAINBOW"" is 7? Too long? 

Perhaps ""RAI"" is not common? How about ""RAITA""? But T eliminated? 

Maybe we should put I in position5? Instead? So pattern: R A ? ? I

Then we can have words like ""RABBI""? But B? And duplicate B? ""RABBI"": R(1),A(2),B(3),B(4),I(5)? But duplicate B? And we don't know? But B is available? 

""RABBI"" is a word? But let's see? We can try? But we have to avoid eliminated? D? Not? So ""RABBI"" is possible? But we have I in position5? And we test B? 

But we also need to test position3 and4? With B? 

Another: ""RADII""? But D eliminated? And duplicate I? ""RADII"" has D? Bad? 

""RAGI"" is 4? ""RAGIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAKI"" is 4? ""RAKIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAMI"" is 4? ""RAMIE"" E? Bad? ""RAMIN"" N? Bad? 

""RANI"" is 4? ""RANIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAPI"" not? ""RAPID"" D? Bad? 

""RATI"" is 4? ""RATIO"" O? Bad? ""RATIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAVI"" is 4? ""RAVIN"" N? Bad? 

""RAWI"" is 4? ""RAWIN"" N? Bad? 

""RAXIS"" S? Bad? 

It seems hard? But we have to use a word? 

Another common word: ""RAIN"" is 4? But we can think of ""RAIN"" as part? But no? 

""RAISE"" E and S? Bad? 

""ROUSE"" O and E? Bad? 

Perhaps ""RALLY""? But L? And Y? Y eliminated? ""RALLY"" has Y? Bad? 

""RALPH"" H? And P? But no I? We must include I? 

We must include I? Because it is in the word? So we cannot omit I? 

So let's list words that start with ""RA"", have I in position3 or5? And avoid eliminated letters? 

Eliminated: C,D,E,N,O,S,T,Y? 

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? And I? 

For I in position3: R A I ? ? 

Possible: 
- ""RAI"" + two letters? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""L"" + ""L"" -> ""RAILL""? Not English? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""F"" + ""F"" -> ""RAIFF""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""G"" + ""G"" -> ""RAIGG""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""H"" + ""H"" -> ""RAIHH""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""J"" + ""J"" -> ""RAIJJ""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""K"" + ""K"" -> ""RAIKK""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""L"" + ""M"" -> ""RAILM""? Not word? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""L"" + ""P"" -> ""RAILP""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""M"" + ""L"" -> ""RAIML""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""P"" + ""L"" -> ""RAIPL""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""Z"" + ""L"" -> ""RAIZL""? No? 

Not working? 

For I in position5: R A ? ? I 

Words: 
- ""RA"" + two letters + ""I"" 
  - ""RABI"" + ? ""RABI"" is 4? So ""RABBI"" as above? 
  - ""RAGI"" is 4? ""RAGGI""? Not English? 
  - ""RAKI"" is 4? ""RAKKI""? No? 
  - ""RAMI"" is 4? ""RAMMI""? No? 
  - ""RANI"" is 4? ""RANNI""? No? 
  - ""RAPHI""? H,I? ""RAPHI"" is 5? R,A,P,H,I? Positions: R(1),A(2),P(3),H(4),I(5)? And avoid eliminated? P and H are available? So ""RAPHI""? Is it a word? RAPHI is not common? But it might be accepted? 

Another: ""RABBI"" we said? R,A,B,B,I? With duplicate B? 

""RABBI"" is a valid word? Meaning a Jewish scholar? 

Similarly, ""RAPHI"" might not be? 

""RAGI"" is a word? But 4 letters? 

""RALPH"" is 5? But no I? ""RALPH"" is R,A,L,P,H? But no I? So not? 

""RAMIE"" is 5? But E eliminated? 

""RUBLE"" E? Bad? 

""RAVEN"" E? Bad? 

Perhaps ""RAXIS"" but S? Bad? 

Another idea: ""HAIR"" is 4? But not start with RA? 

We need to include I? So how about ""RAJAH"" but no I? 

Perhaps we missed a word? Like ""RAIN"" but with different? 

""BRAID"" B,R,A,I,D? But R and A are at1 and2? But ""BRAID"" has B at1? Not R? 

We are fixed with R at1 and A at2? 

""FRAIL"" F,R,A,I,L? But positions: F(1),R(2)? But we have R at1? So not? 

The word must start with RA? 

So back to ""RAPHI""? Or ""RABBI""? 

""RABBI"" is more common? And it has I in position5? Which is good? And we test B in position3 and4? But duplicate B? So if B is in the word? And we put B in position3 and4? Then feedback might show? 

But we don't know if B is in the word? So we can try? 

Also, ""RABBI"" avoids eliminated letters? B is not eliminated? 

So let's try ""rabbi"" 

But in ""rabbi"", position3 and4 are both B? So if the word has only one B? Then position3 might be '-' and position4 might be 'x'? Or both '-' if B is present but not in those positions? But we have two B's? So if the word has B? Then it might be correct? Or not? 

But we have to try? 

Another word: ""RABIC""? C eliminated? Bad? 

""RADII"" D? Bad? 

""RAFFI"" F? And I? ""RAFFI"": R(1),A(2),F(3),F(4),I(5)? Duplicate F? And F is available? 

""RAFFI"" is a name? But accepted? 

Similarly, ""RAKKI"" not? 

""RAMMI"" not? 

""RAPPI"" not? 

""RAVVY"" V and Y? Y eliminated? 

So ""RABBI"" or ""RAFFI""? 

""RAFFI"" has F? Which is common? ""RABBI"" has B? 

But let's choose ""RABBI"" as it is a common word? 

So guess: ""rabbi"" 

But we have to be careful? In ""rabbi"", I is in position5? Which is one of the possibilities? 

If I is in position5? Then position3 must be a letter? And position4 another? But in ""rabbi"", position3 and4 are both B? So we are testing B? 

If we get feedback that B is not in the word? Then we know no B? And I is in position5? Then we need to find position3 and4? But we have only one guess left? Or more? We have 3 guesses left? We are at guess4? So 2 more after this? 

But let's do it? 

So guess: rabbi

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If the word is ""RA something I""? With I in5? Then in ""rabbi"", we have R(✓), A(✓), B(3), B(4), I(5)? 

Then feedback: R and A correct? I in5? If I is correct position? Then ✓? Or if not? But we think it is? 

But if the word has I in position3? Then in this guess? I is in position5? Which might be absent? Or present? But we know I is in the word? So if I is in position3? Then in position5? It might be a different letter? So I in position5 would be x? Or if duplicate? But we don't know? 

So it's risky? Because if I is in position3? Then ""rabbi"" has no I in position3? So I in position5 might be marked as '-' if duplicate? Or 'x' if not? But we know I is in the word? So if the word has only one I? And it is in position3? Then in position5? I would be 'x'? Because not in word? But we know I is in the word? So it must be that I is in position5? Or duplicate? 

But to avoid confusion? Perhaps better to put I in position3? In a word? 

But we couldn't find a word? 

Another common word: ""RAIN"" is not 5? ""RAIN"" with ""Y"" but Y eliminated? 

""MAIZE"" M,A,I,Z,E? E eliminated? 

""RAISE"" E and S? Bad? 

""PRIDE"" P,R,I,D,E? D and E bad? 

""BRIDE"" B,R,I,D,E? Bad? 

""GRIME"" G,R,I,M,E? E bad? 

""CRIME"" C and E bad? 

""DRIVE"" D and E bad? 

""FRUIT"" F,R,U,I,T? T eliminated? 

""GRAPE"" E? Bad? 

Perhaps ""QUAIL"" Q,U,A,I,L? But positions: Q(1),U(2),A(3),I(4),L(5)? But we need A in position2? So not? 

We are fixed to RA at start? 

So back to ""RAI"" with something? 

""RAILE"" not word? 

""RAILS"" S bad? 

""RAZED"" D and E bad? 

""RAFIK"" K? And F? ""RAFIK"" not word? 

""RAFTS"" T and S bad? 

""RAGAS"" S bad? 

""RAHIM"" H,I,M? ""RAHIM"": R(1),A(2),H(3),I(4),M(5)? But we know I cannot be in position4? Because from ""radio"" feedback? I in position4 was wrong? So if we put I in position4 again? It will be wrong again? So we avoid? 

So we must not put I in position4? So in ""RAHIM"", I is in position4? So not allowed? 

Similarly, any word with I in position4 is not allowed? Because we know it's not there? 

So for our new guess? I must be in position3 or5? 

So for position3: R A I ? ? 

We need a word like ""RAINBOW"" but too long? 

""RAIN"" is 4? How about ""RAINS"" but S bad? 

""RAIRD"" not word? 

""RAI"" with ""L"" and ""E"" but E bad? 

""RAI"" with ""L"" and ""A"" but A duplicate? ""RAILA"" not word? 

""RAIA"" is 4? 

Perhaps ""RAITA"" but T bad? 

I think we have to use a word with I in position5? Like ""RABBI"" or ""RAFFI"" or ""RAPHI"" 

""RAPHI"" might not be common? ""RAFFI"" is a name? ""RABBI"" is the most common? 

So I'll go with ""RABBI"" 

So guess: rabbi

But let's write it: R A B B I

Positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:B, 4:B, 5:I

We will get feedback on B and I? 

If I is in position5? Then it might be correct? Or if not? We'll see? 

Also, if B is in the word? But we have two B's? So feedback will tell? 

So it's acceptable? 

Therefore, next guess: rabbi

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C, N, E** are **not in the word**.  
  - **R and A** are **in the word** but **not in positions 2 or 3**, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: stray → S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x)**  
  - **S, T, Y** are **not in the word**.  
  - **R and A** are **in the word** but **not in positions 3 or 4**, respectively.  

- **Guess 3: radio → R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x)**  
  - **R is correct in position 1** (✓).  
  - **A is correct in position 2** (✓).  
  - **D and O are not in the word** (x).  
  - **I is in the word but not in position 4** (-).  

### Key Insights
- **Confirmed letters/positions**:  
  - Position 1: **R** (fixed).  
  - Position 2: **A** (fixed).  
  - The word starts with **RA**.  
- **I is present** but **not in position 4**. It must be in **position 3 or 5** (since positions 1 and 2 are fixed).  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, D, E, N, O, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions**: 3, 4, and 5 need to be filled.  
  - Position 4 is **not I** (from Guess 3 feedback).  
  - Positions 3 and 5 are candidates for I or new letters.  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since C, D, E, N, O, S, T, Y are eliminated).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test **I in position 5** (since position 3 is still untested for I).  
  - Introduce **new high-frequency consonants** (e.g., B, L, M) to gather information.  
  - Avoid position 4 for I (known incorrect).  
  - The word must include **I** (confirmed present).  

### Chosen Guess: **RABBI**
- **Structure**: R (position 1), A (position 2), B (position 3), B (position 4), I (position 5).  
- **Why this guess?**  
  - Tests **I in position 5** (if correct, it solves position 5; if not, I must be in position 3).  
  - Uses **B** (high-frequency consonant) in positions 3 and 4 to test for presence/position.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and respects fixed positions (R in 1, A in 2).  
  - If B is in the word, feedback on the duplicate B will clarify its position/count.  
- **Risk**: If I is actually in position 3, this guess may not fully solve the word, but it will confirm I's position and provide data on B.  

<guess>rabbi</guess>",rabbi,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - C, N, E are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: stray -> S(x) T(x) R(-) A(-) Y(x)
  - S, T, Y are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: radio -> R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(-) O(x)
  - R is correct and in position 1 (✓).
  - A is correct and in position 2 (✓).
  - D is not in the word (x).
  - I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in the guess).
  - O is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The first two letters are R and A: so the word starts with ""RA"".
- I is in the word, but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 3 or 5, since positions 1 and 2 are taken by R and A).
- Eliminated letters: C, E, N, S, T, Y, D, O. (from all feedback so far)
- We also know that the word has I, and one more letter (since we have positions 3,4,5 to fill, and I is one of them, but not in position 4).

The word so far: R A _ _ _

We know I is in the word and not in position 4, so it must be in position 3 or 5.

Also, we have one more letter to find? Actually, two more positions? Positions 3,4,5? But I is one letter? So the word has three more letters? But we only have I confirmed? And we know the word has at least one I? But it might have more? But we don't know? So we assume one I for now? But we have to consider.

Actually, the word has 5 letters: positions 1 and 2 are R and A? Then positions 3,4,5: one of them is I? And the other two are two other letters? Or one letter repeated? But we don't have evidence of duplicates? So we assume distinct? Until we see.

But we have eliminated many letters? So the remaining letters? We have to choose from the alphabet without: C, D, E, N, O, S, T, Y? And also without R and A? Because they are already placed? But we need to find the other letters.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? But we know I is in the word? So we must include I? And one or two more? But we have three positions? But I is one? So two more letters? But we don't know? Actually, we have three positions? And I is one of the letters? So we need to fill positions 3,4,5? With I and two other letters? Or I and one other letter if duplicate? But we don't know? But from feedback? We haven't seen duplicates? So likely distinct? But we must be cautious.

But in the feedback for ""radio"", I was in position4? And got '-'? Meaning I is in the word but not in position4? So if the word has only one I? Then I must be in position3 or5? And position4 is a different letter.

Similarly? If the word has two I's? Then I could be in position3 and5? And position4 is something else? But we don't know? So we have to consider both possibilities? But for now? We can assume one I? And if we get feedback? We adjust.

So? The word: R A ? ? ?

With I in position3 or5? And position4 is a new letter? And if I is in3? Then position5 is new? Or if I in5? Then position3 and4 are new? But position4 is always new? Because we haven't placed I there? And it's not I? Because we know I is not in4? So position4 is a different letter.

So? We need to find a letter for position4? And for position3 and5? But one of them is I? The other is a new letter.

So? We have two new letters to find? Plus I? But I is known? So we need to find two new letters? For positions 3,4,5? But one of 3 or5 is I? So we need one letter for the other of 3 or5? And one for position4? So two new letters? But we don't know what they are? And we have eliminated: C,D,E,N,O,S,T,Y? And the word has no duplicates? So we choose from the remaining.

But we also know that I is in the word? So we must include I? But we are going to? Because we know it's there.

For the next guess? We need to form a word that starts with ""RA""? And then has three letters? With I in position3 or5? And avoid the eliminated letters? And use common letters? To test.

But we have to decide? Do we put I in position3? Or position5? We can try one? And see.

But we want to test? So perhaps try I in position3? Then we can see if it's correct? Or not? And also test a new letter for position4 and5.

Similarly? If we put I in position5? Then we test position3 and4.

But we also need to cover the possibility? So we can choose a word that has I in position3? And another that has I in position5? But we can only do one guess.

So? We can choose a word that tests I in position3? Because if it's correct? Then we have position3? And we only need position4 and5? But if not? Then I must be in position5? And we can adjust.

So? Let's try I in position3? So the word: R A I ? ?

Then we need two letters for position4 and5? Avoid eliminated? And common.

Eliminated: C,D,E,N,O,S,T,Y? So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But we need common? So F,G,H,L,M,P,U? Etc.

Common words: ""RAINY""? But Y eliminated? ""RAISE""? S and E eliminated? ""RAILS""? S eliminated? ""RAJAH""? H? And A duplicate? But we don't know? ""RAIN"" too short? ""RAINBOW"" too long.

""RAIN"" is 4? We need 5? So ""RAINS""? S eliminated? ""RAINY"" Y eliminated? ""RAITA""? T? But T eliminated? ""RAJAR""? Duplicate R? But R is already? And we don't know if duplicate? But in feedback? We haven't seen duplicate? So avoid? Or try? But let's avoid for now.

""RAILE""? E eliminated? ""RAILE"" not word? ""RAKIA""? K,I,A? But A duplicate? ""RAKIA"": R,A,K,I,A? So A in position2 and5? But we have A in position2? And if we put A in5? Then it might be duplicate? But we don't know? And K? Available? But ""RAKIA"" is a word? But let's see? We can try? But we have I in position4? But we want I in position3? In this case? ""RAKIA"": positions: R(1),A(2),K(3),I(4),A(5)? But we know I cannot be in position4? Because from feedback? In ""radio"", I in position4 was wrong? So if we put I in position4 again? It would be wrong? So we avoid? So we must not put I in position4? So in our new word? I must be in position3 or5? Not 4.

So for ""RAI ? ?"", we put I in position3? So pattern: R A I ? ?

Then position4 and5: two new letters? Avoid eliminated? And common.

Possible words: ""RAINBOW"" too long? ""RAINS"" too short? ""RAIN"" too short? ""RAILS"" S eliminated? ""RAILE"" not word? ""RAIRD"" not word? ""RAJAH"" has A? Duplicate? ""RAJAS"" S eliminated? ""RAJES"" E and S? Bad.

""RAFFS"" S? Bad? ""RAFTY"" T and Y? Bad? ""RAGAS"" S? Bad? ""RAGED"" E and D? Bad? ""RAGES"" E and S? Bad? ""RAGIS"" S? Bad? ""RAHUI"" H,U,I? But I is in position5? Not 3? We want I in position3? So ""RAHUI"" would be R(1),A(2),H(3),U(4),I(5)? So I in5? Not 3.

We need I in position3? So words like ""RAILS"" but S eliminated? ""RAINS"" S? Bad? ""RAIRD"" not word? ""RAITA"" T? Bad? ""RAI"" something? 

""RAINY"" is 5 letters? But Y eliminated? ""RAINS"" 5 letters? But S eliminated? ""RAZED"" E and D? Bad? ""RABID"" we tried? But in guess3? We had ""radio""? Not ""rabid""? But ""rabid"" has B and D? D eliminated? In feedback? D is eliminated? So ""rabid"" has D? So not? 

Another: ""RAVEN"" E and N? Bad? ""RAVIN"" N? Bad? ""RAWIN"" W,I,N? N eliminated? ""RAYON"" Y and O? Bad? 

It seems difficult? How about ""RAJAH""? But duplicate A? And H? But let's see: R(1),A(2),J(3),A(4),H(5)? But I is not included? We need to include I? Because we know I is in the word? So we must have I? So if we don't include I? Then we are not using the information? So we must include I? In position3 or5? 

So for pattern R A I ? ? ? We need a word that has I in position3? And two other letters? 

""RAILS"" is R,A,I,L,S? But S eliminated? So not? ""RAINS"" R,A,I,N,S? N and S eliminated? ""RAIDS"" R,A,I,D,S? D and S eliminated? ""RAI"" with F? ""RAIFF""? Not word? ""RAILE"" not? 

""RAI"" with P? ""RAIPE""? Not word? ""RAIPED""? Too long? 

""RAIN"" is 4? So we need 5? How about ""RAIN"" with a suffix? Not? 

Another idea: ""RAINBOW"" is 7? Too long? 

Perhaps ""RAI"" is not common? How about ""RAITA""? But T eliminated? 

Maybe we should put I in position5? Instead? So pattern: R A ? ? I

Then we can have words like ""RABBI""? But B? And duplicate B? ""RABBI"": R(1),A(2),B(3),B(4),I(5)? But duplicate B? And we don't know? But B is available? 

""RABBI"" is a word? But let's see? We can try? But we have to avoid eliminated? D? Not? So ""RABBI"" is possible? But we have I in position5? And we test B? 

But we also need to test position3 and4? With B? 

Another: ""RADII""? But D eliminated? And duplicate I? ""RADII"" has D? Bad? 

""RAGI"" is 4? ""RAGIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAKI"" is 4? ""RAKIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAMI"" is 4? ""RAMIE"" E? Bad? ""RAMIN"" N? Bad? 

""RANI"" is 4? ""RANIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAPI"" not? ""RAPID"" D? Bad? 

""RATI"" is 4? ""RATIO"" O? Bad? ""RATIS"" S? Bad? 

""RAVI"" is 4? ""RAVIN"" N? Bad? 

""RAWI"" is 4? ""RAWIN"" N? Bad? 

""RAXIS"" S? Bad? 

It seems hard? But we have to use a word? 

Another common word: ""RAIN"" is 4? But we can think of ""RAIN"" as part? But no? 

""RAISE"" E and S? Bad? 

""ROUSE"" O and E? Bad? 

Perhaps ""RALLY""? But L? And Y? Y eliminated? ""RALLY"" has Y? Bad? 

""RALPH"" H? And P? But no I? We must include I? 

We must include I? Because it is in the word? So we cannot omit I? 

So let's list words that start with ""RA"", have I in position3 or5? And avoid eliminated letters? 

Eliminated: C,D,E,N,O,S,T,Y? 

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? And I? 

For I in position3: R A I ? ? 

Possible: 
- ""RAI"" + two letters? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""L"" + ""L"" -> ""RAILL""? Not English? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""F"" + ""F"" -> ""RAIFF""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""G"" + ""G"" -> ""RAIGG""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""H"" + ""H"" -> ""RAIHH""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""J"" + ""J"" -> ""RAIJJ""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""K"" + ""K"" -> ""RAIKK""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""L"" + ""M"" -> ""RAILM""? Not word? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""L"" + ""P"" -> ""RAILP""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""M"" + ""L"" -> ""RAIML""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""P"" + ""L"" -> ""RAIPL""? No? 
  - ""RAI"" + ""Z"" + ""L"" -> ""RAIZL""? No? 

Not working? 

For I in position5: R A ? ? I 

Words: 
- ""RA"" + two letters + ""I"" 
  - ""RABI"" + ? ""RABI"" is 4? So ""RABBI"" as above? 
  - ""RAGI"" is 4? ""RAGGI""? Not English? 
  - ""RAKI"" is 4? ""RAKKI""? No? 
  - ""RAMI"" is 4? ""RAMMI""? No? 
  - ""RANI"" is 4? ""RANNI""? No? 
  - ""RAPHI""? H,I? ""RAPHI"" is 5? R,A,P,H,I? Positions: R(1),A(2),P(3),H(4),I(5)? And avoid eliminated? P and H are available? So ""RAPHI""? Is it a word? RAPHI is not common? But it might be accepted? 

Another: ""RABBI"" we said? R,A,B,B,I? With duplicate B? 

""RABBI"" is a valid word? Meaning a Jewish scholar? 

Similarly, ""RAPHI"" might not be? 

""RAGI"" is a word? But 4 letters? 

""RALPH"" is 5? But no I? ""RALPH"" is R,A,L,P,H? But no I? So not? 

""RAMIE"" is 5? But E eliminated? 

""RUBLE"" E? Bad? 

""RAVEN"" E? Bad? 

Perhaps ""RAXIS"" but S? Bad? 

Another idea: ""HAIR"" is 4? But not start with RA? 

We need to include I? So how about ""RAJAH"" but no I? 

Perhaps we missed a word? Like ""RAIN"" but with different? 

""BRAID"" B,R,A,I,D? But R and A are at1 and2? But ""BRAID"" has B at1? Not R? 

We are fixed with R at1 and A at2? 

""FRAIL"" F,R,A,I,L? But positions: F(1),R(2)? But we have R at1? So not? 

The word must start with RA? 

So back to ""RAPHI""? Or ""RABBI""? 

""RABBI"" is more common? And it has I in position5? Which is good? And we test B in position3 and4? But duplicate B? So if B is in the word? And we put B in position3 and4? Then feedback might show? 

But we don't know if B is in the word? So we can try? 

Also, ""RABBI"" avoids eliminated letters? B is not eliminated? 

So let's try ""rabbi"" 

But in ""rabbi"", position3 and4 are both B? So if the word has only one B? Then position3 might be '-' and position4 might be 'x'? Or both '-' if B is present but not in those positions? But we have two B's? So if the word has B? Then it might be correct? Or not? 

But we have to try? 

Another word: ""RABIC""? C eliminated? Bad? 

""RADII"" D? Bad? 

""RAFFI"" F? And I? ""RAFFI"": R(1),A(2),F(3),F(4),I(5)? Duplicate F? And F is available? 

""RAFFI"" is a name? But accepted? 

Similarly, ""RAKKI"" not? 

""RAMMI"" not? 

""RAPPI"" not? 

""RAVVY"" V and Y? Y eliminated? 

So ""RABBI"" or ""RAFFI""? 

""RAFFI"" has F? Which is common? ""RABBI"" has B? 

But let's choose ""RABBI"" as it is a common word? 

So guess: ""rabbi"" 

But we have to be careful? In ""rabbi"", I is in position5? Which is one of the possibilities? 

If I is in position5? Then position3 must be a letter? And position4 another? But in ""rabbi"", position3 and4 are both B? So we are testing B? 

If we get feedback that B is not in the word? Then we know no B? And I is in position5? Then we need to find position3 and4? But we have only one guess left? Or more? We have 3 guesses left? We are at guess4? So 2 more after this? 

But let's do it? 

So guess: rabbi

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If the word is ""RA something I""? With I in5? Then in ""rabbi"", we have R(✓), A(✓), B(3), B(4), I(5)? 

Then feedback: R and A correct? I in5? If I is correct position? Then ✓? Or if not? But we think it is? 

But if the word has I in position3? Then in this guess? I is in position5? Which might be absent? Or present? But we know I is in the word? So if I is in position3? Then in position5? It might be a different letter? So I in position5 would be x? Or if duplicate? But we don't know? 

So it's risky? Because if I is in position3? Then ""rabbi"" has no I in position3? So I in position5 might be marked as '-' if duplicate? Or 'x' if not? But we know I is in the word? So if the word has only one I? And it is in position3? Then in position5? I would be 'x'? Because not in word? But we know I is in the word? So it must be that I is in position5? Or duplicate? 

But to avoid confusion? Perhaps better to put I in position3? In a word? 

But we couldn't find a word? 

Another common word: ""RAIN"" is not 5? ""RAIN"" with ""Y"" but Y eliminated? 

""MAIZE"" M,A,I,Z,E? E eliminated? 

""RAISE"" E and S? Bad? 

""PRIDE"" P,R,I,D,E? D and E bad? 

""BRIDE"" B,R,I,D,E? Bad? 

""GRIME"" G,R,I,M,E? E bad? 

""CRIME"" C and E bad? 

""DRIVE"" D and E bad? 

""FRUIT"" F,R,U,I,T? T eliminated? 

""GRAPE"" E? Bad? 

Perhaps ""QUAIL"" Q,U,A,I,L? But positions: Q(1),U(2),A(3),I(4),L(5)? But we need A in position2? So not? 

We are fixed to RA at start? 

So back to ""RAI"" with something? 

""RAILE"" not word? 

""RAILS"" S bad? 

""RAZED"" D and E bad? 

""RAFIK"" K? And F? ""RAFIK"" not word? 

""RAFTS"" T and S bad? 

""RAGAS"" S bad? 

""RAHIM"" H,I,M? ""RAHIM"": R(1),A(2),H(3),I(4),M(5)? But we know I cannot be in position4? Because from ""radio"" feedback? I in position4 was wrong? So if we put I in position4 again? It will be wrong again? So we avoid? 

So we must not put I in position4? So in ""RAHIM"", I is in position4? So not allowed? 

Similarly, any word with I in position4 is not allowed? Because we know it's not there? 

So for our new guess? I must be in position3 or5? 

So for position3: R A I ? ? 

We need a word like ""RAINBOW"" but too long? 

""RAIN"" is 4? How about ""RAINS"" but S bad? 

""RAIRD"" not word? 

""RAI"" with ""L"" and ""E"" but E bad? 

""RAI"" with ""L"" and ""A"" but A duplicate? ""RAILA"" not word? 

""RAIA"" is 4? 

Perhaps ""RAITA"" but T bad? 

I think we have to use a word with I in position5? Like ""RABBI"" or ""RAFFI"" or ""RAPHI"" 

""RAPHI"" might not be common? ""RAFFI"" is a name? ""RABBI"" is the most common? 

So I'll go with ""RABBI"" 

So guess: rabbi

But let's write it: R A B B I

Positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:B, 4:B, 5:I

We will get feedback on B and I? 

If I is in position5? Then it might be correct? Or if not? We'll see? 

Also, if B is in the word? But we have two B's? So feedback will tell? 

So it's acceptable? 

Therefore, next guess: rabbi### Analysis of Previous Feedback

  - **D and O are not in the word** (x).  
  - **I is in the word but not in position 4** (-).  

### Key Insights
- **Confirmed letters/positions**:  
  - Position 1: **R** (fixed).  
  - Position 2: **A** (fixed).  
  - The word starts with **RA**.  
- **I is present** but **not in position 4**. It must be in **position 3 or 5** (since positions 1 and 2 are fixed).  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, D, E, N, O, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions**: 3, 4, and 5 need to be filled.  
  - Position 4 is **not I** (from Guess 3 feedback).  
  - Positions 3 and 5 are candidates for I or new letters.  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since C, D, E, N, O, S, T, Y are eliminated).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test **I in position 5** (since position 3 is still untested for I).  
  - Introduce **new high-frequency consonants** (e.g., B, L, M) to gather information.  
  - Avoid position 4 for I (known incorrect).  
  - The word must include **I** (confirmed present).  

### Chosen Guess: **RABBI**
- **Structure**: R (position 1), A (position 2), B (position 3), B (position 4), I (position 5).  
- **Why this guess?**  
  - Tests **I in position 5** (if correct, it solves position 5; if not, I must be in position 3).  
  - Uses **B** (high-frequency consonant) in positions 3 and 4 to test for presence/position.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and respects fixed positions (R in 1, A in 2).  
  - If B is in the word, feedback on the duplicate B will clarify its position/count.  
- **Risk**: If I is actually in position 3, this guess may not fully solve the word, but it will confirm I's position and provide data on B.",Guess 4: rabbi -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) B(✓) B(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
