We are at the start of the game. We have no information yet.
 The goal is to choose a word that can provide maximum information. Typically, we want a word with common letters and no repeated letters to check multiple letters at once.

 Some common starting words in such games include words like ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. These words use common vowels and consonants.

 I think ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is also a solid choice: it has C, R, A, T, E which are common.

 However, to maximize the chance of getting vowels and common consonants, let's use ""ROATE"". According to some sources, ""ROATE"" is the best starting word because it maximizes the information in the average case? But let me think.

 Since the game is Wordle-like, and common practice is to use words with common letters.

 I'll choose ""SLATE"". It's popular because it has S, L, A, T, E — all common letters. Alternatively, I see that ""CRANE"" is also very good.

 Actually, let me pick ""CRANE"". It has three vowels and two common consonants.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Steps:
   - We are making the first guess.
   - We choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting feedback on many common letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CRANE"".
</think>
<thought>
This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback. The goal is to maximize information about the secret word. A good starting word should:
- Contain common vowels and consonants to test multiple frequent letters.
- Preferably have no repeated letters.

I considered words like ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""RAISE"". After evaluating, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and one semi-vowel (Y-sound in E) — covering frequent English letters.
- It uses three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are unique, allowing me to check if any occur twice in the secret word via future guesses.
- It leaves room for adaptation based on feedback.

High-frequency letters tested: E (most common in English), A, R, C, N. If I get ✓ or - for any, it narrows down possibilities significantly. If I get all ""x"", it eliminates many letters efficiently.

Thus, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the 4th letter of the secret word is N)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has N in the 4th position and does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter English word that:
- Has N as the 4th letter (since we know it's correct there, we can use that to get more information).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the word.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R), we should focus on other common letters.

Common English letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to include as many of these as possible in our next guess, while keeping N in the 4th position.

Possible words that fit:
- Must have N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- Avoid C, R, A, E.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern and use common untested letters.

Examples:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but we have N in the 4th, so P O I N T. This uses P, O, I, T (all new) and N (known). However, we already know N is in the word and in the 4th position, so we can use it to test other positions.
- ""JOINT"": J is less common, so maybe not ideal.
- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> again, N in 4th, and M, O, U, T are new.
- ""COUNT"": But C is already eliminated (we know C is not in the word), so we cannot use C. So ""COUNT"" is invalid because of C.
- ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"" are valid.

We also want to test vowels because we know A and E are out, so the word must have other vowels (like O, I, U, etc.). Since we have only one vowel left from the first guess (we tested A and E, but not O, I, U), we should test more vowels.

But note: the secret word might have multiple vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

We can also consider ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> but the 4th is N, so that works. However, we are missing testing a vowel? It has I.

Another idea: ""STING"": S, T, I, N, G.

But let's look for words that use more common letters and cover a variety.

We can also consider ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but we have N in the 4th. This tests B, L, I, D.

However, we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses P, O, I, T (all common and untested).
- It has two vowels (O and I) which we haven't checked.

But note: the word must be valid and we know the 4th letter is N, so we can use that.

Alternatively, ""MOIST"": but that doesn't have N in the 4th. We must have N in the 4th to confirm we are using the known information? Actually, we don't have to put N in the 4th again, but if we don't, we might not get information about other positions. However, since we know N is in the 4th, we can use that position to test other letters? Actually, no: the feedback for N would be a check only if it's in the 4th. If we put N in a different position, we might get a dash if it's in the word but wrong position, but we already know it's in the word and specifically in the 4th. So if we put N in a different position, we might get a dash, which would be inconsistent because we know it's only in the 4th? Actually, the word might have two N's? But we don't know that. The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the 4th). But it could have another N? We don't have information about that.

So, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have two N's? But the feedback for ""CRANE"" only had one N marked as correct. If there were two N's, and one was in the 4th, but the other was not in the word or in a different position, then in the first guess, if the other N was in the word but not in the guess, it wouldn't show. But in ""CRANE"", we only have one N (at the 4th). So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""CRANE"", we only covered one N (at the 4th), so the other N in the secret word would not be in our guess and thus we wouldn't know about it. Therefore, it's possible that there is another N.

But to keep it simple, for the second guess, we can put N in the 4th again to confirm that it's still there and to test other letters. Alternatively, we can put N in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But that might be less efficient.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to use the known N in the 4th to test other positions. So I will choose a word that has N in the 4th position.

So, back to ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T.

This tests:
- P in position 1
- O in position 2
- I in position 3
- N in position 4 (we know it's correct, so we'll get a check for that, but that doesn't give new info, but it confirms we are on track)
- T in position 5

We might get feedback on O, I, and T, and P.

Another option: ""JOINS"" but that has J which is less common, and S at the end. But we don't have N in the 4th? ""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S, so N is in the 4th? Yes, but then the 5th is S. But we want to test more common letters.

""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but N is in the 3rd position, not 4th. So that doesn't use the known N in 4th.

We need N in the 4th.

Let me list some words ending with N? No, the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is _ _ _ N _.

So, 5-letter words with N as the 4th letter: 
- ...N. : like BUNNY, but that has two N's and we avoid A, E (so BUNNY has U and Y, but also two N's). But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But we are avoiding C, R, A, E.

So, let's think of words: 
- POINT (P,O,I,N,T)
- MOUNT (M,O,U,N,T)
- JOINT (J,O,I,N,T) - J is less common
- FOUNT (F,O,U,N,T) - F is less common
- BLIND (B,L,I,N,D) - but D is common
- FLING (F,L,I,N,G) - F less common
- SLING (S,L,I,N,G) - S and G are common
- STING (S,T,I,N,G) - S, T, I, G are common

""STING"" is a good candidate: S, T, I, N, G. It tests S, T, I, G (all new) and N (known).

Similarly, ""POINT"" tests P, O, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to test more vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so we need to test O, I, U. 

In ""STING"", we test I (a vowel) and consonants S, T, G.
In ""POINT"", we test O and I (two vowels) and consonants P, T.

Since we have two vowels to test (O and I) and we don't know which one might be in the word, ""POINT"" tests two vowels at once. That might be more efficient.

But note: the secret word might not have O or I? But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can test a word with U? Like ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) which tests O and U (two vowels) and M, T.

But ""MOUNT"" uses O and U, which are both vowels, but we might not need to test both at once? Actually, testing multiple vowels is efficient.

But let's consider letter frequency in 5-letter words.

Common vowels: After A and E, the next are O, I, U.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N (we already have N), R (but R is eliminated), so S, T, L, D, M, etc.

We haven't tested S, T, L, which are very common.

So, a word that includes S, T, L and a vowel would be ideal, but with N in the 4th.

For example, ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> tests S, L, I, G. It has I (vowel) and S, L, G (consonants).

""STING"": S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G.

""POINT"" doesn't test S or L, but tests P which is less common than S or T.

So, I think ""STING"" is better because S and T are very common.

We can also consider ""BLIND"", but B and L: B is less common than S or T.

Another word: ""SWUNG"" - S, W, U, N, G -> but W is less common, and we test U.

But S and G are common.

However, I think ""STING"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""STING"" is a valid word: yes, it means a sharp pain.

So, I'll go with ""STING"".

But note: we are avoiding C, R, A, E, and ""STING"" doesn't have any of those.

Therefore, the second guess is ""STING"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked ""✓"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word has ""N"" as the 4th letter.
2. The word contains no C, R, A, or E.
3. We need to test new common letters to gather more information, focusing on untested vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants (like S, T, L, G, M).

For the second guess:
- Must have ""N"" in the 4th position to leverage known information.
- Should avoid C, R, A, E.
- Prioritize high-frequency untested letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, L) to maximize feedback.

After evaluating options like ""POINT"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""MOUNT"" (tests M, O, U, T), ""STING"" was chosen because:
- It tests S, T, I, and G—all common letters not yet tried.
- It includes the vowel ""I"" (since A and E are eliminated, testing other vowels is crucial).
- It fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ and avoids forbidden letters.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking S (position 1), T (position 2), I (position 3), and G (position 5), while confirming N in position 4.

<thought>
- Feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x). So, N is in the 4th position, and C, R, A, E are absent.
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ N _, excluding C, R, A, E.
- Second guess goals: Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, U, L, G) and include N in position 4.
- ""STING"" is valid: It uses S, T, I, N, G—all untested letters. S and T are high-frequency consonants, I is a vowel (needed after eliminating A/E), and G is a common consonant.
- Alternatives considered: ""POINT"" (tests P, O, I, T) but P is less common than S; ""MOUNT"" (tests M, O, U, T) but U is less frequent than I. ""STING"" optimizes for information gain by covering S, T, and I together.
- If ""STING"" gets feedback, it will reveal:
  - Whether S, T, I, or G are in the word and their positions.
  - Further narrow the search for the next guess.

<guess>STING</guess>",STING,"We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the 4th letter of the secret word is N)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has N in the 4th position and does not contain C, R, A, E.

Possible words that fit:
- Must have N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- Avoid C, R, A, E.

- ""JOINT"": J is less common, so maybe not ideal.
- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> again, N in 4th, and M, O, U, T are new.
- ""COUNT"": But C is already eliminated (we know C is not in the word), so we cannot use C. So ""COUNT"" is invalid because of C.
- ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"" are valid.

We also want to test vowels because we know A and E are out, so the word must have other vowels (like O, I, U, etc.). Since we have only one vowel left from the first guess (we tested A and E, but not O, I, U), we should test more vowels.

We can also consider ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> but the 4th is N, so that works. However, we are missing testing a vowel? It has I.

We can also consider ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but we have N in the 4th. This tests B, L, I, D.

However, we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses P, O, I, T (all common and untested).
- It has two vowels (O and I) which we haven't checked.

But note: the word must be valid and we know the 4th letter is N, so we can use that.

Alternatively, ""MOIST"": but that doesn't have N in the 4th. We must have N in the 4th to confirm we are using the known information? Actually, we don't have to put N in the 4th again, but if we don't, we might not get information about other positions. However, since we know N is in the 4th, we can use that position to test other letters? Actually, no: the feedback for N would be a check only if it's in the 4th. If we put N in a different position, we might get a dash if it's in the word but wrong position, but we already know it's in the word and specifically in the 4th. So if we put N in a different position, we might get a dash, which would be inconsistent because we know it's only in the 4th? Actually, the word might have two N's? But we don't know that. The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the 4th). But it could have another N? We don't have information about that.

So, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have two N's? But the feedback for ""CRANE"" only had one N marked as correct. If there were two N's, and one was in the 4th, but the other was not in the word or in a different position, then in the first guess, if the other N was in the word but not in the guess, it wouldn't show. But in ""CRANE"", we only have one N (at the 4th). So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""CRANE"", we only covered one N (at the 4th), so the other N in the secret word would not be in our guess and thus we wouldn't know about it. Therefore, it's possible that there is another N.

But to keep it simple, for the second guess, we can put N in the 4th again to confirm that it's still there and to test other letters. Alternatively, we can put N in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But that might be less efficient.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to use the known N in the 4th to test other positions. So I will choose a word that has N in the 4th position.

So, back to ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T.

This tests:
- P in position 1
- O in position 2
- I in position 3
- N in position 4 (we know it's correct, so we'll get a check for that, but that doesn't give new info, but it confirms we are on track)
- T in position 5

We might get feedback on O, I, and T, and P.

Another option: ""JOINS"" but that has J which is less common, and S at the end. But we don't have N in the 4th? ""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S, so N is in the 4th? Yes, but then the 5th is S. But we want to test more common letters.

""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but N is in the 3rd position, not 4th. So that doesn't use the known N in 4th.

We need N in the 4th.

Let me list some words ending with N? No, the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is _ _ _ N _.

So, 5-letter words with N as the 4th letter: 
- ...N. : like BUNNY, but that has two N's and we avoid A, E (so BUNNY has U and Y, but also two N's). But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But we are avoiding C, R, A, E.

So, let's think of words: 
- POINT (P,O,I,N,T)
- MOUNT (M,O,U,N,T)
- JOINT (J,O,I,N,T) - J is less common
- FOUNT (F,O,U,N,T) - F is less common
- BLIND (B,L,I,N,D) - but D is common
- FLING (F,L,I,N,G) - F less common
- SLING (S,L,I,N,G) - S and G are common
- STING (S,T,I,N,G) - S, T, I, G are common

""STING"" is a good candidate: S, T, I, N, G. It tests S, T, I, G (all new) and N (known).

Similarly, ""POINT"" tests P, O, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to test more vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so we need to test O, I, U. 

In ""STING"", we test I (a vowel) and consonants S, T, G.
In ""POINT"", we test O and I (two vowels) and consonants P, T.

Since we have two vowels to test (O and I) and we don't know which one might be in the word, ""POINT"" tests two vowels at once. That might be more efficient.

But note: the secret word might not have O or I? But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can test a word with U? Like ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) which tests O and U (two vowels) and M, T.

But ""MOUNT"" uses O and U, which are both vowels, but we might not need to test both at once? Actually, testing multiple vowels is efficient.

But let's consider letter frequency in 5-letter words.

Common vowels: After A and E, the next are O, I, U.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N (we already have N), R (but R is eliminated), so S, T, L, D, M, etc.

We haven't tested S, T, L, which are very common.

So, a word that includes S, T, L and a vowel would be ideal, but with N in the 4th.

For example, ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> tests S, L, I, G. It has I (vowel) and S, L, G (consonants).

""STING"": S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G.

""POINT"" doesn't test S or L, but tests P which is less common than S or T.

So, I think ""STING"" is better because S and T are very common.

We can also consider ""BLIND"", but B and L: B is less common than S or T.

Another word: ""SWUNG"" - S, W, U, N, G -> but W is less common, and we test U.

But S and G are common.

However, I think ""STING"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""STING"" is a valid word: yes, it means a sharp pain.

So, I'll go with ""STING"".

But note: we are avoiding C, R, A, E, and ""STING"" doesn't have any of those.

Therefore, the second guess is ""STING"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked ""✓"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word has ""N"" as the 4th letter.
2. The word contains no C, R, A, or E.
3. We need to test new common letters to gather more information, focusing on untested vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants (like S, T, L, G, M).

For the second guess:
- Must have ""N"" in the 4th position to leverage known information.
- Should avoid C, R, A, E.
- Prioritize high-frequency untested letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, L) to maximize feedback.

After evaluating options like ""POINT"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""MOUNT"" (tests M, O, U, T), ""STING"" was chosen because:
- It tests S, T, I, and G—all common letters not yet tried.
- It includes the vowel ""I"" (since A and E are eliminated, testing other vowels is crucial).
- It fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ and avoids forbidden letters.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking S (position 1), T (position 2), I (position 3), and G (position 5), while confirming N in position 4.

<thought>
- Feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x). So, N is in the 4th position, and C, R, A, E are absent.
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ N _, excluding C, R, A, E.
- Second guess goals: Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, U, L, G) and include N in position 4.
- ""STING"" is valid: It uses S, T, I, N, G—all untested letters. S and T are high-frequency consonants, I is a vowel (needed after eliminating A/E), and G is a common consonant.
- Alternatives considered: ""POINT"" (tests P, O, I, T) but P is less common than S; ""MOUNT"" (tests M, O, U, T) but U is less frequent than I. ""STING"" optimizes for information gain by covering S, T, and I together.
- If ""STING"" gets feedback, it will reveal:
  - Whether S, T, I, or G are in the word and their positions.
  - Further narrow the search for the next guess.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the start of the game. We have no information yet.
 The goal is to choose a word that can provide maximum information. Typically, we want a word with common letters and no repeated letters to check multiple letters at once.

 Some common starting words in such games include words like ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. These words use common vowels and consonants.

 I think ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is also a solid choice: it has C, R, A, T, E which are common.

 However, to maximize the chance of getting vowels and common consonants, let's use ""ROATE"". According to some sources, ""ROATE"" is the best starting word because it maximizes the information in the average case? But let me think.

 Since the game is Wordle-like, and common practice is to use words with common letters.

 I'll choose ""SLATE"". It's popular because it has S, L, A, T, E — all common letters. Alternatively, I see that ""CRANE"" is also very good.

 Actually, let me pick ""CRANE"". It has three vowels and two common consonants.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Steps:
   - We are making the first guess.
   - We choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting feedback on many common letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CRANE"".<thought>
This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback. The goal is to maximize information about the secret word. A good starting word should:
- Contain common vowels and consonants to test multiple frequent letters.
- Preferably have no repeated letters.

I considered words like ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""RAISE"". After evaluating, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and one semi-vowel (Y-sound in E) — covering frequent English letters.
- It uses three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are unique, allowing me to check if any occur twice in the secret word via future guesses.
- It leaves room for adaptation based on feedback.

High-frequency letters tested: E (most common in English), A, R, C, N. If I get ✓ or - for any, it narrows down possibilities significantly. If I get all ""x"", it eliminates many letters efficiently.

Thus, I'll start with ""CRANE"".
</thought>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the 4th letter of the secret word is N)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has N in the 4th position and does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter English word that:
- Has N as the 4th letter (since we know it's correct there, we can use that to get more information).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the word.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R), we should focus on other common letters.

Common English letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to include as many of these as possible in our next guess, while keeping N in the 4th position.

Possible words that fit:
- Must have N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- Avoid C, R, A, E.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern and use common untested letters.

Examples:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but we have N in the 4th, so P O I N T. This uses P, O, I, T (all new) and N (known). However, we already know N is in the word and in the 4th position, so we can use it to test other positions.
- ""JOINT"": J is less common, so maybe not ideal.
- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> again, N in 4th, and M, O, U, T are new.
- ""COUNT"": But C is already eliminated (we know C is not in the word), so we cannot use C. So ""COUNT"" is invalid because of C.
- ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"" are valid.

We also want to test vowels because we know A and E are out, so the word must have other vowels (like O, I, U, etc.). Since we have only one vowel left from the first guess (we tested A and E, but not O, I, U), we should test more vowels.

But note: the secret word might have multiple vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

We can also consider ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> but the 4th is N, so that works. However, we are missing testing a vowel? It has I.

Another idea: ""STING"": S, T, I, N, G.

But let's look for words that use more common letters and cover a variety.

We can also consider ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but we have N in the 4th. This tests B, L, I, D.

However, we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses P, O, I, T (all common and untested).
- It has two vowels (O and I) which we haven't checked.

But note: the word must be valid and we know the 4th letter is N, so we can use that.

Alternatively, ""MOIST"": but that doesn't have N in the 4th. We must have N in the 4th to confirm we are using the known information? Actually, we don't have to put N in the 4th again, but if we don't, we might not get information about other positions. However, since we know N is in the 4th, we can use that position to test other letters? Actually, no: the feedback for N would be a check only if it's in the 4th. If we put N in a different position, we might get a dash if it's in the word but wrong position, but we already know it's in the word and specifically in the 4th. So if we put N in a different position, we might get a dash, which would be inconsistent because we know it's only in the 4th? Actually, the word might have two N's? But we don't know that.

Therefore, it's possible that there is another N.

But to keep it simple, for the second guess, we can put N in the 4th again to confirm that it's still there and to test other letters. Alternatively, we can put N in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But that might be less efficient.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to use the known N in the 4th to test other positions. So I will choose a word that has N in the 4th position.

So, back to ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T.

This tests:
- P in position 1
- O in position 2
- I in position 3
- N in position 4 (we know it's correct, so we'll get a check for that, but that doesn't give new info, but it confirms we are on track)
- T in position 5

We might get feedback on O, I, and T, and P.

Another option: ""JOINS"" but that has J which is less common, and S at the end. But we don't have N in the 4th? ""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S, so N is in the 4th? Yes, but then the 5th is S. But we want to test more common letters.

""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but N is in the 3rd position, not 4th. So that doesn't use the known N in 4th.

We need N in the 4th.

Let me list some words ending with N? No, the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is _ _ _ N _.

So, 5-letter words with N as the 4th letter: 
- ...N. : like BUNNY, but that has two N's and we avoid A, E (so BUNNY has U and Y, but also two N's). But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But we are avoiding C, R, A, E.

So, let's think of words: 
- POINT (P,O,I,N,T)
- MOUNT (M,O,U,N,T)
- JOINT (J,O,I,N,T) - J is less common
- FOUNT (F,O,U,N,T) - F is less common
- BLIND (B,L,I,N,D) - but D is common
- FLING (F,L,I,N,G) - F less common
- SLING (S,L,I,N,G) - S and G are common
- STING (S,T,I,N,G) - S, T, I, G are common

""STING"" is a good candidate: S, T, I, N, G. It tests S, T, I, G (all new) and N (known).

Similarly, ""POINT"" tests P, O, I, T.

Which one is better? We want to test more vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so we need to test O, I, U. 

In ""STING"", we test I (a vowel) and consonants S, T, G.

So, I think ""STING"" is better because S and T are very common.

We can also consider ""BLIND"", but B and L: B is less common than S or T.

Another word: ""SWUNG"" - S, W, U, N, G -> but W is less common, and we test U.

But S and G are common.

However, I think ""STING"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""STING"" is a valid word: yes, it means a sharp pain.

So, I'll go with ""STING"".

If I get all ""x"", it eliminates many letters efficiently.\n\nThus, I\'ll start with ""CRANE"".\n</thought>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the 4th letter of the secret word is N)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The 4th letter is N.\n- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n- Therefore, the secret word has N in the 4th position and does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter English word that:\n- Has N as the 4th letter (since we know it\'s correct there, we can use that to get more information).\n- Avoids the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the word.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R), we should focus on other common letters.\n\nCommon English letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, etc.\n\nWe should try to include as many of these as possible in our next guess, while keeping N in the 4th position.\n\nPossible words that fit:\n- Must have N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _\n- Avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit this pattern and use common untested letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but we have N in the 4th, so P O I N T. This uses P, O, I, T (all new) and N (known). However, we already know N is in the word and in the 4th position, so we can use it to test other positions.\n- ""JOINT"": J is less common, so maybe not ideal.\n- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> again, N in 4th, and M, O, U, T are new.\n- ""COUNT"": But C is already eliminated (we know C is not in the word), so we cannot use C. So ""COUNT"" is invalid because of C.\n- ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"" are valid.\n\nWe also want to test vowels because we know A and E are out, so the word must have other vowels (like O, I, U, etc.). Since we have only one vowel left from the first guess (we tested A and E, but not O, I, U), we should test more vowels.\n\nBut note: the secret word might have multiple vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> but the 4th is N, so that works. However, we are missing testing a vowel? It has I.\n\nAnother idea: ""STING"": S, T, I, N, G.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that use more common letters and cover a variety.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but we have N in the 4th. This tests B, L, I, D.\n\nHowever, we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because:\n- It uses P, O, I, T (all common and untested).\n- It has two vowels (O and I) which we haven\'t checked.\n\nBut note: the word must be valid and we know the 4th letter is N, so we can use that.\n\nAlternatively, ""MOIST"": but that doesn\'t have N in the 4th. We must have N in the 4th to confirm we are using the known information? Actually, we don\'t have to put N in the 4th again, but if we don\'t, we might not get information about other positions. However, since we know N is in the 4th, we can use that position to test other letters? Actually, no: the feedback for N would be a check only if it\'s in the 4th. If we put N in a different position, we might get a dash if it\'s in the word but wrong position, but we already know it\'s in the word and specifically in the 4th. So if we put N in a different position, we might get a dash, which would be inconsistent because we know it\'s only in the 4th? Actually, the word might have two N\'s? But we don\'t know that. The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the 4th). But it could have another N? We don\'t have information about that.\n\nSo, to be safe, we should consider that the word might have two N\'s? But the feedback for ""CRANE"" only had one N marked as correct. If there were two N\'s, and one was in the 4th, but the other was not in the word or in a different position, then in the first guess, if the other N was in the word but not in the guess, it wouldn\'t show. But in ""CRANE"", we only have one N (at the 4th). So if the secret word has two N\'s, then when we guessed ""CRANE"", we only covered one N (at the 4th), so the other N in the secret word would not be in our guess and thus we wouldn\'t know about it. Therefore, it\'s possible that there is another N.\n\nBut to keep it simple, for the second guess, we can put N in the 4th again to confirm that it\'s still there and to test other letters. Alternatively, we can put N in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But that might be less efficient.\n\nGiven that we have limited guesses, it\'s better to use the known N in the 4th to test other positions. So I will choose a word that has N in the 4th position.\n\nSo, back to ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T.\n\nThis tests:\n- P in position 1\n- O in position 2\n- I in position 3\n- N in position 4 (we know it\'s correct, so we\'ll get a check for that, but that doesn\'t give new info, but it confirms we are on track)\n- T in position 5\n\nWe might get feedback on O, I, and T, and P.\n\nAnother option: ""JOINS"" but that has J which is less common, and S at the end. But we don\'t have N in the 4th? ""JOINS"" is J-O-I-N-S, so N is in the 4th? Yes, but then the 5th is S. But we want to test more common letters.\n\n""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S -> but N is in the 3rd position, not 4th. So that doesn\'t use the known N in 4th.\n\nWe need N in the 4th.\n\nLet me list some words ending with N? No, the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is _ _ _ N _.\n\nSo, 5-letter words with N as the 4th letter: \n- ...N. : like BUNNY, but that has two N\'s and we avoid A, E (so BUNNY has U and Y, but also two N\'s). But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\nBut we are avoiding C, R, A, E.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words: \n- POINT (P,O,I,N,T)\n- MOUNT (M,O,U,N,T)\n- JOINT (J,O,I,N,T) - J is less common\n- FOUNT (F,O,U,N,T) - F is less common\n- BLIND (B,L,I,N,D) - but D is common\n- FLING (F,L,I,N,G) - F less common\n- SLING (S,L,I,N,G) - S and G are common\n- STING (S,T,I,N,G) - S, T, I, G are common\n\n""STING"" is a good candidate: S, T, I, N, G. It tests S, T, I, G (all new) and N (known).\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"" tests P, O, I, T.\n\nWhich one is better? We want to test more vowels. We have eliminated A and E, so we need to test O, I, U. \n\nIn ""STING"", we test I (a vowel) and consonants S, T, G.\nIn ""POINT"", we test O and I (two vowels) and consonants P, T.\n\nSince we have two vowels to test (O and I) and we don\'t know which one might be in the word, ""POINT"" tests two vowels at once. That might be more efficient.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not have O or I? But we have to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can test a word with U? Like ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) which tests O and U (two vowels) and M, T.\n\nBut ""MOUNT"" uses O and U, which are both vowels, but we might not need to test both at once? Actually, testing multiple vowels is efficient.\n\nBut let\'s consider letter frequency in 5-letter words.\n\nCommon vowels: After A and E, the next are O, I, U.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, N (we already have N), R (but R is eliminated), so S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, L, which are very common.\n\nSo, a word that includes S, T, L and a vowel would be ideal, but with N in the 4th.\n\nFor example, ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> tests S, L, I, G. It has I (vowel) and S, L, G (consonants).\n\n""STING"": S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G.\n\n""POINT"" doesn\'t test S or L, but tests P which is less common than S or T.\n\nSo, I think ""STING"" is better because S and T are very common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLIND"", but B and L: B is less common than S or T.\n\nAnother word: ""SWUNG"" - S, W, U, N, G -> but W is less common, and we test U.\n\nBut S and G are common.\n\nHowever, I think ""STING"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""STING"" is a valid word: yes, it means a sharp pain.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""STING"".\n\nBut note: we are avoiding C, R, A, E, and ""STING"" doesn\'t have any of those.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""STING"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word has ""N"" as the 4th letter.\n2. The word contains no C, R, A, or E.\n3. We need to test new common letters to gather more information, focusing on untested vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants (like S, T, L, G, M).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must have ""N"" in the 4th position to leverage known information.\n- Should avoid C, R, A, E.\n- Prioritize high-frequency untested letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, L) to maximize feedback.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""POINT"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""MOUNT"" (tests M, O, U, T), ""STING"" was chosen because:\n- It tests S, T, I, and G—all common letters not yet tried.\n- It includes the vowel ""I"" (since A and E are eliminated, testing other vowels is crucial).\n- It fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ and avoids forbidden letters.\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking S (position 1), T (position 2), I (position 3), and G (position 5), while confirming N in position 4.\n\n<thought>\n- Feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x). So, N is in the 4th position, and C, R, A, E are absent.\n- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ N _, excluding C, R, A, E.\n- Second guess goals: Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, U, L, G) and include N in position 4.\n- ""STING"" is valid: It uses S, T, I, N, G—all untested letters. S and T are high-frequency consonants, I is a vowel (needed after eliminating A/E), and G is a common consonant.\n- Alternatives considered: ""POINT"" (tests P, O, I, T) but P is less common than S; ""MOUNT"" (tests M, O, U, T) but U is less frequent than I. ""STING"" optimizes for information gain by covering S, T, and I together.\n- If ""STING"" gets feedback, it will reveal:\n  - Whether S, T, I, or G are in the word and their positions.\n  - Further narrow the search for the next guess.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>STING</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: ✓ (in word, correct position, so 4th letter is N)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: STING
- S: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (in word, correct position, so 3rd letter is I)
- N: ✓ (in word, correct position, so 4th letter is N, which we already knew)
- G: x (not in word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the 3rd letter I and 4th letter N. So the pattern is: _ _ I N _
2. The word contains T, but not in the 2nd position (since in STING, T was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not there).
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, G.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N in the 4th and it was correct, and in the second guess, we have I in the 3rd and N in the 4th, both correct.

Now, the word is _ _ I N _

We know T is in the word but not in position 2. Since the word has positions 1,2,5 open, T must be in position 1 or 5.

But we also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, G.

We need to think of words that fit: _ _ I N _ and include T (in position 1 or 5) and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for position 1: any letter except C,R,A,E,S,G and also not T if we think it might be in position 5? But we don't know yet. Actually, T could be in 1 or 5.

But we have to consider that the word might have other letters.

We also haven't tested many vowels. We know A and E are out, and I is in. The remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I, G. So we haven't tested: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

The word must have T in it, so either position 1 or 5.

Let's list possible words:

If T is in position 1: T _ I N _
Then the word is T? I N? and the second and fifth letters are unknown, but must not be forbidden letters.

Possible words: 
- THINK: T H I N K -> but H and K are not tested. Also, K is allowed.
- But we have to check if H and K are allowed? They are not forbidden yet.

But THINK: positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). This seems possible.

If T is in position 5: _ _ I N T
Then the word is ? ? I N T.

Possible words: 
- POINT: P O I N T -> but O is not forbidden, but we have to check if P and O are allowed? They are not in the forbidden list.
- However, in the first guess, we didn't test P or O, so they could be in the word.

But we have feedback that T is in the word but not in position 2. In POINT, T is in position 5, which is fine.

But we also have other possibilities: JOINT, MOINT (not a word), FAINT (but A is forbidden), etc.

But FAINT has A, which is forbidden.

So, let's list possible words that fit the pattern and include T and avoid forbidden letters.

Pattern: _ _ I N _

With T in the word (position 1 or 5) and letters not in {C,R,A,E,S,G}.

Also, the second letter cannot be T because if it were, then in STING, T was in position 2 and we got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So T is not in position 2, which we already know.

Now, common words:

- If T in position 1: T? I N? 
  - THINK: T H I N K -> H and K are new.
  - THING: T H I N G -> but G is forbidden (from STING feedback, G is x, so not in word). So THING is invalid because of G.
  - TWIN? But that's 4 letters? 5-letter: TWINS? But that ends with S, which is forbidden. S is not allowed.
  - TRAIN? But R and A are forbidden.
  - So THINK is a candidate.

- If T in position 5: ? ? I N T
  - POINT: P O I N T -> P and O are new.
  - JOINT: J O I N T -> J is less common.
  - MOINT: not a word.
  - FAINT: F A I N T -> A is forbidden.
  - PAINT: P A I N T -> A forbidden.
  - OINT? Not 5 letters. OINTS? Not a word.
  - MINTS: M I N T S -> but S is forbidden and also the pattern is _ _ I N _, so the 3rd must be I, but in MINTS it's I in 2nd? MINTS: M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> doesn't match our pattern of 3rd=I and 4th=N. So no.
  - Similarly, HINTS: H I N T S -> same issue, I in 2nd, not 3rd.

So the only common words seem to be THINK (with T in 1st) and POINT (with T in 5th).

But we also have other possibilities, like using U: QUINT? Q U I N T -> but Q is less common, and U is new.

But let's see: QUINT: Q U I N T -> pattern: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). This fits the pattern.

Similarly, FLINT: F L I N T -> F and L are new, but pattern: F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). This also fits.

But in FLINT, we have F and L.

We also have BLINT? Not a word.

So possible words: THINK, POINT, QUINT, FLINT.

But we need to test which one it is.

We have 4 possibilities? But we have more guesses.

But we can design a guess that helps distinguish.

We know T is in the word, and it's either in position 1 or 5.

In our next guess, we can try to confirm the position of T.

But we also need to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes letters from these possibilities.

For example, if we guess THINK, we test T in position 1, H in 2, K in 5.

If we guess POINT, we test P in 1, O in 2, T in 5.

But we don't know which one.

We can guess a word that has T in position 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,E,S,G.

We also know the 3rd and 4th letters are I and N, so we can fix those.

So, for the next guess, we can use the known I and N in positions 3 and 4, and try different letters in 1,2,5.

We want to test multiple possibilities at once.

For example, we can test a word that has T in position 5, and in position 1 and 2, we put common letters that appear in the candidate words.

Candidate words:
- THINK: T, H, I, N, K
- POINT: P, O, I, N, T
- FLINT: F, L, I, N, T
- QUINT: Q, U, I, N, T

Common letters in these: H, K, P, O, F, L, Q, U.

But we can test, for example, O and H in one guess? But we have to put them in positions that might be correct.

We know position 1 and 2 are unknown, and position 5 is unknown.

We can guess a word like ""POINT"" to test P and O and T in 5.

But if we guess POINT and it's not the word, we get feedback on P, O, T.

Similarly, if we guess THINK, we test T in 1, H, K.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but helps eliminate multiple options.

For example, we can guess a word that has H, O, and K? But we need to fit the pattern _ _ I N _.

But we know positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N, so we must have I in 3 and N in 4.

So the guess must be ? ? I N ?

We can choose the first, second, and fifth letters to be letters that are in the candidate words.

For example, we can guess ""OH INK"" but that's not a word. We need a real word.

""CHINK"" but C is forbidden.

""THINK"" is one candidate.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> B and L are new, and K. This is a valid word. But it doesn't have T? But we know T must be in the word, so if we guess BLINK, and T is not in it, then if the secret word has T, we would get a dash for T if it were present but not in the guess? But we are guessing BLINK, which has no T, so if the secret word has T, we would get a dash for T? But we don't have T in the guess, so we wouldn't get feedback about T? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. So if we guess BLINK, we get feedback on B, L, I, N, K. But we already know I and N are correct, so we get feedback on B, L, K.

But we know T is in the word, so if we guess a word without T, we don't get new info about T, but we might confirm if B, L, K are present.

But that might not be efficient.

We can guess a word that includes T and also other letters.

But we know T is in the word, so we can put T in a position we think it might be.

For example, if we think T is in position 5, we can guess a word with T in 5, and in positions 1 and 2, we put common letters.

Similarly for position 1.

But we don't know.

Another idea: since T is in the word and not in position 2, and we have positions 1 and 5 open, we can test T in position 5 to see if it's there.

So, let's guess a word with T in position 5: ? ? I N T

And we choose letters for 1 and 2 that are common and in the candidate words.

For example, in POINT, we have O in position 2; in FLINT, L in 2; in QUINT, U in 2.

We can choose a word that has, say, O in position 2? But we need to choose position 1 as well.

We can guess ""POINT"" directly. If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and O.

Similarly, we can guess ""FLINT"" to test F and L.

But to be more efficient, we can guess a word that tests letters that are in multiple candidates.

For example, if we guess ""POINT"", and it's not the word, but we find that O is in the word (if we get a dash for O), then that might support THINK? Not necessarily.

Let's think about the feedback.

If we guess ""POINT"":
- If the word is POINT, we get all correct.
- If the word is THINK, then:
  - P: not in word (x)
  - O: not in word (x) because THINK has H, I, N, K, no O.
  - I: correct (✓)
  - N: correct (✓)
  - T: in word but not in position 5? In THINK, T is in position 1, so T in position 5 would be wrong position? But the secret word THINK has T in position 1, so when we put T in position 5, it should get a dash (since T is in the word but not in position 5). But in the feedback, we would get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-) because T is in the word but not at position 5.

Similarly, if the word is FLINT, and we guess POINT:
- P: not in FLINT (x)
- O: not in FLINT (x)
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- T: in word, but in FLINT, T is in position 5, so if we put T in position 5, it would be correct? But in POINT, T is in position 5, and in FLINT, T is also in position 5, so if the word is FLINT, and we guess POINT, then T would be in the correct position? But the letters are different.

FLINT: F L I N T
POINT: P O I N T

So for POINT guess on FLINT secret:
- P: not in FLINT (x)
- O: not in FLINT (x)
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- T: ✓ (because T is in position 5 in both)

But the word is FLINT, so T is in position 5, so it would be correct.

Similarly, for QUINT: Q U I N T
Guess POINT: 
- P: x
- O: x
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- T: ✓

So in all cases, I and N are correct, and T is either dash or correct.

But we don't get much information about the other letters.

If we guess POINT and get:
- If all but P and O are correct, then it's POINT.
- If P and O are x, and T is dash, then it might be THINK or FLINT or QUINT, but with T not in 5? But in THINK, T is in 1, so T in 5 would be dash. In FLINT and QUINT, T is in 5, so it would be correct.

But we need to distinguish.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has T in position 1 to test that.

But let's consider guessing ""THINK"" instead.

If we guess THINK:
- If the word is THINK, we win.
- If the word is POINT, then:
  - T: in word but not position 1 (dash) because POINT has T at 5.
  - H: not in POINT (x)
  - I: ✓
  - N: ✓
  - K: not in POINT (x)
  So feedback: T(-), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)

Similarly, if the word is FLINT, guess THINK:
- T: in word but not position 1 (dash) because FLINT has T at 5.
- H: not in FLINT (x)
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- K: not in FLINT (x)
Same as above.

If the word is QUINT, same thing.

So we get similar feedback.

But we can design a guess that includes letters from multiple candidates.

For example, guess ""POINT"" to test P and O.

Or guess ""FLINT"" to test F and L.

But we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3, so we have 4 more? No, we have 6 guesses total, we used 2, so 4 left.

But we can be efficient.

Another idea: guess a word that has K and P, for example, but we need a valid word.

""PINKY"" but Y is not common, and positions: P I N K Y, but we need I in 3rd and N in 4th, so PINKY has I in 2nd and N in 3rd, not matching.

We must have the pattern _ _ I N _

So let's list all possible words that fit:
- With T in 1: THINK, THINS (but S is forbidden), THINE (E forbidden), so only THINK really.
- With T in 5: POINT, JOINT, FLINT, QUINT, also BLINT? Not a word, or DAINT? Not common, or HAINT? Not common. Also, OINT? Not 5 letters.

Also, without T? But we know T is in the word, so must have T.

From feedback, T is in the word.

So candidates: THINK, POINT, FLINT, QUINT, and perhaps others like DWINE? Not a word.

So let's focus on THINK, POINT, FLINT, QUINT.

We can guess a word that tests H, O, F, L, etc.

For example, we can guess ""HOUND"" but that doesn't have I and N fixed.

We must keep I and N in positions 3 and 4.

So the guess must be ? ? I N ?

We can guess ""CHAIN"" but C and A forbidden.

""BLIND"" but G forbidden? No, G is forbidden, but BLIND has B,L,I,N,D. D is not forbidden. But we know T is in the word, and BLIND has no T, so if we guess BLIND, and the secret word has T, we would not have T in the guess, so we get no feedback on T, but we know T is in the word, so it would be a waste.

So better to include T in the guess.

So let's put T in position 5, for example, and choose letters for 1 and 2 that are common.

For instance, guess ""POINT"" to test P and O.

If we get P and O both x, then it's not POINT, and O and P are not in the word, which eliminates POINT and also tells us that the word does not have P or O.

Then the candidates left are THINK, FLINT, QUINT.

Then we can guess ""QUINT"" next to test Q and U.

But QUINT has Q and U, which are less common.

If we guess ""POINT"" and get P x and O -, for example, then O is in the word but not in position 2, which might support other words.

But let's be systematic.

Since we have to make a guess, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it's a common word and tests two new vowels O and I? But we already know I is in the word.

We know I is in position 3, so in ""POINT"", I is in position 3, which is correct, so we don't get new info about I.

But we test P and O.

Alternatively, we can guess ""MOUTH"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

I think we should guess ""POINT"".

But let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess ""POINT"":
- If the secret is POINT, we win.
- If the secret is THINK, we get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)  [since T is in word but not at 5]
- If the secret is FLINT, we get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(✓)  [because T is at 5 in both]
- If the secret is QUINT, we get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(✓)  [T at 5]

So if we get T(✓), then it's either FLINT or QUINT or POINT (but POINT would have all correct).

If we get T(-), then it's THINK.

And if we get T(✓) and P and O are x, then it's FLINT or QUINT.

Then we can guess ""FLINT"" next to distinguish.

But we have enough guesses.

We can also guess a word that tests F and Q, but that's harder.

So let's go with ""POINT"" for the third guess.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another candidate is ""JOINT"", but J is less common.

Or ""HYMN"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""POINT"" is fine.

But in the feedback from STING, we have T with dash, meaning T is in the word but not in position 2. In POINT, we are putting T in position 5, which is fine.

So I'll guess ""POINT"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the word.  
- **Guess 2: STING** → S(x), T(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(x)  
  - I is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.  
  - T is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
  - S and G are **not** in the word.  
  - N (position 4) is confirmed correct again.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I N _` (positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N).  
2. **Confirmed letters in word**:  
   - I (position 3), N (position 4), and T (somewhere, but not position 2).  
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, E, S, G (not in the word at all).  
4. **T's position**: Must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 2, and positions 3–4 are filled).  
5. **Possible words**: Based on the pattern and constraints, common candidates include:  
   - `THINK` (T in position 1), `POINT` (T in position 5), `FLINT` (T in position 5), or `QUINT` (T in position 5).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test the position of T (1 vs. 5) and probe new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, H, K) to distinguish between candidates.  
- **Why guess ""POINT""?**  
  - It tests T in position 5 (if T is here, it confirms/refutes half the possibilities).  
  - It introduces P (position 1) and O (position 2)—common untested letters.  
  - If ""POINT"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on P and O will narrow the list:  
    - If P or O is present (✓ or -), it supports `POINT` or similar.  
    - If both are absent (x), it favors `THINK` or `FLINT`/`QUINT` (requiring a follow-up guess).  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ I N _` and avoids eliminated letters.  

<thought>
- Pattern: _ _ I N _  
- T must be in position 1 or 5.

  - O (new vowel) in position 2.  
  - I (✓, position 3) and N (✓, position 4) for confirmation.  
  - T in position 5 (to check if T is here).  
- Feedback will reveal:  
  - If T is in position 5 (✓), candidates like `FLINT`/`QUINT`/`POINT` survive.  
  - If T is not in position 5 (-), `THINK` is likely (T in position 1).  
  - P/O feedback will eliminate letters or hint at other words.

<guess>POINT</guess>",POINT,"We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: ✓ (in word, correct position, so 4th letter is N)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: STING
- S: x (not in word)
- T: - (in word, but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (in word, correct position, so 3rd letter is I)
- N: ✓ (in word, correct position, so 4th letter is N, which we already knew)
- G: x (not in word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the 3rd letter I and 4th letter N. So the pattern is: _ _ I N _
2. The word contains T, but not in the 2nd position (since in STING, T was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not there).
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, G.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N in the 4th and it was correct, and in the second guess, we have I in the 3rd and N in the 4th, both correct.

Now, the word is _ _ I N _

We know T is in the word but not in position 2. Since the word has positions 1,2,5 open, T must be in position 1 or 5.

But we also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, G.

We need to think of words that fit: _ _ I N _ and include T (in position 1 or 5) and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible letters for position 1: any letter except C,R,A,E,S,G and also not T if we think it might be in position 5? But we don't know yet. Actually, T could be in 1 or 5.

But we have to consider that the word might have other letters.

We also haven't tested many vowels. We know A and E are out, and I is in. The remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I, G. So we haven't tested: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

The word must have T in it, so either position 1 or 5.

Let's list possible words:

If T is in position 1: T _ I N _
Then the word is T? I N? and the second and fifth letters are unknown, but must not be forbidden letters.

Possible words: 
- THINK: T H I N K -> but H and K are not tested. Also, K is allowed.
- But we have to check if H and K are allowed? They are not forbidden yet.

But THINK: positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). This seems possible.

If T is in position 5: _ _ I N T
Then the word is ? ? I N T.

Possible words: 
- POINT: P O I N T -> but O is not forbidden, but we have to check if P and O are allowed? They are not in the forbidden list.
- However, in the first guess, we didn't test P or O, so they could be in the word.

But we have feedback that T is in the word but not in position 2. In POINT, T is in position 5, which is fine.

But we also have other possibilities: JOINT, MOINT (not a word), FAINT (but A is forbidden), etc.

But FAINT has A, which is forbidden.

So, let's list possible words that fit the pattern and include T and avoid forbidden letters.

Pattern: _ _ I N _

With T in the word (position 1 or 5) and letters not in {C,R,A,E,S,G}.

Also, the second letter cannot be T because if it were, then in STING, T was in position 2 and we got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So T is not in position 2, which we already know.

Now, common words:

- If T in position 1: T? I N? 
  - THINK: T H I N K -> H and K are new.
  - THING: T H I N G -> but G is forbidden (from STING feedback, G is x, so not in word). So THING is invalid because of G.
  - TWIN? But that's 4 letters? 5-letter: TWINS? But that ends with S, which is forbidden. S is not allowed.
  - TRAIN? But R and A are forbidden.
  - So THINK is a candidate.

- If T in position 5: ? ? I N T
  - POINT: P O I N T -> P and O are new.
  - JOINT: J O I N T -> J is less common.
  - MOINT: not a word.
  - FAINT: F A I N T -> A is forbidden.
  - PAINT: P A I N T -> A forbidden.
  - OINT? Not 5 letters. OINTS? Not a word.
  - MINTS: M I N T S -> but S is forbidden and also the pattern is _ _ I N _, so the 3rd must be I, but in MINTS it's I in 2nd? MINTS: M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> doesn't match our pattern of 3rd=I and 4th=N. So no.
  - Similarly, HINTS: H I N T S -> same issue, I in 2nd, not 3rd.

So the only common words seem to be THINK (with T in 1st) and POINT (with T in 5th).

But we also have other possibilities, like using U: QUINT? Q U I N T -> but Q is less common, and U is new.

But let's see: QUINT: Q U I N T -> pattern: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). This fits the pattern.

Similarly, FLINT: F L I N T -> F and L are new, but pattern: F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). This also fits.

But in FLINT, we have F and L.

We also have BLINT? Not a word.

So possible words: THINK, POINT, QUINT, FLINT.

But we need to test which one it is.

We have 4 possibilities? But we have more guesses.

But we can design a guess that helps distinguish.

We know T is in the word, and it's either in position 1 or 5.

In our next guess, we can try to confirm the position of T.

But we also need to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes letters from these possibilities.

For example, if we guess THINK, we test T in position 1, H in 2, K in 5.

If we guess POINT, we test P in 1, O in 2, T in 5.

But we don't know which one.

We can guess a word that has T in position 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,E,S,G.

We also know the 3rd and 4th letters are I and N, so we can fix those.

So, for the next guess, we can use the known I and N in positions 3 and 4, and try different letters in 1,2,5.

We want to test multiple possibilities at once.

For example, we can test a word that has T in position 5, and in position 1 and 2, we put common letters that appear in the candidate words.

Candidate words:
- THINK: T, H, I, N, K
- POINT: P, O, I, N, T
- FLINT: F, L, I, N, T
- QUINT: Q, U, I, N, T

Common letters in these: H, K, P, O, F, L, Q, U.

But we can test, for example, O and H in one guess? But we have to put them in positions that might be correct.

We know position 1 and 2 are unknown, and position 5 is unknown.

We can guess a word like ""POINT"" to test P and O and T in 5.

But if we guess POINT and it's not the word, we get feedback on P, O, T.

Similarly, if we guess THINK, we test T in 1, H, K.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but helps eliminate multiple options.

For example, we can guess a word that has H, O, and K? But we need to fit the pattern _ _ I N _.

But we know positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N, so we must have I in 3 and N in 4.

So the guess must be ? ? I N ?

We can choose the first, second, and fifth letters to be letters that are in the candidate words.

For example, we can guess ""OH INK"" but that's not a word. We need a real word.

""CHINK"" but C is forbidden.

""THINK"" is one candidate.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> B and L are new, and K. This is a valid word. But it doesn't have T? But we know T must be in the word, so if we guess BLINK, and T is not in it, then if the secret word has T, we would get a dash for T if it were present but not in the guess? But we are guessing BLINK, which has no T, so if the secret word has T, we would get a dash for T? But we don't have T in the guess, so we wouldn't get feedback about T? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. So if we guess BLINK, we get feedback on B, L, I, N, K. But we already know I and N are correct, so we get feedback on B, L, K.

But we know T is in the word, so if we guess a word without T, we don't get new info about T, but we might confirm if B, L, K are present.

But that might not be efficient.

We can guess a word that includes T and also other letters.

But we know T is in the word, so we can put T in a position we think it might be.

For example, if we think T is in position 5, we can guess a word with T in 5, and in positions 1 and 2, we put common letters.

Similarly for position 1.

But we don't know.

Another idea: since T is in the word and not in position 2, and we have positions 1 and 5 open, we can test T in position 5 to see if it's there.

So, let's guess a word with T in position 5: ? ? I N T

And we choose letters for 1 and 2 that are common and in the candidate words.

For example, in POINT, we have O in position 2; in FLINT, L in 2; in QUINT, U in 2.

We can choose a word that has, say, O in position 2? But we need to choose position 1 as well.

We can guess ""POINT"" directly. If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and O.

Similarly, we can guess ""FLINT"" to test F and L.

But to be more efficient, we can guess a word that tests letters that are in multiple candidates.

For example, if we guess ""POINT"", and it's not the word, but we find that O is in the word (if we get a dash for O), then that might support THINK? Not necessarily.

Let's think about the feedback.

If we guess ""POINT"":
- If the word is POINT, we get all correct.
- If the word is THINK, then:
  - P: not in word (x)
  - O: not in word (x) because THINK has H, I, N, K, no O.
  - I: correct (✓)
  - N: correct (✓)
  - T: in word but not in position 5? In THINK, T is in position 1, so T in position 5 would be wrong position? But the secret word THINK has T in position 1, so when we put T in position 5, it should get a dash (since T is in the word but not in position 5). But in the feedback, we would get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-) because T is in the word but not at position 5.

Similarly, if the word is FLINT, and we guess POINT:
- P: not in FLINT (x)
- O: not in FLINT (x)
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- T: in word, but in FLINT, T is in position 5, so if we put T in position 5, it would be correct? But in POINT, T is in position 5, and in FLINT, T is also in position 5, so if the word is FLINT, and we guess POINT, then T would be in the correct position? But the letters are different.

FLINT: F L I N T
POINT: P O I N T

So for POINT guess on FLINT secret:
- P: not in FLINT (x)
- O: not in FLINT (x)
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- T: ✓ (because T is in position 5 in both)

But the word is FLINT, so T is in position 5, so it would be correct.

Similarly, for QUINT: Q U I N T
Guess POINT: 
- P: x
- O: x
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- T: ✓

So in all cases, I and N are correct, and T is either dash or correct.

But we don't get much information about the other letters.

If we guess POINT and get:
- If all but P and O are correct, then it's POINT.
- If P and O are x, and T is dash, then it might be THINK or FLINT or QUINT, but with T not in 5? But in THINK, T is in 1, so T in 5 would be dash. In FLINT and QUINT, T is in 5, so it would be correct.

But we need to distinguish.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has T in position 1 to test that.

But let's consider guessing ""THINK"" instead.

If we guess THINK:
- If the word is THINK, we win.
- If the word is POINT, then:
  - T: in word but not position 1 (dash) because POINT has T at 5.
  - H: not in POINT (x)
  - I: ✓
  - N: ✓
  - K: not in POINT (x)
  So feedback: T(-), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)

Similarly, if the word is FLINT, guess THINK:
- T: in word but not position 1 (dash) because FLINT has T at 5.
- H: not in FLINT (x)
- I: ✓
- N: ✓
- K: not in FLINT (x)
Same as above.

If the word is QUINT, same thing.

So we get similar feedback.

But we can design a guess that includes letters from multiple candidates.

For example, guess ""POINT"" to test P and O.

Or guess ""FLINT"" to test F and L.

But we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3, so we have 4 more? No, we have 6 guesses total, we used 2, so 4 left.

But we can be efficient.

Another idea: guess a word that has K and P, for example, but we need a valid word.

""PINKY"" but Y is not common, and positions: P I N K Y, but we need I in 3rd and N in 4th, so PINKY has I in 2nd and N in 3rd, not matching.

We must have the pattern _ _ I N _

So let's list all possible words that fit:
- With T in 1: THINK, THINS (but S is forbidden), THINE (E forbidden), so only THINK really.
- With T in 5: POINT, JOINT, FLINT, QUINT, also BLINT? Not a word, or DAINT? Not common, or HAINT? Not common. Also, OINT? Not 5 letters.

Also, without T? But we know T is in the word, so must have T.

From feedback, T is in the word.

So candidates: THINK, POINT, FLINT, QUINT, and perhaps others like DWINE? Not a word.

So let's focus on THINK, POINT, FLINT, QUINT.

We can guess a word that tests H, O, F, L, etc.

For example, we can guess ""HOUND"" but that doesn't have I and N fixed.

We must keep I and N in positions 3 and 4.

So the guess must be ? ? I N ?

We can guess ""CHAIN"" but C and A forbidden.

""BLIND"" but G forbidden? No, G is forbidden, but BLIND has B,L,I,N,D. D is not forbidden. But we know T is in the word, and BLIND has no T, so if we guess BLIND, and the secret word has T, we would not have T in the guess, so we get no feedback on T, but we know T is in the word, so it would be a waste.

So better to include T in the guess.

So let's put T in position 5, for example, and choose letters for 1 and 2 that are common.

For instance, guess ""POINT"" to test P and O.

If we get P and O both x, then it's not POINT, and O and P are not in the word, which eliminates POINT and also tells us that the word does not have P or O.

Then the candidates left are THINK, FLINT, QUINT.

Then we can guess ""QUINT"" next to test Q and U.

But QUINT has Q and U, which are less common.

If we guess ""POINT"" and get P x and O -, for example, then O is in the word but not in position 2, which might support other words.

But let's be systematic.

Since we have to make a guess, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it's a common word and tests two new vowels O and I? But we already know I is in the word.

We know I is in position 3, so in ""POINT"", I is in position 3, which is correct, so we don't get new info about I.

But we test P and O.

Alternatively, we can guess ""MOUTH"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

I think we should guess ""POINT"".

But let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess ""POINT"":
- If the secret is POINT, we win.
- If the secret is THINK, we get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)  [since T is in word but not at 5]
- If the secret is FLINT, we get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(✓)  [because T is at 5 in both]
- If the secret is QUINT, we get: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(✓)  [T at 5]

So if we get T(✓), then it's either FLINT or QUINT or POINT (but POINT would have all correct).

If we get T(-), then it's THINK.

And if we get T(✓) and P and O are x, then it's FLINT or QUINT.

Then we can guess ""FLINT"" next to distinguish.

But we have enough guesses.

We can also guess a word that tests F and Q, but that's harder.

So let's go with ""POINT"" for the third guess.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another candidate is ""JOINT"", but J is less common.

Or ""HYMN"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""POINT"" is fine.

But in the feedback from STING, we have T with dash, meaning T is in the word but not in position 2. In POINT, we are putting T in position 5, which is fine.

So I'll guess ""POINT"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
