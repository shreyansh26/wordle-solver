We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in word

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)
 Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> x

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters: R and A (at least one occurrence each)
- Does not have: C, N, E (since marked x)

We also know the word does not have C, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Is 5 letters, English word.
- Does not contain C, N, E (to avoid wasted letters).
- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, R cannot be at position 1, and A cannot be at position 2. But they could be anywhere else.

We also want to try to place other common consonants to get more information.

Let me think about possible words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Common letters to try: we might include other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, etc.).

One idea: start with words that have R and A in different positions.

Possible word: ""ROAST"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, we must avoid E? Actually, we know E is not in the word, so we should avoid E. ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T, and R. But let's check:
- R: we have R, but we must not put R at position 1? Actually in ""ROAST"", R is at position 0. That might be okay because in the first guess R was at position 1 so it could be at 0. Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.

Wait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: 
R O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. 
But we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

So we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.

Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.

Possible words:
- Try ""PARTY"": 
  P A R T Y
  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it's at 1 so different.
  R is at index 2 -> we don't know yet if that's allowed? Previously it was at index 1 and was wrong. So we have R at a new position.

But what about the R? Previously, R was in the word but not at index 1. So R can be at index 2? Yes, because we don't know where it is exactly.

So ""PARTY"": 
- R at index 2: which is new (was 1 before) -> okay.
- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.

However, note that we have two new letters: P, T, Y. We don't know about them.

Another possibility: ""RADAR"" -> but has R at index 0 and index 3? But R is present, and A is at index 1 and index 3? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We don't have information that the word has duplicates. Sometimes words have repeated letters, but we have to consider that. However, starting with a word without duplicates might be better.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. So ideally we choose a word without repeated letters to maximize information.

""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.

Similarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.

In ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.

So let's try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.

Some options:

- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong? Actually, the feedback only tells us about that particular guess. But we already know R cannot be at index1 because we had it there and it wasn't correct. So we should avoid putting R at index1 again because we know it's wrong. Similarly for A at index2.

So ""ARRAY"": has A at index0 (new) and index2 (but we avoid index2 for A). Also, R at index1 (bad) and index3. Also duplicate R and duplicate A? So that might be messy.

Better avoid duplicates until we know more.

Another word: ""PARTY"" as before: P at0, A at1, R at2, T at3, Y at4.

A is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.
R is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.

Similarly, ""RASP?"" Wait, ""RASP"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: 
P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)

But A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.

""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.

I think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.

But let me note: we also have the letter S that we haven't tested. In ""PARTS"", we have P, A, R, T, S. Similarly, ""PARTY"" has Y.

We also haven't tried any vowels? We have A (which is a vowel) but we need to check other vowels because the word might have one of I, O, U.

So maybe a word like ""RADIO""? But ""RADIO"": 
R A D I O
- R at index0: new (so okay, since we had R at index1 before)
- But A at index1: that's a new position? And previously we had A at index2? So index1 is a new position -> okay.
However, we have D, I, O that are new.

But note: we don't have feedback about these positions. Also, ""RADIO"" has R at index0: that might be a valid position? But we don't know if it will be correct.

Another word: ""ORBIT"" -> O R B I T.
A is missing? But we know the word has A because of the first guess. So we must include A? Otherwise we are missing a required letter.

We know the word must contain R and A. So we have to include both.

So words without A are invalid? Yes, we must include R and A.

Therefore, we need a word that includes R and A (and avoids C, N, E).

Let me consider words starting with A? For example, ""ADAPT"" -> but has D, P, T? 
A at index0 -> okay (not index2)
D, P, T are new.

But R? Where is R? Not present in ""ADAPT"". So not containing R -> invalid.

Similarly, must have R.

Let me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that's a new position.

So ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: 
- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay
- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don't know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.

But in the feedback we don't have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.

But note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That's all.

So R at0: okay. A at1: we don't have information that it's wrong? So we can try.

""RAILS"": 
R(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)

But A at index1: we don't know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.

However, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).

In ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.

Also, the word has I, L, S which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.

Same as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.

To cover more common letters, perhaps ""TRAIN"" or ""TRAIT"" (but duplicates?).

""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> but we have A at index2? Not allowed because we cannot put A at index2. So invalid.

We need to avoid index2 for A.

What about ""TARES""? T A R E S -> but E is disallowed! Because we got E marked as x in first guess? So we must avoid E.

So ""TARES"" is invalid.

Similarly, words with C, N, E are invalid.

So ""PARTY"" seems good.

Alternative: ""CARES"" -> has C and E? we know C and E are not in the word -> invalid.

Another alternative: ""MOIST"" -> but no R and A? invalid.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> unique letters, P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4). And avoids index2 for A and index1 for R? R at index2: which we haven't tried? And A at index1: which is not index2 -> okay.

Similarly, ""PARTS"" is as good as ""PARTY"". But ""PARTY"" is a word.

I think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".

Summary for guess2: ""PARTY""

We hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.

So, my guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- Letters C, N, E are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (marked -).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A to probe their correct positions (avoiding positions where they are invalid: R cannot be at index 1, A cannot be at index 2).
- Must exclude C, N, E.
- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids duplicate letters for maximum information gain.

The word ""party"":
- Places R at index 2 (new position from R's previous index 1).
- Places A at index 1 (new position from A's previous index 2).
- Introduces P, T, Y (new letters to test).
- No repeated letters.

<guess>party</guess>",party,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in word

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)
 Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)

 Position 4: E -> x

Therefore, the secret word has:

Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.

Wait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: 
R O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. 
But we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

So we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.

Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.

Possible words:
- Try ""PARTY"": 
  P A R T Y
  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it's at 1 so different.

- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.

""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.

Similarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.

In ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.

So let's try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.

Some options:

- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong?

A is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.
R is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: 
P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)

But A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.

""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.

I think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.

Similarly, must have R.

Let me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that's a new position.

So ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: 
- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay
- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don't know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.

But in the feedback we don't have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.

But note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That's all.

So R at0: okay. A at1: we don't have information that it's wrong? So we can try.

""RAILS"": 
R(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)

But A at index1: we don't know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.

However, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).

In ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.

Also, the word has I, L, S which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.

Same as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.

I think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".

Summary for guess2: ""PARTY""

We hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.

So, my guess is ""party"".

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,HARRY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in word

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)
 Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> x

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters: R and A (at least one occurrence each)
- Does not have: C, N, E (since marked x)

We also know the word does not have C, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Is 5 letters, English word.
- Does not contain C, N, E (to avoid wasted letters).
- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, R cannot be at position 1, and A cannot be at position 2. But they could be anywhere else.

We also want to try to place other common consonants to get more information.

Let me think about possible words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Common letters to try: we might include other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, etc.).

One idea: start with words that have R and A in different positions.

Possible word: ""ROAST"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, we must avoid E? Actually, we know E is not in the word, so we should avoid E. ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T, and R. But let's check:
- R: we have R, but we must not put R at position 1? Actually in ""ROAST"", R is at position 0. That might be okay because in the first guess R was at position 1 so it could be at 0. Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.

Wait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: 
R O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. 
But we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

So we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.

Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.

Possible words:
- Try ""PARTY"": 
  P A R T Y
  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it's at 1 so different.
  R is at index 2 -> we don't know yet if that's allowed? Previously it was at index 1 and was wrong. So we have R at a new position.

But what about the R? Previously, R was in the word but not at index 1. So R can be at index 2? Yes, because we don't know where it is exactly.

So ""PARTY"": 
- R at index 2: which is new (was 1 before) -> okay.
- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.

However, note that we have two new letters: P, T, Y. We don't know about them.

Another possibility: ""RADAR"" -> but has R at index 0 and index 3? But R is present, and A is at index 1 and index 3? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We don't have information that the word has duplicates. Sometimes words have repeated letters, but we have to consider that. However, starting with a word without duplicates might be better.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. So ideally we choose a word without repeated letters to maximize information.

""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.

Similarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.

In ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.

So let's try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.

Some options:

- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong? Actually, the feedback only tells us about that particular guess. But we already know R cannot be at index1 because we had it there and it wasn't correct. So we should avoid putting R at index1 again because we know it's wrong. Similarly for A at index2.

So ""ARRAY"": has A at index0 (new) and index2 (but we avoid index2 for A). Also, R at index1 (bad) and index3. Also duplicate R and duplicate A? So that might be messy.

Better avoid duplicates until we know more.

Another word: ""PARTY"" as before: P at0, A at1, R at2, T at3, Y at4.

A is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.
R is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.

Similarly, ""RASP?"" Wait, ""RASP"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: 
P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)

But A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.

""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.

I think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.

But let me note: we also have the letter S that we haven't tested. In ""PARTS"", we have P, A, R, T, S. Similarly, ""PARTY"" has Y.

We also haven't tried any vowels? We have A (which is a vowel) but we need to check other vowels because the word might have one of I, O, U.

So maybe a word like ""RADIO""? But ""RADIO"": 
R A D I O
- R at index0: new (so okay, since we had R at index1 before)
- But A at index1: that's a new position? And previously we had A at index2? So index1 is a new position -> okay.
However, we have D, I, O that are new.

But note: we don't have feedback about these positions. Also, ""RADIO"" has R at index0: that might be a valid position? But we don't know if it will be correct.

Another word: ""ORBIT"" -> O R B I T.
A is missing? But we know the word has A because of the first guess. So we must include A? Otherwise we are missing a required letter.

We know the word must contain R and A. So we have to include both.

So words without A are invalid? Yes, we must include R and A.

Therefore, we need a word that includes R and A (and avoids C, N, E).

Let me consider words starting with A? For example, ""ADAPT"" -> but has D, P, T? 
A at index0 -> okay (not index2)
D, P, T are new.

But R? Where is R? Not present in ""ADAPT"". So not containing R -> invalid.

Similarly, must have R.

Let me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that's a new position.

So ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: 
- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay
- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don't know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.

But in the feedback we don't have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.

But note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That's all.

So R at0: okay. A at1: we don't have information that it's wrong? So we can try.

""RAILS"": 
R(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)

But A at index1: we don't know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.

However, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).

In ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.

Also, the word has I, L, S which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.

Same as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.

To cover more common letters, perhaps ""TRAIN"" or ""TRAIT"" (but duplicates?).

""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> but we have A at index2? Not allowed because we cannot put A at index2. So invalid.

We need to avoid index2 for A.

What about ""TARES""? T A R E S -> but E is disallowed! Because we got E marked as x in first guess? So we must avoid E.

So ""TARES"" is invalid.

Similarly, words with C, N, E are invalid.

So ""PARTY"" seems good.

Alternative: ""CARES"" -> has C and E? we know C and E are not in the word -> invalid.

Another alternative: ""MOIST"" -> but no R and A? invalid.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> unique letters, P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4). And avoids index2 for A and index1 for R? R at index2: which we haven't tried? And A at index1: which is not index2 -> okay.

Similarly, ""PARTS"" is as good as ""PARTY"". But ""PARTY"" is a word.

I think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".

Summary for guess2: ""PARTY""

We hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.

So, my guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- Letters C, N, E are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (marked -).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A to probe their correct positions (avoiding positions where they are invalid: R cannot be at index 1, A cannot be at index 2).
- Must exclude C, N, E.
- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids duplicate letters for maximum information gain.

The word ""party"":
- Places R at index 2 (new position from R's previous index 1).
- Places A at index 1 (new position from A's previous index 2).
- Introduces P, T, Y (new letters to test).
- No repeated letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct, at position 4)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, and Y.
   - A is at position 1 (index 1).
   - R is at position 2 (index 2).
   - Y is at position 4 (index 4).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T.

3. The word structure so far: 
   - Position 0: unknown (but not C, N, E, P, T, and also not A, R, Y because they are fixed elsewhere)
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 2: R
   - Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 0)
   - Position 4: Y

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter3] Y

Constraints on letter1 and letter3:
- They cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.
- Also, they must be letters that are in the word, but we don't know which ones yet.

We have only two unknown positions: index 0 and index 3.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word directly if we can think of one.

But note: we have not tested many letters. We know the word must have exactly these letters: A, R, Y, and two more letters that are not C, N, E, P, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tried: like S, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

But we also have to form a valid English word.

Let me think of words that match the pattern _ A R _ Y.

Common words:
- DAIRY: D at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- FAIRY: F at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- HAIRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4? But ""MARRY"" has two R's? The pattern is _ A R _ Y, so if we put R at 3, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, but it's possible.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 and it was present, and in the second guess R at position 2 is correct. So if the word had two R's, that would be possible? But in ""party"", R at position 2 is correct, so if there is another R, it would have been indicated? Actually, in ""party"", we only have one R. The feedback for ""party"" shows R at position 2 is correct, but if the word had another R, we wouldn't know because we didn't have a guess with R in another position? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""party"", we guessed R only at position 2, so if the word has another R, we wouldn't have feedback for it. So duplicates are possible.

But let's check the pattern: the word must have A at 1, R at 2, Y at 4, and two other letters.

Now, for the word ""MARRY"": it would be M, A, R, R, Y -> but that's 5 letters: positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y. But we have R at position 2 and position 3? Then in the first guess, when we had ""crane"" with R at position 1, it would have been marked as present (which it was) but we don't know if there are two R's. Similarly, in ""party"", we only have one R, so if the word has two R's, the feedback for the R at position 2 would still be correct, and we wouldn't know about the other R.

But we don't have evidence for or against duplicates. So we must consider both.

However, to be safe, we can first try a word without duplicates.

Let me list possible words that fit _ A R _ Y and avoid the excluded letters (C, N, E, P, T).

Possible letters for position 0 and 3: any letter except A, R, Y (because they are fixed) and except C, N, E, P, T.

Note: A, R, Y are already in the word at fixed positions, so they can appear again? But we don't know. For now, let's assume they don't, to avoid complexity.

Common words:
- DAIRY: D and I are not excluded? D is not in the excluded list (C, N, E, P, T). I is also not excluded. So ""DAIRY"" is a candidate.
- FAIRY: F and I -> F is not excluded, I is not excluded.
- HAIRY: H and I.
- LAIRY: L and I? ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means something, but less common.
- MAIRY: not common.
- WAIRY: not common.
- BAIRY: not common.

Also, words with O: like OARY? Not a word. Or with U: like ... ""CARNY"" but C is excluded.

Another: ""HARPY"" -> but H and P? P is excluded (from ""party"" feedback: P is not in the word). So ""HARPY"" has P? H A R P Y -> P at position 3? But P is excluded, so invalid.

Similarly, ""TARPY"" -> T is excluded.

So let's list:

- DAIRY: D, A, R, I, Y -> D and I are new.
- FAIRY: F, A, R, I, Y -> F and I.
- HAIRY: H, A, R, I, Y -> H and I.
- Also, ""WARLY"" -> W, A, R, L, Y -> W and L? ""WARLY"" is an adjective meaning watchful? Not very common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y -> but then position 3 is R. We haven't tested R at position 3? And we know R is in the word at position 2, but if there is another R, it's possible. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R, which is the same as position 2. But we don't know if that's allowed.

Similarly, ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is excluded? From first guess, N is not in the word. So invalid.

""JARRY"": J, A, R, R, Y? But J and duplicate R.

But J is not excluded? We haven't tested J.

But let's stick to non-duplicates for now.

We have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY.

We need to choose one to guess. We can also think of other words.

Another common word: ""DAIRY"" and ""FAIRY"" are both common.

But note: we have not tested D, F, H, I, L, etc.

We can choose a word that uses a common letter to get more information? But we only have two positions left, and we are guessing the entire word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has new letters to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.

Since we have A, R, Y fixed, and two unknowns, we can try to guess one of these words.

But we have to make a guess. Let's pick ""DAIRY"" because it's common.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn't conflict.

Similarly, R at position 2 is correct.

Now, if we guess ""DAIRY"", we are testing D at 0 and I at 3.

If it's not correct, we get feedback on D and I.

But we have only 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 4 more tries including this one.

But we might solve it.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have I, but has other letters? For example, ""HARMY"" -> not a word? Or ""BARMY"" -> B and M? But ""BARMY"" is a word? Meaning crazy. But B and M are not excluded.

But pattern: B A R M Y -> positions: 0:B, 1:A, 2:R, 3:M, 4:Y.

But we don't know if M is in the word.

Similarly, ""WARAY"" not a word.

""CARVY"" not a word.

So back to the common ones.

I think ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"" are the main ones.

Also, ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means of or relating to a lair, but rare.

""MAYRY"" not a word.

""NAIRY"" not a word.

So let's choose ""DAIRY"".

But we can also consider: we have Y at the end, so the word is likely to be an adjective or noun ending with Y.

Another word: ""GAWKY"" -> but G A W K Y? Then position 1 is A? But we have A at position 1, so it would be G A W K Y -> but then position 2 is W, but we need R at position 2? So no, because position 2 must be R.

So the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ Y

So only the first and third positions are free.

Therefore, we must have a word that starts with a letter and has a letter at the third position.

Given that, let's list all possible common words:

- DAIRY
- FAIRY
- HAIRY
- JAWKY? Not a word.
- KARZY? Not a word.
- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K at position 3? ""LARKY"" is a word? Meaning mischievous? Not common.
- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R, but common.
- NARCO? Not matching pattern.

So the most common are DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, and MARRY.

But MARRY has duplicate R, so if we guess MARRY and it's wrong, we might not get information about the third letter because it's R again.

So better to guess one without duplicates.

Among DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, which one to choose?

We can choose based on commonality or to test more common letters.

But we don't have information about D, F, H, I.

I is common, so if we guess a word with I, we test I.

Similarly, D, F, H are less common? But we need to test.

But we are guessing the entire word, so if it's not correct, we get feedback on the two new letters.

For example, if we guess ""DAIRY"" and it's wrong, we might get:
- If D is in the word, and if it's at position 0, then D would be correct? Or if not, then we get feedback.

But the word might be ""FAIRY"" or ""HAIRY"", so we can try.

To be systematic, we can choose the most common word: ""DAIRY"" is common.

But let me check: ""FAIRY"" is also very common.

Perhaps we can look for a word that uses a letter we haven't tried that is very common, like S? But is there a word ""SARY""? No, not 5 letters.

""SARAY"" not a word.

""SAIRY"" not a word.

""SHIRY"" not a word.

So no word with S? What about ""STARY""? But T is excluded? ""STARY"" has T? S T A R Y -> but T is at position 1? No: positions: 0:S, 1:T, 2:A? But we need position 1 to be A and 2 to be R. So ""STARY"" is S T A R Y -> position 1 is T, but we need A at position 1? So not matching.

Similarly, ""SCARY"" has C and A at position 2? Not matching.

So no common word with S.

Similarly, L: ""LARDY"" -> L A R D Y -> D at position 3? ""LARDY"" is a word? Meaning fat? But then we have D at position 3 and L at 0. But we can consider.

""LARDY"": L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But D is at position 3? And we have D at 0? No, L at 0, D at 3.

But we have two D's? No, ""LARDY"" has one D.

Similarly, ""LARKY"" as before.

But ""LARDY"" is less common.

Similarly, M: ""MARRY"" or ""MARDY"" -> M A R D Y? ""MARDY"" is a word? Meaning spoiled? Not common.

So I think DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY are the top candidates.

I'll go with ""dairy"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn't affect.

Similarly, no conflict.

So let's guess ""dairy"".

But we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a vowel for the third position? Like I or O? But O: ""OARY"" not a word.

U: ""UNARY"" has U and N? N is excluded.

So I is the most common.

Therefore, I choose ""dairy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - This indicates that R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed), and C, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), Y(✓)  
  - This confirms that:
    - A is correct and in position 1 (1st index).
    - R is correct and in position 2 (2nd index).
    - Y is correct and in position 4 (4th index).
    - P and T are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[letter] A R [letter] Y` (positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Known correct letters: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, E, P, T (from feedback).
- The unknown positions are:
  - Position 0: Must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, or Y (since they are fixed elsewhere, but duplicates are possible).
  - Position 3: Same constraints as position 0.
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""dairy"", ""fairy"", ""hairy"", ""marry"", etc. (avoiding excluded letters).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test the unknown positions (0 and 3) with common letters not yet tested (e.g., D, F, H, I, L, M).
- ""Dairy"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests D at position 0 and I at position 3. If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on D and I (e.g., if they are in the word and their positions).
- This guess could solve the puzzle if correct, or narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>dairy</guess>",dairy,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct, at position 4)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, and Y.
   - A is at position 1 (index 1).
   - R is at position 2 (index 2).
   - Y is at position 4 (index 4).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T.

3. The word structure so far: 
   - Position 0: unknown (but not C, N, E, P, T, and also not A, R, Y because they are fixed elsewhere)
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 2: R
   - Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 0)
   - Position 4: Y

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter3] Y

Constraints on letter1 and letter3:
- They cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.
- Also, they must be letters that are in the word, but we don't know which ones yet.

We have only two unknown positions: index 0 and index 3.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word directly if we can think of one.

But note: we have not tested many letters. We know the word must have exactly these letters: A, R, Y, and two more letters that are not C, N, E, P, T.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in word

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)
 Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> x

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters: R and A (at least one occurrence each)
- Does not have: C, N, E (since marked x)

We also know the word does not have C, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Is 5 letters, English word.
- Does not contain C, N, E (to avoid wasted letters).
- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, R cannot be at position 1, and A cannot be at position 2. But they could be anywhere else.

We also want to try to place other common consonants to get more information.

Let me think about possible words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Common letters to try: we might include other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, etc.).

One idea: start with words that have R and A in different positions.

Possible word: ""ROAST"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, we must avoid E? Actually, we know E is not in the word, so we should avoid E. ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T, and R. But let's check:
- R: we have R, but we must not put R at position 1? Actually in ""ROAST"", R is at position 0. That might be okay because in the first guess R was at position 1 so it could be at 0. Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.

Wait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: 
R O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. 
But we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

So we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.

Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.

Possible words:
- Try ""PARTY"": 
  P A R T Y
  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it's at 1 so different.
  R is at index 2 -> we don't know yet if that's allowed? Previously it was at index 1 and was wrong. So we have R at a new position.

But what about the R? Previously, R was in the word but not at index 1. So R can be at index 2? Yes, because we don't know where it is exactly.

So ""PARTY"": 
- R at index 2: which is new (was 1 before) -> okay.
- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.

However, note that we have two new letters: P, T, Y. We don't know about them.

Another possibility: ""RADAR"" -> but has R at index 0 and index 3? But R is present, and A is at index 1 and index 3? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We don't have information that the word has duplicates. Sometimes words have repeated letters, but we have to consider that. However, starting with a word without duplicates might be better.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. So ideally we choose a word without repeated letters to maximize information.

""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.

Similarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.

In ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.

So let's try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.

Some options:

- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong? Actually, the feedback only tells us about that particular guess. But we already know R cannot be at index1 because we had it there and it wasn't correct. So we should avoid putting R at index1 again because we know it's wrong. Similarly for A at index2.

So ""ARRAY"": has A at index0 (new) and index2 (but we avoid index2 for A). Also, R at index1 (bad) and index3. Also duplicate R and duplicate A? So that might be messy.

Better avoid duplicates until we know more.

Another word: ""PARTY"" as before: P at0, A at1, R at2, T at3, Y at4.

A is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.
R is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.

Similarly, ""RASP?"" Wait, ""RASP"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: 
P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)

But A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.

""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.

I think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.

But let me note: we also have the letter S that we haven't tested. In ""PARTS"", we have P, A, R, T, S. Similarly, ""PARTY"" has Y.

We also haven't tried any vowels? We have A (which is a vowel) but we need to check other vowels because the word might have one of I, O, U.

So maybe a word like ""RADIO""? But ""RADIO"": 
R A D I O
- R at index0: new (so okay, since we had R at index1 before)
- But A at index1: that's a new position? And previously we had A at index2? So index1 is a new position -> okay.
However, we have D, I, O that are new.

But note: we don't have feedback about these positions. Also, ""RADIO"" has R at index0: that might be a valid position? But we don't know if it will be correct.

Another word: ""ORBIT"" -> O R B I T.
A is missing? But we know the word has A because of the first guess. So we must include A? Otherwise we are missing a required letter.

We know the word must contain R and A. So we have to include both.

So words without A are invalid? Yes, we must include R and A.

Therefore, we need a word that includes R and A (and avoids C, N, E).

Let me consider words starting with A? For example, ""ADAPT"" -> but has D, P, T? 
A at index0 -> okay (not index2)
D, P, T are new.

But R? Where is R? Not present in ""ADAPT"". So not containing R -> invalid.

Similarly, must have R.

Let me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that's a new position.

So ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: 
- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay
- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don't know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.

But in the feedback we don't have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.

But note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That's all.

So R at0: okay. A at1: we don't have information that it's wrong? So we can try.

""RAILS"": 
R(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)

But A at index1: we don't know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.

However, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).

In ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.

Also, the word has I, L, S which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.

Same as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.

To cover more common letters, perhaps ""TRAIN"" or ""TRAIT"" (but duplicates?).

""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> but we have A at index2? Not allowed because we cannot put A at index2. So invalid.

We need to avoid index2 for A.

What about ""TARES""? T A R E S -> but E is disallowed! Because we got E marked as x in first guess? So we must avoid E.

So ""TARES"" is invalid.

Similarly, words with C, N, E are invalid.

So ""PARTY"" seems good.

Alternative: ""CARES"" -> has C and E? we know C and E are not in the word -> invalid.

Another alternative: ""MOIST"" -> but no R and A? invalid.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> unique letters, P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4). And avoids index2 for A and index1 for R? R at index2: which we haven't tried? And A at index1: which is not index2 -> okay.

Similarly, ""PARTS"" is as good as ""PARTY"". But ""PARTY"" is a word.

I think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".

Summary for guess2: ""PARTY""

We hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.

So, my guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- Letters C, N, E are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (marked -).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A to probe their correct positions (avoiding positions where they are invalid: R cannot be at index 1, A cannot be at index 2).
- Must exclude C, N, E.
- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids duplicate letters for maximum information gain.

The word ""party"":
- Places R at index 2 (new position from R's previous index 1).
- Places A at index 1 (new position from A's previous index 2).
- Introduces P, T, Y (new letters to test).
- No repeated letters.

<guess>party</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct, at position 4)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, and Y.
   - A is at position 1 (index 1).
   - R is at position 2 (index 2).
   - Y is at position 4 (index 4).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T.

3. The word structure so far: 
   - Position 0: unknown (but not C, N, E, P, T, and also not A, R, Y because they are fixed elsewhere)
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 2: R
   - Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 0)
   - Position 4: Y

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter3] Y

Constraints on letter1 and letter3:
- They cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.
- Also, they must be letters that are in the word, but we don't know which ones yet.

We have only two unknown positions: index 0 and index 3.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word directly if we can think of one.

But note: we have not tested many letters. We know the word must have exactly these letters: A, R, Y, and two more letters that are not C, N, E, P, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tried: like S, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

But we also have to form a valid English word.

Let me think of words that match the pattern _ A R _ Y.

Common words:
- DAIRY: D at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- FAIRY: F at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- HAIRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4? But ""MARRY"" has two R's? The pattern is _ A R _ Y, so if we put R at 3, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, but it's possible.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 and it was present, and in the second guess R at position 2 is correct. So if the word had two R's, that would be possible? But in ""party"", R at position 2 is correct, so if there is another R, it would have been indicated? Actually, in ""party"", we only have one R. The feedback for ""party"" shows R at position 2 is correct, but if the word had another R, we wouldn't know because we didn't have a guess with R in another position? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""party"", we guessed R only at position 2, so if the word has another R, we wouldn't have feedback for it. So duplicates are possible.

But let's check the pattern: the word must have A at 1, R at 2, Y at 4, and two other letters.

Now, for the word ""MARRY"": it would be M, A, R, R, Y -> but that's 5 letters: positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y. But we have R at position 2 and position 3? Then in the first guess, when we had ""crane"" with R at position 1, it would have been marked as present (which it was) but we don't know if there are two R's. Similarly, in ""party"", we only have one R, so if the word has two R's, the feedback for the R at position 2 would still be correct, and we wouldn't know about the other R.

But we don't have evidence for or against duplicates. So we must consider both.

However, to be safe, we can first try a word without duplicates.

Let me list possible words that fit _ A R _ Y and avoid the excluded letters (C, N, E, P, T).

Possible letters for position 0 and 3: any letter except A, R, Y (because they are fixed) and except C, N, E, P, T.

Note: A, R, Y are already in the word at fixed positions, so they can appear again? But we don't know. For now, let's assume they don't, to avoid complexity.

Common words:
- DAIRY: D and I are not excluded? D is not in the excluded list (C, N, E, P, T). I is also not excluded. So ""DAIRY"" is a candidate.
- FAIRY: F and I -> F is not excluded, I is not excluded.
- HAIRY: H and I.
- LAIRY: L and I? ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means something, but less common.
- MAIRY: not common.
- WAIRY: not common.
- BAIRY: not common.

Also, words with O: like OARY? Not a word. Or with U: like ... ""CARNY"" but C is excluded.

Another: ""HARPY"" -> but H and P? P is excluded (from ""party"" feedback: P is not in the word). So ""HARPY"" has P? H A R P Y -> P at position 3? But P is excluded, so invalid.

Similarly, ""TARPY"" -> T is excluded.

So let's list:

- DAIRY: D, A, R, I, Y -> D and I are new.
- FAIRY: F, A, R, I, Y -> F and I.
- HAIRY: H, A, R, I, Y -> H and I.
- Also, ""WARLY"" -> W, A, R, L, Y -> W and L? ""WARLY"" is an adjective meaning watchful? Not very common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y -> but then position 3 is R. We haven't tested R at position 3? And we know R is in the word at position 2, but if there is another R, it's possible. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R, which is the same as position 2. But we don't know if that's allowed.

Similarly, ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is excluded? From first guess, N is not in the word. So invalid.

""JARRY"": J, A, R, R, Y? But J and duplicate R.

But J is not excluded? We haven't tested J.

But let's stick to non-duplicates for now.

We have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY.

We need to choose one to guess. We can also think of other words.

Another common word: ""DAIRY"" and ""FAIRY"" are both common.

But note: we have not tested D, F, H, I, L, etc.

We can choose a word that uses a common letter to get more information? But we only have two positions left, and we are guessing the entire word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has new letters to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.

Since we have A, R, Y fixed, and two unknowns, we can try to guess one of these words.

But we have to make a guess. Let's pick ""DAIRY"" because it's common.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn't conflict.

Similarly, R at position 2 is correct.

Now, if we guess ""DAIRY"", we are testing D at 0 and I at 3.

If it's not correct, we get feedback on D and I.

But we have only 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 4 more tries including this one.

But we might solve it.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have I, but has other letters? For example, ""HARMY"" -> not a word? Or ""BARMY"" -> B and M? But ""BARMY"" is a word? Meaning crazy. But B and M are not excluded.

But pattern: B A R M Y -> positions: 0:B, 1:A, 2:R, 3:M, 4:Y.

But we don't know if M is in the word.

Similarly, ""WARAY"" not a word.

""CARVY"" not a word.

So back to the common ones.

I think ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"" are the main ones.

Also, ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means of or relating to a lair, but rare.

""MAYRY"" not a word.

""NAIRY"" not a word.

So let's choose ""DAIRY"".

But we can also consider: we have Y at the end, so the word is likely to be an adjective or noun ending with Y.

Another word: ""GAWKY"" -> but G A W K Y? Then position 1 is A? But we have A at position 1, so it would be G A W K Y -> but then position 2 is W, but we need R at position 2? So no, because position 2 must be R.

So the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ Y

So only the first and third positions are free.

Therefore, we must have a word that starts with a letter and has a letter at the third position.

Given that, let's list all possible common words:

- DAIRY
- FAIRY
- HAIRY
- JAWKY? Not a word.
- KARZY? Not a word.
- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K at position 3? ""LARKY"" is a word? Meaning mischievous? Not common.
- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R, but common.
- NARCO? Not matching pattern.

So the most common are DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, and MARRY.

But MARRY has duplicate R, so if we guess MARRY and it's wrong, we might not get information about the third letter because it's R again.

So better to guess one without duplicates.

Among DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, which one to choose?

We can choose based on commonality or to test more common letters.

But we don't have information about D, F, H, I.

I is common, so if we guess a word with I, we test I.

Similarly, D, F, H are less common? But we need to test.

But we are guessing the entire word, so if it's not correct, we get feedback on the two new letters.

For example, if we guess ""DAIRY"" and it's wrong, we might get:
- If D is in the word, and if it's at position 0, then D would be correct? Or if not, then we get feedback.

But the word might be ""FAIRY"" or ""HAIRY"", so we can try.

To be systematic, we can choose the most common word: ""DAIRY"" is common.

But let me check: ""FAIRY"" is also very common.

Perhaps we can look for a word that uses a letter we haven't tried that is very common, like S? But is there a word ""SARY""? No, not 5 letters.

""SARAY"" not a word.

""SAIRY"" not a word.

""SHIRY"" not a word.

So no word with S? What about ""STARY""? But T is excluded? ""STARY"" has T? S T A R Y -> but T is at position 1? No: positions: 0:S, 1:T, 2:A? But we need position 1 to be A and 2 to be R. So ""STARY"" is S T A R Y -> position 1 is T, but we need A at position 1? So not matching.

Similarly, ""SCARY"" has C and A at position 2? Not matching.

So no common word with S.

Similarly, L: ""LARDY"" -> L A R D Y -> D at position 3? ""LARDY"" is a word? Meaning fat? But then we have D at position 3 and L at 0. But we can consider.

""LARDY"": L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But D is at position 3? And we have D at 0? No, L at 0, D at 3.

But we have two D's? No, ""LARDY"" has one D.

Similarly, ""LARKY"" as before.

But ""LARDY"" is less common.

Similarly, M: ""MARRY"" or ""MARDY"" -> M A R D Y? ""MARDY"" is a word? Meaning spoiled? Not common.

So I think DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY are the top candidates.

I'll go with ""dairy"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn't affect.

Similarly, no conflict.

So let's guess ""dairy"".

But we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a vowel for the third position? Like I or O? But O: ""OARY"" not a word.

U: ""UNARY"" has U and N? N is excluded.

So I is the most common.

Therefore, I choose ""dairy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - This indicates that R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed), and C, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), Y(✓)  
  - This confirms that:
    - A is correct and in position 1 (1st index).
    - R is correct and in position 2 (2nd index).
    - Y is correct and in position 4 (4th index).
    - P and T are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[letter] A R [letter] Y` (positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Known correct letters: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, E, P, T (from feedback).
- The unknown positions are:
  - Position 0: Must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, or Y (since they are fixed elsewhere, but duplicates are possible).
  - Position 3: Same constraints as position 0.
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""dairy"", ""fairy"", ""hairy"", ""marry"", etc. (avoiding excluded letters).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test the unknown positions (0 and 3) with common letters not yet tested (e.g., D, F, H, I, L, M).
- ""Dairy"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests D at position 0 and I at position 3. If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on D and I (e.g., if they are in the word and their positions).
- This guess could solve the puzzle if correct, or narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n C: x -> not in the word\n R: - -> in the word but wrong position\n A: - -> in the word but wrong position\n N: x -> not in the word\n E: x -> not in word\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:\n Position 0: C -> x\n Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)\n Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)\n Position 3: N -> x\n Position 4: E -> x\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Letters: R and A (at least one occurrence each)\n- Does not have: C, N, E (since marked x)\n\nWe also know the word does not have C, N, or E.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Is 5 letters, English word.\n- Does not contain C, N, E (to avoid wasted letters).\n- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, R cannot be at position 1, and A cannot be at position 2. But they could be anywhere else.\n\nWe also want to try to place other common consonants to get more information.\n\nLet me think about possible words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nCommon letters to try: we might include other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, etc.).\n\nOne idea: start with words that have R and A in different positions.\n\nPossible word: ""ROAST"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, we must avoid E? Actually, we know E is not in the word, so we should avoid E. ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T, and R. But let\'s check:\n- R: we have R, but we must not put R at position 1? Actually in ""ROAST"", R is at position 0. That might be okay because in the first guess R was at position 1 so it could be at 0. Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.\n\nWait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: \nR O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. \nBut we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nSo we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.\n\nAlso, avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.\n\nPossible words:\n- Try ""PARTY"": \n  P A R T Y\n  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it\'s at 1 so different.\n  R is at index 2 -> we don\'t know yet if that\'s allowed? Previously it was at index 1 and was wrong. So we have R at a new position.\n\nBut what about the R? Previously, R was in the word but not at index 1. So R can be at index 2? Yes, because we don\'t know where it is exactly.\n\nSo ""PARTY"": \n- R at index 2: which is new (was 1 before) -> okay.\n- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.\n\nHowever, note that we have two new letters: P, T, Y. We don\'t know about them.\n\nAnother possibility: ""RADAR"" -> but has R at index 0 and index 3? But R is present, and A is at index 1 and index 3? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We don\'t have information that the word has duplicates. Sometimes words have repeated letters, but we have to consider that. However, starting with a word without duplicates might be better.\n\nWe don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. So ideally we choose a word without repeated letters to maximize information.\n\n""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.\n\nSimilarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.\n\nSome options:\n\n- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong? Actually, the feedback only tells us about that particular guess. But we already know R cannot be at index1 because we had it there and it wasn\'t correct. So we should avoid putting R at index1 again because we know it\'s wrong. Similarly for A at index2.\n\nSo ""ARRAY"": has A at index0 (new) and index2 (but we avoid index2 for A). Also, R at index1 (bad) and index3. Also duplicate R and duplicate A? So that might be messy.\n\nBetter avoid duplicates until we know more.\n\nAnother word: ""PARTY"" as before: P at0, A at1, R at2, T at3, Y at4.\n\nA is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.\nR is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""RASP?"" Wait, ""RASP"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.\n\n""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: \nP(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)\n\nBut A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.\n\n""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.\n\nI think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.\n\nBut let me note: we also have the letter S that we haven\'t tested. In ""PARTS"", we have P, A, R, T, S. Similarly, ""PARTY"" has Y.\n\nWe also haven\'t tried any vowels? We have A (which is a vowel) but we need to check other vowels because the word might have one of I, O, U.\n\nSo maybe a word like ""RADIO""? But ""RADIO"": \nR A D I O\n- R at index0: new (so okay, since we had R at index1 before)\n- But A at index1: that\'s a new position? And previously we had A at index2? So index1 is a new position -> okay.\nHowever, we have D, I, O that are new.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have feedback about these positions. Also, ""RADIO"" has R at index0: that might be a valid position? But we don\'t know if it will be correct.\n\nAnother word: ""ORBIT"" -> O R B I T.\nA is missing? But we know the word has A because of the first guess. So we must include A? Otherwise we are missing a required letter.\n\nWe know the word must contain R and A. So we have to include both.\n\nSo words without A are invalid? Yes, we must include R and A.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that includes R and A (and avoids C, N, E).\n\nLet me consider words starting with A? For example, ""ADAPT"" -> but has D, P, T? \nA at index0 -> okay (not index2)\nD, P, T are new.\n\nBut R? Where is R? Not present in ""ADAPT"". So not containing R -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, must have R.\n\nLet me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that\'s a new position.\n\nSo ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: \n- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay\n- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don\'t know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.\n\nBut in the feedback we don\'t have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.\n\nBut note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That\'s all.\n\nSo R at0: okay. A at1: we don\'t have information that it\'s wrong? So we can try.\n\n""RAILS"": \nR(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)\n\nBut A at index1: we don\'t know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.\n\nHowever, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).\n\nIn ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.\n\nAlso, the word has I, L, S which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAnother word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.\n\nSame as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.\n\nTo cover more common letters, perhaps ""TRAIN"" or ""TRAIT"" (but duplicates?).\n\n""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> but we have A at index2? Not allowed because we cannot put A at index2. So invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid index2 for A.\n\nWhat about ""TARES""? T A R E S -> but E is disallowed! Because we got E marked as x in first guess? So we must avoid E.\n\nSo ""TARES"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, words with C, N, E are invalid.\n\nSo ""PARTY"" seems good.\n\nAlternative: ""CARES"" -> has C and E? we know C and E are not in the word -> invalid.\n\nAnother alternative: ""MOIST"" -> but no R and A? invalid.\n\n""PARTS"": P A R T S -> unique letters, P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4). And avoids index2 for A and index1 for R? R at index2: which we haven\'t tried? And A at index1: which is not index2 -> okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARTS"" is as good as ""PARTY"". But ""PARTY"" is a word.\n\nI think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".\n\nSummary for guess2: ""PARTY""\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.\n\nSo, my guess is ""party"".\n\n<guess>party</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":\n- Letters C, N, E are not in the secret word (marked x).\n- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (marked -).\n\nFor my next guess:\n- Must include R and A to probe their correct positions (avoiding positions where they are invalid: R cannot be at index 1, A cannot be at index 2).\n- Must exclude C, N, E.\n- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n- Avoids duplicate letters for maximum information gain.\n\nThe word ""party"":\n- Places R at index 2 (new position from R\'s previous index 1).\n- Places A at index 1 (new position from A\'s previous index 2).\n- Introduces P, T, Y (new letters to test).\n- No repeated letters.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)\n- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, at position 1)\n- R: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- Y: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word has the letters A, R, and Y.\n   - A is at position 1 (index 1).\n   - R is at position 2 (index 2).\n   - Y is at position 4 (index 4).\n\n2. The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T.\n\n3. The word structure so far: \n   - Position 0: unknown (but not C, N, E, P, T, and also not A, R, Y because they are fixed elsewhere)\n   - Position 1: A\n   - Position 2: R\n   - Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 0)\n   - Position 4: Y\n\nSo the word is: _ A R _ Y\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter3] Y\n\nConstraints on letter1 and letter3:\n- They cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.\n- Also, they must be letters that are in the word, but we don\'t know which ones yet.\n\nWe have only two unknown positions: index 0 and index 3.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word directly if we can think of one.\n\nBut note: we have not tested many letters. We know the word must have exactly these letters: A, R, Y, and two more letters that are not C, N, E, P, T.\n\nWe should consider common letters that haven\'t been tried: like S, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nBut we also have to form a valid English word.\n\nLet me think of words that match the pattern _ A R _ Y.\n\nCommon words:\n- DAIRY: D at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.\n- FAIRY: F at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.\n- HAIRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.\n- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4? But ""MARRY"" has two R\'s? The pattern is _ A R _ Y, so if we put R at 3, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any duplicate, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 and it was present, and in the second guess R at position 2 is correct. So if the word had two R\'s, that would be possible? But in ""party"", R at position 2 is correct, so if there is another R, it would have been indicated? Actually, in ""party"", we only have one R. The feedback for ""party"" shows R at position 2 is correct, but if the word had another R, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t have a guess with R in another position? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\nIn ""party"", we guessed R only at position 2, so if the word has another R, we wouldn\'t have feedback for it. So duplicates are possible.\n\nBut let\'s check the pattern: the word must have A at 1, R at 2, Y at 4, and two other letters.\n\nNow, for the word ""MARRY"": it would be M, A, R, R, Y -> but that\'s 5 letters: positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y. But we have R at position 2 and position 3? Then in the first guess, when we had ""crane"" with R at position 1, it would have been marked as present (which it was) but we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. Similarly, in ""party"", we only have one R, so if the word has two R\'s, the feedback for the R at position 2 would still be correct, and we wouldn\'t know about the other R.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence for or against duplicates. So we must consider both.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can first try a word without duplicates.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit _ A R _ Y and avoid the excluded letters (C, N, E, P, T).\n\nPossible letters for position 0 and 3: any letter except A, R, Y (because they are fixed) and except C, N, E, P, T.\n\nNote: A, R, Y are already in the word at fixed positions, so they can appear again? But we don\'t know. For now, let\'s assume they don\'t, to avoid complexity.\n\nCommon words:\n- DAIRY: D and I are not excluded? D is not in the excluded list (C, N, E, P, T). I is also not excluded. So ""DAIRY"" is a candidate.\n- FAIRY: F and I -> F is not excluded, I is not excluded.\n- HAIRY: H and I.\n- LAIRY: L and I? ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means something, but less common.\n- MAIRY: not common.\n- WAIRY: not common.\n- BAIRY: not common.\n\nAlso, words with O: like OARY? Not a word. Or with U: like ... ""CARNY"" but C is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""HARPY"" -> but H and P? P is excluded (from ""party"" feedback: P is not in the word). So ""HARPY"" has P? H A R P Y -> P at position 3? But P is excluded, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TARPY"" -> T is excluded.\n\nSo let\'s list:\n\n- DAIRY: D, A, R, I, Y -> D and I are new.\n- FAIRY: F, A, R, I, Y -> F and I.\n- HAIRY: H, A, R, I, Y -> H and I.\n- Also, ""WARLY"" -> W, A, R, L, Y -> W and L? ""WARLY"" is an adjective meaning watchful? Not very common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y -> but then position 3 is R. We haven\'t tested R at position 3? And we know R is in the word at position 2, but if there is another R, it\'s possible. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R, which is the same as position 2. But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is excluded? From first guess, N is not in the word. So invalid.\n\n""JARRY"": J, A, R, R, Y? But J and duplicate R.\n\nBut J is not excluded? We haven\'t tested J.\n\nBut let\'s stick to non-duplicates for now.\n\nWe have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess. We can also think of other words.\n\nAnother common word: ""DAIRY"" and ""FAIRY"" are both common.\n\nBut note: we have not tested D, F, H, I, L, etc.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses a common letter to get more information? But we only have two positions left, and we are guessing the entire word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess a word that has new letters to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nSince we have A, R, Y fixed, and two unknowns, we can try to guess one of these words.\n\nBut we have to make a guess. Let\'s pick ""DAIRY"" because it\'s common.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn\'t conflict.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 2 is correct.\n\nNow, if we guess ""DAIRY"", we are testing D at 0 and I at 3.\n\nIf it\'s not correct, we get feedback on D and I.\n\nBut we have only 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 4 more tries including this one.\n\nBut we might solve it.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that doesn\'t necessarily have I, but has other letters? For example, ""HARMY"" -> not a word? Or ""BARMY"" -> B and M? But ""BARMY"" is a word? Meaning crazy. But B and M are not excluded.\n\nBut pattern: B A R M Y -> positions: 0:B, 1:A, 2:R, 3:M, 4:Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if M is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""WARAY"" not a word.\n\n""CARVY"" not a word.\n\nSo back to the common ones.\n\nI think ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"" are the main ones.\n\nAlso, ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means of or relating to a lair, but rare.\n\n""MAYRY"" not a word.\n\n""NAIRY"" not a word.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""DAIRY"".\n\nBut we can also consider: we have Y at the end, so the word is likely to be an adjective or noun ending with Y.\n\nAnother word: ""GAWKY"" -> but G A W K Y? Then position 1 is A? But we have A at position 1, so it would be G A W K Y -> but then position 2 is W, but we need R at position 2? So no, because position 2 must be R.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ Y\n\nSo only the first and third positions are free.\n\nTherefore, we must have a word that starts with a letter and has a letter at the third position.\n\nGiven that, let\'s list all possible common words:\n\n- DAIRY\n- FAIRY\n- HAIRY\n- JAWKY? Not a word.\n- KARZY? Not a word.\n- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K at position 3? ""LARKY"" is a word? Meaning mischievous? Not common.\n- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R, but common.\n- NARCO? Not matching pattern.\n\nSo the most common are DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, and MARRY.\n\nBut MARRY has duplicate R, so if we guess MARRY and it\'s wrong, we might not get information about the third letter because it\'s R again.\n\nSo better to guess one without duplicates.\n\nAmong DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, which one to choose?\n\nWe can choose based on commonality or to test more common letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have information about D, F, H, I.\n\nI is common, so if we guess a word with I, we test I.\n\nSimilarly, D, F, H are less common? But we need to test.\n\nBut we are guessing the entire word, so if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on the two new letters.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""DAIRY"" and it\'s wrong, we might get:\n- If D is in the word, and if it\'s at position 0, then D would be correct? Or if not, then we get feedback.\n\nBut the word might be ""FAIRY"" or ""HAIRY"", so we can try.\n\nTo be systematic, we can choose the most common word: ""DAIRY"" is common.\n\nBut let me check: ""FAIRY"" is also very common.\n\nPerhaps we can look for a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried that is very common, like S? But is there a word ""SARY""? No, not 5 letters.\n\n""SARAY"" not a word.\n\n""SAIRY"" not a word.\n\n""SHIRY"" not a word.\n\nSo no word with S? What about ""STARY""? But T is excluded? ""STARY"" has T? S T A R Y -> but T is at position 1? No: positions: 0:S, 1:T, 2:A? But we need position 1 to be A and 2 to be R. So ""STARY"" is S T A R Y -> position 1 is T, but we need A at position 1? So not matching.\n\nSimilarly, ""SCARY"" has C and A at position 2? Not matching.\n\nSo no common word with S.\n\nSimilarly, L: ""LARDY"" -> L A R D Y -> D at position 3? ""LARDY"" is a word? Meaning fat? But then we have D at position 3 and L at 0. But we can consider.\n\n""LARDY"": L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.\n\nBut D is at position 3? And we have D at 0? No, L at 0, D at 3.\n\nBut we have two D\'s? No, ""LARDY"" has one D.\n\nSimilarly, ""LARKY"" as before.\n\nBut ""LARDY"" is less common.\n\nSimilarly, M: ""MARRY"" or ""MARDY"" -> M A R D Y? ""MARDY"" is a word? Meaning spoiled? Not common.\n\nSo I think DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY are the top candidates.\n\nI\'ll go with ""dairy"".\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn\'t affect.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""dairy"".\n\nBut we have to output in the format.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a vowel for the third position? Like I or O? But O: ""OARY"" not a word.\n\nU: ""UNARY"" has U and N? N is excluded.\n\nSo I is the most common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""dairy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - This indicates that R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed), and C, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2: ""party""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), Y(✓)  \n  - This confirms that:\n    - A is correct and in position 1 (1st index).\n    - R is correct and in position 2 (2nd index).\n    - Y is correct and in position 4 (4th index).\n    - P and T are not in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `[letter] A R [letter] Y` (positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n- Known correct letters: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, E, P, T (from feedback).\n- The unknown positions are:\n  - Position 0: Must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, or Y (since they are fixed elsewhere, but duplicates are possible).\n  - Position 3: Same constraints as position 0.\n- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""dairy"", ""fairy"", ""hairy"", ""marry"", etc. (avoiding excluded letters).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- We need to test the unknown positions (0 and 3) with common letters not yet tested (e.g., D, F, H, I, L, M).\n- ""Dairy"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests D at position 0 and I at position 3. If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on D and I (e.g., if they are in the word and their positions).\n- This guess could solve the puzzle if correct, or narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>dairy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the fixed letters:  
   - Position 1: A  
   - Position 2: R  
   - Position 4: Y

2. So the pattern is: [unknown0] A R [unknown3] Y

3. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):  
   - C (from guess1), N (from guess1), E (from guess1), P (from guess2), T (from guess2), D (from guess3), I (from guess3)

4. Also, from guess1, we know:
   - R was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 1 (and now we know it's at position 2, so that matches).  
   - A was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 2 (and now we know it's at position 1, so that matches).

Now, the unknown positions are 0 and 3. We need to fill them with letters that are not excluded.  

Possible letters: any letter not in {A, R, Y} (though duplicates are possible, but unlikely) and must avoid {C, N, E, P, T, D, I}.

Since we don't have any indication of duplicates, we continue with the assumption of no duplicates. Thus, positions 0 and 3 should be letters not among A, R, Y, and not excluded.

Excluded set: C, N, E, P, T, D, I

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ Y

Possible words:  
- FAIRY? But I is excluded. ""FAIRY"" has I at position 3 -> I is already excluded (from guess3: I(x)), so not possible.  
- HAIRY? Similarly, has I -> excluded.  
- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R? But R is already fixed at position 2. Position 3 would be R. Since R is allowed to reappear?  
  However, in ""dairy"", we didn't have a second R, and feedback didn't indicate any. But the secret word could have a second R?  
  We need to consider that possibility.  
- Other words: BARMY? Not common, means eccentric.  
HARDY? H A R D Y -> but D is excluded.  
LACKY -> contains C (excluded) and K? Pattern doesn't fit.  

Let's list systematically:

- Words ending in Y: e.g., 
  - ...ARY: not possible because position 1 is A and 2 is R, so we have AR at 1 and 2.  
  - Instead, we have AR followed by something Y.

Common words:
- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4 -> duplicate R. Possible.
- FARRY? Not a word.
- HARRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R? But ""HARRY"" is H A R R Y? No, ""HARRY"" is typically 5 letters? H-A-R-R-Y? Yes, positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y? But that's two R's. ""HARRY"" has two R's? No, in standard spelling, ""harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y? Actually, it's spelled H-A-R-R-Y? Let me confirm: ""Harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y, so if we take ""HARRY"" (without capitalization), it has two R's: indices 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R? No: 
- The word ""harry"" is 5 letters: H-A-R-R-Y -> positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> so two R's.

Similarly:
- JARRY: J A R R Y? Duplicate R? Not common.
- PARRY: P is excluded? P(x) from guess2, so P not in word. ""Parry"" has P -> invalid.
- TARRY: T is excluded -> invalid.
- WARRY: W A R R Y? Duplicate R.
- CARVY: C excluded? Yes.

Words without duplicate R:
- BAWLY? Not a word.
- GAWKY? But position 4 is Y, and we have G A W K Y -> positions 0:G, 1:A, 2:R must be? But we have W at 2? No, pattern requires position 2 is R, so the third character must be R.

The pattern must be [some letter] A R [some letter] Y

So the only common words I can think of with no excluded letters and no duplicates (beside possible R duplicate) are:

- MARRY: with R at position 3.
- HARRY: H A R R Y -> again duplicate R.

Other words without duplicate R:

- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K not excluded? L(0), A(1), R(2), K(3), Y(4). So K is new? And L new.

""Larky"" is a word? Meaning playful or mischievous. Acceptable.

- Similarly, ""MARVY"": M A R V Y -> V at position 3? Marvy means excellent? Slang? Less common.

""HARDY"" -> but D excluded.

""FARM Y"" -> not a word? ""FARM"" is 4 letters.

""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but T excluded.

""BARNY"" -> N excluded.

So possibilities:
- MARRY (with duplicate R): positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> but we have duplicate R? So if this is the word, then feedback for previous guesses:

In ""crane"", R was at position 1 which is not correct? But since there is an R at position 2, it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. So possible.

In ""party"", R was at position 2 which is correct. So no indication of the second R because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, ""dairy"" didn't have R at position 3.

- LARKY: L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, K at 3, Y at 4.

- HAIRY: but I excluded, so not possible.

Given that, we have to choose between ""MARRY"" and ""LARKY"".

To test, we can guess either. But note that we need to form a valid word.

Another word: ""CARBY"" -> C excluded? No.

""JARLY"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""MARRY"" is more common.

But let's consider the feedback: in guess1, A was at position 2 and wrong? But in the secret word, if it's ""MARRY"", A is at position 1? Correct? But position 2 is R. So in guess1, we had A at position 2 and the secret word has R at position 2? So then A was not at position 2? And since the secret word has A at position 1, then A should have been marked as ""-"" because it was in the word but not at position 2? That matches.

Similarly, no conflict.

But we thought of ""MARRY"" with duplicate R. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R? So in the feedback for ""dairy"", we had I at position 3 and it was x? That is consistent because I is not in the word.

But to guess, we have two options: ""MARRY"" or ""LARKY"".

Since we haven't tested many letters, we can use a guess that also tests new letters? But we are forced into the pattern.

Alternatively, we can guess ""marry"" to test the duplicate R theory.

If we guess ""marry"":
- If correct, we win.
- If incorrect, we get feedback on M and possibly the third position? But in ""marry"", position 0 is M and position 3 is R (duplicate).

If position 0 is M and it's correct or wrong? And position 3 is R: since R is already known, if it is at this position correctly? Or if there is no duplicate, then R would be marked wrong at position 3? But R is in the word, so it would be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if it is the correct position? But we don't know.

But likely, if the secret word is ""LARKY"", then we get feedback for ""marry"" as M(x), A(✓), R(✓), R(x) if R is not at position 3? But R is in the word at position 2, so a second R at position 3 being wrong? Maybe ""-"" because the letter R is in the word but not at position 3? But there is already one R placed correctly? So for duplicate, it depends on whether there are two R's and if we guess correctly.

To avoid confusion, we can guess ""larky"" instead? But it's less common.

Since ""MARRY"" is a common word and matches, we can try that.

Also, note: in the first guess, we had a ""-"" for R at position 1: now R is at position 2? So if there were another R, the ""-"" in guess1 would still stand? Yes.

Similarly, no issue.

Thus, I'll guess ""marry"".

But note: excluded letters? M is not excluded.

So guess ""marry"".Based on the previous feedback, we have:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A R _ Y`  
- **Fixed letters**: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  
- **Possible candidates**: Only a few words fit the pattern while avoiding excluded letters, such as ""marry"" (with duplicate R) or ""larky"" (with K and L).

After evaluating:
- ""Marry"" is a common word that fits the pattern `M A R R Y`, testing:
  - M at position 0 (new letter).
  - Duplicate R at position 3 (since R is already confirmed at position 2).
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback will clarify if M is present and whether a duplicate R is allowed at position 3.

<guess>marry</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed).  
   - C, N, E are not in the word.  

2. **Guess 2 (""party"")**:  
   - A, R, Y are confirmed correct at positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.  
   - P and T are not in the word.  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ A R _ Y`.  

3. **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**:  
   - D and I are not in the word.  
   - A, R, Y remain correct at their positions.  
   - No new letters added beyond exclusions.  

### Deductions:
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  
- **Pattern**: `[?] A R [?] Y` (positions 0 and 3 unknown).  
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Likely candidates**:  
  - ""Marry"" (M A R R Y): Tests M at position 0 and a potential duplicate R at position 3.  
  - ""Larky"" (L A R K Y): Tests L at position 0 and K at position 3.  
- ""Marry"" is a common word and fits the pattern. Guessing it tests the duplicate R scenario and M efficiently.

### Next Guess:  
Chose ""marry"" to resolve the pattern directly. If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on M/R duplication will narrow options significantly.

<guess>marry</guess>",marry,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (still correct at position 1)
- I: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (still correct at position 2)
- Y: ✓ (still correct at position 4)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the fixed letters:  
   - Position 1: A  
   - Position 2: R  
   - Position 4: Y

2. So the pattern is: [unknown0] A R [unknown3] Y

3. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):  
   - C (from guess1), N (from guess1), E (from guess1), P (from guess2), T (from guess2), D (from guess3), I (from guess3)

4. Also, from guess1, we know:
   - R was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 1 (and now we know it's at position 2, so that matches).  
   - A was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 2 (and now we know it's at position 1, so that matches).

Now, the unknown positions are 0 and 3. We need to fill them with letters that are not excluded.  

Possible letters: any letter not in {A, R, Y} (though duplicates are possible, but unlikely) and must avoid {C, N, E, P, T, D, I}.

Since we don't have any indication of duplicates, we continue with the assumption of no duplicates. Thus, positions 0 and 3 should be letters not among A, R, Y, and not excluded.

Excluded set: C, N, E, P, T, D, I

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ Y

Possible words:  
- FAIRY? But I is excluded. ""FAIRY"" has I at position 3 -> I is already excluded (from guess3: I(x)), so not possible.  
- HAIRY? Similarly, has I -> excluded.  
- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R? But R is already fixed at position 2. Position 3 would be R. Since R is allowed to reappear?  
  However, in ""dairy"", we didn't have a second R, and feedback didn't indicate any. But the secret word could have a second R?  
  We need to consider that possibility.  
- Other words: BARMY? Not common, means eccentric.  
HARDY? H A R D Y -> but D is excluded.  
LACKY -> contains C (excluded) and K? Pattern doesn't fit.  

Let's list systematically:

- Words ending in Y: e.g., 
  - ...ARY: not possible because position 1 is A and 2 is R, so we have AR at 1 and 2.  
  - Instead, we have AR followed by something Y.

Common words:
- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4 -> duplicate R. Possible.
- FARRY? Not a word.
- HARRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R? But ""HARRY"" is H A R R Y? No, ""HARRY"" is typically 5 letters? H-A-R-R-Y? Yes, positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y? But that's two R's. ""HARRY"" has two R's? No, in standard spelling, ""harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y? Actually, it's spelled H-A-R-R-Y? Let me confirm: ""Harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y, so if we take ""HARRY"" (without capitalization), it has two R's: indices 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R? No: 
- The word ""harry"" is 5 letters: H-A-R-R-Y -> positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> so two R's.

Similarly:
- JARRY: J A R R Y? Duplicate R? Not common.
- PARRY: P is excluded? P(x) from guess2, so P not in word. ""Parry"" has P -> invalid.
- TARRY: T is excluded -> invalid.
- WARRY: W A R R Y? Duplicate R.
- CARVY: C excluded? Yes.

Words without duplicate R:
- BAWLY? Not a word.
- GAWKY? But position 4 is Y, and we have G A W K Y -> positions 0:G, 1:A, 2:R must be? But we have W at 2? No, pattern requires position 2 is R, so the third character must be R.

The pattern must be [some letter] A R [some letter] Y

So the only common words I can think of with no excluded letters and no duplicates (beside possible R duplicate) are:

- MARRY: with R at position 3.
- HARRY: H A R R Y -> again duplicate R.

Other words without duplicate R:

- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K not excluded? L(0), A(1), R(2), K(3), Y(4). So K is new? And L new.

""Larky"" is a word? Meaning playful or mischievous. Acceptable.

- Similarly, ""MARVY"": M A R V Y -> V at position 3? Marvy means excellent? Slang? Less common.

""HARDY"" -> but D excluded.

""FARM Y"" -> not a word? ""FARM"" is 4 letters.

""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but T excluded.

""BARNY"" -> N excluded.

So possibilities:
- MARRY (with duplicate R): positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> but we have duplicate R? So if this is the word, then feedback for previous guesses:

In ""crane"", R was at position 1 which is not correct? But since there is an R at position 2, it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. So possible.

In ""party"", R was at position 2 which is correct. So no indication of the second R because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, ""dairy"" didn't have R at position 3.

- LARKY: L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, K at 3, Y at 4.

- HAIRY: but I excluded, so not possible.

Given that, we have to choose between ""MARRY"" and ""LARKY"".

To test, we can guess either. But note that we need to form a valid word.

Another word: ""CARBY"" -> C excluded? No.

""JARLY"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""MARRY"" is more common.

But let's consider the feedback: in guess1, A was at position 2 and wrong? But in the secret word, if it's ""MARRY"", A is at position 1? Correct? But position 2 is R. So in guess1, we had A at position 2 and the secret word has R at position 2? So then A was not at position 2? And since the secret word has A at position 1, then A should have been marked as ""-"" because it was in the word but not at position 2? That matches.

Similarly, no conflict.

But we thought of ""MARRY"" with duplicate R. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R? So in the feedback for ""dairy"", we had I at position 3 and it was x? That is consistent because I is not in the word.

But to guess, we have two options: ""MARRY"" or ""LARKY"".

Since we haven't tested many letters, we can use a guess that also tests new letters? But we are forced into the pattern.

Alternatively, we can guess ""marry"" to test the duplicate R theory.

If we guess ""marry"":
- If correct, we win.
- If incorrect, we get feedback on M and possibly the third position? But in ""marry"", position 0 is M and position 3 is R (duplicate).

If position 0 is M and it's correct or wrong? And position 3 is R: since R is already known, if it is at this position correctly? Or if there is no duplicate, then R would be marked wrong at position 3? But R is in the word, so it would be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if it is the correct position? But we don't know.

But likely, if the secret word is ""LARKY"", then we get feedback for ""marry"" as M(x), A(✓), R(✓), R(x) if R is not at position 3? But R is in the word at position 2, so a second R at position 3 being wrong? Maybe ""-"" because the letter R is in the word but not at position 3? But there is already one R placed correctly? So for duplicate, it depends on whether there are two R's and if we guess correctly.

To avoid confusion, we can guess ""larky"" instead? But it's less common.

Since ""MARRY"" is a common word and matches, we can try that.

Also, note: in the first guess, we had a ""-"" for R at position 1: now R is at position 2? So if there were another R, the ""-"" in guess1 would still stand? Yes.

Similarly, no issue.

Thus, I'll guess ""marry"".

But note: excluded letters? M is not excluded.

So guess ""marry"".Based on the previous feedback, we have:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A R _ Y`  
- **Fixed letters**: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  
- **Possible candidates**: Only a few words fit the pattern while avoiding excluded letters, such as ""marry"" (with duplicate R) or ""larky"" (with K and L).

After evaluating:
- ""Marry"" is a common word that fits the pattern `M A R R Y`, testing:
  - M at position 0 (new letter).
  - Duplicate R at position 3 (since R is already confirmed at position 2).
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback will clarify if M is present and whether a duplicate R is allowed at position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in word

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)
 Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> x

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters: R and A (at least one occurrence each)
- Does not have: C, N, E (since marked x)

We also know the word does not have C, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Is 5 letters, English word.
- Does not contain C, N, E (to avoid wasted letters).
- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, R cannot be at position 1, and A cannot be at position 2. But they could be anywhere else.

We also want to try to place other common consonants to get more information.

Let me think about possible words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Common letters to try: we might include other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, etc.).

One idea: start with words that have R and A in different positions.

Possible word: ""ROAST"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, we must avoid E? Actually, we know E is not in the word, so we should avoid E. ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T, and R. But let's check:
- R: we have R, but we must not put R at position 1? Actually in ""ROAST"", R is at position 0. That might be okay because in the first guess R was at position 1 so it could be at 0. Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.

Wait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: 
R O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. 
But we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

So we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.

Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.

Possible words:
- Try ""PARTY"": 
  P A R T Y
  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it's at 1 so different.
  R is at index 2 -> we don't know yet if that's allowed? Previously it was at index 1 and was wrong. So we have R at a new position.

But what about the R? Previously, R was in the word but not at index 1. So R can be at index 2? Yes, because we don't know where it is exactly.

So ""PARTY"": 
- R at index 2: which is new (was 1 before) -> okay.
- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.

However, note that we have two new letters: P, T, Y. We don't know about them.

Another possibility: ""RADAR"" -> but has R at index 0 and index 3? But R is present, and A is at index 1 and index 3? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We don't have information that the word has duplicates. Sometimes words have repeated letters, but we have to consider that. However, starting with a word without duplicates might be better.

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. So ideally we choose a word without repeated letters to maximize information.

""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.

Similarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.

In ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.

So let's try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.

Some options:

- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong? Actually, the feedback only tells us about that particular guess. But we already know R cannot be at index1 because we had it there and it wasn't correct. So we should avoid putting R at index1 again because we know it's wrong. Similarly for A at index2.

So ""ARRAY"": has A at index0 (new) and index2 (but we avoid index2 for A). Also, R at index1 (bad) and index3. Also duplicate R and duplicate A? So that might be messy.

Better avoid duplicates until we know more.

Another word: ""PARTY"" as before: P at0, A at1, R at2, T at3, Y at4.

A is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.
R is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.

Similarly, ""RASP?"" Wait, ""RASP"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: 
P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)

But A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.

""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.

I think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.

But let me note: we also have the letter S that we haven't tested. In ""PARTS"", we have P, A, R, T, S. Similarly, ""PARTY"" has Y.

We also haven't tried any vowels? We have A (which is a vowel) but we need to check other vowels because the word might have one of I, O, U.

So maybe a word like ""RADIO""? But ""RADIO"": 
R A D I O
- R at index0: new (so okay, since we had R at index1 before)
- But A at index1: that's a new position? And previously we had A at index2? So index1 is a new position -> okay.
However, we have D, I, O that are new.

But note: we don't have feedback about these positions. Also, ""RADIO"" has R at index0: that might be a valid position? But we don't know if it will be correct.

Another word: ""ORBIT"" -> O R B I T.
A is missing? But we know the word has A because of the first guess. So we must include A? Otherwise we are missing a required letter.

We know the word must contain R and A. So we have to include both.

So words without A are invalid? Yes, we must include R and A.

Therefore, we need a word that includes R and A (and avoids C, N, E).

Let me consider words starting with A? For example, ""ADAPT"" -> but has D, P, T? 
A at index0 -> okay (not index2)
D, P, T are new.

But R? Where is R? Not present in ""ADAPT"". So not containing R -> invalid.

Similarly, must have R.

Let me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that's a new position.

So ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: 
- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay
- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don't know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.

But in the feedback we don't have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.

But note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That's all.

So R at0: okay. A at1: we don't have information that it's wrong? So we can try.

""RAILS"": 
R(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)

But A at index1: we don't know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.

However, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).

In ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.

Also, the word has I, L, S which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.

Same as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.

To cover more common letters, perhaps ""TRAIN"" or ""TRAIT"" (but duplicates?).

""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> but we have A at index2? Not allowed because we cannot put A at index2. So invalid.

We need to avoid index2 for A.

What about ""TARES""? T A R E S -> but E is disallowed! Because we got E marked as x in first guess? So we must avoid E.

So ""TARES"" is invalid.

Similarly, words with C, N, E are invalid.

So ""PARTY"" seems good.

Alternative: ""CARES"" -> has C and E? we know C and E are not in the word -> invalid.

Another alternative: ""MOIST"" -> but no R and A? invalid.

""PARTS"": P A R T S -> unique letters, P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4). And avoids index2 for A and index1 for R? R at index2: which we haven't tried? And A at index1: which is not index2 -> okay.

Similarly, ""PARTS"" is as good as ""PARTY"". But ""PARTY"" is a word.

I think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".

Summary for guess2: ""PARTY""

We hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.

So, my guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- Letters C, N, E are not in the secret word (marked x).
- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (marked -).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A to probe their correct positions (avoiding positions where they are invalid: R cannot be at index 1, A cannot be at index 2).
- Must exclude C, N, E.
- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids duplicate letters for maximum information gain.

The word ""party"":
- Places R at index 2 (new position from R's previous index 1).
- Places A at index 1 (new position from A's previous index 2).
- Introduces P, T, Y (new letters to test).
- No repeated letters.

<guess>party</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct, at position 4)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, and Y.
   - A is at position 1 (index 1).
   - R is at position 2 (index 2).
   - Y is at position 4 (index 4).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T.

3. The word structure so far: 
   - Position 0: unknown (but not C, N, E, P, T, and also not A, R, Y because they are fixed elsewhere)
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 2: R
   - Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 0)
   - Position 4: Y

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter3] Y

Constraints on letter1 and letter3:
- They cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.
- Also, they must be letters that are in the word, but we don't know which ones yet.

We have only two unknown positions: index 0 and index 3.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word directly if we can think of one.

But note: we have not tested many letters. We know the word must have exactly these letters: A, R, Y, and two more letters that are not C, N, E, P, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tried: like S, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

But we also have to form a valid English word.

Let me think of words that match the pattern _ A R _ Y.

Common words:
- DAIRY: D at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- FAIRY: F at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- HAIRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.
- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4? But ""MARRY"" has two R's? The pattern is _ A R _ Y, so if we put R at 3, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, but it's possible.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 and it was present, and in the second guess R at position 2 is correct. So if the word had two R's, that would be possible? But in ""party"", R at position 2 is correct, so if there is another R, it would have been indicated? Actually, in ""party"", we only have one R. The feedback for ""party"" shows R at position 2 is correct, but if the word had another R, we wouldn't know because we didn't have a guess with R in another position? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""party"", we guessed R only at position 2, so if the word has another R, we wouldn't have feedback for it. So duplicates are possible.

But let's check the pattern: the word must have A at 1, R at 2, Y at 4, and two other letters.

Now, for the word ""MARRY"": it would be M, A, R, R, Y -> but that's 5 letters: positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y. But we have R at position 2 and position 3? Then in the first guess, when we had ""crane"" with R at position 1, it would have been marked as present (which it was) but we don't know if there are two R's. Similarly, in ""party"", we only have one R, so if the word has two R's, the feedback for the R at position 2 would still be correct, and we wouldn't know about the other R.

But we don't have evidence for or against duplicates. So we must consider both.

However, to be safe, we can first try a word without duplicates.

Let me list possible words that fit _ A R _ Y and avoid the excluded letters (C, N, E, P, T).

Possible letters for position 0 and 3: any letter except A, R, Y (because they are fixed) and except C, N, E, P, T.

Note: A, R, Y are already in the word at fixed positions, so they can appear again? But we don't know. For now, let's assume they don't, to avoid complexity.

Common words:
- DAIRY: D and I are not excluded? D is not in the excluded list (C, N, E, P, T). I is also not excluded. So ""DAIRY"" is a candidate.
- FAIRY: F and I -> F is not excluded, I is not excluded.
- HAIRY: H and I.
- LAIRY: L and I? ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means something, but less common.
- MAIRY: not common.
- WAIRY: not common.
- BAIRY: not common.

Also, words with O: like OARY? Not a word. Or with U: like ... ""CARNY"" but C is excluded.

Another: ""HARPY"" -> but H and P? P is excluded (from ""party"" feedback: P is not in the word). So ""HARPY"" has P? H A R P Y -> P at position 3? But P is excluded, so invalid.

Similarly, ""TARPY"" -> T is excluded.

So let's list:

- DAIRY: D, A, R, I, Y -> D and I are new.
- FAIRY: F, A, R, I, Y -> F and I.
- HAIRY: H, A, R, I, Y -> H and I.
- Also, ""WARLY"" -> W, A, R, L, Y -> W and L? ""WARLY"" is an adjective meaning watchful? Not very common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y -> but then position 3 is R. We haven't tested R at position 3? And we know R is in the word at position 2, but if there is another R, it's possible. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R, which is the same as position 2. But we don't know if that's allowed.

Similarly, ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is excluded? From first guess, N is not in the word. So invalid.

""JARRY"": J, A, R, R, Y? But J and duplicate R.

But J is not excluded? We haven't tested J.

But let's stick to non-duplicates for now.

We have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY.

We need to choose one to guess. We can also think of other words.

Another common word: ""DAIRY"" and ""FAIRY"" are both common.

But note: we have not tested D, F, H, I, L, etc.

We can choose a word that uses a common letter to get more information? But we only have two positions left, and we are guessing the entire word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has new letters to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.

Since we have A, R, Y fixed, and two unknowns, we can try to guess one of these words.

But we have to make a guess. Let's pick ""DAIRY"" because it's common.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn't conflict.

Similarly, R at position 2 is correct.

Now, if we guess ""DAIRY"", we are testing D at 0 and I at 3.

If it's not correct, we get feedback on D and I.

But we have only 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 4 more tries including this one.

But we might solve it.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have I, but has other letters? For example, ""HARMY"" -> not a word? Or ""BARMY"" -> B and M? But ""BARMY"" is a word? Meaning crazy. But B and M are not excluded.

But pattern: B A R M Y -> positions: 0:B, 1:A, 2:R, 3:M, 4:Y.

But we don't know if M is in the word.

Similarly, ""WARAY"" not a word.

""CARVY"" not a word.

So back to the common ones.

I think ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"" are the main ones.

Also, ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means of or relating to a lair, but rare.

""MAYRY"" not a word.

""NAIRY"" not a word.

So let's choose ""DAIRY"".

But we can also consider: we have Y at the end, so the word is likely to be an adjective or noun ending with Y.

Another word: ""GAWKY"" -> but G A W K Y? Then position 1 is A? But we have A at position 1, so it would be G A W K Y -> but then position 2 is W, but we need R at position 2? So no, because position 2 must be R.

So the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ Y

So only the first and third positions are free.

Therefore, we must have a word that starts with a letter and has a letter at the third position.

Given that, let's list all possible common words:

- DAIRY
- FAIRY
- HAIRY
- JAWKY? Not a word.
- KARZY? Not a word.
- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K at position 3? ""LARKY"" is a word? Meaning mischievous? Not common.
- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R, but common.
- NARCO? Not matching pattern.

So the most common are DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, and MARRY.

But MARRY has duplicate R, so if we guess MARRY and it's wrong, we might not get information about the third letter because it's R again.

So better to guess one without duplicates.

Among DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, which one to choose?

We can choose based on commonality or to test more common letters.

But we don't have information about D, F, H, I.

I is common, so if we guess a word with I, we test I.

Similarly, D, F, H are less common? But we need to test.

But we are guessing the entire word, so if it's not correct, we get feedback on the two new letters.

For example, if we guess ""DAIRY"" and it's wrong, we might get:
- If D is in the word, and if it's at position 0, then D would be correct? Or if not, then we get feedback.

But the word might be ""FAIRY"" or ""HAIRY"", so we can try.

To be systematic, we can choose the most common word: ""DAIRY"" is common.

But let me check: ""FAIRY"" is also very common.

Perhaps we can look for a word that uses a letter we haven't tried that is very common, like S? But is there a word ""SARY""? No, not 5 letters.

""SARAY"" not a word.

""SAIRY"" not a word.

""SHIRY"" not a word.

So no word with S? What about ""STARY""? But T is excluded? ""STARY"" has T? S T A R Y -> but T is at position 1? No: positions: 0:S, 1:T, 2:A? But we need position 1 to be A and 2 to be R. So ""STARY"" is S T A R Y -> position 1 is T, but we need A at position 1? So not matching.

Similarly, ""SCARY"" has C and A at position 2? Not matching.

So no common word with S.

Similarly, L: ""LARDY"" -> L A R D Y -> D at position 3? ""LARDY"" is a word? Meaning fat? But then we have D at position 3 and L at 0. But we can consider.

""LARDY"": L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But D is at position 3? And we have D at 0? No, L at 0, D at 3.

But we have two D's? No, ""LARDY"" has one D.

Similarly, ""LARKY"" as before.

But ""LARDY"" is less common.

Similarly, M: ""MARRY"" or ""MARDY"" -> M A R D Y? ""MARDY"" is a word? Meaning spoiled? Not common.

So I think DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY are the top candidates.

I'll go with ""dairy"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn't affect.

Similarly, no conflict.

So let's guess ""dairy"".

But we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a vowel for the third position? Like I or O? But O: ""OARY"" not a word.

U: ""UNARY"" has U and N? N is excluded.

So I is the most common.

Therefore, I choose ""dairy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - This indicates that R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed), and C, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), Y(✓)  
  - This confirms that:
    - A is correct and in position 1 (1st index).
    - R is correct and in position 2 (2nd index).
    - Y is correct and in position 4 (4th index).
    - P and T are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[letter] A R [letter] Y` (positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Known correct letters: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, E, P, T (from feedback).
- The unknown positions are:
  - Position 0: Must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, or Y (since they are fixed elsewhere, but duplicates are possible).
  - Position 3: Same constraints as position 0.
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""dairy"", ""fairy"", ""hairy"", ""marry"", etc. (avoiding excluded letters).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test the unknown positions (0 and 3) with common letters not yet tested (e.g., D, F, H, I, L, M).
- ""Dairy"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests D at position 0 and I at position 3. If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on D and I (e.g., if they are in the word and their positions).
- This guess could solve the puzzle if correct, or narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Guess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (still correct at position 1)
- I: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (still correct at position 2)
- Y: ✓ (still correct at position 4)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the fixed letters:  
   - Position 1: A  
   - Position 2: R  
   - Position 4: Y

2. So the pattern is: [unknown0] A R [unknown3] Y

3. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):  
   - C (from guess1), N (from guess1), E (from guess1), P (from guess2), T (from guess2), D (from guess3), I (from guess3)

4. Also, from guess1, we know:
   - R was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 1 (and now we know it's at position 2, so that matches).  
   - A was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 2 (and now we know it's at position 1, so that matches).

Now, the unknown positions are 0 and 3. We need to fill them with letters that are not excluded.  

Possible letters: any letter not in {A, R, Y} (though duplicates are possible, but unlikely) and must avoid {C, N, E, P, T, D, I}.

Since we don't have any indication of duplicates, we continue with the assumption of no duplicates. Thus, positions 0 and 3 should be letters not among A, R, Y, and not excluded.

Excluded set: C, N, E, P, T, D, I

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ Y

Possible words:  
- FAIRY? But I is excluded. ""FAIRY"" has I at position 3 -> I is already excluded (from guess3: I(x)), so not possible.  
- HAIRY? Similarly, has I -> excluded.  
- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R? But R is already fixed at position 2. Position 3 would be R. Since R is allowed to reappear?  
  However, in ""dairy"", we didn't have a second R, and feedback didn't indicate any. But the secret word could have a second R?  
  We need to consider that possibility.  
- Other words: BARMY? Not common, means eccentric.  
HARDY? H A R D Y -> but D is excluded.  
LACKY -> contains C (excluded) and K? Pattern doesn't fit.  

Let's list systematically:

- Words ending in Y: e.g., 
  - ...ARY: not possible because position 1 is A and 2 is R, so we have AR at 1 and 2.  
  - Instead, we have AR followed by something Y.

Common words:
- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4 -> duplicate R. Possible.
- FARRY? Not a word.
- HARRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R? But ""HARRY"" is H A R R Y? No, ""HARRY"" is typically 5 letters? H-A-R-R-Y? Yes, positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y? But that's two R's. ""HARRY"" has two R's? No, in standard spelling, ""harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y? Actually, it's spelled H-A-R-R-Y? Let me confirm: ""Harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y, so if we take ""HARRY"" (without capitalization), it has two R's: indices 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R? No: 
- The word ""harry"" is 5 letters: H-A-R-R-Y -> positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> so two R's.

Similarly:
- JARRY: J A R R Y? Duplicate R? Not common.
- PARRY: P is excluded? P(x) from guess2, so P not in word. ""Parry"" has P -> invalid.
- TARRY: T is excluded -> invalid.
- WARRY: W A R R Y? Duplicate R.
- CARVY: C excluded? Yes.

Words without duplicate R:
- BAWLY? Not a word.
- GAWKY? But position 4 is Y, and we have G A W K Y -> positions 0:G, 1:A, 2:R must be? But we have W at 2? No, pattern requires position 2 is R, so the third character must be R.

The pattern must be [some letter] A R [some letter] Y

So the only common words I can think of with no excluded letters and no duplicates (beside possible R duplicate) are:

- MARRY: with R at position 3.
- HARRY: H A R R Y -> again duplicate R.

Other words without duplicate R:

- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K not excluded? L(0), A(1), R(2), K(3), Y(4). So K is new? And L new.

""Larky"" is a word? Meaning playful or mischievous. Acceptable.

- Similarly, ""MARVY"": M A R V Y -> V at position 3? Marvy means excellent? Slang? Less common.

""HARDY"" -> but D excluded.

""FARM Y"" -> not a word? ""FARM"" is 4 letters.

""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but T excluded.

""BARNY"" -> N excluded.

So possibilities:
- MARRY (with duplicate R): positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> but we have duplicate R? So if this is the word, then feedback for previous guesses:

In ""crane"", R was at position 1 which is not correct? But since there is an R at position 2, it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. So possible.

In ""party"", R was at position 2 which is correct. So no indication of the second R because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, ""dairy"" didn't have R at position 3.

- LARKY: L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, K at 3, Y at 4.

- HAIRY: but I excluded, so not possible.

Given that, we have to choose between ""MARRY"" and ""LARKY"".

To test, we can guess either. But note that we need to form a valid word.

Another word: ""CARBY"" -> C excluded? No.

""JARLY"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""MARRY"" is more common.

But let's consider the feedback: in guess1, A was at position 2 and wrong? But in the secret word, if it's ""MARRY"", A is at position 1? Correct? But position 2 is R. So in guess1, we had A at position 2 and the secret word has R at position 2? So then A was not at position 2? And since the secret word has A at position 1, then A should have been marked as ""-"" because it was in the word but not at position 2? That matches.

Similarly, no conflict.

But we thought of ""MARRY"" with duplicate R. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R? So in the feedback for ""dairy"", we had I at position 3 and it was x? That is consistent because I is not in the word.

But to guess, we have two options: ""MARRY"" or ""LARKY"".

Since we haven't tested many letters, we can use a guess that also tests new letters? But we are forced into the pattern.

Alternatively, we can guess ""marry"" to test the duplicate R theory.

If we guess ""marry"":
- If correct, we win.
- If incorrect, we get feedback on M and possibly the third position? But in ""marry"", position 0 is M and position 3 is R (duplicate).

If position 0 is M and it's correct or wrong? And position 3 is R: since R is already known, if it is at this position correctly? Or if there is no duplicate, then R would be marked wrong at position 3? But R is in the word, so it would be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if it is the correct position? But we don't know.

But likely, if the secret word is ""LARKY"", then we get feedback for ""marry"" as M(x), A(✓), R(✓), R(x) if R is not at position 3? But R is in the word at position 2, so a second R at position 3 being wrong? Maybe ""-"" because the letter R is in the word but not at position 3? But there is already one R placed correctly? So for duplicate, it depends on whether there are two R's and if we guess correctly.

To avoid confusion, we can guess ""larky"" instead? But it's less common.

Since ""MARRY"" is a common word and matches, we can try that.

Also, note: in the first guess, we had a ""-"" for R at position 1: now R is at position 2? So if there were another R, the ""-"" in guess1 would still stand? Yes.

Similarly, no issue.

Thus, I'll guess ""marry"".

But note: excluded letters? M is not excluded.

So guess ""marry"".Based on the previous feedback, we have:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A R _ Y`  
- **Fixed letters**: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  
- **Possible candidates**: Only a few words fit the pattern while avoiding excluded letters, such as ""marry"" (with duplicate R) or ""larky"" (with K and L).

After evaluating:
- ""Marry"" is a common word that fits the pattern `M A R R Y`, testing:
  - M at position 0 (new letter).
  - Duplicate R at position 3 (since R is already confirmed at position 2).
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback will clarify if M is present and whether a duplicate R is allowed at position 3.

<guess>marry</guess>After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed).  
   - C, N, E are not in the word.  

2. **Guess 2 (""party"")**:  
   - A, R, Y are confirmed correct at positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.  
   - P and T are not in the word.  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ A R _ Y`.  

3. **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**:  
   - D and I are not in the word.  
   - A, R, Y remain correct at their positions.  
   - No new letters added beyond exclusions.  

### Deductions:
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  
- **Pattern**: `[?] A R [?] Y` (positions 0 and 3 unknown).  
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Likely candidates**:  
  - ""Marry"" (M A R R Y): Tests M at position 0 and a potential duplicate R at position 3.  
  - ""Larky"" (L A R K Y): Tests L at position 0 and K at position 3.  
- ""Marry"" is a common word and fits the pattern. Guessing it tests the duplicate R scenario and M efficiently.

### Next Guess:  
Chose ""marry"" to resolve the pattern directly. If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on M/R duplication will narrow options significantly.

Since ""crane"" has R at position 2 and A at position 3, the secret word has R and A, but not at index 1 (since positions are 0-indexed: C=0, R=1, A=2, N=3, E=4) or index 2? Actually, let me note:\n Position 0: C -> x\n Position 1: R -> - (so R is in the word but not at position 1)\n Position 2: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 2)\n Position 3: N -> x\n Position 4: E -> x\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Letters: R and A (at least one occurrence each)\n- Does not have: C, N, E (since marked x)\n\nWe also know the word does not have C, N, or E.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Is 5 letters, English word.\n- Does not contain C, N, E (to avoid wasted letters).\n- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, R cannot be at position 1, and A cannot be at position 2. But they could be anywhere else.\n\nWe also want to try to place other common consonants to get more information.\n\nLet me think about possible words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nCommon letters to try: we might include other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, L, etc.).\n\nOne idea: start with words that have R and A in different positions.\n\nPossible word: ""ROAST"" -> but E is not allowed? Wait, we must avoid E? Actually, we know E is not in the word, so we should avoid E. ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T, and R. But let\'s check:\n- R: we have R, but we must not put R at position 1? Actually in ""ROAST"", R is at position 0. That might be okay because in the first guess R was at position 1 so it could be at 0. Also A is at position 2? But our feedback says A cannot be at position 2. So if I put A in ""ROAST"" at position 2, that would be the same position? Then we know that position 2 cannot be A.\n\nWait, the feedback for A was at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A cannot be at index 2. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at index 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROAST"" has A at index 2? Actually: \nR O A S T -> index:0:R, 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T. \nBut we cannot have A at index 2 because that was the same position and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nSo we need a word with R and A, but R not at index 1 and A not at index 2.\n\nAlso, avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and A, and put A in a different position.\n\nPossible words:\n- Try ""PARTY"": \n  P A R T Y\n  A is at index 1 -> okay? Yes, because previously A was at index 2 and now it\'s at 1 so different.\n  R is at index 2 -> we don\'t know yet if that\'s allowed? Previously it was at index 1 and was wrong. So we have R at a new position.\n\nBut what about the R? Previously, R was in the word but not at index 1. So R can be at index 2? Yes, because we don\'t know where it is exactly.\n\nSo ""PARTY"": \n- R at index 2: which is new (was 1 before) -> okay.\n- A at index 1: which is new (was 2 before) -> okay.\n\nHowever, note that we have two new letters: P, T, Y. We don\'t know about them.\n\nAnother possibility: ""RADAR"" -> but has R at index 0 and index 3? But R is present, and A is at index 1 and index 3? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We don\'t have information that the word has duplicates. Sometimes words have repeated letters, but we have to consider that. However, starting with a word without duplicates might be better.\n\nWe don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. So ideally we choose a word without repeated letters to maximize information.\n\n""PARTY"" has unique letters: P, A, R, T, Y.\n\nSimilarly, another idea: ""TRAIL"" -> but L is new? Also, A is at index 2? Oh, we cannot put A at index 2 because that was the wrong position in the first guess. So we must avoid index 2 for A.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> A is at index 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that avoid position 2 for A and position 1 for R? Actually, we only know from the feedback that R cannot be at position 1 and A cannot be at position 2. They can be elsewhere.\n\nSome options:\n\n- ""ARRAY"": A at index0, R at index1? -> But we have R at index1: wait, the feedback said R at index1 was present but wrong position. So if R were at index1 again, it would still be wrong? Actually, the feedback only tells us about that particular guess. But we already know R cannot be at index1 because we had it there and it wasn\'t correct. So we should avoid putting R at index1 again because we know it\'s wrong. Similarly for A at index2.\n\nSo ""ARRAY"": has A at index0 (new) and index2 (but we avoid index2 for A). Also, R at index1 (bad) and index3. Also duplicate R and duplicate A? So that might be messy.\n\nBetter avoid duplicates until we know more.\n\nAnother word: ""PARTY"" as before: P at0, A at1, R at2, T at3, Y at4.\n\nA is at index1 (good, not 2) -> okay.\nR is at index2 (was at index1 before, so new) -> okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""RASP?"" Wait, ""RASP"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.\n\n""PARTS"": P A R T S -> A at index1? Same as above? Yes: \nP(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4)\n\nBut A is at index1, which is different from index2? Correct.\n\n""PARTS"" and ""PARTY"" are both options.\n\nI think ""PARTY"" is a common word? Actually, ""PARTS"" is equally good.\n\nBut let me note: we also have the letter S that we haven\'t tested. In ""PARTS"", we have P, A, R, T, S. Similarly, ""PARTY"" has Y.\n\nWe also haven\'t tried any vowels? We have A (which is a vowel) but we need to check other vowels because the word might have one of I, O, U.\n\nSo maybe a word like ""RADIO""? But ""RADIO"": \nR A D I O\n- R at index0: new (so okay, since we had R at index1 before)\n- But A at index1: that\'s a new position? And previously we had A at index2? So index1 is a new position -> okay.\nHowever, we have D, I, O that are new.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have feedback about these positions. Also, ""RADIO"" has R at index0: that might be a valid position? But we don\'t know if it will be correct.\n\nAnother word: ""ORBIT"" -> O R B I T.\nA is missing? But we know the word has A because of the first guess. So we must include A? Otherwise we are missing a required letter.\n\nWe know the word must contain R and A. So we have to include both.\n\nSo words without A are invalid? Yes, we must include R and A.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that includes R and A (and avoids C, N, E).\n\nLet me consider words starting with A? For example, ""ADAPT"" -> but has D, P, T? \nA at index0 -> okay (not index2)\nD, P, T are new.\n\nBut R? Where is R? Not present in ""ADAPT"". So not containing R -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, must have R.\n\nLet me look for words starting with R? But we must avoid R at index1? Actually, we can try R at index0? Because that\'s a new position.\n\nSo ""RAILS"": R A I L S -> R at0, A at1: \n- R at0: new (was 1 before) -> okay\n- A at1: new (was 2 before) -> okay? But wait, position1 for A? Previously we only know that A cannot be at index2. We don\'t know about index1? It could be correct or wrong.\n\nBut in the feedback we don\'t have any information about index1 for the secret word? So we can try.\n\nBut note: in first guess, R was at index1 and it was wrong. And A at index2 was wrong. That\'s all.\n\nSo R at0: okay. A at1: we don\'t have information that it\'s wrong? So we can try.\n\n""RAILS"": \nR(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)\n\nBut A at index1: we don\'t know if that can be the right position? And we are going to test it.\n\nHowever, we can also consider: if A was at index2 in the first guess and was present but in a different position, then in the secret word A is at index0,1,3, or4 (any except2). Similarly R is at index0,2,3,4 (except1).\n\nIn ""RAILS"", A is at index1 -> allowed, and R at index0 -> allowed.\n\nAlso, the word has I, L, S which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAnother word: ""RAPID"": R at0, A at1, P at2, I at3, D at4.\n\nSame as above? We miss having T or another common consonant.\n\nTo cover more common letters, perhaps ""TRAIN"" or ""TRAIT"" (but duplicates?).\n\n""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> but we have A at index2? Not allowed because we cannot put A at index2. So invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid index2 for A.\n\nWhat about ""TARES""? T A R E S -> but E is disallowed! Because we got E marked as x in first guess? So we must avoid E.\n\nSo ""TARES"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, words with C, N, E are invalid.\n\nSo ""PARTY"" seems good.\n\nAlternative: ""CARES"" -> has C and E? we know C and E are not in the word -> invalid.\n\nAnother alternative: ""MOIST"" -> but no R and A? invalid.\n\n""PARTS"": P A R T S -> unique letters, P(0), A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4). And avoids index2 for A and index1 for R? R at index2: which we haven\'t tried? And A at index1: which is not index2 -> okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARTS"" is as good as ""PARTY"". But ""PARTY"" is a word.\n\nI think ""PARTY"" is common. Let me choose ""PARTY"".\n\nSummary for guess2: ""PARTY""\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us about the positions of R and A and the new letters P, T, Y.\n\nSo, my guess is ""party"".\n\n<guess>party</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":\n- Letters C, N, E are not in the secret word (marked x).\n- Letters R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (marked -).\n\nFor my next guess:\n- Must include R and A to probe their correct positions (avoiding positions where they are invalid: R cannot be at index 1, A cannot be at index 2).\n- Must exclude C, N, E.\n- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n- Avoids duplicate letters for maximum information gain.\n\nThe word ""party"":\n- Places R at index 2 (new position from R\'s previous index 1).\n- Places A at index 1 (new position from A\'s previous index 2).\n- Introduces P, T, Y (new letters to test).\n- No repeated letters.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)\n- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, at position 1)\n- R: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- Y: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word has the letters A, R, and Y.\n   - A is at position 1 (index 1).\n   - R is at position 2 (index 2).\n   - Y is at position 4 (index 4).\n\n2. The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T.\n\n3. The word structure so far: \n   - Position 0: unknown (but not C, N, E, P, T, and also not A, R, Y because they are fixed elsewhere)\n   - Position 1: A\n   - Position 2: R\n   - Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 0)\n   - Position 4: Y\n\nSo the word is: _ A R _ Y\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter3] Y\n\nConstraints on letter1 and letter3:\n- They cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.\n- Also, they must be letters that are in the word, but we don\'t know which ones yet.\n\nWe have only two unknown positions: index 0 and index 3.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word directly if we can think of one.\n\nBut note: we have not tested many letters. We know the word must have exactly these letters: A, R, Y, and two more letters that are not C, N, E, P, T.\n\nWe should consider common letters that haven\'t been tried: like S, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nBut we also have to form a valid English word.\n\nLet me think of words that match the pattern _ A R _ Y.\n\nCommon words:\n- DAIRY: D at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.\n- FAIRY: F at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.\n- HAIRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, Y at 4.\n- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4? But ""MARRY"" has two R\'s? The pattern is _ A R _ Y, so if we put R at 3, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any duplicate, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 and it was present, and in the second guess R at position 2 is correct. So if the word had two R\'s, that would be possible? But in ""party"", R at position 2 is correct, so if there is another R, it would have been indicated? Actually, in ""party"", we only have one R. The feedback for ""party"" shows R at position 2 is correct, but if the word had another R, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t have a guess with R in another position? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\nIn ""party"", we guessed R only at position 2, so if the word has another R, we wouldn\'t have feedback for it. So duplicates are possible.\n\nBut let\'s check the pattern: the word must have A at 1, R at 2, Y at 4, and two other letters.\n\nNow, for the word ""MARRY"": it would be M, A, R, R, Y -> but that\'s 5 letters: positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y. But we have R at position 2 and position 3? Then in the first guess, when we had ""crane"" with R at position 1, it would have been marked as present (which it was) but we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. Similarly, in ""party"", we only have one R, so if the word has two R\'s, the feedback for the R at position 2 would still be correct, and we wouldn\'t know about the other R.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence for or against duplicates. So we must consider both.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can first try a word without duplicates.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit _ A R _ Y and avoid the excluded letters (C, N, E, P, T).\n\nPossible letters for position 0 and 3: any letter except A, R, Y (because they are fixed) and except C, N, E, P, T.\n\nNote: A, R, Y are already in the word at fixed positions, so they can appear again? But we don\'t know. For now, let\'s assume they don\'t, to avoid complexity.\n\nCommon words:\n- DAIRY: D and I are not excluded? D is not in the excluded list (C, N, E, P, T). I is also not excluded. So ""DAIRY"" is a candidate.\n- FAIRY: F and I -> F is not excluded, I is not excluded.\n- HAIRY: H and I.\n- LAIRY: L and I? ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means something, but less common.\n- MAIRY: not common.\n- WAIRY: not common.\n- BAIRY: not common.\n\nAlso, words with O: like OARY? Not a word. Or with U: like ... ""CARNY"" but C is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""HARPY"" -> but H and P? P is excluded (from ""party"" feedback: P is not in the word). So ""HARPY"" has P? H A R P Y -> P at position 3? But P is excluded, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TARPY"" -> T is excluded.\n\nSo let\'s list:\n\n- DAIRY: D, A, R, I, Y -> D and I are new.\n- FAIRY: F, A, R, I, Y -> F and I.\n- HAIRY: H, A, R, I, Y -> H and I.\n- Also, ""WARLY"" -> W, A, R, L, Y -> W and L? ""WARLY"" is an adjective meaning watchful? Not very common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y -> but then position 3 is R. We haven\'t tested R at position 3? And we know R is in the word at position 2, but if there is another R, it\'s possible. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R, which is the same as position 2. But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is excluded? From first guess, N is not in the word. So invalid.\n\n""JARRY"": J, A, R, R, Y? But J and duplicate R.\n\nBut J is not excluded? We haven\'t tested J.\n\nBut let\'s stick to non-duplicates for now.\n\nWe have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess. We can also think of other words.\n\nAnother common word: ""DAIRY"" and ""FAIRY"" are both common.\n\nBut note: we have not tested D, F, H, I, L, etc.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses a common letter to get more information? But we only have two positions left, and we are guessing the entire word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess a word that has new letters to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nSince we have A, R, Y fixed, and two unknowns, we can try to guess one of these words.\n\nBut we have to make a guess. Let\'s pick ""DAIRY"" because it\'s common.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn\'t conflict.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 2 is correct.\n\nNow, if we guess ""DAIRY"", we are testing D at 0 and I at 3.\n\nIf it\'s not correct, we get feedback on D and I.\n\nBut we have only 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 4 more tries including this one.\n\nBut we might solve it.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that doesn\'t necessarily have I, but has other letters? For example, ""HARMY"" -> not a word? Or ""BARMY"" -> B and M? But ""BARMY"" is a word? Meaning crazy. But B and M are not excluded.\n\nBut pattern: B A R M Y -> positions: 0:B, 1:A, 2:R, 3:M, 4:Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if M is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""WARAY"" not a word.\n\n""CARVY"" not a word.\n\nSo back to the common ones.\n\nI think ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"" are the main ones.\n\nAlso, ""LAIRY"" is a word? It means of or relating to a lair, but rare.\n\n""MAYRY"" not a word.\n\n""NAIRY"" not a word.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""DAIRY"".\n\nBut we can also consider: we have Y at the end, so the word is likely to be an adjective or noun ending with Y.\n\nAnother word: ""GAWKY"" -> but G A W K Y? Then position 1 is A? But we have A at position 1, so it would be G A W K Y -> but then position 2 is W, but we need R at position 2? So no, because position 2 must be R.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ Y\n\nSo only the first and third positions are free.\n\nTherefore, we must have a word that starts with a letter and has a letter at the third position.\n\nGiven that, let\'s list all possible common words:\n\n- DAIRY\n- FAIRY\n- HAIRY\n- JAWKY? Not a word.\n- KARZY? Not a word.\n- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K at position 3? ""LARKY"" is a word? Meaning mischievous? Not common.\n- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R, but common.\n- NARCO? Not matching pattern.\n\nSo the most common are DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, and MARRY.\n\nBut MARRY has duplicate R, so if we guess MARRY and it\'s wrong, we might not get information about the third letter because it\'s R again.\n\nSo better to guess one without duplicates.\n\nAmong DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY, which one to choose?\n\nWe can choose based on commonality or to test more common letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have information about D, F, H, I.\n\nI is common, so if we guess a word with I, we test I.\n\nSimilarly, D, F, H are less common? But we need to test.\n\nBut we are guessing the entire word, so if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on the two new letters.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""DAIRY"" and it\'s wrong, we might get:\n- If D is in the word, and if it\'s at position 0, then D would be correct? Or if not, then we get feedback.\n\nBut the word might be ""FAIRY"" or ""HAIRY"", so we can try.\n\nTo be systematic, we can choose the most common word: ""DAIRY"" is common.\n\nBut let me check: ""FAIRY"" is also very common.\n\nPerhaps we can look for a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried that is very common, like S? But is there a word ""SARY""? No, not 5 letters.\n\n""SARAY"" not a word.\n\n""SAIRY"" not a word.\n\n""SHIRY"" not a word.\n\nSo no word with S? What about ""STARY""? But T is excluded? ""STARY"" has T? S T A R Y -> but T is at position 1? No: positions: 0:S, 1:T, 2:A? But we need position 1 to be A and 2 to be R. So ""STARY"" is S T A R Y -> position 1 is T, but we need A at position 1? So not matching.\n\nSimilarly, ""SCARY"" has C and A at position 2? Not matching.\n\nSo no common word with S.\n\nSimilarly, L: ""LARDY"" -> L A R D Y -> D at position 3? ""LARDY"" is a word? Meaning fat? But then we have D at position 3 and L at 0. But we can consider.\n\n""LARDY"": L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.\n\nBut D is at position 3? And we have D at 0? No, L at 0, D at 3.\n\nBut we have two D\'s? No, ""LARDY"" has one D.\n\nSimilarly, ""LARKY"" as before.\n\nBut ""LARDY"" is less common.\n\nSimilarly, M: ""MARRY"" or ""MARDY"" -> M A R D Y? ""MARDY"" is a word? Meaning spoiled? Not common.\n\nSo I think DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY are the top candidates.\n\nI\'ll go with ""dairy"".\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 1, which is correct. So that doesn\'t affect.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""dairy"".\n\nBut we have to output in the format.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a vowel for the third position? Like I or O? But O: ""OARY"" not a word.\n\nU: ""UNARY"" has U and N? N is excluded.\n\nSo I is the most common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""dairy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - This indicates that R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed), and C, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2: ""party""** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), Y(✓)  \n  - This confirms that:\n    - A is correct and in position 1 (1st index).\n    - R is correct and in position 2 (2nd index).\n    - Y is correct and in position 4 (4th index).\n    - P and T are not in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `[letter] A R [letter] Y` (positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n- Known correct letters: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, N, E, P, T (from feedback).\n- The unknown positions are:\n  - Position 0: Must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, or Y (since they are fixed elsewhere, but duplicates are possible).\n  - Position 3: Same constraints as position 0.\n- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""dairy"", ""fairy"", ""hairy"", ""marry"", etc. (avoiding excluded letters).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- We need to test the unknown positions (0 and 3) with common letters not yet tested (e.g., D, F, H, I, L, M).\n- ""Dairy"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests D at position 0 and I at position 3. If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on D and I (e.g., if they are in the word and their positions).\n- This guess could solve the puzzle if correct, or narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>dairy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word, wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)\n- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)\n\nGuess 3: ""dairy""\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (still correct at position 1)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (still correct at position 2)\n- Y: ✓ (still correct at position 4)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word has the fixed letters:  \n   - Position 1: A  \n   - Position 2: R  \n   - Position 4: Y\n\n2. So the pattern is: [unknown0] A R [unknown3] Y\n\n3. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):  \n   - C (from guess1), N (from guess1), E (from guess1), P (from guess2), T (from guess2), D (from guess3), I (from guess3)\n\n4. Also, from guess1, we know:\n   - R was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 1 (and now we know it\'s at position 2, so that matches).  \n   - A was marked as ""-"" meaning it was in the word but not in position 2 (and now we know it\'s at position 1, so that matches).\n\nNow, the unknown positions are 0 and 3. We need to fill them with letters that are not excluded.  \n\nPossible letters: any letter not in {A, R, Y} (though duplicates are possible, but unlikely) and must avoid {C, N, E, P, T, D, I}.\n\nSince we don\'t have any indication of duplicates, we continue with the assumption of no duplicates. Thus, positions 0 and 3 should be letters not among A, R, Y, and not excluded.\n\nExcluded set: C, N, E, P, T, D, I\n\nRemaining common letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe need a 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ Y\n\nPossible words:  \n- FAIRY? But I is excluded. ""FAIRY"" has I at position 3 -> I is already excluded (from guess3: I(x)), so not possible.  \n- HAIRY? Similarly, has I -> excluded.  \n- MARRY: M A R R Y -> duplicate R? But R is already fixed at position 2. Position 3 would be R. Since R is allowed to reappear?  \n  However, in ""dairy"", we didn\'t have a second R, and feedback didn\'t indicate any. But the secret word could have a second R?  \n  We need to consider that possibility.  \n- Other words: BARMY? Not common, means eccentric.  \nHARDY? H A R D Y -> but D is excluded.  \nLACKY -> contains C (excluded) and K? Pattern doesn\'t fit.  \n\nLet\'s list systematically:\n\n- Words ending in Y: e.g., \n  - ...ARY: not possible because position 1 is A and 2 is R, so we have AR at 1 and 2.  \n  - Instead, we have AR followed by something Y.\n\nCommon words:\n- MARRY: M at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R at 3, Y at 4 -> duplicate R. Possible.\n- FARRY? Not a word.\n- HARRY: H at 0, A at 1, R at 2, R? But ""HARRY"" is H A R R Y? No, ""HARRY"" is typically 5 letters? H-A-R-R-Y? Yes, positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y? But that\'s two R\'s. ""HARRY"" has two R\'s? No, in standard spelling, ""harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y? Actually, it\'s spelled H-A-R-R-Y? Let me confirm: ""Harry"" is H-A-R-R-Y, so if we take ""HARRY"" (without capitalization), it has two R\'s: indices 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R? No: \n- The word ""harry"" is 5 letters: H-A-R-R-Y -> positions: 0:H, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> so two R\'s.\n\nSimilarly:\n- JARRY: J A R R Y? Duplicate R? Not common.\n- PARRY: P is excluded? P(x) from guess2, so P not in word. ""Parry"" has P -> invalid.\n- TARRY: T is excluded -> invalid.\n- WARRY: W A R R Y? Duplicate R.\n- CARVY: C excluded? Yes.\n\nWords without duplicate R:\n- BAWLY? Not a word.\n- GAWKY? But position 4 is Y, and we have G A W K Y -> positions 0:G, 1:A, 2:R must be? But we have W at 2? No, pattern requires position 2 is R, so the third character must be R.\n\nThe pattern must be [some letter] A R [some letter] Y\n\nSo the only common words I can think of with no excluded letters and no duplicates (beside possible R duplicate) are:\n\n- MARRY: with R at position 3.\n- HARRY: H A R R Y -> again duplicate R.\n\nOther words without duplicate R:\n\n- LARKY: L A R K Y -> K not excluded? L(0), A(1), R(2), K(3), Y(4). So K is new? And L new.\n\n""Larky"" is a word? Meaning playful or mischievous. Acceptable.\n\n- Similarly, ""MARVY"": M A R V Y -> V at position 3? Marvy means excellent? Slang? Less common.\n\n""HARDY"" -> but D excluded.\n\n""FARM Y"" -> not a word? ""FARM"" is 4 letters.\n\n""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but T excluded.\n\n""BARNY"" -> N excluded.\n\nSo possibilities:\n- MARRY (with duplicate R): positions 0:M, 1:A, 2:R, 3:R, 4:Y -> but we have duplicate R? So if this is the word, then feedback for previous guesses:\n\nIn ""crane"", R was at position 1 which is not correct? But since there is an R at position 2, it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. So possible.\n\nIn ""party"", R was at position 2 which is correct. So no indication of the second R because we didn\'t guess it.\n\nSimilarly, ""dairy"" didn\'t have R at position 3.\n\n- LARKY: L at 0, A at 1, R at 2, K at 3, Y at 4.\n\n- HAIRY: but I excluded, so not possible.\n\nGiven that, we have to choose between ""MARRY"" and ""LARKY"".\n\nTo test, we can guess either. But note that we need to form a valid word.\n\nAnother word: ""CARBY"" -> C excluded? No.\n\n""JARLY"" -> not common.\n\nPerhaps ""MARRY"" is more common.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback: in guess1, A was at position 2 and wrong? But in the secret word, if it\'s ""MARRY"", A is at position 1? Correct? But position 2 is R. So in guess1, we had A at position 2 and the secret word has R at position 2? So then A was not at position 2? And since the secret word has A at position 1, then A should have been marked as ""-"" because it was in the word but not at position 2? That matches.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nBut we thought of ""MARRY"" with duplicate R. However, in ""MARRY"", the letter at position 3 is R? So in the feedback for ""dairy"", we had I at position 3 and it was x? That is consistent because I is not in the word.\n\nBut to guess, we have two options: ""MARRY"" or ""LARKY"".\n\nSince we haven\'t tested many letters, we can use a guess that also tests new letters? But we are forced into the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""marry"" to test the duplicate R theory.\n\nIf we guess ""marry"":\n- If correct, we win.\n- If incorrect, we get feedback on M and possibly the third position? But in ""marry"", position 0 is M and position 3 is R (duplicate).\n\nIf position 0 is M and it\'s correct or wrong? And position 3 is R: since R is already known, if it is at this position correctly? Or if there is no duplicate, then R would be marked wrong at position 3? But R is in the word, so it would be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if it is the correct position? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut likely, if the secret word is ""LARKY"", then we get feedback for ""marry"" as M(x), A(✓), R(✓), R(x) if R is not at position 3? But R is in the word at position 2, so a second R at position 3 being wrong? Maybe ""-"" because the letter R is in the word but not at position 3? But there is already one R placed correctly? So for duplicate, it depends on whether there are two R\'s and if we guess correctly.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we can guess ""larky"" instead? But it\'s less common.\n\nSince ""MARRY"" is a common word and matches, we can try that.\n\nAlso, note: in the first guess, we had a ""-"" for R at position 1: now R is at position 2? So if there were another R, the ""-"" in guess1 would still stand? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nThus, I\'ll guess ""marry"".\n\nBut note: excluded letters? M is not excluded.\n\nSo guess ""marry"".Based on the previous feedback, we have:\n\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A R _ Y`  \n- **Fixed letters**: A (position 1), R (position 2), Y (position 4).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  \n- **Possible candidates**: Only a few words fit the pattern while avoiding excluded letters, such as ""marry"" (with duplicate R) or ""larky"" (with K and L).\n\nAfter evaluating:\n- ""Marry"" is a common word that fits the pattern `M A R R Y`, testing:\n  - M at position 0 (new letter).\n  - Duplicate R at position 3 (since R is already confirmed at position 2).\n- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback will clarify if M is present and whether a duplicate R is allowed at position 3.\n\n<guess>marry</guess>After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  \n   - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2 (0-indexed).  \n   - C, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n2. **Guess 2 (""party"")**:  \n   - A, R, Y are confirmed correct at positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.  \n   - P and T are not in the word.  \n   - The secret word pattern is: `_ A R _ Y`.  \n\n3. **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**:  \n   - D and I are not in the word.  \n   - A, R, Y remain correct at their positions.  \n   - No new letters added beyond exclusions.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.  \n- **Pattern**: `[?] A R [?] Y` (positions 0 and 3 unknown).  \n- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.  \n- **Likely candidates**:  \n  - ""Marry"" (M A R R Y): Tests M at position 0 and a potential duplicate R at position 3.  \n  - ""Larky"" (L A R K Y): Tests L at position 0 and K at position 3.  \n- ""Marry"" is a common word and fits the pattern. Guessing it tests the duplicate R scenario and M efficiently.\n\n### Next Guess:  \nChose ""marry"" to resolve the pattern directly. If correct, the game ends.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- I: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

Guess 4: ""marry""
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 3)  [Note: the second R in ""marry"" is at position 3]
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

The feedback for ""marry"" shows that the second R is correct at position 3. This means the secret word has R at position 3 as well.

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: R  (since the second R in ""marry"" at position 3 is correct)
- Position 4: Y

But what about position 0? We have M marked as x, so M is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter0] A R R Y

But we know position 0 is not M, and also not any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.

Moreover, from the pattern, the word must be _ A R R Y

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""ARRY"", but not starting with M, and not starting with any excluded letter.

Common words ending with ""ARRY"":
- MARRY (but we tried and M is not the first letter? We tried ""marry"" and M was x, so the word is not ""marry"".)
- CARRY? But C is excluded (from guess1).
- HARRY: H A R R Y -> H is not excluded? We haven't tested H.
- LARRY: L A R R Y -> L not excluded.
- BARRY: B A R R Y -> B not excluded.
- PARRY: P is excluded.
- TARRY: T is excluded.
- JARRY: J A R R Y -> J not excluded.

So possible words: HARRY, LARRY, BARRY, JARRY, etc.

We need to choose one.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 (in ""crane"") and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now, in the secret word, R is at positions 2 and 3? So if we have a word with R at 2 and 3, then R at position 1 in the first guess would be wrong? But the secret word has R at 2 and 3, so R at position 1 is not present? Then why was it marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position) in the first guess?

This is a conflict.

Let me reexamine:

In ""crane"", we had R at position 1. The feedback was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 1.

But if the secret word has R only at positions 2 and 3, then R is in the word, so the ""-"" is correct because it is present but not at position 1.

No conflict.

Now, for the word, we have to find a word that starts with a letter that is not excluded and is not M.

Excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T, D, I, M (from guess4)

So excluded: C, N, E, P, T, D, I, M

Possible starting letters for _ARRY: H, L, B, J, F, G, K, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But Y is at the end, so probably not at start? But possible.

Common words:
- HARRY
- LARRY
- BARRY

Less common: JARRY, FARRY (not common), GARRY (name), etc.

We can try ""harry"".

But note: in ""harry"", the letters are H, A, R, R, Y. We have A, R, R, Y fixed, so we are testing H at position 0.

If we guess ""harry"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on H.

Similarly, we have other options.

But we have only two tries left? We are on guess 5, so one more after this if wrong.

But we can try the most common one: ""harry"" is a common word.

Alternatively, we can think: is there any constraint from the first guess?

In the first guess, we had A at position 2? And it was marked as present but wrong position. Now, in the secret word, A is at position 1. So that is consistent.

Similarly, no other constraints.

So let's guess ""harry"".

But note: ""harry"" has two R's? Yes, at positions 2 and 3? 
- Position 0: H
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: Y

Yes.

So I think ""harry"" is a good guess.

But we must ensure that H is not excluded? It is not in the excluded list.

So guess ""harry"".Based on the feedback:

- **Pattern from Guess 4 (""marry"")**: The feedback `M(x) A(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)` reveals:
  - The secret word has `A` (position 1), `R` (position 2), `R` (position 3), and `Y` (position 4) confirmed.
  - `M` is not in the word.
  - Thus, the secret word pattern is `[?] A R R Y`, with position 0 being the only unknown.

- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I, M (from all previous feedback).
- **Possible words**: Only words ending in `ARRY` are possible, such as ""harry"", ""larry"", ""barry"", ""jarry"", etc. (avoiding excluded starting letters).

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- ""Harry"" is a common word fitting the pattern and tests `H` at position 0. If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on `H` will confirm if it is in the word (though unlikely, as position 0 is the only unknown).

<guess>harry</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been narrowed down to the pattern `_ A R R Y`, with the following constraints:

- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: `A` (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
  - Position 2: `R` (confirmed in Guess 2, 3, and 4).
  - Position 3: `R` (confirmed in Guess 4, as the second `R` in ""marry"" was correct at position 3).
  - Position 4: `Y` (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
- **Position 0**: Unknown, but must be a letter not excluded.
- **Excluded letters**: `C`, `N`, `E`, `P`, `T`, `D`, `I`, `M` (from feedback in all guesses).
- **Possible words**: Only words ending in `ARRY` are valid, such as:
  - `HARRY` (tests `H` at position 0).
  - `LARRY` (tests `L` at position 0).
  - `BARRY` (tests `B` at position 0).
  - `JARRY` (tests `J` at position 0).

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- `HARRY` is the most common word fitting this pattern and tests a new letter (`H`) at position 0.
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on `H` will confirm if it is in the word (though unlikely, as position 0 is the only unknown), and we can use the last guess for another candidate (e.g., `LARRY` or `BARRY`).

<guess>harry</guess>",harry,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
- D: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- I: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

Guess 4: ""marry""
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 3)  [Note: the second R in ""marry"" is at position 3]
- Y: ✓ (correct at position 4)

The feedback for ""marry"" shows that the second R is correct at position 3. This means the secret word has R at position 3 as well.

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: R  (since the second R in ""marry"" at position 3 is correct)
- Position 4: Y

But what about position 0? We have M marked as x, so M is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter0] A R R Y

But we know position 0 is not M, and also not any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T, D, I.

Moreover, from the pattern, the word must be _ A R R Y

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""ARRY"", but not starting with M, and not starting with any excluded letter.

Common words ending with ""ARRY"":
- MARRY (but we tried and M is not the first letter? We tried ""marry"" and M was x, so the word is not ""marry"".)
- CARRY? But C is excluded (from guess1).
- HARRY: H A R R Y -> H is not excluded? We haven't tested H.
- LARRY: L A R R Y -> L not excluded.
- BARRY: B A R R Y -> B not excluded.
- PARRY: P is excluded.
- TARRY: T is excluded.
- JARRY: J A R R Y -> J not excluded.

So possible words: HARRY, LARRY, BARRY, JARRY, etc.

We need to choose one.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 1 (in ""crane"") and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now, in the secret word, R is at positions 2 and 3? So if we have a word with R at 2 and 3, then R at position 1 in the first guess would be wrong? But the secret word has R at 2 and 3, so R at position 1 is not present? Then why was it marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position) in the first guess?

This is a conflict.

Let me reexamine:

In ""crane"", we had R at position 1. The feedback was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 1.

But if the secret word has R only at positions 2 and 3, then R is in the word, so the ""-"" is correct because it is present but not at position 1.

No conflict.

Now, for the word, we have to find a word that starts with a letter that is not excluded and is not M.

Excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T, D, I, M (from guess4)

So excluded: C, N, E, P, T, D, I, M

Possible starting letters for _ARRY: H, L, B, J, F, G, K, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But Y is at the end, so probably not at start? But possible.

Common words:
- HARRY
- LARRY
- BARRY

Less common: JARRY, FARRY (not common), GARRY (name), etc.

We can try ""harry"".

But note: in ""harry"", the letters are H, A, R, R, Y. We have A, R, R, Y fixed, so we are testing H at position 0.

If we guess ""harry"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on H.

Similarly, we have other options.

But we have only two tries left? We are on guess 5, so one more after this if wrong.

But we can try the most common one: ""harry"" is a common word.

Alternatively, we can think: is there any constraint from the first guess?

In the first guess, we had A at position 2? And it was marked as present but wrong position. Now, in the secret word, A is at position 1. So that is consistent.

Similarly, no other constraints.

So let's guess ""harry"".

But note: ""harry"" has two R's? Yes, at positions 2 and 3? 
- Position 0: H
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: Y

Yes.

So I think ""harry"" is a good guess.

But we must ensure that H is not excluded? It is not in the excluded list.

So guess ""harry"".Based on the feedback:

- **Pattern from Guess 4 (""marry"")**: The feedback `M(x) A(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)` reveals:
  - The secret word has `A` (position 1), `R` (position 2), `R` (position 3), and `Y` (position 4) confirmed.
  - `M` is not in the word.
  - Thus, the secret word pattern is `[?] A R R Y`, with position 0 being the only unknown.

- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, D, I, M (from all previous feedback).
- **Possible words**: Only words ending in `ARRY` are possible, such as ""harry"", ""larry"", ""barry"", ""jarry"", etc. (avoiding excluded starting letters).

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- ""Harry"" is a common word fitting the pattern and tests `H` at position 0. If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on `H` will confirm if it is in the word (though unlikely, as position 0 is the only unknown).

<guess>harry</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been narrowed down to the pattern `_ A R R Y`, with the following constraints:

- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: `A` (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
  - Position 2: `R` (confirmed in Guess 2, 3, and 4).
  - Position 3: `R` (confirmed in Guess 4, as the second `R` in ""marry"" was correct at position 3).
  - Position 4: `Y` (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).
- **Position 0**: Unknown, but must be a letter not excluded.
- **Excluded letters**: `C`, `N`, `E`, `P`, `T`, `D`, `I`, `M` (from feedback in all guesses).
- **Possible words**: Only words ending in `ARRY` are valid, such as:
  - `HARRY` (tests `H` at position 0).
  - `LARRY` (tests `L` at position 0).
  - `BARRY` (tests `B` at position 0).
  - `JARRY` (tests `J` at position 0).

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- `HARRY` is the most common word fitting this pattern and tests a new letter (`H`) at position 0.
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on `H` will confirm if it is in the word (though unlikely, as position 0 is the only unknown), and we can use the last guess for another candidate (e.g., `LARRY` or `BARRY`).",Guess 5: harry -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
