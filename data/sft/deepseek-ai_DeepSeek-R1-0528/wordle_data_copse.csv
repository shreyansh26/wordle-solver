First, let's understand the feedback from the first guess.

The guess was ""crane"", and the feedback is: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- C is in the word and in the correct position. Since C is the first letter, it must be the first letter of the secret word.
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- N is not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position. E is the fifth letter, so it must be the fifth letter of the secret word.

So, from this, we know that the secret word:
- Starts with C
- Ends with E
- Does not contain R, A, or N anywhere.

Since A and N are not in the word, and the word starts with C and ends with E, possible positions are filled with other letters.

The secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E

Letters R, A, N are excluded. So, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, ends with E, doesn't have R, A, N, and contains E only at the end (but we already know E is at the end).

The feedback shows E(✓) for the fifth position, so E is correctly placed. Since R, A, N are absent, we must include other letters.

Now, common letters to try: We should avoid using R, A, N in the new guess.

Possible options: Since the word is C _ _ _ E, let's think of common English words fitting this pattern.

Common possibilities:
- CYCLE? But C is already used, and Y might be possible.
- CABLE? But A is excluded, feedback says A not in word.
- CACHE? Has A, but A is excluded.
- CASTE? Has A and S, but A excluded.
- CHOSE? Has O, S, E at end, but E is at end.

List some words starting with C and ending with E without R, A, N:
- CHOICE? 6 letters, too long.
- CLOSE? That's 5 letters: C L O S E
- CYCLE? C Y C L E – but C is repeated, and Y is a vowel.

Feedback didn't prohibit letters like O or S yet.

From ""crane"", we know C and E are in place, R,A,N out.

So for the next guess, I need to guess a word that tests possible middle letters.

I should aim to include common consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Excluded letters: R, A, N

Known positions: 1st: C, 5th: E

Possible vowels: E is already used, but it's at end. Other vowels: O, U, I, etc.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z — but excluding R,A,N.

S, T, L, O, U are common.

Perhaps guess a word like ""CLOSE"": C L O S E

But E is at end, C at start.

In ""close"", positions: C at 1, L at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Since we know C and E are correct and in position, we can focus on testing positions 2,3,4.

Another common choice could be ""CHIME"" or something, but let's see.

""CHOSE"": C H O S E

But H,O,S are new letters.

I could use a word that has varied letters to cover more possibilities.

Similarly, ""IMAGE"" but wait, must start with C, so not possible.

I need to start with C and end with E.

List possible 5-letter words starting with C and ending with E:

- CACHE (but has A, excluded)
- CALVE? But has A, excluded)
- CAME? 4 letters.
- CEDE, but short.
- CEASE (has A, excluded — C E A S E, A is excluded)
- CHASE? Has A.
- CHOSE: C H O S E — no R,A,N
- CLOSE: C L O S E
- CRUDE? But R excluded.
- CYCLE: C Y C L E — has Y, possible, and repeated C? But C is at position 1, and another C? Position 3 is C.

In ""cycle"", position 1 is C, position 3 is C. Since we have C(✓) first position, and secret word might have another C? But not sure.

Possible words: CHOSE, CLOSE, BIOME? Starts with B, not C.

Focus: C _ _ _ E

With common letters: L, O, S, T, U, I, etc.

For example:
- CLOSE: letters C,L,O,S,E — we know C and E are in word, L,O,S unknown.
- CHOSE: C,H,O,S,E
- CELEB? Not common.
- CYCLE: C,Y,C,L,E
- COUPE: C,O,U,P,E
- CRIPE? R excluded.

Since R,A,N are out, and C,E in place, let's choose a word that tests the middle three positions with letters that weren't in the first guess.

First guess had R,A,N excluded, so use H,O,S,T, or others.

Perhaps ""SHITE"" but doesn't start with C.

Must start with C.

Another idea: ""SCENE"" — S C E N E, but N is excluded, and E is at position 4? Secret word ends with E, so position 5 must be E. ""SCENE"" has E at 4 and 5, but we know position 1 is C, so ""SCENE"" starts with S, not C — invalid.

So, back to choices. ""SLICE""? S L I C E — starts with S, not C.

Starts with C: ""CLINE""? But N excluded.

""CHILE""? C H I L E — no R,A,N.

""COUPE"": C O U P E

""CRIME""? But R excluded.

""CHIME"": C H I M E

That's 5 letters.

Similarly, ""THOSE"" but starts with T.

So options:
- CLOSE: C L O S E
- CHOSE: C H O S E
- CHIME: C H I M E
- BULGE? Not C.

CHIME: C H I M E

Now, in CHIME, position 1: C, position 2: H, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E. Position 5 is E, which we know is correct, so it's fine.

Similarly for CLOSE.

I need to prioritize letters that are common and haven't been tested.

For instance, in first guess 'crane', we tested C, R, A, N, E. So letters not tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we know R,A,N are out, so avoid those.

So I should include H, O, S, L, I, M, T, U, etc., to get coverage on other common letters.

Perhaps CHOSE or CLOSE are good.

Maybe CLOUD, but ends with D, not E.

Ends with E: CHOSE, CLOSE, PRICE? R excluded.

Let's pick ""CLOSE"" as a common word.

C L O S E

If I guess ""CLOSE"", feedback might be:

- Position 1: C, should be ✓ (correct position)
- Position 2: L, unknown
- Position 3: O, unknown
-X Position 4: S, unknown
- Position 5: E, should be ✓

But it depends on the secret word.

Another possibility: since E is at end, and C at start, perhaps the word is ""CLONE"", but N excluded.

""CRATE""? A and R excluded.

Better not guess with excluded letters.

So ""CHOSE"": C H O S E

H,O,S are new.

Or ""CHIME"": C H I M E, H,I,M new.

I think ""CLOSE"" might be better because L,O,S are common.

""SLATE"" is common starter but doesn't start with C.

Since we have first and last fixed, we can target position 2,3,4.

I recall that in Wordle, after fixed positions, it's good to use words with diverse letters.

Also, avoid repeated letters if possible, since we don't know yet.

In ""CLOSE"", all letters different except C, but C is already known.

C is position 1, and if secret has another C, not sure.

But initially, let's assume no repeats.

Similarly, ""CHOSE"" has no repeats: C,H,O,S,E — E at end.

C,H,O,S,E all distinct except E, but E is repeated? No, positions: 1:C,2:H,3:O,4:S,5:E all different.

CHOSE: C-H-O-S-E all distinct letters.

CLOSE: C-L-O-S-E, all distinct.

CHIME: C-H-I-M-E, all distinct.

Now, all seem fine.

But E is already confirmed, so not testing new vowel per se.

Vowels: in first guess, A is excluded, E is used, O is untested, I,U untested.

Consonants: S,T,L are common.

Perhaps ""COILS"" not ends with E.

I think CLOSE is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there's a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

For example, S and T are very common.

In position 4? But we need end with E.

C_T E, like CUTE, but U and T.

CUTE: C U T E, but it's 4 letters? 5? C-U-T-E is 4 letters. Wordle has 5-letters.

So must be C U T E S? No, ""CUTES"" isn't common, or ""CUTIE"".

""CUTIE"": C U T I E — 5 letters, ends with E.

Letters: C,U,T,I,E — C and E known, U,T,I new.

Similarly, ""SITE"" ends with E but not start with C.

Back to: ""CHOSE"" or ""CLOSE"".

Perhaps ""CLOSE"" is fine.

To include T, which is common, ""CHUTE""? C-H-U-T-E but T at position 4? Secret word positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:E.

If I guess ""CHUTE"": C H U T E, positions 1 and 5 correct, 2:H,3:U,4:T.

But ""CHUTE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""COATE"" not common.

""COZIE""? Not standard.

Stick with common words.

I think ""CLOSE"" is a standard choice.

So I'll go with ""CLOSE"" for the second guess.

Guess: CLOSE

But let's confirm the format.

Response should be in <guess>close</guess>

Thinking: based on feedback, C and E are fixed, so pattern C _ _ _ E, no R,A,N.

In CLOSE, we test L,O,S.

If L is in word, position might or might not be correct.

Similarly for O and S.

This will give us more information.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C(✓) and E(✓) are in the correct positions, and R(x), A(x), N(x) are not in the secret word, we know the secret word has the pattern C _ _ _ E and excludes R, A, and N. For the next guess, I need to test possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 4 using unused common letters to maximize information. Letters like L, O, S, T, H, I, M are good candidates because they are high-frequency and haven't been tested yet.

Choosing ""close"" as the guess:
- It starts with C and ends with E, leveraging the known positions.
- It includes new letters: L, O, S, to test their presence and positions.
- All letters are distinct, minimizing redundancy and clarifying feedback.
- If any of L, O, or S are present, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities; if absent, they can be excluded in future guesses.

This approach should efficiently reduce the possible word list for subsequent guesses.

<guess>close</guess>",close,"First, let's understand the feedback from the first guess.

The guess was ""crane"", and the feedback is: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- C is in the word and in the correct position. Since C is the first letter, it must be the first letter of the secret word.
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- N is not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position. E is the fifth letter, so it must be the fifth letter of the secret word.

So, from this, we know that the secret word:
- Starts with C
- Ends with E
- Does not contain R, A, or N anywhere.

Since A and N are not in the word, and the word starts with C and ends with E, possible positions are filled with other letters.

The secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E

Letters R, A, N are excluded. So, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, ends with E, doesn't have R, A, N, and contains E only at the end (but we already know E is at the end).

The feedback shows E(✓) for the fifth position, so E is correctly placed. Since R, A, N are absent, we must include other letters.

Now, common letters to try: We should avoid using R, A, N in the new guess.

Possible options: Since the word is C _ _ _ E, let's think of common English words fitting this pattern.

Common possibilities:
- CYCLE? But C is already used, and Y might be possible.
- CABLE? But A is excluded, feedback says A not in word.
- CACHE? Has A, but A is excluded.
- CASTE? Has A and S, but A excluded.
- CHOSE? Has O, S, E at end, but E is at end.

List some words starting with C and ending with E without R, A, N:
- CHOICE? 6 letters, too long.
- CLOSE? That's 5 letters: C L O S E
- CYCLE? C Y C L E – but C is repeated, and Y is a vowel.

Feedback didn't prohibit letters like O or S yet.

From ""crane"", we know C and E are in place, R,A,N out.

So for the next guess, I need to guess a word that tests possible middle letters.

I should aim to include common consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Excluded letters: R, A, N

Known positions: 1st: C, 5th: E

Possible vowels: E is already used, but it's at end. Other vowels: O, U, I, etc.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z — but excluding R,A,N.

S, T, L, O, U are common.

Perhaps guess a word like ""CLOSE"": C L O S E

But E is at end, C at start.

In ""close"", positions: C at 1, L at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Since we know C and E are correct and in position, we can focus on testing positions 2,3,4.

Another common choice could be ""CHIME"" or something, but let's see.

""CHOSE"": C H O S E

But H,O,S are new letters.

I could use a word that has varied letters to cover more possibilities.

Similarly, ""IMAGE"" but wait, must start with C, so not possible.

I need to start with C and end with E.

List possible 5-letter words starting with C and ending with E:

- CACHE (but has A, excluded)
- CALVE? But has A, excluded)
- CAME? 4 letters.
- CEDE, but short.
- CEASE (has A, excluded — C E A S E, A is excluded)
- CHASE? Has A.
- CHOSE: C H O S E — no R,A,N
- CLOSE: C L O S E
- CRUDE? But R excluded.
- CYCLE: C Y C L E — has Y, possible, and repeated C? But C is at position 1, and another C? Position 3 is C.

In ""cycle"", position 1 is C, position 3 is C. Since we have C(✓) first position, and secret word might have another C? But not sure.

Possible words: CHOSE, CLOSE, BIOME? Starts with B, not C.

Focus: C _ _ _ E

With common letters: L, O, S, T, U, I, etc.

For example:
- CLOSE: letters C,L,O,S,E — we know C and E are in word, L,O,S unknown.
- CHOSE: C,H,O,S,E
- CELEB? Not common.
- CYCLE: C,Y,C,L,E
- COUPE: C,O,U,P,E
- CRIPE? R excluded.

Since R,A,N are out, and C,E in place, let's choose a word that tests the middle three positions with letters that weren't in the first guess.

First guess had R,A,N excluded, so use H,O,S,T, or others.

Perhaps ""SHITE"" but doesn't start with C.

Must start with C.

Another idea: ""SCENE"" — S C E N E, but N is excluded, and E is at position 4? Secret word ends with E, so position 5 must be E. ""SCENE"" has E at 4 and 5, but we know position 1 is C, so ""SCENE"" starts with S, not C — invalid.

So, back to choices. ""SLICE""? S L I C E — starts with S, not C.

Starts with C: ""CLINE""? But N excluded.

""CHILE""? C H I L E — no R,A,N.

""COUPE"": C O U P E

""CRIME""? But R excluded.

""CHIME"": C H I M E

That's 5 letters.

Similarly, ""THOSE"" but starts with T.

So options:
- CLOSE: C L O S E
- CHOSE: C H O S E
- CHIME: C H I M E
- BULGE? Not C.

CHIME: C H I M E

Now, in CHIME, position 1: C, position 2: H, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E. Position 5 is E, which we know is correct, so it's fine.

Similarly for CLOSE.

I need to prioritize letters that are common and haven't been tested.

For instance, in first guess 'crane', we tested C, R, A, N, E. So letters not tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we know R,A,N are out, so avoid those.

So I should include H, O, S, L, I, M, T, U, etc., to get coverage on other common letters.

Perhaps CHOSE or CLOSE are good.

Maybe CLOUD, but ends with D, not E.

Ends with E: CHOSE, CLOSE, PRICE? R excluded.

Let's pick ""CLOSE"" as a common word.

C L O S E

If I guess ""CLOSE"", feedback might be:

- Position 1: C, should be ✓ (correct position)
- Position 2: L, unknown
- Position 3: O, unknown
-X Position 4: S, unknown
- Position 5: E, should be ✓

But it depends on the secret word.

Another possibility: since E is at end, and C at start, perhaps the word is ""CLONE"", but N excluded.

""CRATE""? A and R excluded.

Better not guess with excluded letters.

So ""CHOSE"": C H O S E

H,O,S are new.

Or ""CHIME"": C H I M E, H,I,M new.

I think ""CLOSE"" might be better because L,O,S are common.

""SLATE"" is common starter but doesn't start with C.

Since we have first and last fixed, we can target position 2,3,4.

I recall that in Wordle, after fixed positions, it's good to use words with diverse letters.

Also, avoid repeated letters if possible, since we don't know yet.

In ""CLOSE"", all letters different except C, but C is already known.

C is position 1, and if secret has another C, not sure.

But initially, let's assume no repeats.

Similarly, ""CHOSE"" has no repeats: C,H,O,S,E — E at end.

C,H,O,S,E all distinct except E, but E is repeated? No, positions: 1:C,2:H,3:O,4:S,5:E all different.

CHOSE: C-H-O-S-E all distinct letters.

CLOSE: C-L-O-S-E, all distinct.

CHIME: C-H-I-M-E, all distinct.

Now, all seem fine.

But E is already confirmed, so not testing new vowel per se.

Vowels: in first guess, A is excluded, E is used, O is untested, I,U untested.

Consonants: S,T,L are common.

Perhaps ""COILS"" not ends with E.

I think CLOSE is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there's a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

For example, S and T are very common.

In position 4? But we need end with E.

C_T E, like CUTE, but U and T.

CUTE: C U T E, but it's 4 letters? 5? C-U-T-E is 4 letters. Wordle has 5-letters.

So must be C U T E S? No, ""CUTES"" isn't common, or ""CUTIE"".

""CUTIE"": C U T I E — 5 letters, ends with E.

Letters: C,U,T,I,E — C and E known, U,T,I new.

Similarly, ""SITE"" ends with E but not start with C.

Back to: ""CHOSE"" or ""CLOSE"".

Perhaps ""CLOSE"" is fine.

To include T, which is common, ""CHUTE""? C-H-U-T-E but T at position 4? Secret word positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:E.

If I guess ""CHUTE"": C H U T E, positions 1 and 5 correct, 2:H,3:U,4:T.

But ""CHUTE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""COATE"" not common.

""COZIE""? Not standard.

Stick with common words.

I think ""CLOSE"" is a standard choice.

So I'll go with ""CLOSE"" for the second guess.

Guess: CLOSE

But let's confirm the format.

Response should be in <guess>close</guess>

Thinking: based on feedback, C and E are fixed, so pattern C _ _ _ E, no R,A,N.

In CLOSE, we test L,O,S.

If L is in word, position might or might not be correct.

Similarly for O and S.

This will give us more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C(✓) and E(✓) are in the correct positions, and R(x), A(x), N(x) are not in the secret word, we know the secret word has the pattern C _ _ _ E and excludes R, A, and N. For the next guess, I need to test possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 4 using unused common letters to maximize information. Letters like L, O, S, T, H, I, M are good candidates because they are high-frequency and haven't been tested yet.

Choosing ""close"" as the guess:
- It starts with C and ends with E, leveraging the known positions.
- It includes new letters: L, O, S, to test their presence and positions.
- All letters are distinct, minimizing redundancy and clarifying feedback.
- If any of L, O, or S are present, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities; if absent, they can be excluded in future guesses.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,copse,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, let's understand the feedback from the first guess.

The guess was ""crane"", and the feedback is: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- C is in the word and in the correct position. Since C is the first letter, it must be the first letter of the secret word.
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- N is not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position. E is the fifth letter, so it must be the fifth letter of the secret word.

So, from this, we know that the secret word:
- Starts with C
- Ends with E
- Does not contain R, A, or N anywhere.

Since A and N are not in the word, and the word starts with C and ends with E, possible positions are filled with other letters.

The secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E

Letters R, A, N are excluded. So, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, ends with E, doesn't have R, A, N, and contains E only at the end (but we already know E is at the end).

The feedback shows E(✓) for the fifth position, so E is correctly placed. Since R, A, N are absent, we must include other letters.

Now, common letters to try: We should avoid using R, A, N in the new guess.

Possible options: Since the word is C _ _ _ E, let's think of common English words fitting this pattern.

Common possibilities:
- CYCLE? But C is already used, and Y might be possible.
- CABLE? But A is excluded, feedback says A not in word.
- CACHE? Has A, but A is excluded.
- CASTE? Has A and S, but A excluded.
- CHOSE? Has O, S, E at end, but E is at end.

List some words starting with C and ending with E without R, A, N:
- CHOICE? 6 letters, too long.
- CLOSE? That's 5 letters: C L O S E
- CYCLE? C Y C L E – but C is repeated, and Y is a vowel.

Feedback didn't prohibit letters like O or S yet.

From ""crane"", we know C and E are in place, R,A,N out.

So for the next guess, I need to guess a word that tests possible middle letters.

I should aim to include common consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Excluded letters: R, A, N

Known positions: 1st: C, 5th: E

Possible vowels: E is already used, but it's at end. Other vowels: O, U, I, etc.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z — but excluding R,A,N.

S, T, L, O, U are common.

Perhaps guess a word like ""CLOSE"": C L O S E

But E is at end, C at start.

In ""close"", positions: C at 1, L at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Since we know C and E are correct and in position, we can focus on testing positions 2,3,4.

Another common choice could be ""CHIME"" or something, but let's see.

""CHOSE"": C H O S E

But H,O,S are new letters.

I could use a word that has varied letters to cover more possibilities.

Similarly, ""IMAGE"" but wait, must start with C, so not possible.

I need to start with C and end with E.

List possible 5-letter words starting with C and ending with E:

- CACHE (but has A, excluded)
- CALVE? But has A, excluded)
- CAME? 4 letters.
- CEDE, but short.
- CEASE (has A, excluded — C E A S E, A is excluded)
- CHASE? Has A.
- CHOSE: C H O S E — no R,A,N
- CLOSE: C L O S E
- CRUDE? But R excluded.
- CYCLE: C Y C L E — has Y, possible, and repeated C? But C is at position 1, and another C? Position 3 is C.

In ""cycle"", position 1 is C, position 3 is C. Since we have C(✓) first position, and secret word might have another C? But not sure.

Possible words: CHOSE, CLOSE, BIOME? Starts with B, not C.

Focus: C _ _ _ E

With common letters: L, O, S, T, U, I, etc.

For example:
- CLOSE: letters C,L,O,S,E — we know C and E are in word, L,O,S unknown.
- CHOSE: C,H,O,S,E
- CELEB? Not common.
- CYCLE: C,Y,C,L,E
- COUPE: C,O,U,P,E
- CRIPE? R excluded.

Since R,A,N are out, and C,E in place, let's choose a word that tests the middle three positions with letters that weren't in the first guess.

First guess had R,A,N excluded, so use H,O,S,T, or others.

Perhaps ""SHITE"" but doesn't start with C.

Must start with C.

Another idea: ""SCENE"" — S C E N E, but N is excluded, and E is at position 4? Secret word ends with E, so position 5 must be E. ""SCENE"" has E at 4 and 5, but we know position 1 is C, so ""SCENE"" starts with S, not C — invalid.

So, back to choices. ""SLICE""? S L I C E — starts with S, not C.

Starts with C: ""CLINE""? But N excluded.

""CHILE""? C H I L E — no R,A,N.

""COUPE"": C O U P E

""CRIME""? But R excluded.

""CHIME"": C H I M E

That's 5 letters.

Similarly, ""THOSE"" but starts with T.

So options:
- CLOSE: C L O S E
- CHOSE: C H O S E
- CHIME: C H I M E
- BULGE? Not C.

CHIME: C H I M E

Now, in CHIME, position 1: C, position 2: H, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E. Position 5 is E, which we know is correct, so it's fine.

Similarly for CLOSE.

I need to prioritize letters that are common and haven't been tested.

For instance, in first guess 'crane', we tested C, R, A, N, E. So letters not tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we know R,A,N are out, so avoid those.

So I should include H, O, S, L, I, M, T, U, etc., to get coverage on other common letters.

Perhaps CHOSE or CLOSE are good.

Maybe CLOUD, but ends with D, not E.

Ends with E: CHOSE, CLOSE, PRICE? R excluded.

Let's pick ""CLOSE"" as a common word.

C L O S E

If I guess ""CLOSE"", feedback might be:

- Position 1: C, should be ✓ (correct position)
- Position 2: L, unknown
- Position 3: O, unknown
-X Position 4: S, unknown
- Position 5: E, should be ✓

But it depends on the secret word.

Another possibility: since E is at end, and C at start, perhaps the word is ""CLONE"", but N excluded.

""CRATE""? A and R excluded.

Better not guess with excluded letters.

So ""CHOSE"": C H O S E

H,O,S are new.

Or ""CHIME"": C H I M E, H,I,M new.

I think ""CLOSE"" might be better because L,O,S are common.

""SLATE"" is common starter but doesn't start with C.

Since we have first and last fixed, we can target position 2,3,4.

I recall that in Wordle, after fixed positions, it's good to use words with diverse letters.

Also, avoid repeated letters if possible, since we don't know yet.

In ""CLOSE"", all letters different except C, but C is already known.

C is position 1, and if secret has another C, not sure.

But initially, let's assume no repeats.

Similarly, ""CHOSE"" has no repeats: C,H,O,S,E — E at end.

C,H,O,S,E all distinct except E, but E is repeated? No, positions: 1:C,2:H,3:O,4:S,5:E all different.

CHOSE: C-H-O-S-E all distinct letters.

CLOSE: C-L-O-S-E, all distinct.

CHIME: C-H-I-M-E, all distinct.

Now, all seem fine.

But E is already confirmed, so not testing new vowel per se.

Vowels: in first guess, A is excluded, E is used, O is untested, I,U untested.

Consonants: S,T,L are common.

Perhaps ""COILS"" not ends with E.

I think CLOSE is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there's a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

For example, S and T are very common.

In position 4? But we need end with E.

C_T E, like CUTE, but U and T.

CUTE: C U T E, but it's 4 letters? 5? C-U-T-E is 4 letters. Wordle has 5-letters.

So must be C U T E S? No, ""CUTES"" isn't common, or ""CUTIE"".

""CUTIE"": C U T I E — 5 letters, ends with E.

Letters: C,U,T,I,E — C and E known, U,T,I new.

Similarly, ""SITE"" ends with E but not start with C.

Back to: ""CHOSE"" or ""CLOSE"".

Perhaps ""CLOSE"" is fine.

To include T, which is common, ""CHUTE""? C-H-U-T-E but T at position 4? Secret word positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:E.

If I guess ""CHUTE"": C H U T E, positions 1 and 5 correct, 2:H,3:U,4:T.

But ""CHUTE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""COATE"" not common.

""COZIE""? Not standard.

Stick with common words.

I think ""CLOSE"" is a standard choice.

So I'll go with ""CLOSE"" for the second guess.

Guess: CLOSE

But let's confirm the format.

Response should be in <guess>close</guess>

Thinking: based on feedback, C and E are fixed, so pattern C _ _ _ E, no R,A,N.

In CLOSE, we test L,O,S.

If L is in word, position might or might not be correct.

Similarly for O and S.

This will give us more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C(✓) and E(✓) are in the correct positions, and R(x), A(x), N(x) are not in the secret word, we know the secret word has the pattern C _ _ _ E and excludes R, A, and N. For the next guess, I need to test possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 4 using unused common letters to maximize information. Letters like L, O, S, T, H, I, M are good candidates because they are high-frequency and haven't been tested yet.

Choosing ""close"" as the guess:
- It starts with C and ends with E, leveraging the known positions.
- It includes new letters: L, O, S, to test their presence and positions.
- All letters are distinct, minimizing redundancy and clarifying feedback.
- If any of L, O, or S are present, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities; if absent, they can be excluded in future guesses.

This approach should efficiently reduce the possible word list for subsequent guesses.

- Secret word pattern: C _ _ S E (since S is in the fourth position and correct)
- Letters in the word: C, E, S (known positions), and O is present but not in second position. Also, O is not in any of the positions it was guessed? In ""close"", O was in position 3, but O(-) indicates it is in the word but not there. So O must be in a different position.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, L (from L(x))

Positions:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E
- To find: Position 2 and 3.

O is in the word but not at position 2 or 3? In ""close"", O was in position 3. Since O(-), it is not at position 3, so it must be at position 2? But position 2 is the only unknown position available? Positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=?, 4=S, 5=E.

Available positions: 2 and 3.

O(-) for position 3: O is present but not at position 3. Therefore, O must be at position 2? Because if not, it would be x if not present. But O(-) means present but wrong position, so it must be in one of the unknown positions: 2 or ... well, positions 1,4,5 are fixed and O is not C, S, or E? Position 1 is C, so O can't be there because it's a different letter. Similarly, position 4 is S and position 5 is E. Therefore, the only possible place for O is either position 2 or position 3. But O(-) for position 3 means it is not at position 3. Therefore, O must be at position 2.

Is that correct? The feedback for ""close"" says O(-), meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3). Since positions 1,4,5 are occupied by C,S,E respectively, and O can't be those, so position 2 is indeed the only remaining position. Therefore, position 2 must be O.

But wait: we guessed O at position 3, and it's not there, so it must be at position 2? Yes, because there's nowhere else for it to be.

Also, we have L(x), so L is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be: C O ? S E, with some letter at position 3.

Letters excluded: R, A, N, L.

So, what could the missing letter be? Position 3 can be any letter except R,A,N,L, and not C,O,S,E (since if it were those, it might be duplicated, but possible).

C,O,S,E are already present, so position 3 could be another letter, possibly a duplicate? But O is at position 2, C,S,E at others.

Possible duplicate? For example, if position 3 is O, but we have O at position 2? But O(-) for position 3 indicates there is an O somewhere else, which we deduced is position 2. So position 3 cannot be O because that would make two Os, and O(-) could still be correct if there is an O but not at position 3. However, if position 3 were O, then O would be at position 3, but feedback says not at position 3, so contradiction. Thus, if position 3 were O, then O at position 3 would be correct and we would get ✓, not -. Since we got -, it means O is not at position 3 and position 3 is not O. Therefore, position 2 must be O, and position 3 is a different letter.

To summarize:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O (inferred from O(-) and that it must be at position 2, since it can't be at 1,3,4,5)
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: E

Thus, the secret word is C O ? S E.

Now, we need to guess position 3. We have only one missing letter.

The options for position 3: letter not in {R,A,N,L} (excluded), and also the word must be valid English word.

Possible English words: CO_SE, with the blank filled.

Common words:
- COUSE? Not common.
- COPSE: C O P S E (meaning a thicket of trees)
- CORSE? But R excluded.
- COSTE? Not standard.
- COZSE? Not a word.
- COVES? But V, and ends with S? Pattern ends with E, not S.

CO_SE options:
- COPSE: a noun, meaning a small group of trees.
- COUSE? Not familiar.
- COTES: C O T E S, but that ends with S, not E? Position 4 should be S, but COTES has S at position 5.

No: secret word pattern: C O ? S E, so fourth position is S, fifth is E. So word is CO?SE.

For example:
- COPSE: C O P S E — this matches: position 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E.

Other options:
- COSSE? But that would be C O S S E, position 4 is S, but has double S? But in pattern, position 4 is S, so for COSSE, positions: 1:C,2:O,3:S1,4:S2,5:E? But S at position 3 and 4. But our pattern has position 3 unknown and position 4 S. So COSSE would have S at position 3 and 4, which is possible? But in our case, from ""close"", we have S in position 4, but if we guess COPSE, position 3 is P, not S.

What other words? COGSE? Not common. COESE? No.

CONES? But N excluded.

COMES? C O M E S, positions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E? But it has E at position 4, not S. But secret has position 4 as S, so E should be at position 5. COMES ends with S, not E? S-E.

No: COMES: C O M E S, so position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

But secret word ends with E and has S at position 4. So COMES is not matching.

COPES? C O P E S, position 4 E? But secret position 4 is S.

So must have S at position 4 and E at position 5.

Therefore, COPSE: C O P S E is a valid word.

Are there others? COVES: C O V E S, position 4 E? No.

COTES: C O T E S, position 4 E? Position 5 S? But secret ends with E, so not.

Words ending in SE: COPSE, perhaps MIDSE not start with C.

So essentially, COPSE seems almost the only common word.

COZSE? Not a word.

Frequently, COPSE is a possibility.

Now, with the guess, we should confirm if position 3 is P.

But we don't have P in any feedback yet. P wasn't tested before.

Also, in previous feedback, we only tested C, R, A, N, E, L, O, S.

So P is new.

Therefore, if we guess ""COPSE"", it has C,O,P,S,E.

Positions: 1:C(known), 2:O, 3:P, 4:S(known), 5:E(known).

We expect that O should be at position 2? But according to above, we infer it must be.

But let's see what feedback should be: if secret is COPSE, then:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: O ✓? If O is indeed at position 2, it should be ✓.
- Position 3: P, unknown
- Position 4: S ✓
- Position 5: E ✓

And P would be correct position if secret is COPSE.

But if secret is not COPSE, it might be different.

Other possibilities? Is there a word with O at position 2 and position 3 some other letter.

For example, COBSE? Not common.

COES? 4 letters.

COFFS? Ends with S, not E.

COKES? C O K E S, but position 4 E? Not S.

So likely COPSE is the word.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible words fitting C O ? S E with ? not in excluded letters.

Excluded: R,A,N,L.

So possible letters for ?: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (not R,A,N,L)

But must form a valid word.

Common options: COPSE is one.

COHES? Not common.

COUPS? Ends with S.

COTES ends with S not E.

CIDES? Not start with CO.

Actually, COPSE seems the most likely.

COMAE? C O M A E, but A excluded and position 4 not S.

No.

Perhaps COSIE? Ends with E? C O S I E, but positions: 1:C,2:O,3:S? Position 3 S, position 4 I? But pattern requires position 4 S, so if word is COSIE, position 3:S, position 4:I — no S at position 4. Contradiction.

Our pattern has pos 4=S, so position 3 cannot be S? Unless duplicate S.

Possible: if secret word has S at position 4 and also S elsewhere? But in this case, position 3 could be S? For example, if word is COSSE? What does that mean? Not a word really. COSS could be a word? But C O S S E? Not standard.

Most likely COPSE.

Given that we have few tries left, we might as well guess COPSE.

But in the guess, we should make sure.

Perhaps test position 3 with another guess that uses multiple possibilities, but since we know three positions, guessing COPSE directly could solve it.

If not, we'll get feedback.

In feedback, if COPSE:
- C✓, O✓ (since O must be at position 2), P? S✓, E✓

If P is correct, it will be ✓.

If not, then it should be x or -, but since only one position unknown, we can deduce.

But to save guesses, we can guess COPSE.

Confirming words: COPSE is a valid Scrabble word and English word.

So I will guess COPSE.

But in the response, format should be <guess>copse</guess>

Step-by-step reasoning:

From feedback:
- Secret word begins with C, ends with E, and has S at position 4.
- O is present but not at the guessed position (3), so it must be at position 2.
- Excluded letters: R,A,N,L.
- Thus, secret word is C O ? S E for some letter at position 3.
- Common and only realistic option is COPSE with P at position 3.
- Therefore, guess ""copse"".

<guess>copse</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": C(✓) and E(✓) are in the correct positions. R, A, and N are excluded (x).
- From ""close"": C(✓) and E(✓) confirm the first and last positions are fixed as C and E. S(✓) confirms the fourth position is S. O(-) indicates O is present but not in the third position. L(x) excludes L.

Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is C _ _ S E.
/ Position 1: C
/ Position 4: S
/ Position 5: E
/ Position 2 and 3 are unknown, with O present (since O(-) means O is in the word but not at position 3).
- Given O must be in the word, and positions 1, 4, and 5 are fixed (C, S, E), O must be at position 2 (the only remaining spot, since it can't be at position 3 due to O(-)).
- Thus, position 2 is O, reducing the pattern to C O _ S E.
- Position 3 must be a letter not excluded (R, A, N, L are excluded) and not C, O, S, E to avoid duplicates unless specified.
- Common words fitting C O _ S E include COPSE (a small group of trees), as P is a valid letter not yet tested or excluded.

Therefore, guessing ""copse"" efficiently tests position 3 with P and aims to solve the word.

<guess>copse</guess>",copse,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. From ""crane"": 
   - C(✓) : first position correct
