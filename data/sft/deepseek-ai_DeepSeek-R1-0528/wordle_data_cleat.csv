We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is not in the word at all.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we put it there and got a dash).
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word is 5 letters and we know the first letter is C.

 Now, we can think about the positions:
 Position 1: C (fixed)
 Position 2: Not R, and not A (because A is present but in the wrong position, so it can't be in position 2). Also, we don't know what it is yet.
 Position 3: We don't know.
 Position 4: We don't know.
 Position 5: Not E (because E is present but not in position 5).

 We also know the word contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively) and does not contain R and N.

 Since A is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5. But note: position 5 is not E, but we don't know about A in position 5? Actually, A could be in position 5? However, we have to remember that the feedback for A was a dash meaning it is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was position 2). So A can be in position 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But wait, position 2: we don't know, but we know it's not R and not A. Also, note that we have the first letter fixed as C.

 However, we must also note that the word does not contain R and N.

 Let's list the knowns:
 - The word: C _ _ _ _
 - Contains: A (somewhere in positions 3,4,5) and E (somewhere in positions 2,3,4) [but note: position 2 is still possible for E?]
 - Does not contain: R, N

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to test possible positions for A and E, and also try to find other letters.

 Since we know the first letter is C, we can try to form a word that starts with C and uses some new letters to get more information.

 We should avoid using R and N because we know they are not in the word.

 Also, we want to test the positions for A and E. But note: we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and E) and we haven't placed them yet.

 Let me think of words that start with C, and contain A and E, but without R and N.

 Also, we don't want to put A in position 2 again (because we already know it's not there) and E in position 5 (because we know it's not there). So we can try to put A and E in other positions.

 Possibilities for the second guess:

 We can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? etc.

 Let me try to come up with a word that fits:

 Option 1: C _ A E _ -> but we need a letter for position 2 and 5. We know position 2 cannot be R, N, and also we don't want to reuse letters that we know are absent? We also want to test new letters.

 But note: we don't know about other letters. We have to test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 3? 

 Example: C L E A P? But we don't know if L and P are in the word.

 However, we have to make a valid English word.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have A and E, and avoid R and N.

 Some words:
 - ""cameo"": C A M E O -> but we have A in position 2? We already know A is not in position 2. So we cannot use A in position 2 again. So this is not a good choice because we would be repeating the mistake of putting A in position 2.

 - ""cease"": C E A S E -> This has E in position 2 and A in position 3. Also, S and E (again) in positions 4 and 5. But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback only told us that E is present (at least one) but not in position 5. It could appear multiple times? However, the feedback for the first guess only had one E and it was marked as present (dash) so we don't know about duplicates.

 But let's check: the word ""cease"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. So it's a possibility.

 However, we also have to consider that we are trying to get information about other letters.

 Another word: ""cable"": C A B L E -> but again, A is in position 2 which we know is wrong. So avoid.

 How about ""scale"": S C A L E -> but this doesn't start with C? We know the first letter is C, so ""scale"" starts with S. Not valid.

 We need a word that starts with C.

 How about ""cadet"": C A D E T -> again, A is in position 2. Not good.

 How about ""chase"": C H A S E -> A is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is A? Let me break it down:
 C (position1), H (position2), A (position3), S (position4), E (position5)

 But wait, we know that E is not in position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as dash (meaning present but not in position 5). So if we put E in position 5 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we are allowed to put E in position 5 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let me try to find a word that starts with C, has A (in position 3,4, or 5) and E (in position 2,3, or 4) and avoids R and N.

 Example: ""camel"": C A M E L -> A in position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""celeb"": C E L E B -> This has E in position 2 and 4. But we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Actually, we don't have to include A in the guess? But we are trying to figure out the position of A. However, if we don't include A, we won't get information about A. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try to guess without A? But we know A is in the word, so we should try to test its position.

 Another idea: ""capex"": C A P E X -> A in position 2? Not good.

 How about ""cause"": C A U S E -> A in position 2? Not good.

 I'm having trouble. Let me try to put A in position 4 and E in position 2.

 Example: ""C E _ A _""

 Words: ""ceiba"" (a type of tree) -> C E I B A -> This has A in position 5? But we don't know if A can be in position 5? Actually, we don't have any information about position 5 except that it's not E. So A could be in position 5.

 But let's see: 
 - Position 1: C
 - Position 2: E (we are testing E in position 2)
 - Position 3: I (new letter)
 - Position 4: B (new letter)
 - Position 5: A (testing A in position 5)

 This word ""ceiba"" is valid? I think so (it's in the dictionary as a tropical tree).

 Alternatively, we can try ""cesta"" (a basket used in jai alai): C E S T A -> A in position 5.

 But note: we are avoiding R and N, and these words don't have R or N.

 However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""cheap"" -> but we have A in position 4? C H E A P -> 
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: H (new)
 Position 3: E (testing E in position 3)
 Position 4: A (testing A in position 4)
 Position 5: P (new)

 This seems good because we are testing A in position 4 and E in position 3, and we are introducing H and P.

 But wait, we know that in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 4 and E in position 3. Also, we are avoiding R and N.

 So ""cheap"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""cleat"": C L E A T -> 
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: L (new)
 Position 3: E (testing E in position 3)
 Position 4: A (testing A in position 4)
 Position 5: T (new)

 This is also valid.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

 However, we are introducing new letters: in ""cheap"" we have H, E, A, P. In ""cleat"" we have L, E, A, T.

 We want to cover more common letters. Let me think of the frequency.

 Another word: ""caste"": C A S T E -> but A is in position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""cameo"" is invalid because of A in position 2.

 I think ""cheap"" or ""cleat"" are good options.

 But let me check: we know that E is in the word and not in position 5, so putting E in position 3 (as in both ""cheap"" and ""cleat"") is a good test. Similarly, putting A in position 4 is a good test.

 I'll go with ""cheap"" because it uses H and P which are common.

 However, note that we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know R and N are absent, and we are not using them.

 So, second guess: ""cheap""

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We are not testing that, but we can get that from feedback.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't include A and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We need to find their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""cheap"".

 However, let me double-check: the first guess was ""crane"", and we got:
 C: correct (so first letter C)
 R: absent -> so no R in the word
 A: present but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not in position 2)
 N: absent
 E: present but wrong position (so E is in the word, but not in position 5)

 Now, ""cheap"": 
 C H E A P

 We are hoping to get feedback that tells us about H, E, A, and P.

 But note: we already know C is correct, so the first letter will be ✓.

 We are testing:
 - H: if it's in the word? and if so, in what position?
 - E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 3 -> if it's in the correct position we get ✓, if not then we get - (if it's elsewhere) or if it's not in the word? but we know it is, so it must be either ✓ or -.
 - A: we are putting it in position 4 -> same as above: we know it's in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.
 - P: we don't know, so it could be absent, present, or correct.

 This will give us good information.

 So, I choose ""cheap"".

<guess>cheap</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is absent from the word (x).
- **A** is present but not in position 2 (-).
- **N** is absent from the word (x).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- **A** must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **E** must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is invalid for E).
- **R** and **N** are eliminated.

For the second guess, I chose **CHEAP** because:
- It starts with **C** (leveraging the known correct position).
- It tests **E** in position 3 and **A** in position 4 (exploring valid positions for these known letters).
- It introduces new common letters (**H** and **P**) to gather more information.
- It avoids eliminated letters (R, N).

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing new letters.

 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: x (not in the word)

 Position 1: C (fixed)

 A: present but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not in position 2)
 N: absent
 E: present but wrong position (so E is in the word, but not in position 5)

 Now, ""cheap"": 
 C H E A P

 We are hoping to get feedback that tells us about H, E, A, and P.

 But note: we already know C is correct, so the first letter will be ✓.

 We are testing:
 - H: if it's in the word? and if so, in what position?
 - E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 3 -> if it's in the correct position we get ✓, if not then we get - (if it's elsewhere) or if it's not in the word? but we know it is, so it must be either ✓ or -.
 - A: we are putting it in position 4 -> same as above: we know it's in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.
 - P: we don't know, so it could be absent, present, or correct.

 This will give us good information.

 So, I choose ""cheap"".

<guess>cheap</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is absent from the word (x).
- **A** is present but not in position 2 (-).
- **N** is absent from the word (x).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- **A** must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **E** must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is invalid for E).
- **R** and **N** are eliminated.

For the second guess, I chose **CHEAP** because:
- It starts with **C** (leveraging the known correct position).
- It tests **E** in position 3 and **A** in position 4 (exploring valid positions for these known letters).
- It introduces new common letters (**H** and **P**) to gather more information.
- It avoids eliminated letters (R, N).

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing new letters.",Guess 2: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,cleat,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is not in the word at all.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we put it there and got a dash).
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word is 5 letters and we know the first letter is C.

 Now, we can think about the positions:
 Position 1: C (fixed)
 Position 2: Not R, and not A (because A is present but in the wrong position, so it can't be in position 2). Also, we don't know what it is yet.
 Position 3: We don't know.
 Position 4: We don't know.
 Position 5: Not E (because E is present but not in position 5).

 We also know the word contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively) and does not contain R and N.

 Since A is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5. But note: position 5 is not E, but we don't know about A in position 5? Actually, A could be in position 5? However, we have to remember that the feedback for A was a dash meaning it is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was position 2). So A can be in position 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But wait, position 2: we don't know, but we know it's not R and not A. Also, note that we have the first letter fixed as C.

 However, we must also note that the word does not contain R and N.

 Let's list the knowns:
 - The word: C _ _ _ _
 - Contains: A (somewhere in positions 3,4,5) and E (somewhere in positions 2,3,4) [but note: position 2 is still possible for E?]
 - Does not contain: R, N

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to test possible positions for A and E, and also try to find other letters.

 Since we know the first letter is C, we can try to form a word that starts with C and uses some new letters to get more information.

 We should avoid using R and N because we know they are not in the word.

 Also, we want to test the positions for A and E. But note: we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and E) and we haven't placed them yet.

 Let me think of words that start with C, and contain A and E, but without R and N.

 Also, we don't want to put A in position 2 again (because we already know it's not there) and E in position 5 (because we know it's not there). So we can try to put A and E in other positions.

 Possibilities for the second guess:

 We can try to put A in position 3 and E in position 4? Or A in position 4 and E in position 2? etc.

 Let me try to come up with a word that fits:

 Option 1: C _ A E _ -> but we need a letter for position 2 and 5. We know position 2 cannot be R, N, and also we don't want to reuse letters that we know are absent? We also want to test new letters.

 But note: we don't know about other letters. We have to test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 3? 

 Example: C L E A P? But we don't know if L and P are in the word.

 However, we have to make a valid English word.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have A and E, and avoid R and N.

 Some words:
 - ""cameo"": C A M E O -> but we have A in position 2? We already know A is not in position 2. So we cannot use A in position 2 again. So this is not a good choice because we would be repeating the mistake of putting A in position 2.

 - ""cease"": C E A S E -> This has E in position 2 and A in position 3. Also, S and E (again) in positions 4 and 5. But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback only told us that E is present (at least one) but not in position 5. It could appear multiple times? However, the feedback for the first guess only had one E and it was marked as present (dash) so we don't know about duplicates.

 But let's check: the word ""cease"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. So it's a possibility.

 However, we also have to consider that we are trying to get information about other letters.

 Another word: ""cable"": C A B L E -> but again, A is in position 2 which we know is wrong. So avoid.

 How about ""scale"": S C A L E -> but this doesn't start with C? We know the first letter is C, so ""scale"" starts with S. Not valid.

 We need a word that starts with C.

 How about ""cadet"": C A D E T -> again, A is in position 2. Not good.

 How about ""chase"": C H A S E -> A is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is A? Let me break it down:
 C (position1), H (position2), A (position3), S (position4), E (position5)

 But wait, we know that E is not in position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as dash (meaning present but not in position 5). So if we put E in position 5 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we are allowed to put E in position 5 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let me try to find a word that starts with C, has A (in position 3,4, or 5) and E (in position 2,3, or 4) and avoids R and N.

 Example: ""camel"": C A M E L -> A in position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""celeb"": C E L E B -> This has E in position 2 and 4. But we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Actually, we don't have to include A in the guess? But we are trying to figure out the position of A. However, if we don't include A, we won't get information about A. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try to guess without A? But we know A is in the word, so we should try to test its position.

 Another idea: ""capex"": C A P E X -> A in position 2? Not good.

 How about ""cause"": C A U S E -> A in position 2? Not good.

 I'm having trouble. Let me try to put A in position 4 and E in position 2.

 Example: ""C E _ A _""

 Words: ""ceiba"" (a type of tree) -> C E I B A -> This has A in position 5? But we don't know if A can be in position 5? Actually, we don't have any information about position 5 except that it's not E. So A could be in position 5.

 But let's see: 
 - Position 1: C
 - Position 2: E (we are testing E in position 2)
 - Position 3: I (new letter)
 - Position 4: B (new letter)
 - Position 5: A (testing A in position 5)

 This word ""ceiba"" is valid? I think so (it's in the dictionary as a tropical tree).

 Alternatively, we can try ""cesta"" (a basket used in jai alai): C E S T A -> A in position 5.

 But note: we are avoiding R and N, and these words don't have R or N.

 However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""cheap"" -> but we have A in position 4? C H E A P -> 
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: H (new)
 Position 3: E (testing E in position 3)
 Position 4: A (testing A in position 4)
 Position 5: P (new)

 This seems good because we are testing A in position 4 and E in position 3, and we are introducing H and P.

 But wait, we know that in the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 4 and E in position 3. Also, we are avoiding R and N.

 So ""cheap"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""cleat"": C L E A T -> 
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: L (new)
 Position 3: E (testing E in position 3)
 Position 4: A (testing A in position 4)
 Position 5: T (new)

 This is also valid.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

 However, we are introducing new letters: in ""cheap"" we have H, E, A, P. In ""cleat"" we have L, E, A, T.

 We want to cover more common letters. Let me think of the frequency.

 Another word: ""caste"": C A S T E -> but A is in position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""cameo"" is invalid because of A in position 2.

 I think ""cheap"" or ""cleat"" are good options.

 But let me check: we know that E is in the word and not in position 5, so putting E in position 3 (as in both ""cheap"" and ""cleat"") is a good test. Similarly, putting A in position 4 is a good test.

 I'll go with ""cheap"" because it uses H and P which are common.

 However, note that we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know R and N are absent, and we are not using them.

 So, second guess: ""cheap""

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We are not testing that, but we can get that from feedback.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't include A and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We need to find their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""cheap"".

 However, let me double-check: the first guess was ""crane"", and we got:
 C: correct (so first letter C)
 R: absent -> so no R in the word
 A: present but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not in position 2)
 N: absent
 E: present but wrong position (so E is in the word, but not in position 5)

 Now, ""cheap"": 
 C H E A P

 We are hoping to get feedback that tells us about H, E, A, and P.

 But note: we already know C is correct, so the first letter will be ✓.

 We are testing:
 - H: if it's in the word? and if so, in what position?
 - E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 3 -> if it's in the correct position we get ✓, if not then we get - (if it's elsewhere) or if it's not in the word? but we know it is, so it must be either ✓ or -.
 - A: we are putting it in position 4 -> same as above: we know it's in the word, so it will be either ✓ or -.
 - P: we don't know, so it could be absent, present, or correct.

 This will give us good information.

 So, I choose ""cheap"".

<guess>cheap</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)

From this, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- R is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: cheap
Feedback: C(✓) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x)

From this, we know:
- The first letter is C (confirmed again).
- H is not in the word.
- E is in the word and exactly in position 3 (since we got a ✓ for position 3).
- A is in the word and exactly in position 4 (since we got a ✓ for position 4).
- P is not in the word.

Now, putting it all together, we have:

Secret word pattern: C _ E A _ 

We know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: Unknown, but cannot be R, N, H (because absent), and cannot be A (since A is fixed at position 4) or E (fixed at position 3).
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be E (from first feedback), and cannot be R, N, H, P (absent). Also, note that in the first guess, E was in position 5 and was marked as '-' meaning present but not there, but now we know E is only in position 3? Wait, could there be two E's?

Re-examining: In the first guess, we had E in position 5 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. In the second guess, we have E in position 3 and got ✓, meaning position 3 is E. This does not preclude the word from having another E. But we don't have any information about duplicates yet.

However, from the second guess, we only tested one E (at position 3) and it was correct. There might still be another E? Let me think: if there were another E, it would have shown up in the feedback for the second guess? But in the second guess, we only had one E, so if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn't know if it exists or what position it might be. But note: the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but not position, so if there were only one E and it is at position 3, then when E was at position 5 it is not correct so we got '-'. That is consistent. And in the second guess when we put E at position 3 we got ✓, so if there were a duplicate E, say at position 2 or 4 or 5, we would have gotten an additional feedback? But wait, in the second guess we didn't put E anywhere else. Also, position 4 is A so it's not E. Position 5 is unknown. So we don't know about duplicate E.

But let's check the feedback rules: when a letter is duplicated, if one is correct and the other might be absent? Actually, feedback marks each letter separately. However, if the word has two E's, and we guess one E correct at position 3 and we don't have another E in the guess, then the feedback for the other E won't be shown? We only guess one E.

So we still don't know if there might be another E. Similarly for other letters.

But from first guess, we know that position 5 cannot be E (because E at position 5 was marked as not correct). So even if there is a duplicate E, it could not be at position 5 because that E would have to be marked either correct or present? But in the first guess, we put E in position 5 and got '-', meaning it is present but not at position 5. So if there were only one E, then it cannot be at position 5. And if there are two E's, one at position 3 (which is correct) and one elsewhere, say position 2, then when we put E in position 5 (first guess) and it is not actually there, so we get '-' for E even if there is another E? Actually, no: if the word has two E's, and we put E in position 5, and one E is at position 3 and the other at position 2, then the E at position 5 is not present? Wait no: the word has two E's, so E is present. But it's not at position 5? So we get a '-' meaning there is an E but not at position 5. So that feedback doesn't tell us where the other E is.

But in our current knowledge, we have:

Word: C ? E A ?

Where:
- The second character must be a letter not in: R, N, H, P (eliminated by absence).
- The fifth character must be a letter not in: E (because of first feedback), R, N, H, P.

Also, we know the word contains E (but we've fixed it at position 3) and A (fixed at position 4). We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one other letter? Actually, we know the letters E and A are in the word, and we have eliminated R, N, H, P.

Now, what letters are possible? We have to choose from the remaining alphabet except eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: R, N, H, P.

But note, we have used C, R, A, N, E in the first guess and then C, H, E, A, P in the second guess. So we also have tested A and E multiple times? So eliminated: R, N, H, P.

Also, note that position 2: cannot be A (already used in position 4) and cannot be E (position 3), but if there were a duplicate E, it could be? But let's not jump to duplicates until we have to.

We should form the word: C E A at positions 1,3,4. Positions 2 and 5 to fill.

Possible words: 

We must form a valid English word.

Position 2: any letter except R, N, H, P, and also C (if not duplicated) but note C is at position 1 so duplicate might be allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Actually, the rules don't say that duplicates are forbidden. For example, the word ""sweet"" has two E's.

But we have C at position 1, so position 2 could be C? Then word would start with ""CC"" and that might not be common.

But let's be systematic.

We know the word must end with a letter that is not E, R, N, H, P. So fifth position: cannot be E, R, N, H, P.

Similarly, second position: cannot be R, N, H, P, and also cannot be A or E? Wait, no: A is at position 4 so if the word has duplicate A, it could be at position 2? But we don't have any information about that. Actually, we know A is at position 4, but we don't know if there is another A. Similarly for E.

But from feedback, in the first guess we had A at position 2 and got '-', meaning there is an A not at position 2. Then in the second guess we put A at position 4 and got ✓. So if there were a duplicate A, it would have been revealed by one of these? Actually: if the word had a duplicate A, then when we put A at position 2 in the first guess, we should get a '-' (since A is present but not at position 2) and when we put A at position 4 we should get ✓ for that one, and the duplicate A would also get marked? Only if we guess it? But we didn't guess duplicate A.

So we cannot rule out a duplicate A or E.

But for position 2, it could be A? But wait, we already know that at position 2 we cannot have A because in the first guess we put A there and got '-' meaning it is not at position 2? But that '-' doesn't say it's not at position 2 because it's already placed elsewhere? Actually, no: the feedback for each position is independent. But it means that even if there were a duplicate A, we must not put it at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not A (otherwise we would have gotten a ✓ in the first guess). So the letter at position 2 cannot be A. Similarly, it cannot be E? Why? Because we put E in position 3 and it got ✓. But that doesn't say anything about position 2. However, we haven't tested position 2 for E.

But we do know that E is in the word. We know its position 3. But if there is another E, it could be anywhere? But in the first guess, we put E at position 5 and got '-'. So if we put E at position 2, we don't know because we haven't tested that.

Actually, we must avoid using eliminated letters: R, N, H, P.

So for position 2: cannot be R, N, H, P. Also, we have C at position 1, so it could be C? And it could be any other letter including A? But wait, we know from the first guess that A is not at position 2 (because we got '-'). So if we put A at position 2, we know it will be wrong? So we should avoid that because we know it's not there.

Similarly, we haven't tested position 2 for E? So it might be E? But note: if there is a duplicate E, it could be at position 2? However, in the first guess, we put E at position 5 and got '-', which is consistent. So E could be at position 2? We are not sure.

But to maximize information, we should try to cover new letters? Or try to complete the word.

We have the word: C ? E A ?

We need to fill two blanks: letter2 and letter5.

Also, we have eliminated R, N, H, P.

Possible letters for letter2: any except R, N, H, P and also avoid C? Not necessarily. We should list common letters.

Since we know positions 3 and 4 are E and A, common letters at the beginning might include words like:
- CHINA -> but we eliminated H.
- CAMEL -> but A at wrong position and we have eliminated? Actually, we have used A? We need to avoid.

Wait, let me think of valid words that are: C _ E A _

Examples of such words:
- create -> letter2 is R, but R is eliminated.
- cease -> but this has E at position 3 (correct), A at position 4 (correct), and position2 is E? But we know that in the first guess E was at position 5 and not there, but if we have E at position2? The word ""cease"" has E at position2 and position5? Wait, position5 is E? But we know that position5 cannot be E (from first feedback). So ""cease"" has E at position5, which is forbidden? So no.

- crate -> C R A T E, but R is eliminated, and E at position5 forbidden.

- caveat -> C A V E A, but position2 is A which we know is wrong? Also, we have E at position4? But we have E at position3? Wait, the word: caveat: positions: C A V E A -> so position3 is V, not E? So not matching.

We need position3=E and position4=A.

So: C ? E A ?

Let me list words in this pattern:
- cleat -> C L E A T
- cheat -> C H E A T -> but H is eliminated.
- cleam (not common)
- cream -> C R E A M -> R eliminated.
- steam -> doesn't start with C
- dream -> doesn't start with C

So: cleat: C L E A T
Is L eliminated? We have not guessed L? So L is possible.

Another word: cable -> C A B L E -> but this has A as position2 which we know is wrong? and E at position5 which we know cannot be? So invalid for our word.

Another: cease? Already considered.

How about: crate? No.

Common words: 
- C L E A T (cleat) - meaning a wedge or a fastener.
- C H E A P (cheap) - but we already guessed it? And it had H and P which are eliminated? Wait, we guess cheap and got H and P absent.

So cleat: C L E A T -> positions: 
1: C
2: L
3: E
4: A
5: T

Now, T has not been tested? So T might be in the word? We don't know.

Another possibility: C L E A R -> but R is eliminated.

C L E A N -> N is eliminated.

So cleat might be a candidate.

Are there others?

Cream: R eliminated.

Cheat: H eliminated.

Another: C S E A T -> but that's not a word? Or ""cse"": not starting with C? I mean words: there is ""cesta"" but that is C E S T A -> which doesn't match our pattern because we need position3=E and we have C E S T A -> position3 is S? No.

Another: C B E A M -> not a common word.

So cleat: C L E A T

But we have not tested L and T.

We also can think: if we guess cleat, then we test L and T.

But we also note that in the first guess and second guess, we have tested:
First: C,R,A,N,E -> we know C and A,E positions, R and N absent.
Second: C,H,E,A,P -> C,E,A correct, H and P absent.

So the only unknown letters are L and T in cleat? And position5=T.

But wait, could the word be with duplicate letters? For example, could position2 be S? Or D?

Other words: 
- cease: not possible because E at position5 forbidden?
Actually, cease: C E A S E -> 
Position1: C
Position2: E
Position3: A -> but we require E at position3? So position3 is A? But we have E fixed at position3? So no.

How about: crate: C R A T E? No.

Another: clade: C L A D E -> but this doesn't have E at position3? So not.

Beast: not starting with C?

We have limited options.

C O E A T? Not a word.

C U E A T? Not a word.

C L E A R? R eliminated.

So cleat might be the only common option? 

But let me verify: is there also ""covey""? C O V E Y -> position3=E? Yes, and position4=Y? Not A. So not.

Or ""creek"": C R E E K -> R eliminated and we need A at position4? Not.

Another possibility: ""comet"": C O M E T -> position4 is E, but we need A at position4? No.

""cheap"": we already tried.

So our only candidate so far is ""cleat"": C L E A T.

But note: we don't know if L and T are in the word? But if cleat is not the word, there might be other words?

Another word: ""cubeb""? Not common.

Or ""cella"": C E L L A -> but we have position3=L? Not E.

No.

How about ""cameo"": C A M E O -> A at position2? Not allowed.

So perhaps cleat is a good guess.

We also have the possibility that the fifth letter is A? Wait, but position4 is A? And we don't know about duplicates? So could it be ""cidea""? Not a word.

Or ""cunea""? Not.

Another known word: ""pleat"" doesn't start with C.

So I think ""cleat"" is the most plausible.

But we can also consider that we might have duplicates? For example, the word ""cease"" wouldn't work because of E at position5? But what if the word is ""cater"": C A T E R -> position3=E? Position4=R? But we need position4=A? No.

Another word: ""chela"": C H E L A -> already tried and we know H is absent? Also, position4=A? But H is absent.

So let's guess ""cleat"".

If it is correct, we get it. If not, we get feedback.

In feedback, we can learn about L and T.

So third guess: cleat.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:

**Key Deductions:**  
1. **From Guess 1 (crane):**  
   - **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).  
   - **R** and **N** are absent (x).  
   - **A** is present but not in position 2 (-).  
   - **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).  

2. **From Guess 2 (cheap):**  
   - **C** is correct in position 1 (✓) (reinforced).  
   - **H** and **P** are absent (x).  
   - **E** is correct in position 3 (✓).  
   - **A** is correct in position 4 (✓).  

**Combined Insights:**  
- The secret word format is: **C _ E A _** (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed: C, E, A).  
- Position 2 must be a letter **not eliminated** (R, N, H, P) and **cannot be A** (as position 4 is confirmed ✓). It could be E (if duplicate), but we focus on untested common letters.  
- Position 5 must be a letter **not eliminated** (E, R, N, H, P) and feasible for English words.  
- Eliminated letters: **R, N, H, P**.  
- Possible words: Given the constraints, ""cleat"" (C L E A T) is a strong candidate:  
  - It respects the fixed pattern (C, E, A).  
  - It tests new letters (L and T) in positions 2 and 5.  
  - L and T are common and untested.  

If ""cleat"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal if L/T are present/correct or absent, significantly narrowing down options.

<guess>cleat</guess>",cleat,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)

From this, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- R is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: cheap
Feedback: C(✓) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x)

From this, we know:
- The first letter is C (confirmed again).
- H is not in the word.
- E is in the word and exactly in position 3 (since we got a ✓ for position 3).
- A is in the word and exactly in position 4 (since we got a ✓ for position 4).
- P is not in the word.

Now, putting it all together, we have:

Secret word pattern: C _ E A _ 

We know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: Unknown, but cannot be R, N, H (because absent), and cannot be A (since A is fixed at position 4) or E (fixed at position 3).
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be E (from first feedback), and cannot be R, N, H, P (absent). Also, note that in the first guess, E was in position 5 and was marked as '-' meaning present but not there, but now we know E is only in position 3? Wait, could there be two E's?

Re-examining: In the first guess, we had E in position 5 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. In the second guess, we have E in position 3 and got ✓, meaning position 3 is E. This does not preclude the word from having another E. But we don't have any information about duplicates yet.

However, from the second guess, we only tested one E (at position 3) and it was correct. There might still be another E? Let me think: if there were another E, it would have shown up in the feedback for the second guess? But in the second guess, we only had one E, so if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn't know if it exists or what position it might be. But note: the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but not position, so if there were only one E and it is at position 3, then when E was at position 5 it is not correct so we got '-'. That is consistent. And in the second guess when we put E at position 3 we got ✓, so if there were a duplicate E, say at position 2 or 4 or 5, we would have gotten an additional feedback? But wait, in the second guess we didn't put E anywhere else. Also, position 4 is A so it's not E. Position 5 is unknown. So we don't know about duplicate E.

But let's check the feedback rules: when a letter is duplicated, if one is correct and the other might be absent? Actually, feedback marks each letter separately. However, if the word has two E's, and we guess one E correct at position 3 and we don't have another E in the guess, then the feedback for the other E won't be shown? We only guess one E.

So we still don't know if there might be another E. Similarly for other letters.

But from first guess, we know that position 5 cannot be E (because E at position 5 was marked as not correct). So even if there is a duplicate E, it could not be at position 5 because that E would have to be marked either correct or present? But in the first guess, we put E in position 5 and got '-', meaning it is present but not at position 5. So if there were only one E, then it cannot be at position 5. And if there are two E's, one at position 3 (which is correct) and one elsewhere, say position 2, then when we put E in position 5 (first guess) and it is not actually there, so we get '-' for E even if there is another E? Actually, no: if the word has two E's, and we put E in position 5, and one E is at position 3 and the other at position 2, then the E at position 5 is not present? Wait no: the word has two E's, so E is present. But it's not at position 5? So we get a '-' meaning there is an E but not at position 5. So that feedback doesn't tell us where the other E is.

But in our current knowledge, we have:

Word: C ? E A ?

Where:
- The second character must be a letter not in: R, N, H, P (eliminated by absence).
- The fifth character must be a letter not in: E (because of first feedback), R, N, H, P.

Also, we know the word contains E (but we've fixed it at position 3) and A (fixed at position 4). We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one other letter? Actually, we know the letters E and A are in the word, and we have eliminated R, N, H, P.

Now, what letters are possible? We have to choose from the remaining alphabet except eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: R, N, H, P.

But note, we have used C, R, A, N, E in the first guess and then C, H, E, A, P in the second guess. So we also have tested A and E multiple times? So eliminated: R, N, H, P.

Also, note that position 2: cannot be A (already used in position 4) and cannot be E (position 3), but if there were a duplicate E, it could be? But let's not jump to duplicates until we have to.

We should form the word: C E A at positions 1,3,4. Positions 2 and 5 to fill.

Possible words: 

We must form a valid English word.

Position 2: any letter except R, N, H, P, and also C (if not duplicated) but note C is at position 1 so duplicate might be allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Actually, the rules don't say that duplicates are forbidden. For example, the word ""sweet"" has two E's.

But we have C at position 1, so position 2 could be C? Then word would start with ""CC"" and that might not be common.

But let's be systematic.

We know the word must end with a letter that is not E, R, N, H, P. So fifth position: cannot be E, R, N, H, P.

Similarly, second position: cannot be R, N, H, P, and also cannot be A or E? Wait, no: A is at position 4 so if the word has duplicate A, it could be at position 2? But we don't have any information about that. Actually, we know A is at position 4, but we don't know if there is another A. Similarly for E.

But from feedback, in the first guess we had A at position 2 and got '-', meaning there is an A not at position 2. Then in the second guess we put A at position 4 and got ✓. So if there were a duplicate A, it would have been revealed by one of these? Actually: if the word had a duplicate A, then when we put A at position 2 in the first guess, we should get a '-' (since A is present but not at position 2) and when we put A at position 4 we should get ✓ for that one, and the duplicate A would also get marked? Only if we guess it? But we didn't guess duplicate A.

So we cannot rule out a duplicate A or E.

But for position 2, it could be A? But wait, we already know that at position 2 we cannot have A because in the first guess we put A there and got '-' meaning it is not at position 2? But that '-' doesn't say it's not at position 2 because it's already placed elsewhere? Actually, no: the feedback for each position is independent. But it means that even if there were a duplicate A, we must not put it at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not A (otherwise we would have gotten a ✓ in the first guess). So the letter at position 2 cannot be A. Similarly, it cannot be E? Why? Because we put E in position 3 and it got ✓. But that doesn't say anything about position 2. However, we haven't tested position 2 for E.

But we do know that E is in the word. We know its position 3. But if there is another E, it could be anywhere? But in the first guess, we put E at position 5 and got '-'. So if we put E at position 2, we don't know because we haven't tested that.

Actually, we must avoid using eliminated letters: R, N, H, P.

So for position 2: cannot be R, N, H, P. Also, we have C at position 1, so it could be C? And it could be any other letter including A? But wait, we know from the first guess that A is not at position 2 (because we got '-'). So if we put A at position 2, we know it will be wrong? So we should avoid that because we know it's not there.

Similarly, we haven't tested position 2 for E? So it might be E? But note: if there is a duplicate E, it could be at position 2? However, in the first guess, we put E at position 5 and got '-', which is consistent. So E could be at position 2? We are not sure.

But to maximize information, we should try to cover new letters? Or try to complete the word.

We have the word: C ? E A ?

We need to fill two blanks: letter2 and letter5.

Also, we have eliminated R, N, H, P.

Possible letters for letter2: any except R, N, H, P and also avoid C? Not necessarily. We should list common letters.

Since we know positions 3 and 4 are E and A, common letters at the beginning might include words like:
- CHINA -> but we eliminated H.
- CAMEL -> but A at wrong position and we have eliminated? Actually, we have used A? We need to avoid.

Wait, let me think of valid words that are: C _ E A _

Examples of such words:
- create -> letter2 is R, but R is eliminated.
- cease -> but this has E at position 3 (correct), A at position 4 (correct), and position2 is E? But we know that in the first guess E was at position 5 and not there, but if we have E at position2? The word ""cease"" has E at position2 and position5? Wait, position5 is E? But we know that position5 cannot be E (from first feedback). So ""cease"" has E at position5, which is forbidden? So no.

- crate -> C R A T E, but R is eliminated, and E at position5 forbidden.

- caveat -> C A V E A, but position2 is A which we know is wrong? Also, we have E at position4? But we have E at position3? Wait, the word: caveat: positions: C A V E A -> so position3 is V, not E? So not matching.

We need position3=E and position4=A.

So: C ? E A ?

Let me list words in this pattern:
- cleat -> C L E A T
- cheat -> C H E A T -> but H is eliminated.
- cleam (not common)
- cream -> C R E A M -> R eliminated.
- steam -> doesn't start with C
- dream -> doesn't start with C

So: cleat: C L E A T
Is L eliminated? We have not guessed L? So L is possible.

Another word: cable -> C A B L E -> but this has A as position2 which we know is wrong? and E at position5 which we know cannot be? So invalid for our word.

Another: cease? Already considered.

How about: crate? No.

Common words: 
- C L E A T (cleat) - meaning a wedge or a fastener.
- C H E A P (cheap) - but we already guessed it? And it had H and P which are eliminated? Wait, we guess cheap and got H and P absent.

So cleat: C L E A T -> positions: 
1: C
2: L
3: E
4: A
5: T

Now, T has not been tested? So T might be in the word? We don't know.

Another possibility: C L E A R -> but R is eliminated.

C L E A N -> N is eliminated.

So cleat might be a candidate.

Are there others?

Cream: R eliminated.

Cheat: H eliminated.

Another: C S E A T -> but that's not a word? Or ""cse"": not starting with C? I mean words: there is ""cesta"" but that is C E S T A -> which doesn't match our pattern because we need position3=E and we have C E S T A -> position3 is S? No.

Another: C B E A M -> not a common word.

So cleat: C L E A T

But we have not tested L and T.

We also can think: if we guess cleat, then we test L and T.

But we also note that in the first guess and second guess, we have tested:
First: C,R,A,N,E -> we know C and A,E positions, R and N absent.
Second: C,H,E,A,P -> C,E,A correct, H and P absent.

So the only unknown letters are L and T in cleat? And position5=T.

But wait, could the word be with duplicate letters? For example, could position2 be S? Or D?

Other words: 
- cease: not possible because E at position5 forbidden?
Actually, cease: C E A S E -> 
Position1: C
Position2: E
Position3: A -> but we require E at position3? So position3 is A? But we have E fixed at position3? So no.

How about: crate: C R A T E? No.

Another: clade: C L A D E -> but this doesn't have E at position3? So not.

Beast: not starting with C?

We have limited options.

C O E A T? Not a word.

C U E A T? Not a word.

C L E A R? R eliminated.

So cleat might be the only common option? 

But let me verify: is there also ""covey""? C O V E Y -> position3=E? Yes, and position4=Y? Not A. So not.

Or ""creek"": C R E E K -> R eliminated and we need A at position4? Not.

Another possibility: ""comet"": C O M E T -> position4 is E, but we need A at position4? No.

""cheap"": we already tried.

So our only candidate so far is ""cleat"": C L E A T.

But note: we don't know if L and T are in the word? But if cleat is not the word, there might be other words?

Another word: ""cubeb""? Not common.

Or ""cella"": C E L L A -> but we have position3=L? Not E.

No.

How about ""cameo"": C A M E O -> A at position2? Not allowed.

So perhaps cleat is a good guess.

We also have the possibility that the fifth letter is A? Wait, but position4 is A? And we don't know about duplicates? So could it be ""cidea""? Not a word.

Or ""cunea""? Not.

Another known word: ""pleat"" doesn't start with C.

So I think ""cleat"" is the most plausible.

But we can also consider that we might have duplicates? For example, the word ""cease"" wouldn't work because of E at position5? But what if the word is ""cater"": C A T E R -> position3=E? Position4=R? But we need position4=A? No.

Another word: ""chela"": C H E L A -> already tried and we know H is absent? Also, position4=A? But H is absent.

So let's guess ""cleat"".

If it is correct, we get it. If not, we get feedback.

In feedback, we can learn about L and T.

So third guess: cleat.After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:

**Key Deductions:**  
1. **From Guess 1 (crane):**  
   - **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).  
   - **R** and **N** are absent (x).  
   - **A** is present but not in position 2 (-).  
   - **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).  

2. **From Guess 2 (cheap):**  
   - **C** is correct in position 1 (✓) (reinforced).  
   - **H** and **P** are absent (x).  
   - **E** is correct in position 3 (✓).  
   - **A** is correct in position 4 (✓).  

**Combined Insights:**  
- The secret word format is: **C _ E A _** (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed: C, E, A).  
- Position 2 must be a letter **not eliminated** (R, N, H, P) and **cannot be A** (as position 4 is confirmed ✓). It could be E (if duplicate), but we focus on untested common letters.  
- Position 5 must be a letter **not eliminated** (E, R, N, H, P) and feasible for English words.  
- Eliminated letters: **R, N, H, P**.  
- Possible words: Given the constraints, ""cleat"" (C L E A T) is a strong candidate:  
  - It respects the fixed pattern (C, E, A).  
  - It tests new letters (L and T) in positions 2 and 5.  
  - L and T are common and untested.  

If ""cleat"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal if L/T are present/correct or absent, significantly narrowing down options.",Guess 3: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
