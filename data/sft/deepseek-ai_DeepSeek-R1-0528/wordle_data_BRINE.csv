 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

First, the previous guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, letter R is in the word and in the second position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, letter N is in the word and in the fourth position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter E is in the word and in the fifth position)

So, from feedback:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: C is wrong and not in the word, so the first letter cannot be C.
  - Position 2: R is correct! So, the second letter is R.
  - Position 3: A is wrong and not in the word, so the third letter cannot be A.
  - Position 4: N is correct! So, the fourth letter is N.
  - Position 5: E is correct! So, the fifth letter is E.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E

Now, letters that are not in the word: C and A. Since both got ""x"", neither C nor A is in the secret word at all.

Letters that are confirmed in the word: R, N, E. And they are in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

We need to find the first and third letters.

Since C and A are out, we need to choose letters that are not C or A.

Also, the secret word must be a 5-letter English word ending with R _ N E? No: the positions are fixed for R, N, E.

Secret word format: letter1 R letter3 N E

So, it's like ? R ? N E

Now, we need to guess a new 5-letter word that fits this pattern and avoids C and A.

Possible words might include things like ""IRONE"" but ""IRONE"" not a common word; let me think of real words.

Common words ending with N E: but here it's specifically ? R ? N E.

For example, words like ""URINE"": U R I N E, but position 4 is N, yes; position 5 is E, yes.

But ""URINE"" has U in first position, I in third position.

We haven't eliminated U or I yet.

Other options: ""PRUNE"" – P R U N E

""GRIME"" – G R I M E, but position 4 should be N, here it's M, not N. So no.

""BRINE"" – B R I N E

""TRINE"" – T R I N E, which is a word.

""DRONE"" – D R O N E

""FRAME"" – but A is not allowed, since A got x earlier.

A is not in the word, so no A.

Similarly, C not in word.

So, let's list possible guesses that fit the known positions.

Known: position 2 must be R, position 4 must be N, position 5 must be E.

Position 1 and 3 are unknown, and cannot be C or A.

Also, the word must exist.

Possible candidates for guess:

- ""BRINE"": B R I N E

- ""PRONE"": P R O N E? ""PRONE"" – P R O N E, position 3 is O.

- ""URINE"": U R I N E

- ""GRIME"": but position 4 is M, not N – no, secret has N in position 4.

- ""CRANE"" is not possible, since C and A are out.

Other words: ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""BRINE"", etc.

""SUPER"": no, ends with R, not N E.

We need words ending with R ? N E? Pattern is _ R _ N E, so third character before N.

""SHONE"": S H O N E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match.

Only words with R in second position, N in fourth, E in fifth.

So: X R Y N E

Where X and Y are letters, not C or A.

Y can be any letter except those known bad or conflict.

In feedback, we didn't have any yellow (wrong position), only green and gray.

From first guess, we have green for R, N, E at positions 2,4,5, and gray for C and A.

Thus, the third position could be any letter except A, and we don't know about others.

Similarly, first position except C.

Now, to maximize information, since we know three positions are correct, we need to guess letters for position 1 and 3 that might be common and give us more info.

For example, we might want to include letters that are frequent but not yet tested.

In ""CRANE"", we tested C, R, A, N, E.

N and E are common, R is common.

We don't know about vowels like I, O, U, or consonants like B, D, F, etc.

So, for position 1, possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But it has to be a word.

Similarly for position 3.

To get more info, we can choose a word that has new letters and potentially reveals more.

For instance, ""BRINE"": B R I N E – this tests B in position 1 and I in position 3.

If we guess ""BRINE"", and if B is correct, we get green, etc.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E

Or ""TRINE"": T R I N E

Let me think of common words:

- BRINE

- PRONE

- TRINE

- DRONE

- FRENE? Not common

- GROAN but ends with N, not N E

""GRAIN"" but position 4 is I, not N – no.

So, common words: URINE, OZONE? O Z O N E, position 2 is Z, not R – no.

Another: GRONE? Not word.

BRUME? Not common.

Perhaps ""CRONE"" but C is bad, so no.

Since A and C are out, avoid them.

""BRINE"" seems fine.

""PRONE"" is P R O N E, position 3 is O.

""TRINE"" T R I N E

""DRONE"" D R O N E

""FRISE""? Not common.

""SHIRE"" S H I R E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match pattern.

The word must have R in position 2, so first position and third position vary.

Possible X R Y N E

With Y being the third letter.

Now, for our guess, we need to pick a valid English word.

Let's choose one that uses common letters to test.

For example, ""BRINE"" has B and I, which haven't been tested.

Similarly, ""PRONE"" has P and O.

O is a vowel, might be good.

""URINE"" has U and I.

U is less common perhaps.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple possibilities.

But since two positions are unknown, we need to guess.

Another idea: ""IRATE"" – but I R A T E position 3 is A, which is bad, and position 4 is T, not N – doesn't fit.

So only specific words fit the pattern.

List of possible words ending with R?NE:

- BRINE

- DRONE

- PRONE? Prone is P R O N E, yes

- TRINE

- GRONE? Not word

- FRISE? Not

- URINE

- WRING? W R I N G, position 5 is G not E – no, must be E at end.

So: BRINE, DRONE, PRONE, TRINE, URINE. Are there more?

""THINE"" T H I N E, position 2 is H not R – no

""SHINE"" S H I N E, same.

""SPINE"" S P I N E, position 2 is P not R

Unless it's like ""SHRINE"" but that's 6 letters.

All must be 5 letters.

""CRONE"" has C, bad.

""PRUNE"" P R U N E, that's a word.

""GRUMP"" no.

So, PRUNE: P R U N E

Yes.

Also, ""BRUME"" not common.

""TRONE"" not standard.

Or ""DRUSE"" no.

So reasonable words: BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, TRINE, URINE, PRUNE.

Now, for guessing, I should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but all these have unique letters except possibly, but likely.

""BRINE"" - B,R,I,N,E - all unique.

Similarly others.

To get information about other letters, let's look at the board.

We know position 1 is not C, position 3 is not A.

Letters we have not tested: many.

Perhaps I should include a letter that is common but not yet tried, like S, T, D, etc., or vowels I, O, U.

In ""CRANE"", we used A, E, R, N, C. So E and N are confirmed, R confirmed.

Missing common vowels: I, O, U not tested.

Consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

So for a guess, I could use ""BRINE"" to test B and I.

""PRONE"" to test P and O.

""TRONE"" not word, ""TRINE"" tests T and I.

Perhaps ""SHINE"" but doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R, not H.

Only words with R in second position.

Another word: ""BROKE"" B R O K E, position 4 K not N – doesn't fit.

So only possibilities are those mentioned.

""CRUMP"" no.

Perhaps ""GRASP"" G R A S P, but A is bad, and position 4 S not N.

Not.

So, I think BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, PRUNE are candidates.

""DRONE"" D R O N E

Let me choose one that includes a vowel untested.

I am considering ""PRONE"": P R O N E

This way, we test P in position 1 and O in position 3.

If O is not in the word, or position.

Similarly, if P is not.

But since we know R, N, E are fixed, the feedback for position 1 and 3 will tell us about P and O.

For example, if for ""PRONE"", position 1: if P is correct, green; if not correct but in word, yellow; if not in word, gray.

Similarly for position 3 O.

But O in position 3: if secret word has O elsewhere, but in our pattern, position 3 is unknown.

In ""PRONE"", position 3 is O.

We could get different feedback.

Similarly, other words.

To speed up, since we know R,N,E are correct, the word must be one of the options I listed.

But we have only 6 tries, so we might not need to guess one directly; we can get more info first.

For instance, if I guess ""BRINE"", and B and I are wrong, but since R,N,E are already known, it might not give full info if, say, I is in the word but not position 3.

But in this case, if for ""BRINE"", feedback shows:

- Position 1 B: could be green, yellow, or gray.

- Position 2 R: should be green, unless something wrong, but it is fixed green.

Position 4 N green, position 5 E green.

Position 3 I: could be green or yellow or gray.

Similarly for others.

Now, specifically for position 1, if it gets gray, it means B is not in the word.

Similarly, if yellow, it might be in wrong position, but since position 2 is R, position 4 N, position 5 E, and B is only in position 1 for now, if B is in the word, it must be in position 1 or position 3? No, position 3 for I in BRINE, but secret can have B elsewhere.

In the secret word format _ R _ N E, possible positions for B are only position 1 or position 3, since position 2 is R, 4 N, 5 E.

Similarly for any letter.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2,4,5 fixed: 2=R, 4=N, 5=E

So variable positions: 1 and 3.

Any letter not R,N,E must be in position 1 or 3.

And R,N,E are in their positions.

Now, for a guess with new letters, say ""PRONE"": P R O N E

If P is not in the word, feedback position 1 x

If P is in the word, it could only be position 1 or 3, so if not green, it might be yellow if in position 3, but since position 3 is O in this guess, if O is wrong, but P might be yellow.

Similarly.

But I think it's fine.

Since we need to guess, I'll go with ""PRONE"" to test P and O.

Or ""DRONE"" for D and O.

Perhaps ""TRINE"" for T and I.

""URINE"" for U and I.

U is less common, so better to avoid.

O is more common vowel.

I am leaning towards ""PRONE"".

Let's confirm it's a valid word; yes, prone is a word meaning susceptible or lying face down.

Similarly.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" but C bad and doesn't fit pattern.

So, I'll go with ""PRONE"".

So my second guess is ""PRONE"".

Let me think of the format.

Response should be <guess>prone</guess>

But first, thought process in thinking.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x), so I avoid C in future guesses.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 2.
- A is not in the word (x), so I avoid A in future guesses.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 4.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 5.

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E, where the first and third positions are unknown letters that are not C or A. The goal now is to guess a new word that fits this pattern and tests potential letters for positions 1 and 3, while gathering more information.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that starts with a letter not C or A, has R in position 2, some letter in position 3 (not A or C), N in position 4, and E in position 5. Possible candidates include words like ""BRINE,"" ""DRONE,"" ""PRONE,"" ""TRINE,"" or ""URINE."" 

To maximize information:
- I should test new common letters that haven't been used yet. In ""crane,"" we tested C, R, A, N, E. R, N, and E are confirmed and fixed, so I need to focus on untested letters for positions 1 and 3, such as vowels like I, O, U or consonants like B, D, P, T.
- Words like ""BRINE"" (testing B and I) or ""PRONE"" (testing P and O) are good options. ""PRONE"" includes the letter O (a common vowel not yet tested) and P (a common consonant), which could provide useful feedback about their presence and positions.

I choose ""PRONE"" as my guess because:
- It fits the known pattern: P (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), O (position 3), N (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).
- ""P"" and ""O"" are new letters; if incorrect, they might still reveal if they're in the word elsewhere (e.g., O in position 3 could be yellow if the secret word has O but in the wrong spot).
- ""PRONE"" is a common English word, ensuring validity.

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If P is correct, it gets green; if not, the feedback may show it's in the word but wrong position (yellow) or absent (gray). Similarly for O.
- Since R, N, and E are fixed and will be green, the feedback will focus on positions 1 and 3.

<guess>prone</guess>",prone,"First, the previous guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, letter R is in the word and in the second position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, letter N is in the word and in the fourth position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter E is in the word and in the fifth position)

So, from feedback:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: C is wrong and not in the word, so the first letter cannot be C.
  - Position 2: R is correct! So, the second letter is R.
  - Position 3: A is wrong and not in the word, so the third letter cannot be A.
  - Position 4: N is correct! So, the fourth letter is N.
  - Position 5: E is correct! So, the fifth letter is E.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E

Now, letters that are not in the word: C and A. Since both got ""x"", neither C nor A is in the secret word at all.

Letters that are confirmed in the word: R, N, E. And they are in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

We need to find the first and third letters.

Since C and A are out, we need to choose letters that are not C or A.

Also, the secret word must be a 5-letter English word ending with R _ N E? No: the positions are fixed for R, N, E.

Secret word format: letter1 R letter3 N E

So, it's like ? R ? N E

Now, we need to guess a new 5-letter word that fits this pattern and avoids C and A.

Possible words might include things like ""IRONE"" but ""IRONE"" not a common word; let me think of real words.

Common words ending with N E: but here it's specifically ? R ? N E.

For example, words like ""URINE"": U R I N E, but position 4 is N, yes; position 5 is E, yes.

But ""URINE"" has U in first position, I in third position.

We haven't eliminated U or I yet.

Other options: ""PRUNE"" – P R U N E

""GRIME"" – G R I M E, but position 4 should be N, here it's M, not N. So no.

""BRINE"" – B R I N E

""TRINE"" – T R I N E, which is a word.

""DRONE"" – D R O N E

""FRAME"" – but A is not allowed, since A got x earlier.

A is not in the word, so no A.

Similarly, C not in word.

So, let's list possible guesses that fit the known positions.

Known: position 2 must be R, position 4 must be N, position 5 must be E.

Position 1 and 3 are unknown, and cannot be C or A.

Also, the word must exist.

Possible candidates for guess:

- ""BRINE"": B R I N E

- ""PRONE"": P R O N E? ""PRONE"" – P R O N E, position 3 is O.

- ""URINE"": U R I N E

- ""GRIME"": but position 4 is M, not N – no, secret has N in position 4.

- ""CRANE"" is not possible, since C and A are out.

Other words: ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""BRINE"", etc.

""SUPER"": no, ends with R, not N E.

We need words ending with R ? N E? Pattern is _ R _ N E, so third character before N.

""SHONE"": S H O N E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match.

Only words with R in second position, N in fourth, E in fifth.

So: X R Y N E

Where X and Y are letters, not C or A.

Y can be any letter except those known bad or conflict.

In feedback, we didn't have any yellow (wrong position), only green and gray.

From first guess, we have green for R, N, E at positions 2,4,5, and gray for C and A.

Thus, the third position could be any letter except A, and we don't know about others.

Similarly, first position except C.

Now, to maximize information, since we know three positions are correct, we need to guess letters for position 1 and 3 that might be common and give us more info.

For example, we might want to include letters that are frequent but not yet tested.

In ""CRANE"", we tested C, R, A, N, E.

N and E are common, R is common.

We don't know about vowels like I, O, U, or consonants like B, D, F, etc.

So, for position 1, possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But it has to be a word.

Similarly for position 3.

To get more info, we can choose a word that has new letters and potentially reveals more.

For instance, ""BRINE"": B R I N E – this tests B in position 1 and I in position 3.

If we guess ""BRINE"", and if B is correct, we get green, etc.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E

Or ""TRINE"": T R I N E

Let me think of common words:

- BRINE

- PRONE

- TRINE

- DRONE

- FRENE? Not common

- GROAN but ends with N, not N E

""GRAIN"" but position 4 is I, not N – no.

So, common words: URINE, OZONE? O Z O N E, position 2 is Z, not R – no.

Another: GRONE? Not word.

BRUME? Not common.

Perhaps ""CRONE"" but C is bad, so no.

Since A and C are out, avoid them.

""BRINE"" seems fine.

""PRONE"" is P R O N E, position 3 is O.

""TRINE"" T R I N E

""DRONE"" D R O N E

""FRISE""? Not common.

""SHIRE"" S H I R E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match pattern.

The word must have R in position 2, so first position and third position vary.

Possible X R Y N E

With Y being the third letter.

Now, for our guess, we need to pick a valid English word.

Let's choose one that uses common letters to test.

For example, ""BRINE"" has B and I, which haven't been tested.

Similarly, ""PRONE"" has P and O.

O is a vowel, might be good.

""URINE"" has U and I.

U is less common perhaps.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple possibilities.

Another idea: ""IRATE"" – but I R A T E position 3 is A, which is bad, and position 4 is T, not N – doesn't fit.

List of possible words ending with R?NE:

- BRINE

- DRONE

- PRONE? Prone is P R O N E, yes

- TRINE

- GRONE? Not word

- FRISE? Not

- URINE

- WRING? W R I N G, position 5 is G not E – no, must be E at end.

So: BRINE, DRONE, PRONE, TRINE, URINE. Are there more?

""THINE"" T H I N E, position 2 is H not R – no

""SHINE"" S H I N E, same.

""SPINE"" S P I N E, position 2 is P not R

Unless it's like ""SHRINE"" but that's 6 letters.

All must be 5 letters.

""CRONE"" has C, bad.

""PRUNE"" P R U N E, that's a word.

""GRUMP"" no.

So, PRUNE: P R U N E

Yes.

Also, ""BRUME"" not common.

""TRONE"" not standard.

Or ""DRUSE"" no.

So reasonable words: BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, TRINE, URINE, PRUNE.

Now, for guessing, I should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but all these have unique letters except possibly, but likely.

""BRINE"" - B,R,I,N,E - all unique.

Similarly others.

To get information about other letters, let's look at the board.

We know position 1 is not C, position 3 is not A.

Letters we have not tested: many.

Perhaps I should include a letter that is common but not yet tried, like S, T, D, etc., or vowels I, O, U.

In ""CRANE"", we used A, E, R, N, C. So E and N are confirmed, R confirmed.

Missing common vowels: I, O, U not tested.

Consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

So for a guess, I could use ""BRINE"" to test B and I.

""PRONE"" to test P and O.

""TRONE"" not word, ""TRINE"" tests T and I.

Perhaps ""SHINE"" but doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R, not H.

Only words with R in second position.

Another word: ""BROKE"" B R O K E, position 4 K not N – doesn't fit.

So only possibilities are those mentioned.

""CRUMP"" no.

Perhaps ""GRASP"" G R A S P, but A is bad, and position 4 S not N.

Not.

So, I think BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, PRUNE are candidates.

""DRONE"" D R O N E

Let me choose one that includes a vowel untested.

I am considering ""PRONE"": P R O N E

This way, we test P in position 1 and O in position 3.

If O is not in the word, or position.

Similarly, if P is not.

But since we know R, N, E are fixed, the feedback for position 1 and 3 will tell us about P and O.

For example, if for ""PRONE"", position 1: if P is correct, green; if not correct but in word, yellow; if not in word, gray.

Similarly for position 3 O.

But O in position 3: if secret word has O elsewhere, but in our pattern, position 3 is unknown.

In ""PRONE"", position 3 is O.

We could get different feedback.

Similarly, other words.

To speed up, since we know R,N,E are correct, the word must be one of the options I listed.

But we have only 6 tries, so we might not need to guess one directly; we can get more info first.

For instance, if I guess ""BRINE"", and B and I are wrong, but since R,N,E are already known, it might not give full info if, say, I is in the word but not position 3.

But in this case, if for ""BRINE"", feedback shows:

- Position 1 B: could be green, yellow, or gray.

- Position 2 R: should be green, unless something wrong, but it is fixed green.

Position 4 N green, position 5 E green.

Position 3 I: could be green or yellow or gray.

Similarly for others.

Now, specifically for position 1, if it gets gray, it means B is not in the word.

Similarly, if yellow, it might be in wrong position, but since position 2 is R, position 4 N, position 5 E, and B is only in position 1 for now, if B is in the word, it must be in position 1 or position 3? No, position 3 for I in BRINE, but secret can have B elsewhere.

In the secret word format _ R _ N E, possible positions for B are only position 1 or position 3, since position 2 is R, 4 N, 5 E.

Similarly for any letter.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2,4,5 fixed: 2=R, 4=N, 5=E

So variable positions: 1 and 3.

Any letter not R,N,E must be in position 1 or 3.

And R,N,E are in their positions.

Now, for a guess with new letters, say ""PRONE"": P R O N E

If P is not in the word, feedback position 1 x

If P is in the word, it could only be position 1 or 3, so if not green, it might be yellow if in position 3, but since position 3 is O in this guess, if O is wrong, but P might be yellow.

Similarly.

But I think it's fine.

Since we need to guess, I'll go with ""PRONE"" to test P and O.

Or ""DRONE"" for D and O.

Perhaps ""TRINE"" for T and I.

""URINE"" for U and I.

U is less common, so better to avoid.

O is more common vowel.

I am leaning towards ""PRONE"".

Let's confirm it's a valid word; yes, prone is a word meaning susceptible or lying face down.

Similarly.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" but C bad and doesn't fit pattern.

So, I'll go with ""PRONE"".

So my second guess is ""PRONE"".

Let me think of the format.

Response should be <guess>prone</guess>

But first, thought process in thinking.Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x), so I avoid C in future guesses.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 2.
- A is not in the word (x), so I avoid A in future guesses.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 4.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 5.

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E, where the first and third positions are unknown letters that are not C or A. The goal now is to guess a new word that fits this pattern and tests potential letters for positions 1 and 3, while gathering more information.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that starts with a letter not C or A, has R in position 2, some letter in position 3 (not A or C), N in position 4, and E in position 5. Possible candidates include words like ""BRINE,"" ""DRONE,"" ""PRONE,"" ""TRINE,"" or ""URINE."" 

To maximize information:
- I should test new common letters that haven't been used yet. In ""crane,"" we tested C, R, A, N, E. R, N, and E are confirmed and fixed, so I need to focus on untested letters for positions 1 and 3, such as vowels like I, O, U or consonants like B, D, P, T.
- Words like ""BRINE"" (testing B and I) or ""PRONE"" (testing P and O) are good options. ""PRONE"" includes the letter O (a common vowel not yet tested) and P (a common consonant), which could provide useful feedback about their presence and positions.

I choose ""PRONE"" as my guess because:
- It fits the known pattern: P (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), O (position 3), N (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).
- ""P"" and ""O"" are new letters; if incorrect, they might still reveal if they're in the word elsewhere (e.g., O in position 3 could be yellow if the secret word has O but in the wrong spot).
- ""PRONE"" is a common English word, ensuring validity.

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If P is correct, it gets green; if not, the feedback may show it's in the word but wrong position (yellow) or absent (gray). Similarly for O.
- Since R, N, and E are fixed and will be green, the feedback will focus on positions 1 and 3.",Guess 2: prone -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BRINE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, letter R is in the word and in the second position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, letter N is in the word and in the fourth position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter E is in the word and in the fifth position)

So, from feedback:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: C is wrong and not in the word, so the first letter cannot be C.
  - Position 2: R is correct! So, the second letter is R.
  - Position 3: A is wrong and not in the word, so the third letter cannot be A.
  - Position 4: N is correct! So, the fourth letter is N.
  - Position 5: E is correct! So, the fifth letter is E.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E

Now, letters that are not in the word: C and A. Since both got ""x"", neither C nor A is in the secret word at all.

Letters that are confirmed in the word: R, N, E. And they are in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

We need to find the first and third letters.

Since C and A are out, we need to choose letters that are not C or A.

Also, the secret word must be a 5-letter English word ending with R _ N E? No: the positions are fixed for R, N, E.

Secret word format: letter1 R letter3 N E

So, it's like ? R ? N E

Now, we need to guess a new 5-letter word that fits this pattern and avoids C and A.

Possible words might include things like ""IRONE"" but ""IRONE"" not a common word; let me think of real words.

Common words ending with N E: but here it's specifically ? R ? N E.

For example, words like ""URINE"": U R I N E, but position 4 is N, yes; position 5 is E, yes.

But ""URINE"" has U in first position, I in third position.

We haven't eliminated U or I yet.

Other options: ""PRUNE"" – P R U N E

""GRIME"" – G R I M E, but position 4 should be N, here it's M, not N. So no.

""BRINE"" – B R I N E

""TRINE"" – T R I N E, which is a word.

""DRONE"" – D R O N E

""FRAME"" – but A is not allowed, since A got x earlier.

A is not in the word, so no A.

Similarly, C not in word.

So, let's list possible guesses that fit the known positions.

Known: position 2 must be R, position 4 must be N, position 5 must be E.

Position 1 and 3 are unknown, and cannot be C or A.

Also, the word must exist.

Possible candidates for guess:

- ""BRINE"": B R I N E

- ""PRONE"": P R O N E? ""PRONE"" – P R O N E, position 3 is O.

- ""URINE"": U R I N E

- ""GRIME"": but position 4 is M, not N – no, secret has N in position 4.

- ""CRANE"" is not possible, since C and A are out.

Other words: ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""BRINE"", etc.

""SUPER"": no, ends with R, not N E.

We need words ending with R ? N E? Pattern is _ R _ N E, so third character before N.

""SHONE"": S H O N E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match.

Only words with R in second position, N in fourth, E in fifth.

So: X R Y N E

Where X and Y are letters, not C or A.

Y can be any letter except those known bad or conflict.

In feedback, we didn't have any yellow (wrong position), only green and gray.

From first guess, we have green for R, N, E at positions 2,4,5, and gray for C and A.

Thus, the third position could be any letter except A, and we don't know about others.

Similarly, first position except C.

Now, to maximize information, since we know three positions are correct, we need to guess letters for position 1 and 3 that might be common and give us more info.

For example, we might want to include letters that are frequent but not yet tested.

In ""CRANE"", we tested C, R, A, N, E.

N and E are common, R is common.

We don't know about vowels like I, O, U, or consonants like B, D, F, etc.

So, for position 1, possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But it has to be a word.

Similarly for position 3.

To get more info, we can choose a word that has new letters and potentially reveals more.

For instance, ""BRINE"": B R I N E – this tests B in position 1 and I in position 3.

If we guess ""BRINE"", and if B is correct, we get green, etc.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E

Or ""TRINE"": T R I N E

Let me think of common words:

- BRINE

- PRONE

- TRINE

- DRONE

- FRENE? Not common

- GROAN but ends with N, not N E

""GRAIN"" but position 4 is I, not N – no.

So, common words: URINE, OZONE? O Z O N E, position 2 is Z, not R – no.

Another: GRONE? Not word.

BRUME? Not common.

Perhaps ""CRONE"" but C is bad, so no.

Since A and C are out, avoid them.

""BRINE"" seems fine.

""PRONE"" is P R O N E, position 3 is O.

""TRINE"" T R I N E

""DRONE"" D R O N E

""FRISE""? Not common.

""SHIRE"" S H I R E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match pattern.

The word must have R in position 2, so first position and third position vary.

Possible X R Y N E

With Y being the third letter.

Now, for our guess, we need to pick a valid English word.

Let's choose one that uses common letters to test.

For example, ""BRINE"" has B and I, which haven't been tested.

Similarly, ""PRONE"" has P and O.

O is a vowel, might be good.

""URINE"" has U and I.

U is less common perhaps.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple possibilities.

But since two positions are unknown, we need to guess.

Another idea: ""IRATE"" – but I R A T E position 3 is A, which is bad, and position 4 is T, not N – doesn't fit.

So only specific words fit the pattern.

List of possible words ending with R?NE:

- BRINE

- DRONE

- PRONE? Prone is P R O N E, yes

- TRINE

- GRONE? Not word

- FRISE? Not

- URINE

- WRING? W R I N G, position 5 is G not E – no, must be E at end.

So: BRINE, DRONE, PRONE, TRINE, URINE. Are there more?

""THINE"" T H I N E, position 2 is H not R – no

""SHINE"" S H I N E, same.

""SPINE"" S P I N E, position 2 is P not R

Unless it's like ""SHRINE"" but that's 6 letters.

All must be 5 letters.

""CRONE"" has C, bad.

""PRUNE"" P R U N E, that's a word.

""GRUMP"" no.

So, PRUNE: P R U N E

Yes.

Also, ""BRUME"" not common.

""TRONE"" not standard.

Or ""DRUSE"" no.

So reasonable words: BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, TRINE, URINE, PRUNE.

Now, for guessing, I should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but all these have unique letters except possibly, but likely.

""BRINE"" - B,R,I,N,E - all unique.

Similarly others.

To get information about other letters, let's look at the board.

We know position 1 is not C, position 3 is not A.

Letters we have not tested: many.

Perhaps I should include a letter that is common but not yet tried, like S, T, D, etc., or vowels I, O, U.

In ""CRANE"", we used A, E, R, N, C. So E and N are confirmed, R confirmed.

Missing common vowels: I, O, U not tested.

Consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

So for a guess, I could use ""BRINE"" to test B and I.

""PRONE"" to test P and O.

""TRONE"" not word, ""TRINE"" tests T and I.

Perhaps ""SHINE"" but doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R, not H.

Only words with R in second position.

Another word: ""BROKE"" B R O K E, position 4 K not N – doesn't fit.

So only possibilities are those mentioned.

""CRUMP"" no.

Perhaps ""GRASP"" G R A S P, but A is bad, and position 4 S not N.

Not.

So, I think BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, PRUNE are candidates.

""DRONE"" D R O N E

Let me choose one that includes a vowel untested.

I am considering ""PRONE"": P R O N E

This way, we test P in position 1 and O in position 3.

If O is not in the word, or position.

Similarly, if P is not.

But since we know R, N, E are fixed, the feedback for position 1 and 3 will tell us about P and O.

For example, if for ""PRONE"", position 1: if P is correct, green; if not correct but in word, yellow; if not in word, gray.

Similarly for position 3 O.

But O in position 3: if secret word has O elsewhere, but in our pattern, position 3 is unknown.

In ""PRONE"", position 3 is O.

We could get different feedback.

Similarly, other words.

To speed up, since we know R,N,E are correct, the word must be one of the options I listed.

But we have only 6 tries, so we might not need to guess one directly; we can get more info first.

For instance, if I guess ""BRINE"", and B and I are wrong, but since R,N,E are already known, it might not give full info if, say, I is in the word but not position 3.

But in this case, if for ""BRINE"", feedback shows:

- Position 1 B: could be green, yellow, or gray.

- Position 2 R: should be green, unless something wrong, but it is fixed green.

Position 4 N green, position 5 E green.

Position 3 I: could be green or yellow or gray.

Similarly for others.

Now, specifically for position 1, if it gets gray, it means B is not in the word.

Similarly, if yellow, it might be in wrong position, but since position 2 is R, position 4 N, position 5 E, and B is only in position 1 for now, if B is in the word, it must be in position 1 or position 3? No, position 3 for I in BRINE, but secret can have B elsewhere.

In the secret word format _ R _ N E, possible positions for B are only position 1 or position 3, since position 2 is R, 4 N, 5 E.

Similarly for any letter.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2,4,5 fixed: 2=R, 4=N, 5=E

So variable positions: 1 and 3.

Any letter not R,N,E must be in position 1 or 3.

And R,N,E are in their positions.

Now, for a guess with new letters, say ""PRONE"": P R O N E

If P is not in the word, feedback position 1 x

If P is in the word, it could only be position 1 or 3, so if not green, it might be yellow if in position 3, but since position 3 is O in this guess, if O is wrong, but P might be yellow.

Similarly.

But I think it's fine.

Since we need to guess, I'll go with ""PRONE"" to test P and O.

Or ""DRONE"" for D and O.

Perhaps ""TRINE"" for T and I.

""URINE"" for U and I.

U is less common, so better to avoid.

O is more common vowel.

I am leaning towards ""PRONE"".

Let's confirm it's a valid word; yes, prone is a word meaning susceptible or lying face down.

Similarly.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" but C bad and doesn't fit pattern.

So, I'll go with ""PRONE"".

So my second guess is ""PRONE"".

Let me think of the format.

Response should be <guess>prone</guess>

But first, thought process in thinking.Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x), so I avoid C in future guesses.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 2.
- A is not in the word (x), so I avoid A in future guesses.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 4.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 5.

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E, where the first and third positions are unknown letters that are not C or A. The goal now is to guess a new word that fits this pattern and tests potential letters for positions 1 and 3, while gathering more information.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that starts with a letter not C or A, has R in position 2, some letter in position 3 (not A or C), N in position 4, and E in position 5. Possible candidates include words like ""BRINE,"" ""DRONE,"" ""PRONE,"" ""TRINE,"" or ""URINE."" 

To maximize information:
- I should test new common letters that haven't been used yet. In ""crane,"" we tested C, R, A, N, E. R, N, and E are confirmed and fixed, so I need to focus on untested letters for positions 1 and 3, such as vowels like I, O, U or consonants like B, D, P, T.
- Words like ""BRINE"" (testing B and I) or ""PRONE"" (testing P and O) are good options. ""PRONE"" includes the letter O (a common vowel not yet tested) and P (a common consonant), which could provide useful feedback about their presence and positions.

I choose ""PRONE"" as my guess because:
- It fits the known pattern: P (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), O (position 3), N (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).
- ""P"" and ""O"" are new letters; if incorrect, they might still reveal if they're in the word elsewhere (e.g., O in position 3 could be yellow if the secret word has O but in the wrong spot).
- ""PRONE"" is a common English word, ensuring validity.

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If P is correct, it gets green; if not, the feedback may show it's in the word but wrong position (yellow) or absent (gray). Similarly for O.
- Since R, N, and E are fixed and will be green, the feedback will focus on positions 1 and 3.

""PRONE"" – P R O N E, position 3 is O.\n\n- ""URINE"": U R I N E\n\n- ""GRIME"": but position 4 is M, not N – no, secret has N in position 4.\n\n- ""CRANE"" is not possible, since C and A are out.\n\nOther words: ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""BRINE"", etc.\n\n""SUPER"": no, ends with R, not N E.\n\nWe need words ending with R ? N E? Pattern is _ R _ N E, so third character before N.\n\n""SHONE"": S H O N E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn\'t match.\n\nOnly words with R in second position, N in fourth, E in fifth.\n\nSo: X R Y N E\n\nWhere X and Y are letters, not C or A.\n\nY can be any letter except those known bad or conflict.\n\nIn feedback, we didn\'t have any yellow (wrong position), only green and gray.\n\nFrom first guess, we have green for R, N, E at positions 2,4,5, and gray for C and A.\n\nThus, the third position could be any letter except A, and we don\'t know about others.\n\nSimilarly, first position except C.\n\nNow, to maximize information, since we know three positions are correct, we need to guess letters for position 1 and 3 that might be common and give us more info.\n\nFor example, we might want to include letters that are frequent but not yet tested.\n\nIn ""CRANE"", we tested C, R, A, N, E.\n\nN and E are common, R is common.\n\nWe don\'t know about vowels like I, O, U, or consonants like B, D, F, etc.\n\nSo, for position 1, possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But it has to be a word.\n\nSimilarly for position 3.\n\nTo get more info, we can choose a word that has new letters and potentially reveals more.\n\nFor instance, ""BRINE"": B R I N E – this tests B in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nIf we guess ""BRINE"", and if B is correct, we get green, etc.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E\n\nOr ""TRINE"": T R I N E\n\nLet me think of common words:\n\n- BRINE\n\n- PRONE\n\n- TRINE\n\n- DRONE\n\n- FRENE? Not common\n\n- GROAN but ends with N, not N E\n\n""GRAIN"" but position 4 is I, not N – no.\n\nSo, common words: URINE, OZONE? O Z O N E, position 2 is Z, not R – no.\n\nAnother: GRONE? Not word.\n\nBRUME? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""CRONE"" but C is bad, so no.\n\nSince A and C are out, avoid them.\n\n""BRINE"" seems fine.\n\n""PRONE"" is P R O N E, position 3 is O.\n\n""TRINE"" T R I N E\n\n""DRONE"" D R O N E\n\n""FRISE""? Not common.\n\n""SHIRE"" S H I R E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn\'t match pattern.\n\nThe word must have R in position 2, so first position and third position vary.\n\nPossible X R Y N E\n\nWith Y being the third letter.\n\nNow, for our guess, we need to pick a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s choose one that uses common letters to test.\n\nFor example, ""BRINE"" has B and I, which haven\'t been tested.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRONE"" has P and O.\n\nO is a vowel, might be good.\n\n""URINE"" has U and I.\n\nU is less common perhaps.\n\nTo cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple possibilities.\n\nBut since two positions are unknown, we need to guess.\n\nAnother idea: ""IRATE"" – but I R A T E position 3 is A, which is bad, and position 4 is T, not N – doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo only specific words fit the pattern.\n\nList of possible words ending with R?NE:\n\n- BRINE\n\n- DRONE\n\n- PRONE? Prone is P R O N E, yes\n\n- TRINE\n\n- GRONE? Not word\n\n- FRISE? Not\n\n- URINE\n\n- WRING? W R I N G, position 5 is G not E – no, must be E at end.\n\nSo: BRINE, DRONE, PRONE, TRINE, URINE. Are there more?\n\n""THINE"" T H I N E, position 2 is H not R – no\n\n""SHINE"" S H I N E, same.\n\n""SPINE"" S P I N E, position 2 is P not R\n\nUnless it\'s like ""SHRINE"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nAll must be 5 letters.\n\n""CRONE"" has C, bad.\n\n""PRUNE"" P R U N E, that\'s a word.\n\n""GRUMP"" no.\n\nSo, PRUNE: P R U N E\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, ""BRUME"" not common.\n\n""TRONE"" not standard.\n\nOr ""DRUSE"" no.\n\nSo reasonable words: BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, TRINE, URINE, PRUNE.\n\nNow, for guessing, I should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but all these have unique letters except possibly, but likely.\n\n""BRINE"" - B,R,I,N,E - all unique.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nTo get information about other letters, let\'s look at the board.\n\nWe know position 1 is not C, position 3 is not A.\n\nLetters we have not tested: many.\n\nPerhaps I should include a letter that is common but not yet tried, like S, T, D, etc., or vowels I, O, U.\n\nIn ""CRANE"", we used A, E, R, N, C. So E and N are confirmed, R confirmed.\n\nMissing common vowels: I, O, U not tested.\n\nConsonants like S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nSo for a guess, I could use ""BRINE"" to test B and I.\n\n""PRONE"" to test P and O.\n\n""TRONE"" not word, ""TRINE"" tests T and I.\n\nPerhaps ""SHINE"" but doesn\'t fit the pattern because position 2 must be R, not H.\n\nOnly words with R in second position.\n\nAnother word: ""BROKE"" B R O K E, position 4 K not N – doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo only possibilities are those mentioned.\n\n""CRUMP"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""GRASP"" G R A S P, but A is bad, and position 4 S not N.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, I think BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, PRUNE are candidates.\n\n""DRONE"" D R O N E\n\nLet me choose one that includes a vowel untested.\n\nI am considering ""PRONE"": P R O N E\n\nThis way, we test P in position 1 and O in position 3.\n\nIf O is not in the word, or position.\n\nSimilarly, if P is not.\n\nBut since we know R, N, E are fixed, the feedback for position 1 and 3 will tell us about P and O.\n\nFor example, if for ""PRONE"", position 1: if P is correct, green; if not correct but in word, yellow; if not in word, gray.\n\nSimilarly for position 3 O.\n\nBut O in position 3: if secret word has O elsewhere, but in our pattern, position 3 is unknown.\n\nIn ""PRONE"", position 3 is O.\n\nWe could get different feedback.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nTo speed up, since we know R,N,E are correct, the word must be one of the options I listed.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, so we might not need to guess one directly; we can get more info first.\n\nFor instance, if I guess ""BRINE"", and B and I are wrong, but since R,N,E are already known, it might not give full info if, say, I is in the word but not position 3.\n\nBut in this case, if for ""BRINE"", feedback shows:\n\n- Position 1 B: could be green, yellow, or gray.\n\n- Position 2 R: should be green, unless something wrong, but it is fixed green.\n\nPosition 4 N green, position 5 E green.\n\nPosition 3 I: could be green or yellow or gray.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, specifically for position 1, if it gets gray, it means B is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, if yellow, it might be in wrong position, but since position 2 is R, position 4 N, position 5 E, and B is only in position 1 for now, if B is in the word, it must be in position 1 or position 3? No, position 3 for I in BRINE, but secret can have B elsewhere.\n\nIn the secret word format _ R _ N E, possible positions for B are only position 1 or position 3, since position 2 is R, 4 N, 5 E.\n\nSimilarly for any letter.\n\nPositions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n2,4,5 fixed: 2=R, 4=N, 5=E\n\nSo variable positions: 1 and 3.\n\nAny letter not R,N,E must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nAnd R,N,E are in their positions.\n\nNow, for a guess with new letters, say ""PRONE"": P R O N E\n\nIf P is not in the word, feedback position 1 x\n\nIf P is in the word, it could only be position 1 or 3, so if not green, it might be yellow if in position 3, but since position 3 is O in this guess, if O is wrong, but P might be yellow.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I think it\'s fine.\n\nSince we need to guess, I\'ll go with ""PRONE"" to test P and O.\n\nOr ""DRONE"" for D and O.\n\nPerhaps ""TRINE"" for T and I.\n\n""URINE"" for U and I.\n\nU is less common, so better to avoid.\n\nO is more common vowel.\n\nI am leaning towards ""PRONE"".\n\nLet\'s confirm it\'s a valid word; yes, prone is a word meaning susceptible or lying face down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CRISP"" but C bad and doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRONE"".\n\nSo my second guess is ""PRONE"".\n\nLet me think of the format.\n\nResponse should be <guess>prone</guess>\n\nBut first, thought process in thinking.Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word (x), so I avoid C in future guesses.\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 2.\n- A is not in the word (x), so I avoid A in future guesses.\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 4.\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 5.\n\nThis means the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E, where the first and third positions are unknown letters that are not C or A. The goal now is to guess a new word that fits this pattern and tests potential letters for positions 1 and 3, while gathering more information.\n\nI need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that starts with a letter not C or A, has R in position 2, some letter in position 3 (not A or C), N in position 4, and E in position 5. Possible candidates include words like ""BRINE,"" ""DRONE,"" ""PRONE,"" ""TRINE,"" or ""URINE."" \n\nTo maximize information:\n- I should test new common letters that haven\'t been used yet. In ""crane,"" we tested C, R, A, N, E. R, N, and E are confirmed and fixed, so I need to focus on untested letters for positions 1 and 3, such as vowels like I, O, U or consonants like B, D, P, T.\n- Words like ""BRINE"" (testing B and I) or ""PRONE"" (testing P and O) are good options. ""PRONE"" includes the letter O (a common vowel not yet tested) and P (a common consonant), which could provide useful feedback about their presence and positions.\n\nI choose ""PRONE"" as my guess because:\n- It fits the known pattern: P (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), O (position 3), N (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).\n- ""P"" and ""O"" are new letters; if incorrect, they might still reveal if they\'re in the word elsewhere (e.g., O in position 3 could be yellow if the secret word has O but in the wrong spot).\n- ""PRONE"" is a common English word, ensuring validity.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down possibilities:\n- If P is correct, it gets green; if not, the feedback may show it\'s in the word but wrong position (yellow) or absent (gray). Similarly for O.\n- Since R, N, and E are fixed and will be green, the feedback will focus on positions 1 and 3.\n\n<guess>prone</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prone -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Based on the feedback from the two guesses:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""):
  - C: x (not in the word at all)
  - R: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 2)
  - A: x (not in the word at all)
  - N: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 4)
  - E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 5)
  Therefore, the secret word must have the form _ R _ N E, and it cannot contain C or A.

- From Guess 2 (""prone""):
  - P: x (not in the word at all)
  - R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
  - O: x (not in the word at all)
  - N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
  - E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)
  So, P and O are also not in the word. This means the secret word contains none of C, A, P, or O.

Given that, the secret word is _ R _ N E, and the missing letters (position 1 and 3) must be letters that are not C, A, P, or O. Also, since R, N, E are fixed and confirmed, only positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

Letters not in the word: C, A, P, O

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3 include consonants like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels like U, I, etc., but avoiding C, A, P, O.

Now, I need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ N E and uses only letters not excluded, to test possible options.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ R _ N E:
- ""BRINE"": B R I N E
- ""TRINE"": T R I N E
- ""DRONE"": But drone has O, which is now excluded, so invalid.
- ""URINE"": U R I N E
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E, but position 4 needs to be N; ""GRIME"" has M in position 4, not N. So not matching.
- ""SHINE"": But position 2 must be R, not H.
- ""THINE"": Similarly, position 2 H.

Valid options I can guess: ""BRINE"", ""TRINE"", ""URINE"". ""PRUNE"" has O? No, prune is P R U N E, but P is excluded now. And O? Prune has U, but P is bad.

""PRUNE"" contains P, which is not in the word, so I cannot use it.

Similarly, ""DRONE"" contains O, excluded.

So remaining: ""BRINE"" (B R I N E), ""TRINE"" (T R I N E), ""URINE"" (U R I N E).

I could also think of less common words, but these are standard.

Now, to decide which to guess, I need to test new letters for more information. For example:
- In ""BRINE"", I test B and I.
- In ""TRINE"", I test T and I.
- In ""URINE"", I test U and I.

Since I is common to all, testing I is efficient. Then, choosing among B, T, U.

U is less common than B or T, so perhaps avoid it for now.

T is very common, B is also common.

I could choose ""BRINE"" to test B, and if B is wrong, I can move to TRINE.

Similarly, TRINE tests T.

But I have limited guesses; only 4 left? We have used 2 guesses, so 4 remaining.

Since R,N,E are fixed, the word must be one of the few possibilities like BRINE, TRINE, URINE.

If I guess one, it might solve it or give info.

To maximize information, I could guess a word that includes more than one possibility, but since pattern is fixed, no.

Note that in position 3, it could be I or other letters.

For example, is there another word? ""CRINE"" not word and C bad.

""WRINE"" not word.

""FRINE""? Not standard.

So probably BRINE, TRINE, URINE are the main options.

Another one: ""GRENE""? Not word.

Perhaps ""BRINE"" is good.

Since U is vowel but less common, I might avoid URINE for now.

Between B and T, B is as common as T perhaps.

I can guess TRINE, or BRINE.

Let me pick TRINE: T R I N E.

This tests T and I.

If T is in position 1, and I in position 3.

If not, feedback will show.

Similarly, if I guess wrong, it narrows down.

I'll go with TRINE.

So, guess: ""TRINE"".

Thought process:

- Secret word format: position 1 unknown, position 2 R (fixed), position 3 unknown, position 4 N (fixed), position 5 E (fixed).
- Excluded letters: C, A, P, O (all gray from previous, so not in word).
- Common possible words: BRINE, TRINE, URINE.
- Choose TRINE to test common letters T and I: if T is correct, we solve; if not, but yellow or gray, we learn.

<guess>trine</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C and A are not in the word (x), R is in position 2 (✓), N is in position 4 (✓), E is in position 5 (✓). This shows the secret word pattern is _ R _ N E, excluding C and A.
- From ""prone"": P and O are not in the word (x), R, N, and E are confirmed in their positions (✓). This adds P and O to the exclusion list.

The secret word is still _ R _ N E, with letters not C, A, P, or O. Only positions 1 and 3 are unknown. Possible words fitting this pattern include ""BRINE"" (B R I N E), ""TRINE"" (T R I N E), or ""URINE"" (U R I N E). 

I choose ""TRINE"" to test T in position 1 and I in position 3, as ""TRINE"" is a common word that uses untested letters. T is a frequent starting letter, and I is a common vowel not yet evaluated. If T or I is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the options among the remaining possibilities.

<guess>trine</guess>",trine,"Based on the feedback from the two guesses:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""):
  - C: x (not in the word at all)
  - R: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 2)
  - A: x (not in the word at all)
  - N: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 4)
  - E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 5)
  Therefore, the secret word must have the form _ R _ N E, and it cannot contain C or A.

- From Guess 2 (""prone""):
  - P: x (not in the word at all)
  - R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
  - O: x (not in the word at all)
  - N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
  - E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)
  So, P and O are also not in the word. This means the secret word contains none of C, A, P, or O.

Given that, the secret word is _ R _ N E, and the missing letters (position 1 and 3) must be letters that are not C, A, P, or O. Also, since R, N, E are fixed and confirmed, only positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

Letters not in the word: C, A, P, O

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3 include consonants like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels like U, I, etc., but avoiding C, A, P, O.

Now, I need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ N E and uses only letters not excluded, to test possible options.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ R _ N E:
- ""BRINE"": B R I N E
- ""TRINE"": T R I N E
- ""DRONE"": But drone has O, which is now excluded, so invalid.
- ""URINE"": U R I N E
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E, but position 4 needs to be N; ""GRIME"" has M in position 4, not N. So not matching.
- ""SHINE"": But position 2 must be R, not H.
- ""THINE"": Similarly, position 2 H.

Valid options I can guess: ""BRINE"", ""TRINE"", ""URINE"". ""PRUNE"" has O? No, prune is P R U N E, but P is excluded now. And O? Prune has U, but P is bad.

""PRUNE"" contains P, which is not in the word, so I cannot use it.

Similarly, ""DRONE"" contains O, excluded.

So remaining: ""BRINE"" (B R I N E), ""TRINE"" (T R I N E), ""URINE"" (U R I N E).

I could also think of less common words, but these are standard.

Now, to decide which to guess, I need to test new letters for more information. For example:
- In ""BRINE"", I test B and I.
- In ""TRINE"", I test T and I.
- In ""URINE"", I test U and I.

Since I is common to all, testing I is efficient. Then, choosing among B, T, U.

U is less common than B or T, so perhaps avoid it for now.

T is very common, B is also common.

I could choose ""BRINE"" to test B, and if B is wrong, I can move to TRINE.

Similarly, TRINE tests T.

But I have limited guesses; only 4 left? We have used 2 guesses, so 4 remaining.

Since R,N,E are fixed, the word must be one of the few possibilities like BRINE, TRINE, URINE.

If I guess one, it might solve it or give info.

To maximize information, I could guess a word that includes more than one possibility, but since pattern is fixed, no.

Note that in position 3, it could be I or other letters.

For example, is there another word? ""CRINE"" not word and C bad.

""WRINE"" not word.

""FRINE""? Not standard.

So probably BRINE, TRINE, URINE are the main options.

Another one: ""GRENE""? Not word.

Perhaps ""BRINE"" is good.

Since U is vowel but less common, I might avoid URINE for now.

Between B and T, B is as common as T perhaps.

I can guess TRINE, or BRINE.

Let me pick TRINE: T R I N E.

This tests T and I.

If T is in position 1, and I in position 3.

If not, feedback will show.

Similarly, if I guess wrong, it narrows down.

I'll go with TRINE.

So, guess: ""TRINE"".

Thought process:

- Secret word format: position 1 unknown, position 2 R (fixed), position 3 unknown, position 4 N (fixed), position 5 E (fixed).
- Excluded letters: C, A, P, O (all gray from previous, so not in word).
- Common possible words: BRINE, TRINE, URINE.
- Choose TRINE to test common letters T and I: if T is correct, we solve; if not, but yellow or gray, we learn.

<guess>trine</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BRINE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, letter R is in the word and in the second position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, letter N is in the word and in the fourth position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter E is in the word and in the fifth position)

So, from feedback:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: C is wrong and not in the word, so the first letter cannot be C.
  - Position 2: R is correct! So, the second letter is R.
  - Position 3: A is wrong and not in the word, so the third letter cannot be A.
  - Position 4: N is correct! So, the fourth letter is N.
  - Position 5: E is correct! So, the fifth letter is E.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E

Now, letters that are not in the word: C and A. Since both got ""x"", neither C nor A is in the secret word at all.

Letters that are confirmed in the word: R, N, E. And they are in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

We need to find the first and third letters.

Since C and A are out, we need to choose letters that are not C or A.

Also, the secret word must be a 5-letter English word ending with R _ N E? No: the positions are fixed for R, N, E.

Secret word format: letter1 R letter3 N E

So, it's like ? R ? N E

Now, we need to guess a new 5-letter word that fits this pattern and avoids C and A.

Possible words might include things like ""IRONE"" but ""IRONE"" not a common word; let me think of real words.

Common words ending with N E: but here it's specifically ? R ? N E.

For example, words like ""URINE"": U R I N E, but position 4 is N, yes; position 5 is E, yes.

But ""URINE"" has U in first position, I in third position.

We haven't eliminated U or I yet.

Other options: ""PRUNE"" – P R U N E

""GRIME"" – G R I M E, but position 4 should be N, here it's M, not N. So no.

""BRINE"" – B R I N E

""TRINE"" – T R I N E, which is a word.

""DRONE"" – D R O N E

""FRAME"" – but A is not allowed, since A got x earlier.

A is not in the word, so no A.

Similarly, C not in word.

So, let's list possible guesses that fit the known positions.

Known: position 2 must be R, position 4 must be N, position 5 must be E.

Position 1 and 3 are unknown, and cannot be C or A.

Also, the word must exist.

Possible candidates for guess:

- ""BRINE"": B R I N E

- ""PRONE"": P R O N E? ""PRONE"" – P R O N E, position 3 is O.

- ""URINE"": U R I N E

- ""GRIME"": but position 4 is M, not N – no, secret has N in position 4.

- ""CRANE"" is not possible, since C and A are out.

Other words: ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""BRINE"", etc.

""SUPER"": no, ends with R, not N E.

We need words ending with R ? N E? Pattern is _ R _ N E, so third character before N.

""SHONE"": S H O N E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match.

Only words with R in second position, N in fourth, E in fifth.

So: X R Y N E

Where X and Y are letters, not C or A.

Y can be any letter except those known bad or conflict.

In feedback, we didn't have any yellow (wrong position), only green and gray.

From first guess, we have green for R, N, E at positions 2,4,5, and gray for C and A.

Thus, the third position could be any letter except A, and we don't know about others.

Similarly, first position except C.

Now, to maximize information, since we know three positions are correct, we need to guess letters for position 1 and 3 that might be common and give us more info.

For example, we might want to include letters that are frequent but not yet tested.

In ""CRANE"", we tested C, R, A, N, E.

N and E are common, R is common.

We don't know about vowels like I, O, U, or consonants like B, D, F, etc.

So, for position 1, possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But it has to be a word.

Similarly for position 3.

To get more info, we can choose a word that has new letters and potentially reveals more.

For instance, ""BRINE"": B R I N E – this tests B in position 1 and I in position 3.

If we guess ""BRINE"", and if B is correct, we get green, etc.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E

Or ""TRINE"": T R I N E

Let me think of common words:

- BRINE

- PRONE

- TRINE

- DRONE

- FRENE? Not common

- GROAN but ends with N, not N E

""GRAIN"" but position 4 is I, not N – no.

So, common words: URINE, OZONE? O Z O N E, position 2 is Z, not R – no.

Another: GRONE? Not word.

BRUME? Not common.

Perhaps ""CRONE"" but C is bad, so no.

Since A and C are out, avoid them.

""BRINE"" seems fine.

""PRONE"" is P R O N E, position 3 is O.

""TRINE"" T R I N E

""DRONE"" D R O N E

""FRISE""? Not common.

""SHIRE"" S H I R E – position 2 is H, not R – doesn't match pattern.

The word must have R in position 2, so first position and third position vary.

Possible X R Y N E

With Y being the third letter.

Now, for our guess, we need to pick a valid English word.

Let's choose one that uses common letters to test.

For example, ""BRINE"" has B and I, which haven't been tested.

Similarly, ""PRONE"" has P and O.

O is a vowel, might be good.

""URINE"" has U and I.

U is less common perhaps.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple possibilities.

But since two positions are unknown, we need to guess.

Another idea: ""IRATE"" – but I R A T E position 3 is A, which is bad, and position 4 is T, not N – doesn't fit.

So only specific words fit the pattern.

List of possible words ending with R?NE:

- BRINE

- DRONE

- PRONE? Prone is P R O N E, yes

- TRINE

- GRONE? Not word

- FRISE? Not

- URINE

- WRING? W R I N G, position 5 is G not E – no, must be E at end.

So: BRINE, DRONE, PRONE, TRINE, URINE. Are there more?

""THINE"" T H I N E, position 2 is H not R – no

""SHINE"" S H I N E, same.

""SPINE"" S P I N E, position 2 is P not R

Unless it's like ""SHRINE"" but that's 6 letters.

All must be 5 letters.

""CRONE"" has C, bad.

""PRUNE"" P R U N E, that's a word.

""GRUMP"" no.

So, PRUNE: P R U N E

Yes.

Also, ""BRUME"" not common.

""TRONE"" not standard.

Or ""DRUSE"" no.

So reasonable words: BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, TRINE, URINE, PRUNE.

Now, for guessing, I should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but all these have unique letters except possibly, but likely.

""BRINE"" - B,R,I,N,E - all unique.

Similarly others.

To get information about other letters, let's look at the board.

We know position 1 is not C, position 3 is not A.

Letters we have not tested: many.

Perhaps I should include a letter that is common but not yet tried, like S, T, D, etc., or vowels I, O, U.

In ""CRANE"", we used A, E, R, N, C. So E and N are confirmed, R confirmed.

Missing common vowels: I, O, U not tested.

Consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

So for a guess, I could use ""BRINE"" to test B and I.

""PRONE"" to test P and O.

""TRONE"" not word, ""TRINE"" tests T and I.

Perhaps ""SHINE"" but doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R, not H.

Only words with R in second position.

Another word: ""BROKE"" B R O K E, position 4 K not N – doesn't fit.

So only possibilities are those mentioned.

""CRUMP"" no.

Perhaps ""GRASP"" G R A S P, but A is bad, and position 4 S not N.

Not.

So, I think BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, PRUNE are candidates.

""DRONE"" D R O N E

Let me choose one that includes a vowel untested.

I am considering ""PRONE"": P R O N E

This way, we test P in position 1 and O in position 3.

If O is not in the word, or position.

Similarly, if P is not.

But since we know R, N, E are fixed, the feedback for position 1 and 3 will tell us about P and O.

For example, if for ""PRONE"", position 1: if P is correct, green; if not correct but in word, yellow; if not in word, gray.

Similarly for position 3 O.

But O in position 3: if secret word has O elsewhere, but in our pattern, position 3 is unknown.

In ""PRONE"", position 3 is O.

We could get different feedback.

Similarly, other words.

To speed up, since we know R,N,E are correct, the word must be one of the options I listed.

But we have only 6 tries, so we might not need to guess one directly; we can get more info first.

For instance, if I guess ""BRINE"", and B and I are wrong, but since R,N,E are already known, it might not give full info if, say, I is in the word but not position 3.

But in this case, if for ""BRINE"", feedback shows:

- Position 1 B: could be green, yellow, or gray.

- Position 2 R: should be green, unless something wrong, but it is fixed green.

Position 4 N green, position 5 E green.

Position 3 I: could be green or yellow or gray.

Similarly for others.

Now, specifically for position 1, if it gets gray, it means B is not in the word.

Similarly, if yellow, it might be in wrong position, but since position 2 is R, position 4 N, position 5 E, and B is only in position 1 for now, if B is in the word, it must be in position 1 or position 3? No, position 3 for I in BRINE, but secret can have B elsewhere.

In the secret word format _ R _ N E, possible positions for B are only position 1 or position 3, since position 2 is R, 4 N, 5 E.

Similarly for any letter.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2,4,5 fixed: 2=R, 4=N, 5=E

So variable positions: 1 and 3.

Any letter not R,N,E must be in position 1 or 3.

And R,N,E are in their positions.

Now, for a guess with new letters, say ""PRONE"": P R O N E

If P is not in the word, feedback position 1 x

If P is in the word, it could only be position 1 or 3, so if not green, it might be yellow if in position 3, but since position 3 is O in this guess, if O is wrong, but P might be yellow.

Similarly.

But I think it's fine.

Since we need to guess, I'll go with ""PRONE"" to test P and O.

Or ""DRONE"" for D and O.

Perhaps ""TRINE"" for T and I.

""URINE"" for U and I.

U is less common, so better to avoid.

O is more common vowel.

I am leaning towards ""PRONE"".

Let's confirm it's a valid word; yes, prone is a word meaning susceptible or lying face down.

Similarly.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" but C bad and doesn't fit pattern.

So, I'll go with ""PRONE"".

So my second guess is ""PRONE"".

Let me think of the format.

Response should be <guess>prone</guess>

But first, thought process in thinking.Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x), so I avoid C in future guesses.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 2.
- A is not in the word (x), so I avoid A in future guesses.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 4.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 5.

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E, where the first and third positions are unknown letters that are not C or A. The goal now is to guess a new word that fits this pattern and tests potential letters for positions 1 and 3, while gathering more information.

I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that starts with a letter not C or A, has R in position 2, some letter in position 3 (not A or C), N in position 4, and E in position 5. Possible candidates include words like ""BRINE,"" ""DRONE,"" ""PRONE,"" ""TRINE,"" or ""URINE."" 

To maximize information:
- I should test new common letters that haven't been used yet. In ""crane,"" we tested C, R, A, N, E. R, N, and E are confirmed and fixed, so I need to focus on untested letters for positions 1 and 3, such as vowels like I, O, U or consonants like B, D, P, T.
- Words like ""BRINE"" (testing B and I) or ""PRONE"" (testing P and O) are good options. ""PRONE"" includes the letter O (a common vowel not yet tested) and P (a common consonant), which could provide useful feedback about their presence and positions.

I choose ""PRONE"" as my guess because:
- It fits the known pattern: P (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), O (position 3), N (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).
- ""P"" and ""O"" are new letters; if incorrect, they might still reveal if they're in the word elsewhere (e.g., O in position 3 could be yellow if the secret word has O but in the wrong spot).
- ""PRONE"" is a common English word, ensuring validity.

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If P is correct, it gets green; if not, the feedback may show it's in the word but wrong position (yellow) or absent (gray). Similarly for O.
- Since R, N, and E are fixed and will be green, the feedback will focus on positions 1 and 3.

<guess>prone</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: prone -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the two guesses:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""):
  - C: x (not in the word at all)
  - R: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 2)
  - A: x (not in the word at all)
  - N: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 4)
  - E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 5)
  Therefore, the secret word must have the form _ R _ N E, and it cannot contain C or A.

- From Guess 2 (""prone""):
  - P: x (not in the word at all)
  - R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
  - O: x (not in the word at all)
  - N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
  - E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)
  So, P and O are also not in the word. This means the secret word contains none of C, A, P, or O.

Given that, the secret word is _ R _ N E, and the missing letters (position 1 and 3) must be letters that are not C, A, P, or O. Also, since R, N, E are fixed and confirmed, only positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

Letters not in the word: C, A, P, O

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3 include consonants like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels like U, I, etc., but avoiding C, A, P, O.

Now, I need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ N E and uses only letters not excluded, to test possible options.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ R _ N E:
- ""BRINE"": B R I N E
- ""TRINE"": T R I N E
- ""DRONE"": But drone has O, which is now excluded, so invalid.
- ""URINE"": U R I N E
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E, but position 4 needs to be N; ""GRIME"" has M in position 4, not N. So not matching.
- ""SHINE"": But position 2 must be R, not H.
- ""THINE"": Similarly, position 2 H.

Valid options I can guess: ""BRINE"", ""TRINE"", ""URINE"". ""PRUNE"" has O? No, prune is P R U N E, but P is excluded now. And O? Prune has U, but P is bad.

""PRUNE"" contains P, which is not in the word, so I cannot use it.

Similarly, ""DRONE"" contains O, excluded.

So remaining: ""BRINE"" (B R I N E), ""TRINE"" (T R I N E), ""URINE"" (U R I N E).

I could also think of less common words, but these are standard.

Now, to decide which to guess, I need to test new letters for more information. For example:
- In ""BRINE"", I test B and I.
- In ""TRINE"", I test T and I.
- In ""URINE"", I test U and I.

Since I is common to all, testing I is efficient. Then, choosing among B, T, U.

U is less common than B or T, so perhaps avoid it for now.

T is very common, B is also common.

I could choose ""BRINE"" to test B, and if B is wrong, I can move to TRINE.

Similarly, TRINE tests T.

But I have limited guesses; only 4 left? We have used 2 guesses, so 4 remaining.

Since R,N,E are fixed, the word must be one of the few possibilities like BRINE, TRINE, URINE.

If I guess one, it might solve it or give info.

To maximize information, I could guess a word that includes more than one possibility, but since pattern is fixed, no.

Note that in position 3, it could be I or other letters.

For example, is there another word? ""CRINE"" not word and C bad.

""WRINE"" not word.

""FRINE""? Not standard.

So probably BRINE, TRINE, URINE are the main options.

Another one: ""GRENE""? Not word.

Perhaps ""BRINE"" is good.

Since U is vowel but less common, I might avoid URINE for now.

Between B and T, B is as common as T perhaps.

I can guess TRINE, or BRINE.

Let me pick TRINE: T R I N E.

This tests T and I.

If T is in position 1, and I in position 3.

If not, feedback will show.

Similarly, if I guess wrong, it narrows down.

I'll go with TRINE.

So, guess: ""TRINE"".

Thought process:

- Secret word format: position 1 unknown, position 2 R (fixed), position 3 unknown, position 4 N (fixed), position 5 E (fixed).
- Excluded letters: C, A, P, O (all gray from previous, so not in word).
- Common possible words: BRINE, TRINE, URINE.
- Choose TRINE to test common letters T and I: if T is correct, we solve; if not, but yellow or gray, we learn.

<guess>trine</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C and A are not in the word (x), R is in position 2 (✓), N is in position 4 (✓), E is in position 5 (✓). This shows the secret word pattern is _ R _ N E, excluding C and A.
- From ""prone"": P and O are not in the word (x), R, N, and E are confirmed in their positions (✓). This adds P and O to the exclusion list.

The secret word is still _ R _ N E, with letters not C, A, P, or O. Only positions 1 and 3 are unknown. Possible words fitting this pattern include ""BRINE"" (B R I N E), ""TRINE"" (T R I N E), or ""URINE"" (U R I N E). 

I choose ""TRINE"" to test T in position 1 and I in position 3, as ""TRINE"" is a common word that uses untested letters. T is a frequent starting letter, and I is a common vowel not yet evaluated. If T or I is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the options among the remaining possibilities.

Are there more?\n\n""THINE"" T H I N E, position 2 is H not R – no\n\n""SHINE"" S H I N E, same.\n\n""SPINE"" S P I N E, position 2 is P not R\n\nUnless it\'s like ""SHRINE"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nAll must be 5 letters.\n\n""CRONE"" has C, bad.\n\n""PRUNE"" P R U N E, that\'s a word.\n\n""GRUMP"" no.\n\nSo, PRUNE: P R U N E\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, ""BRUME"" not common.\n\n""TRONE"" not standard.\n\nOr ""DRUSE"" no.\n\nSo reasonable words: BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, TRINE, URINE, PRUNE.\n\nNow, for guessing, I should avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, but all these have unique letters except possibly, but likely.\n\n""BRINE"" - B,R,I,N,E - all unique.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nTo get information about other letters, let\'s look at the board.\n\nWe know position 1 is not C, position 3 is not A.\n\nLetters we have not tested: many.\n\nPerhaps I should include a letter that is common but not yet tried, like S, T, D, etc., or vowels I, O, U.\n\nIn ""CRANE"", we used A, E, R, N, C. So E and N are confirmed, R confirmed.\n\nMissing common vowels: I, O, U not tested.\n\nConsonants like S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nSo for a guess, I could use ""BRINE"" to test B and I.\n\n""PRONE"" to test P and O.\n\n""TRONE"" not word, ""TRINE"" tests T and I.\n\nPerhaps ""SHINE"" but doesn\'t fit the pattern because position 2 must be R, not H.\n\nOnly words with R in second position.\n\nAnother word: ""BROKE"" B R O K E, position 4 K not N – doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo only possibilities are those mentioned.\n\n""CRUMP"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""GRASP"" G R A S P, but A is bad, and position 4 S not N.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, I think BRINE, PRONE, DRONE, PRUNE are candidates.\n\n""DRONE"" D R O N E\n\nLet me choose one that includes a vowel untested.\n\nI am considering ""PRONE"": P R O N E\n\nThis way, we test P in position 1 and O in position 3.\n\nIf O is not in the word, or position.\n\nSimilarly, if P is not.\n\nBut since we know R, N, E are fixed, the feedback for position 1 and 3 will tell us about P and O.\n\nFor example, if for ""PRONE"", position 1: if P is correct, green; if not correct but in word, yellow; if not in word, gray.\n\nSimilarly for position 3 O.\n\nBut O in position 3: if secret word has O elsewhere, but in our pattern, position 3 is unknown.\n\nIn ""PRONE"", position 3 is O.\n\nWe could get different feedback.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nTo speed up, since we know R,N,E are correct, the word must be one of the options I listed.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, so we might not need to guess one directly; we can get more info first.\n\nFor instance, if I guess ""BRINE"", and B and I are wrong, but since R,N,E are already known, it might not give full info if, say, I is in the word but not position 3.\n\nBut in this case, if for ""BRINE"", feedback shows:\n\n- Position 1 B: could be green, yellow, or gray.\n\n- Position 2 R: should be green, unless something wrong, but it is fixed green.\n\nPosition 4 N green, position 5 E green.\n\nPosition 3 I: could be green or yellow or gray.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, specifically for position 1, if it gets gray, it means B is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, if yellow, it might be in wrong position, but since position 2 is R, position 4 N, position 5 E, and B is only in position 1 for now, if B is in the word, it must be in position 1 or position 3? No, position 3 for I in BRINE, but secret can have B elsewhere.\n\nIn the secret word format _ R _ N E, possible positions for B are only position 1 or position 3, since position 2 is R, 4 N, 5 E.\n\nSimilarly for any letter.\n\nPositions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n2,4,5 fixed: 2=R, 4=N, 5=E\n\nSo variable positions: 1 and 3.\n\nAny letter not R,N,E must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nAnd R,N,E are in their positions.\n\nNow, for a guess with new letters, say ""PRONE"": P R O N E\n\nIf P is not in the word, feedback position 1 x\n\nIf P is in the word, it could only be position 1 or 3, so if not green, it might be yellow if in position 3, but since position 3 is O in this guess, if O is wrong, but P might be yellow.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I think it\'s fine.\n\nSince we need to guess, I\'ll go with ""PRONE"" to test P and O.\n\nOr ""DRONE"" for D and O.\n\nPerhaps ""TRINE"" for T and I.\n\n""URINE"" for U and I.\n\nU is less common, so better to avoid.\n\nO is more common vowel.\n\nI am leaning towards ""PRONE"".\n\nLet\'s confirm it\'s a valid word; yes, prone is a word meaning susceptible or lying face down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CRISP"" but C bad and doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRONE"".\n\nSo my second guess is ""PRONE"".\n\nLet me think of the format.\n\nResponse should be <guess>prone</guess>\n\nBut first, thought process in thinking.Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word (x), so I avoid C in future guesses.\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 2.\n- A is not in the word (x), so I avoid A in future guesses.\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 4.\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), specifically position 5.\n\nThis means the secret word has the form: _ R _ N E, where the first and third positions are unknown letters that are not C or A. The goal now is to guess a new word that fits this pattern and tests potential letters for positions 1 and 3, while gathering more information.\n\nI need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that starts with a letter not C or A, has R in position 2, some letter in position 3 (not A or C), N in position 4, and E in position 5. Possible candidates include words like ""BRINE,"" ""DRONE,"" ""PRONE,"" ""TRINE,"" or ""URINE."" \n\nTo maximize information:\n- I should test new common letters that haven\'t been used yet. In ""crane,"" we tested C, R, A, N, E. R, N, and E are confirmed and fixed, so I need to focus on untested letters for positions 1 and 3, such as vowels like I, O, U or consonants like B, D, P, T.\n- Words like ""BRINE"" (testing B and I) or ""PRONE"" (testing P and O) are good options. ""PRONE"" includes the letter O (a common vowel not yet tested) and P (a common consonant), which could provide useful feedback about their presence and positions.\n\nI choose ""PRONE"" as my guess because:\n- It fits the known pattern: P (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), O (position 3), N (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).\n- ""P"" and ""O"" are new letters; if incorrect, they might still reveal if they\'re in the word elsewhere (e.g., O in position 3 could be yellow if the secret word has O but in the wrong spot).\n- ""PRONE"" is a common English word, ensuring validity.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down possibilities:\n- If P is correct, it gets green; if not, the feedback may show it\'s in the word but wrong position (yellow) or absent (gray). Similarly for O.\n- Since R, N, and E are fixed and will be green, the feedback will focus on positions 1 and 3.\n\n<guess>prone</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prone -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the feedback from the two guesses:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""):\n  - C: x (not in the word at all)\n  - R: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 2)\n  - A: x (not in the word at all)\n  - N: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 4)\n  - E: ✓ (in the word and correct position, position 5)\n  Therefore, the secret word must have the form _ R _ N E, and it cannot contain C or A.\n\n- From Guess 2 (""prone""):\n  - P: x (not in the word at all)\n  - R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)\n  - O: x (not in the word at all)\n  - N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)\n  - E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)\n  So, P and O are also not in the word.

Also, since R, N, E are fixed and confirmed, only positions 1 and 3 are unknown.\n\nLetters not in the word: C, A, P, O\n\nPossible letters for positions 1 and 3 include consonants like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels like U, I, etc., but avoiding C, A, P, O.\n\nNow, I need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ N E and uses only letters not excluded, to test possible options.\n\nCommon 5-letter words fitting _ R _ N E:\n- ""BRINE"": B R I N E\n- ""TRINE"": T R I N E\n- ""DRONE"": But drone has O, which is now excluded, so invalid.\n- ""URINE"": U R I N E\n- ""GRIME"": G R I M E, but position 4 needs to be N; ""GRIME"" has M in position 4, not N.

For example:\n- In ""BRINE"", I test B and I.\n- In ""TRINE"", I test T and I.\n- In ""URINE"", I test U and I.\n\nSince I is common to all, testing I is efficient.

""CRINE"" not word and C bad.\n\n""WRINE"" not word.\n\n""FRINE""? Not standard.\n\nSo probably BRINE, TRINE, URINE are the main options.\n\nAnother one: ""GRENE""?

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""

- R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

- The word has the form: _ R _ N E
- C and A are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""prone""
- P: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- O: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

This adds:
- P and O are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""trine""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- I: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

This adds:
- T is not in the word.
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).

So now we know:
- The secret word is _ R I N E (since position 3 is I, and positions 2,4,5 are fixed as R,N,E).
- Excluded letters: C, A, P, O, T (all marked x in previous guesses).

Therefore, the word must be of the form: ? R I N E, where the first letter is not C, A, P, O, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter (not C,A,P,O,T) and ends with ""RINE"". The only common word that fits is ""BRINE"" (B R I N E) or ""URINE"" (U R I N E). But we have to check if there are others.

Other possibilities? 
- ""GRINE"" is not a word.
- ""FRINE"" not a word.
- ""DRINE"" not a word.
- ""WRINE"" not a word.
- ""SRINE"" not a word.

So the only common words are ""BRINE"" and ""URINE"".

Now, from the feedback, we have not tested B or U yet. But we know that T is not in the word, so ""TRINE"" is out (which we already guessed and got T wrong).

In guess 3, we guessed ""trine"" and got T(x) and I(✓), so the word is not ""trine"" but has I in position 3.

Now, we have two candidates: ""BRINE"" and ""URINE"".

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one.

But note: in the feedback so far, we have no indication of B or U, so we must guess one.

""BRINE"" has B, which is a common letter, and ""URINE"" has U, which is less common. So ""BRINE"" might be more likely, but it's arbitrary.

Alternatively, we can consider that in the first guess ""crane"", we had no B or U, so no information.

But we have to make a guess.

Since we have only two options, I'll go with ""BRINE"" as it is more common.

If it's not, then the next guess would be ""URINE"".

But we have to make a new guess now.

So, let's guess ""BRINE"".

But let's confirm the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: N, position 5: E.

Yes, ""BRINE"" fits: B R I N E.

Similarly, ""URINE"": U R I N E.

Now, in the feedback for guess 3, we have I(✓), so position 3 is I, which is consistent.

So, I'll guess ""BRINE"".

But we must output in the format.

However, note that in the previous guess ""trine"", we got I(✓), which confirms that position 3 is I, so the word is ? R I N E.

Therefore, the next guess should be one of the two.

I think ""BRINE"" is a good guess.

- Excluded letters: C, A, P, O, T (all marked x in previous feedback).
- Possible words: Only common English words fitting this pattern are ""BRINE"" (B R I N E) and ""URINE"" (U R I N E).

I choose ""BRINE"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the letter B (a common consonant not yet evaluated) in position 1.
- ""BRINE"" is a more frequent word than ""URINE"" in common usage, making it a reasonable first choice between the two options.
