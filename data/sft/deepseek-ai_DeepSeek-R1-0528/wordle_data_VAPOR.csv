We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
2. Avoids using C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to try to find more about the secret word.

Let's think about the positions:
- In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3. So in the new word, R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.

We can try to place R and A in other positions. Also, we might want to include other vowels or common consonants.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some ideas:
- We could try ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y
  - A is in position 2 (which is allowed, since previously A was in position 3 and now it's different)
  - R is in position 3 (previously it was in position 2, so that's a different position)

But note: we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word. This is a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""roast"" but we know that the word doesn't have S? Wait, we don't know about S yet. Actually, in the first guess we didn't test S. But ""roast"" has S and T, and we know that E is not in the word, but S might be.

But wait, the first guess was ""crane"" and we got E as not present, but S wasn't tested. So we can use S.

However, note that in ""crane"", the letter S was not present, so we have no information about S.

But we must avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y
- ""tramp"": T, R, A, M, P (but has two P's? Actually, it's T, R, A, M, P -> two P's? No: T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Actually, no duplicate letters? The word is ""tramp"" -> T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Yes, but M and P are new.
- ""gravy"": G, R, A, V, Y
- ""dairy"": D, A, I, R, Y

But note: we also want to test new letters to get more information.

We know that the secret word has R and A. We have two known letters. We should try to use a word that places R and A in positions that are allowed and also tests other common letters.

Let me consider the position constraints for R and A:

For R: cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
For A: cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In ""party"":
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in position 2 and now it's 3, which is different)

Also, we are testing P, T, and Y.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

But without more information, ""party"" seems like a good guess.

Another common word: ""stare"" but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use ""stare"".

We must avoid E.

So, let's avoid words with E, C, N.

Another word: ""piano"" but we know A is in the word, but we also know that the word doesn't have C and N? Actually, we know C and N are not in the word, so ""piano"" has N? Wait, ""piano"" has N? Yes, and N is not in the word. So we cannot use ""piano"".

Similarly, ""train"" has N? Yes, so avoid.

So, ""party"" is acceptable: no C, N, E.

Let me check: P, A, R, T, Y. None of the forbidden letters.

So, I'll go with ""party"".

But note: we are also trying to get as much information as possible. We are testing three new letters: P, T, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down the word.

Therefore, the second guess is ""party"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3). So R must be in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5), and A must be in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""party"" because:
- It includes the known letters R and A, placing them in new positions (A in position 2 and R in position 3) to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, N, and E.
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, Y) to gather more feedback.

This is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother option: ""roast"" but we know that the word doesn\'t have S? Wait, we don\'t know about S yet. Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t test S. But ""roast"" has S and T, and we know that E is not in the word, but S might be.\n\nBut wait, the first guess was ""crane"" and we got E as not present, but S wasn\'t tested. So we can use S.\n\nHowever, note that in ""crane"", the letter S was not present, so we have no information about S.\n\nBut we must avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E:\n\n- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y\n- ""tramp"": T, R, A, M, P (but has two P\'s? Actually, it\'s T, R, A, M, P -> two P\'s? No: T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Actually, no duplicate letters? The word is ""tramp"" -> T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Yes, but M and P are new.\n- ""gravy"": G, R, A, V, Y\n- ""dairy"": D, A, I, R, Y\n\nBut note: we also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWe know that the secret word has R and A. We have two known letters. We should try to use a word that places R and A in positions that are allowed and also tests other common letters.\n\nLet me consider the position constraints for R and A:\n\nFor R: cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nFor A: cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""party"":\n- A is in position 2 (allowed)\n- R is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in position 2 and now it\'s 3, which is different)\n\nAlso, we are testing P, T, and Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that puts R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.\n\nBut without more information, ""party"" seems like a good guess.\n\nAnother common word: ""stare"" but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use ""stare"".\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with E, C, N.\n\nAnother word: ""piano"" but we know A is in the word, but we also know that the word doesn\'t have C and N? Actually, we know C and N are not in the word, so ""piano"" has N? Wait, ""piano"" has N? Yes, and N is not in the word. So we cannot use ""piano"".\n\nSimilarly, ""train"" has N? Yes, so avoid.\n\nSo, ""party"" is acceptable: no C, N, E.\n\nLet me check: P, A, R, T, Y. None of the forbidden letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""party"".\n\nBut note: we are also trying to get as much information as possible. We are testing three new letters: P, T, Y.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down the word.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""party"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3). So R must be in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5), and A must be in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""party"" because:\n- It includes the known letters R and A, placing them in new positions (A in position 2 and R in position 3) to test their correct placement.\n- It avoids the excluded letters C, N, and E.\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, Y) to gather more feedback.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letter A in the second position (position 2). So, the second letter is A.

2. The letters that are in the word: 
   - R is in the word (from both guesses) but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - P is in the word (from second guess) but not in position 1. So P is in the word and must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is A).

3. Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, Y.

4. We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.

Now, let's list the known information about the secret word:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Contains R (not in pos 2 or 3) and P (not in pos 1).
- Does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in position 2 (because we know it's correct, but we can use it to test other letters).
- Includes R and P in positions that are possible (for R: 1,4,5; for P: 3,4,5) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.
- Avoids the letters C, N, E, T, Y.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for P: 3, 4, 5

But note: we don't know if R and P are in the same position? They could be, but we have to assign them to different positions.

We also need to consider that the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

We know the second letter is A, so the word is: _ A _ _ _

We need to place R and P in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but note that position 1,3,4,5 are open.

But we have two known letters to place: R and P, and we have three other letters to guess.

We can try to form a word that has:
- A in position 2.
- R in one of the positions 1,4,5 (but not 2 or 3, which we already tried and failed).
- P in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1, which we tried and failed).

Also, we must avoid T, Y, C, N, E.

Let me think of words that fit:

Option 1: Place R in position 1 and P in position 3? 
- Then the word would be: R A P _ _
But we need two more letters. Words like ""rapid"" but D is allowed? But we haven't tested D. However, ""rapid"" has D and I, but we don't know about I. But note: we must avoid T, so ""rapid"" is acceptable? But we also have to check if it has any forbidden letters? It doesn't have C, N, E, T, Y. So ""rapid"" is a candidate.

But wait, in ""rapid"", P is in position 3. We haven't tested position 3 for P? Actually, in the second guess, we had P in position 1 and it was wrong, but we don't know about position 3. So it's allowed.

Similarly, R in position 1: in the first guess R was in position 2 (wrong) and in the second guess R was in position 3 (wrong), so position 1 is new and allowed.

But we have to see if ""rapid"" is a valid word.

Another option: Place R in position 4 and P in position 3? Then we have: _ A P R _
What words? Like ""paper"" but E is forbidden. Or ""capri"" but C is forbidden. So not.

Place R in position 5 and P in position 3: _ A P _ R -> words like ""vapor"" but O and V are new, and we avoid forbidden letters? ""vapor"" has V, A, P, O, R. No forbidden letters. But we don't know about V and O.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put both R and P in the same guess? But we know they are in the word, so we might as well use them to get their positions.

But we have to consider that we have limited guesses.

We also want to test other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ""rapid"": R in pos1, A in pos2, P in pos3, I in pos4, D in pos5. 
   - This tests R in pos1, P in pos3, and also I and D.

2. ""vapor"": V in pos1, A in pos2, P in pos3, O in pos4, R in pos5.
   - Tests V, O, and R in pos5, P in pos3.

3. ""lapel"": but E is forbidden, so no.

4. ""radar"": but R is in pos1 and pos5, and A in pos2 and pos4? But we have A in pos2, so: R A D A R. But we don't know about D. However, we have two A's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters? But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, in our case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far, but it's possible.

But note: in the feedback for ""party"", we had A as correct and R as present, but if the word had two R's, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, in ""party"", we have one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the secret word has two R's, we might have gotten one marked and the other not? But we don't know.

To be safe, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now, unless necessary.

So ""radar"" has two R's and two A's. We know A is in position 2, so if we use ""radar"", we have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might complicate the feedback.

Similarly, ""rapid"" has no duplicates.

Another word: ""palsy"" but Y is forbidden.

""balsa"" but S and A again? And we don't know about S. But ""balsa"" has A in position 2? Let's see: B A L S A. So A in position 2 and 5. But we know A is in position 2, so that's fixed. But we have another A? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S is new.

But we must avoid Y? ""balsa"" doesn't have Y, but it has S and L and B.

But we also have to avoid T? Yes, and it doesn't have T.

But we are missing R and P? We know the word must have R and P. But ""balsa"" does not have R or P? So it cannot be the secret word because the secret word has R and P. Therefore, we cannot guess ""balsa"" because it doesn't include the known letters R and P? Actually, we are allowed to guess any word, but it's inefficient because we know R and P must be in the word, so we should include them to get their positions.

So we should include both R and P in the guess to try to pin down their positions.

Therefore, words like ""rapid"" and ""vapor"" are good.

Another word: ""grasp"": G R A S P. But in this word, A is in position 3? But we need A in position 2. So we cannot use ""grasp"" because it would put A in position 3, but we know A is in position 2. So we must have A in position 2.

So the word must be: _ A _ _ _

Therefore, ""grasp"" is not valid for our pattern.

Similarly, ""cramp"" has C which is forbidden.

So back to ""rapid"" and ""vapor"".

We can also consider ""drape"": but E is forbidden.

""laird"": L A I R D -> R is in position 4. This has A in position 2, and R in position 4. But we are missing P? We know P is in the word, so we must include P? Otherwise, we are not testing P's position.

We must include P because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

So the guess should include P.

Similarly, we must include R.

Therefore, the guess must have A in position 2, and include R and P, and avoid C, N, E, T, Y.

So let's list possible words:

- ""rapid"": R A P I D
- ""vapor"": V A P O R
- ""paper"": but E is forbidden.
- ""tapir"": T is forbidden.
- ""rapid"" and ""vapor"" are the main candidates.

Another one: ""sappy"" has Y and two P's? And Y is forbidden.

""ramps"": has S and M, but also S is new. But ""ramps"": R A M P S -> P is in position 4. This avoids forbidden letters? No T, no Y, no C, N, E. So it's acceptable.

So we have three candidates: ""rapid"", ""vapor"", ""ramps"".

Now, which one to choose?

We want to maximize information. We can look at the frequency of the new letters.

In ""rapid"": new letters are I and D.
In ""vapor"": new letters are V, O, and R is in position 5 (which we haven't tested for R).
In ""ramps"": new letters are M and S.

Common letters: S is very common, so testing S might be good. M is medium, I and D are common, V and O are less common.

But we also have to consider the positions.

We know R must be in 1,4,5. In ""rapid"", R is in 1; in ""vapor"", R is in 5; in ""ramps"", R is in 1.

Similarly, P: in ""rapid"" it's in 3; in ""vapor"" in 3; in ""ramps"" in 4.

We haven't tested position 1 for R, position 3 for P, position 4 for P, position 5 for R.

We might want to test a position for R that we haven't tested. We have tested position 2 and 3 for R (both wrong), so positions 1,4,5 are open.

Similarly for P, we have tested position 1 (wrong), so positions 3,4,5 are open.

In ""rapid"", we test R in 1 and P in 3.
In ""vapor"", we test R in 5 and P in 3.
In ""ramps"", we test R in 1 and P in 4.

We haven't tested position 4 for P at all, and position 5 for R at all.

But we are testing multiple things.

Another factor: the word ""ramps"" has S, which is a very common letter, so it might be good to test S.

Similarly, ""rapid"" has I and D, which are also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

I recall that in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know A and R are in, and we have excluded E, T, N, C. So the next common are I, O, S, L, etc.

S is more common than V, so ""ramps"" or ""rapid"" might be better than ""vapor"".

Between ""rapid"" and ""ramps"", which one?

""rapid"" has I and D, ""ramps"" has M and S.

S is more common than M, and I is more common than M? Let me think.

Actually, S is very common, I is common, D is common, M is less common.

But we are also testing positions.

We might also consider that if we guess ""ramps"", we are putting P in position 4, which we haven't tested. In ""rapid"", we are putting P in position 3, which we haven't tested either.

But we have no strong preference.

Another candidate: ""larva"" but V and A again? And no P? We must include P.

Or ""parry"" has Y, forbidden.

I think ""rapid"" and ""ramps"" are both good.

But let me check if ""ramps"" is a word? Yes, ramp is a word, and ramps is the plural, which is allowed in Wordle? Actually, Wordle uses common nouns, including plurals, so yes.

Similarly, ""rapid"" is a word.

I'll choose ""rapid"" because it has two vowels (I) which might be helpful, and D is common.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know if it has another vowel. Since E is out, the vowels left are A (already in), I, O, U. So testing I might be good.

In ""ramps"", we have no vowel besides A, so it might not help in finding vowels.

So I think ""rapid"" is a better choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""rapid"".

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: R (we are testing if R is in position 1)
- Position 2: A (correct, so we'll get a check for A)
- Position 3: P (testing P in position 3)
- Position 4: I (new letter)
- Position 5: D (new letter)

And no forbidden letters.

So, the guess is ""rapid"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → P(in word, wrong position), A(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), T(not in word), Y(not in word).

### Key Insights:
1. **A is confirmed** in position 2 (second letter).
2. **R and P are in the word** but not in the positions guessed:
   - R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - P is not in position 1 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, T, Y (not in the word at all).
4. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _`.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Include **A in position 2** (since it's confirmed).
- Include **R and P** to test their valid positions (R in 1/4/5; P in 3/4/5).
- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, E, T, Y).
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, D, S, O) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words that place R and P in untested positions to narrow down possibilities.

Selected guess: **""rapid""**  
- **R** in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).  
- **A** in position 2 (confirmed, so feedback will show ✓).  
- **P** in position 3 (tests if P is in position 3).  
- **I** in position 4 (new letter test).  
- **D** in position 5 (new letter test).  

This guess efficiently tests R and P in new positions while introducing common letters (I and D) for additional feedback. If R or P are misplaced, it will help identify their correct positions, and we'll learn about I and D.

<guess>rapid</guess>",rapid,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letter A in the second position (position 2). So, the second letter is A.

2. The letters that are in the word: 
   - R is in the word (from both guesses) but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - P is in the word (from second guess) but not in position 1. So P is in the word and must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is A).

3. Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, Y.

4. We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.

Now, let's list the known information about the secret word:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Contains R (not in pos 2 or 3) and P (not in pos 1).
- Does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in position 2 (because we know it's correct, but we can use it to test other letters).
- Includes R and P in positions that are possible (for R: 1,4,5; for P: 3,4,5) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.
- Avoids the letters C, N, E, T, Y.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for P: 3, 4, 5

But note: we don't know if R and P are in the same position? They could be, but we have to assign them to different positions.

We also need to consider that the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

We know the second letter is A, so the word is: _ A _ _ _

We need to place R and P in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but note that position 1,3,4,5 are open.

But we have two known letters to place: R and P, and we have three other letters to guess.

We can try to form a word that has:
- A in position 2.
- R in one of the positions 1,4,5 (but not 2 or 3, which we already tried and failed).
- P in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1, which we tried and failed).

Similarly, ""rapid"" has no duplicates.

Another word: ""palsy"" but Y is forbidden.

""balsa"" but S and A again? And we don't know about S. But ""balsa"" has A in position 2? Let's see: B A L S A. So A in position 2 and 5. But we know A is in position 2, so that's fixed. But we have another A? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S is new.

Similarly, ""cramp"" has C which is forbidden.

So back to ""rapid"" and ""vapor"".

We can also consider ""drape"": but E is forbidden.

Common letters: S is very common, so testing S might be good. M is medium, I and D are common, V and O are less common.

But we also have to consider the positions.

We know R must be in 1,4,5. In ""rapid"", R is in 1; in ""vapor"", R is in 5; in ""ramps"", R is in 1.

Similarly, P: in ""rapid"" it's in 3; in ""vapor"" in 3; in ""ramps"" in 4.

We haven't tested position 1 for R, position 3 for P, position 4 for P, position 5 for R.

We might want to test a position for R that we haven't tested. We have tested position 2 and 3 for R (both wrong), so positions 1,4,5 are open.

Similarly for P, we have tested position 1 (wrong), so positions 3,4,5 are open.

In ""rapid"", we test R in 1 and P in 3.
In ""vapor"", we test R in 5 and P in 3.
In ""ramps"", we test R in 1 and P in 4.

We haven't tested position 4 for P at all, and position 5 for R at all.

But we are testing multiple things.

Another factor: the word ""ramps"" has S, which is a very common letter, so it might be good to test S.

Similarly, ""rapid"" has I and D, which are also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

I recall that in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know A and R are in, and we have excluded E, T, N, C. So the next common are I, O, S, L, etc.

S is more common than V, so ""ramps"" or ""rapid"" might be better than ""vapor"".

Between ""rapid"" and ""ramps"", which one?

""rapid"" has I and D, ""ramps"" has M and S.

S is more common than M, and I is more common than M? Let me think.

Actually, S is very common, I is common, D is common, M is less common.

But we are also testing positions.

We might also consider that if we guess ""ramps"", we are putting P in position 4, which we haven't tested. In ""rapid"", we are putting P in position 3, which we haven't tested either.

But we have no strong preference.

Another candidate: ""larva"" but V and A again? And no P? We must include P.

Or ""parry"" has Y, forbidden.

I think ""rapid"" and ""ramps"" are both good.

But let me check if ""ramps"" is a word? Yes, ramp is a word, and ramps is the plural, which is allowed in Wordle? Actually, Wordle uses common nouns, including plurals, so yes.

Similarly, ""rapid"" is a word.

I'll choose ""rapid"" because it has two vowels (I) which might be helpful, and D is common.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know if it has another vowel. Since E is out, the vowels left are A (already in), I, O, U. So testing I might be good.

In ""ramps"", we have no vowel besides A, so it might not help in finding vowels.

So I think ""rapid"" is a better choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""rapid"".

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: R (we are testing if R is in position 1)
- Position 2: A (correct, so we'll get a check for A)
- Position 3: P (testing P in position 3)
- Position 4: I (new letter)
- Position 5: D (new letter)

And no forbidden letters.

So, the guess is ""rapid"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → P(in word, wrong position), A(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), T(not in word), Y(not in word).

### Key Insights:
1. **A is confirmed** in position 2 (second letter).
2. **R and P are in the word** but not in the positions guessed:
   - R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - P is not in position 1 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, T, Y (not in the word at all).
4. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _`.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Include **A in position 2** (since it's confirmed).
- Include **R and P** to test their valid positions (R in 1/4/5; P in 3/4/5).
- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, E, T, Y).
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, D, S, O) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words that place R and P in untested positions to narrow down possibilities.

Selected guess: **""rapid""**  
- **R** in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).  
- **A** in position 2 (confirmed, so feedback will show ✓).  
- **P** in position 3 (tests if P is in position 3).  
- **I** in position 4 (new letter test).  
- **D** in position 5 (new letter test).  

This guess efficiently tests R and P in new positions while introducing common letters (I and D) for additional feedback. If R or P are misplaced, it will help identify their correct positions, and we'll learn about I and D.",Guess 3: rapid -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(✓) I(x) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,VAPOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
2. Avoids using C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to try to find more about the secret word.

Let's think about the positions:
- In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3. So in the new word, R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.

We can try to place R and A in other positions. Also, we might want to include other vowels or common consonants.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some ideas:
- We could try ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y
  - A is in position 2 (which is allowed, since previously A was in position 3 and now it's different)
  - R is in position 3 (previously it was in position 2, so that's a different position)

But note: we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word. This is a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""roast"" but we know that the word doesn't have S? Wait, we don't know about S yet. Actually, in the first guess we didn't test S. But ""roast"" has S and T, and we know that E is not in the word, but S might be.

But wait, the first guess was ""crane"" and we got E as not present, but S wasn't tested. So we can use S.

However, note that in ""crane"", the letter S was not present, so we have no information about S.

But we must avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y
- ""tramp"": T, R, A, M, P (but has two P's? Actually, it's T, R, A, M, P -> two P's? No: T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Actually, no duplicate letters? The word is ""tramp"" -> T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Yes, but M and P are new.
- ""gravy"": G, R, A, V, Y
- ""dairy"": D, A, I, R, Y

But note: we also want to test new letters to get more information.

We know that the secret word has R and A. We have two known letters. We should try to use a word that places R and A in positions that are allowed and also tests other common letters.

Let me consider the position constraints for R and A:

For R: cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
For A: cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In ""party"":
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in position 2 and now it's 3, which is different)

Also, we are testing P, T, and Y.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

But without more information, ""party"" seems like a good guess.

Another common word: ""stare"" but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use ""stare"".

We must avoid E.

So, let's avoid words with E, C, N.

Another word: ""piano"" but we know A is in the word, but we also know that the word doesn't have C and N? Actually, we know C and N are not in the word, so ""piano"" has N? Wait, ""piano"" has N? Yes, and N is not in the word. So we cannot use ""piano"".

Similarly, ""train"" has N? Yes, so avoid.

So, ""party"" is acceptable: no C, N, E.

Let me check: P, A, R, T, Y. None of the forbidden letters.

So, I'll go with ""party"".

But note: we are also trying to get as much information as possible. We are testing three new letters: P, T, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down the word.

Therefore, the second guess is ""party"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3). So R must be in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5), and A must be in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""party"" because:
- It includes the known letters R and A, placing them in new positions (A in position 2 and R in position 3) to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, N, and E.
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, Y) to gather more feedback.

<guess>party</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the letter A in the second position (position 2). So, the second letter is A.

2. The letters that are in the word: 
   - R is in the word (from both guesses) but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - P is in the word (from second guess) but not in position 1. So P is in the word and must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is A).

3. Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, Y.

4. We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.

Now, let's list the known information about the secret word:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Contains R (not in pos 2 or 3) and P (not in pos 1).
- Does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in position 2 (because we know it's correct, but we can use it to test other letters).
- Includes R and P in positions that are possible (for R: 1,4,5; for P: 3,4,5) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.
- Avoids the letters C, N, E, T, Y.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for P: 3, 4, 5

But note: we don't know if R and P are in the same position? They could be, but we have to assign them to different positions.

We also need to consider that the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

We know the second letter is A, so the word is: _ A _ _ _

We need to place R and P in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but note that position 1,3,4,5 are open.

But we have two known letters to place: R and P, and we have three other letters to guess.

We can try to form a word that has:
- A in position 2.
- R in one of the positions 1,4,5 (but not 2 or 3, which we already tried and failed).
- P in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1, which we tried and failed).

Also, we must avoid T, Y, C, N, E.

Let me think of words that fit:

Option 1: Place R in position 1 and P in position 3? 
- Then the word would be: R A P _ _
But we need two more letters. Words like ""rapid"" but D is allowed? But we haven't tested D. However, ""rapid"" has D and I, but we don't know about I. But note: we must avoid T, so ""rapid"" is acceptable? But we also have to check if it has any forbidden letters? It doesn't have C, N, E, T, Y. So ""rapid"" is a candidate.

But wait, in ""rapid"", P is in position 3. We haven't tested position 3 for P? Actually, in the second guess, we had P in position 1 and it was wrong, but we don't know about position 3. So it's allowed.

Similarly, R in position 1: in the first guess R was in position 2 (wrong) and in the second guess R was in position 3 (wrong), so position 1 is new and allowed.

But we have to see if ""rapid"" is a valid word.

Another option: Place R in position 4 and P in position 3? Then we have: _ A P R _
What words? Like ""paper"" but E is forbidden. Or ""capri"" but C is forbidden. So not.

Place R in position 5 and P in position 3: _ A P _ R -> words like ""vapor"" but O and V are new, and we avoid forbidden letters? ""vapor"" has V, A, P, O, R. No forbidden letters. But we don't know about V and O.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put both R and P in the same guess? But we know they are in the word, so we might as well use them to get their positions.

But we have to consider that we have limited guesses.

We also want to test other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ""rapid"": R in pos1, A in pos2, P in pos3, I in pos4, D in pos5. 
   - This tests R in pos1, P in pos3, and also I and D.

2. ""vapor"": V in pos1, A in pos2, P in pos3, O in pos4, R in pos5.
   - Tests V, O, and R in pos5, P in pos3.

3. ""lapel"": but E is forbidden, so no.

4. ""radar"": but R is in pos1 and pos5, and A in pos2 and pos4? But we have A in pos2, so: R A D A R. But we don't know about D. However, we have two A's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters? But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, in our case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far, but it's possible.

But note: in the feedback for ""party"", we had A as correct and R as present, but if the word had two R's, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, in ""party"", we have one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the secret word has two R's, we might have gotten one marked and the other not? But we don't know.

To be safe, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now, unless necessary.

So ""radar"" has two R's and two A's. We know A is in position 2, so if we use ""radar"", we have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might complicate the feedback.

Similarly, ""rapid"" has no duplicates.

Another word: ""palsy"" but Y is forbidden.

""balsa"" but S and A again? And we don't know about S. But ""balsa"" has A in position 2? Let's see: B A L S A. So A in position 2 and 5. But we know A is in position 2, so that's fixed. But we have another A? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S is new.

But we must avoid Y? ""balsa"" doesn't have Y, but it has S and L and B.

But we also have to avoid T? Yes, and it doesn't have T.

But we are missing R and P? We know the word must have R and P. But ""balsa"" does not have R or P? So it cannot be the secret word because the secret word has R and P. Therefore, we cannot guess ""balsa"" because it doesn't include the known letters R and P? Actually, we are allowed to guess any word, but it's inefficient because we know R and P must be in the word, so we should include them to get their positions.

So we should include both R and P in the guess to try to pin down their positions.

Therefore, words like ""rapid"" and ""vapor"" are good.

Another word: ""grasp"": G R A S P. But in this word, A is in position 3? But we need A in position 2. So we cannot use ""grasp"" because it would put A in position 3, but we know A is in position 2. So we must have A in position 2.

So the word must be: _ A _ _ _

Therefore, ""grasp"" is not valid for our pattern.

Similarly, ""cramp"" has C which is forbidden.

So back to ""rapid"" and ""vapor"".

We can also consider ""drape"": but E is forbidden.

""laird"": L A I R D -> R is in position 4. This has A in position 2, and R in position 4. But we are missing P? We know P is in the word, so we must include P? Otherwise, we are not testing P's position.

We must include P because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

So the guess should include P.

Similarly, we must include R.

Therefore, the guess must have A in position 2, and include R and P, and avoid C, N, E, T, Y.

So let's list possible words:

- ""rapid"": R A P I D
- ""vapor"": V A P O R
- ""paper"": but E is forbidden.
- ""tapir"": T is forbidden.
- ""rapid"" and ""vapor"" are the main candidates.

Another one: ""sappy"" has Y and two P's? And Y is forbidden.

""ramps"": has S and M, but also S is new. But ""ramps"": R A M P S -> P is in position 4. This avoids forbidden letters? No T, no Y, no C, N, E. So it's acceptable.

So we have three candidates: ""rapid"", ""vapor"", ""ramps"".

Now, which one to choose?

We want to maximize information. We can look at the frequency of the new letters.

In ""rapid"": new letters are I and D.
In ""vapor"": new letters are V, O, and R is in position 5 (which we haven't tested for R).
In ""ramps"": new letters are M and S.

Common letters: S is very common, so testing S might be good. M is medium, I and D are common, V and O are less common.

But we also have to consider the positions.

We know R must be in 1,4,5. In ""rapid"", R is in 1; in ""vapor"", R is in 5; in ""ramps"", R is in 1.

Similarly, P: in ""rapid"" it's in 3; in ""vapor"" in 3; in ""ramps"" in 4.

We haven't tested position 1 for R, position 3 for P, position 4 for P, position 5 for R.

We might want to test a position for R that we haven't tested. We have tested position 2 and 3 for R (both wrong), so positions 1,4,5 are open.

Similarly for P, we have tested position 1 (wrong), so positions 3,4,5 are open.

In ""rapid"", we test R in 1 and P in 3.
In ""vapor"", we test R in 5 and P in 3.
In ""ramps"", we test R in 1 and P in 4.

We haven't tested position 4 for P at all, and position 5 for R at all.

But we are testing multiple things.

Another factor: the word ""ramps"" has S, which is a very common letter, so it might be good to test S.

Similarly, ""rapid"" has I and D, which are also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

I recall that in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know A and R are in, and we have excluded E, T, N, C. So the next common are I, O, S, L, etc.

S is more common than V, so ""ramps"" or ""rapid"" might be better than ""vapor"".

Between ""rapid"" and ""ramps"", which one?

""rapid"" has I and D, ""ramps"" has M and S.

S is more common than M, and I is more common than M? Let me think.

Actually, S is very common, I is common, D is common, M is less common.

But we are also testing positions.

We might also consider that if we guess ""ramps"", we are putting P in position 4, which we haven't tested. In ""rapid"", we are putting P in position 3, which we haven't tested either.

But we have no strong preference.

Another candidate: ""larva"" but V and A again? And no P? We must include P.

Or ""parry"" has Y, forbidden.

I think ""rapid"" and ""ramps"" are both good.

But let me check if ""ramps"" is a word? Yes, ramp is a word, and ramps is the plural, which is allowed in Wordle? Actually, Wordle uses common nouns, including plurals, so yes.

Similarly, ""rapid"" is a word.

I'll choose ""rapid"" because it has two vowels (I) which might be helpful, and D is common.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know if it has another vowel. Since E is out, the vowels left are A (already in), I, O, U. So testing I might be good.

In ""ramps"", we have no vowel besides A, so it might not help in finding vowels.

So I think ""rapid"" is a better choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""rapid"".

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: R (we are testing if R is in position 1)
- Position 2: A (correct, so we'll get a check for A)
- Position 3: P (testing P in position 3)
- Position 4: I (new letter)
- Position 5: D (new letter)

And no forbidden letters.

So, the guess is ""rapid"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → P(in word, wrong position), A(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), T(not in word), Y(not in word).

### Key Insights:
1. **A is confirmed** in position 2 (second letter).
2. **R and P are in the word** but not in the positions guessed:
   - R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - P is not in position 1 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, T, Y (not in the word at all).
4. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _`.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Include **A in position 2** (since it's confirmed).
- Include **R and P** to test their valid positions (R in 1/4/5; P in 3/4/5).
- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, E, T, Y).
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, D, S, O) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words that place R and P in untested positions to narrow down possibilities.

Selected guess: **""rapid""**  
- **R** in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).  
- **A** in position 2 (confirmed, so feedback will show ✓).  
- **P** in position 3 (tests if P is in position 3).  
- **I** in position 4 (new letter test).  
- **D** in position 5 (new letter test).  

This guess efficiently tests R and P in new positions while introducing common letters (I and D) for additional feedback. If R or P are misplaced, it will help identify their correct positions, and we'll learn about I and D.

We should choose a word that:\n1. Includes R and A (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n2. Avoids using C, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n3. Uses other common letters to try to find more about the secret word.\n\nLet\'s think about the positions:\n- In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3. So in the new word, R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.\n\nWe can try to place R and A in other positions. Also, we might want to include other vowels or common consonants.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)\n\nWe also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nSome ideas:\n- We could try ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y\n  - A is in position 2 (which is allowed, since previously A was in position 3 and now it\'s different)\n  - R is in position 3 (previously it was in position 2, so that\'s a different position)\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if P, T, Y are in the word. This is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother option: ""roast"" but we know that the word doesn\'t have S? Wait, we don\'t know about S yet. Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t test S. But ""roast"" has S and T, and we know that E is not in the word, but S might be.\n\nBut wait, the first guess was ""crane"" and we got E as not present, but S wasn\'t tested. So we can use S.\n\nHowever, note that in ""crane"", the letter S was not present, so we have no information about S.\n\nBut we must avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E:\n\n- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y\n- ""tramp"": T, R, A, M, P (but has two P\'s? Actually, it\'s T, R, A, M, P -> two P\'s? No: T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Actually, no duplicate letters? The word is ""tramp"" -> T, R, A, M, P -> all distinct? Yes, but M and P are new.\n- ""gravy"": G, R, A, V, Y\n- ""dairy"": D, A, I, R, Y\n\nBut note: we also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWe know that the secret word has R and A. We have two known letters. We should try to use a word that places R and A in positions that are allowed and also tests other common letters.\n\nLet me consider the position constraints for R and A:\n\nFor R: cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nFor A: cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""party"":\n- A is in position 2 (allowed)\n- R is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in position 2 and now it\'s 3, which is different)\n\nAlso, we are testing P, T, and Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that puts R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.\n\nBut without more information, ""party"" seems like a good guess.\n\nAnother common word: ""stare"" but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use ""stare"".\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with E, C, N.\n\nAnother word: ""piano"" but we know A is in the word, but we also know that the word doesn\'t have C and N? Actually, we know C and N are not in the word, so ""piano"" has N? Wait, ""piano"" has N? Yes, and N is not in the word. So we cannot use ""piano"".\n\nSimilarly, ""train"" has N? Yes, so avoid.\n\nSo, ""party"" is acceptable: no C, N, E.\n\nLet me check: P, A, R, T, Y. None of the forbidden letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""party"".\n\nBut note: we are also trying to get as much information as possible. We are testing three new letters: P, T, Y.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down the word.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""party"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3). So R must be in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5), and A must be in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""party"" because:\n- It includes the known letters R and A, placing them in new positions (A in position 2 and R in position 3) to test their correct placement.\n- It avoids the excluded letters C, N, and E.\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, Y) to gather more feedback.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n- P: - (in the word, but not in position 1)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- Y: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter A in the second position (position 2). So, the second letter is A.\n\n2. The letters that are in the word: \n   - R is in the word (from both guesses) but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n   - P is in the word (from second guess) but not in position 1. So P is in the word and must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is A).\n\n3. Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, Y.\n\n4. We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.\n\nNow, let\'s list the known information about the secret word:\n- Position 2: A (fixed)\n- Contains R (not in pos 2 or 3) and P (not in pos 1).\n- Does not contain: C, N, E, T, Y.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Has A in position 2 (because we know it\'s correct, but we can use it to test other letters).\n- Includes R and P in positions that are possible (for R: 1,4,5; for P: 3,4,5) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.\n- Avoids the letters C, N, E, T, Y.\n- Uses new common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 4, 5\nPossible positions for P: 3, 4, 5\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if R and P are in the same position? They could be, but we have to assign them to different positions.\n\nWe also need to consider that the word might have other letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWe know the second letter is A, so the word is: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to place R and P in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) but note that position 1,3,4,5 are open.\n\nBut we have two known letters to place: R and P, and we have three other letters to guess.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has:\n- A in position 2.\n- R in one of the positions 1,4,5 (but not 2 or 3, which we already tried and failed).\n- P in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1, which we tried and failed).\n\nAlso, we must avoid T, Y, C, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that fit:\n\nOption 1: Place R in position 1 and P in position 3? \n- Then the word would be: R A P _ _\nBut we need two more letters. Words like ""rapid"" but D is allowed? But we haven\'t tested D. However, ""rapid"" has D and I, but we don\'t know about I. But note: we must avoid T, so ""rapid"" is acceptable? But we also have to check if it has any forbidden letters? It doesn\'t have C, N, E, T, Y. So ""rapid"" is a candidate.\n\nBut wait, in ""rapid"", P is in position 3. We haven\'t tested position 3 for P? Actually, in the second guess, we had P in position 1 and it was wrong, but we don\'t know about position 3. So it\'s allowed.\n\nSimilarly, R in position 1: in the first guess R was in position 2 (wrong) and in the second guess R was in position 3 (wrong), so position 1 is new and allowed.\n\nBut we have to see if ""rapid"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: Place R in position 4 and P in position 3? Then we have: _ A P R _\nWhat words? Like ""paper"" but E is forbidden. Or ""capri"" but C is forbidden. So not.\n\nPlace R in position 5 and P in position 3: _ A P _ R -> words like ""vapor"" but O and V are new, and we avoid forbidden letters? ""vapor"" has V, A, P, O, R. No forbidden letters. But we don\'t know about V and O.\n\nBut we are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put both R and P in the same guess? But we know they are in the word, so we might as well use them to get their positions.\n\nBut we have to consider that we have limited guesses.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n1. ""rapid"": R in pos1, A in pos2, P in pos3, I in pos4, D in pos5. \n   - This tests R in pos1, P in pos3, and also I and D.\n\n2. ""vapor"": V in pos1, A in pos2, P in pos3, O in pos4, R in pos5.\n   - Tests V, O, and R in pos5, P in pos3.\n\n3. ""lapel"": but E is forbidden, so no.\n\n4. ""radar"": but R is in pos1 and pos5, and A in pos2 and pos4? But we have A in pos2, so: R A D A R. But we don\'t know about D. However, we have two A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters? But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. But we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, in our case, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so far, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""party"", we had A as correct and R as present, but if the word had two R\'s, we might have gotten a different feedback? Actually, in ""party"", we have one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the secret word has two R\'s, we might have gotten one marked and the other not? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s avoid words with duplicate letters for now, unless necessary.\n\nSo ""radar"" has two R\'s and two A\'s. We know A is in position 2, so if we use ""radar"", we have A in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might complicate the feedback.\n\nSimilarly, ""rapid"" has no duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""palsy"" but Y is forbidden.\n\n""balsa"" but S and A again? And we don\'t know about S. But ""balsa"" has A in position 2? Let\'s see: B A L S A. So A in position 2 and 5. But we know A is in position 2, so that\'s fixed. But we have another A? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, S is new.\n\nBut we must avoid Y? ""balsa"" doesn\'t have Y, but it has S and L and B.\n\nBut we also have to avoid T? Yes, and it doesn\'t have T.\n\nBut we are missing R and P? We know the word must have R and P. But ""balsa"" does not have R or P? So it cannot be the secret word because the secret word has R and P. Therefore, we cannot guess ""balsa"" because it doesn\'t include the known letters R and P? Actually, we are allowed to guess any word, but it\'s inefficient because we know R and P must be in the word, so we should include them to get their positions.\n\nSo we should include both R and P in the guess to try to pin down their positions.\n\nTherefore, words like ""rapid"" and ""vapor"" are good.\n\nAnother word: ""grasp"": G R A S P. But in this word, A is in position 3? But we need A in position 2. So we cannot use ""grasp"" because it would put A in position 3, but we know A is in position 2. So we must have A in position 2.\n\nSo the word must be: _ A _ _ _\n\nTherefore, ""grasp"" is not valid for our pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""cramp"" has C which is forbidden.\n\nSo back to ""rapid"" and ""vapor"".\n\nWe can also consider ""drape"": but E is forbidden.\n\n""laird"": L A I R D -> R is in position 4. This has A in position 2, and R in position 4. But we are missing P? We know P is in the word, so we must include P? Otherwise, we are not testing P\'s position.\n\nWe must include P because we know it\'s in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nSo the guess should include P.\n\nSimilarly, we must include R.\n\nTherefore, the guess must have A in position 2, and include R and P, and avoid C, N, E, T, Y.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""rapid"": R A P I D\n- ""vapor"": V A P O R\n- ""paper"": but E is forbidden.\n- ""tapir"": T is forbidden.\n- ""rapid"" and ""vapor"" are the main candidates.\n\nAnother one: ""sappy"" has Y and two P\'s? And Y is forbidden.\n\n""ramps"": has S and M, but also S is new. But ""ramps"": R A M P S -> P is in position 4. This avoids forbidden letters? No T, no Y, no C, N, E. So it\'s acceptable.\n\nSo we have three candidates: ""rapid"", ""vapor"", ""ramps"".\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nWe want to maximize information. We can look at the frequency of the new letters.\n\nIn ""rapid"": new letters are I and D.\nIn ""vapor"": new letters are V, O, and R is in position 5 (which we haven\'t tested for R).\nIn ""ramps"": new letters are M and S.\n\nCommon letters: S is very common, so testing S might be good. M is medium, I and D are common, V and O are less common.\n\nBut we also have to consider the positions.\n\nWe know R must be in 1,4,5. In ""rapid"", R is in 1; in ""vapor"", R is in 5; in ""ramps"", R is in 1.\n\nSimilarly, P: in ""rapid"" it\'s in 3; in ""vapor"" in 3; in ""ramps"" in 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 1 for R, position 3 for P, position 4 for P, position 5 for R.\n\nWe might want to test a position for R that we haven\'t tested. We have tested position 2 and 3 for R (both wrong), so positions 1,4,5 are open.\n\nSimilarly for P, we have tested position 1 (wrong), so positions 3,4,5 are open.\n\nIn ""rapid"", we test R in 1 and P in 3.\nIn ""vapor"", we test R in 5 and P in 3.\nIn ""ramps"", we test R in 1 and P in 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 4 for P at all, and position 5 for R at all.\n\nBut we are testing multiple things.\n\nAnother factor: the word ""ramps"" has S, which is a very common letter, so it might be good to test S.\n\nSimilarly, ""rapid"" has I and D, which are also common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\nI recall that in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know A and R are in, and we have excluded E, T, N, C. So the next common are I, O, S, L, etc.\n\nS is more common than V, so ""ramps"" or ""rapid"" might be better than ""vapor"".\n\nBetween ""rapid"" and ""ramps"", which one?\n\n""rapid"" has I and D, ""ramps"" has M and S.\n\nS is more common than M, and I is more common than M? Let me think.\n\nActually, S is very common, I is common, D is common, M is less common.\n\nBut we are also testing positions.\n\nWe might also consider that if we guess ""ramps"", we are putting P in position 4, which we haven\'t tested. In ""rapid"", we are putting P in position 3, which we haven\'t tested either.\n\nBut we have no strong preference.\n\nAnother candidate: ""larva"" but V and A again? And no P? We must include P.\n\nOr ""parry"" has Y, forbidden.\n\nI think ""rapid"" and ""ramps"" are both good.\n\nBut let me check if ""ramps"" is a word? Yes, ramp is a word, and ramps is the plural, which is allowed in Wordle? Actually, Wordle uses common nouns, including plurals, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""rapid"" is a word.\n\nI\'ll choose ""rapid"" because it has two vowels (I) which might be helpful, and D is common.\n\nBut we know the word has A, and we don\'t know if it has another vowel. Since E is out, the vowels left are A (already in), I, O, U. So testing I might be good.\n\nIn ""ramps"", we have no vowel besides A, so it might not help in finding vowels.\n\nSo I think ""rapid"" is a better choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""rapid"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- Position 1: R (we are testing if R is in position 1)\n- Position 2: A (correct, so we\'ll get a check for A)\n- Position 3: P (testing P in position 3)\n- Position 4: I (new letter)\n- Position 5: D (new letter)\n\nAnd no forbidden letters.\n\nSo, the guess is ""rapid"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  \n- **Guess 2: ""party""** → P(in word, wrong position), A(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), T(not in word), Y(not in word).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **A is confirmed** in position 2 (second letter).\n2. **R and P are in the word** but not in the positions guessed:\n   - R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n   - P is not in position 1 (from ""party""), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n3. **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, T, Y (not in the word at all).\n4. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _`.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Include **A in position 2** (since it\'s confirmed).\n- Include **R and P** to test their valid positions (R in 1/4/5; P in 3/4/5).\n- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, E, T, Y).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., I, D, S, O) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize words that place R and P in untested positions to narrow down possibilities.\n\nSelected guess: **""rapid""**  \n- **R** in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).  \n- **A** in position 2 (confirmed, so feedback will show ✓).  \n- **P** in position 3 (tests if P is in position 3).  \n- **I** in position 4 (new letter test).  \n- **D** in position 5 (new letter test).  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and P in new positions while introducing common letters (I and D) for additional feedback. If R or P are misplaced, it will help identify their correct positions, and we\'ll learn about I and D.\n\n<guess>rapid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: rapid -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(✓) I(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""party"" → Feedback: P(-), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)
Interpretation:
- A is correct and in position 2.
- P is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong position).
- T and Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""rapid"" → Feedback: R(-), A(✓), P(✓), I(x), D(x)
Interpretation:
- A and P are correct: A in position 2 (as before) and P in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked wrong position).
- I and D are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

Known letters and positions:
- Position 2: A (from guess 2, confirmed again in guess 3)
- Position 3: P (confirmed in guess 3)

R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from three guesses: not in 2 from ""crane"", not in 3 from ""party"", and not in 1 from ""rapid""). Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5.

Additionally, we know:
- The word contains P (position 3 fixed) and R (somewhere in 4 or 5), and A (position 2).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, T, Y, I, D (from all feedback)
- The word does not contain any of: C, E, N, T, Y, I, D

We need to find a word that fits: _ A P ? ? 
- The last two positions must include R in either the 4th or 5th position, and the remaining position is an unknown letter.
- Since R must be in the word and can only be in 4 or 5, one of the last two letters is R, and the other is a new letter that isn't excluded.

Also, note that in the pattern, position 1 is still unknown (it must not be any of the excluded letters).

We must avoid: C, E, N, T, Y, I, D

Therefore, the remaining letters are from: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word with:
- Position 1: any letter not excluded
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: either R or another letter
- Position 5: if position 4 is R, then another letter; else R

But note: we know the word has R, and it must be in position 4 or 5.

So possible patterns:
1. The R is in position 4: pattern becomes _ A P R _
2. The R is in position 5: pattern becomes _ A P _ R

We need to find valid words for each case.

First, for pattern _ A P R _ 
- We have a letter in position 1 and position 5 (both unknown but not excluded).
- Without knowing the word, we can try to think of words that end with R? But the pattern is _APR_

For example: 
- ""paper"" but E is excluded.
- ""vapor"" has O and R, but position: V A P O R → that puts R in position 5, not position 4! So for _APR_, it must be like ""mapri"" which isn't a word? 

Let me think of words ending with APR? Actually, _ A P R _ could be like:
- ""capri"" but C is excluded.
- ""tapri"" not a word.

Common words:
- ""apron"" but N is excluded and O is allowed? Let's see: A P R O N → but N is excluded, so invalid.
- ""April""? But ""April"" is 5 letters: A P R I L → but I is excluded. And also, position 2 is A, position 3 is P? In ""April"", position 1 is A, which would be wrong because we need position 2 to be A. So ""April"" doesn't fit the pattern because we have _ A P R _.

For the pattern _ A P R _, we require the first letter to be something and the last letter to be something, with the middle ""APR"". 

But ""APR"" at positions 2-4: that means position 1 is one letter, position 5 is one letter.

Is there such a word? For example:
- ""vapor"" is V A P O R → which is _ A P _ R, so R in position 5. That's the other pattern.

I'm having trouble finding words for _ A P R _. Let me list:

Actually, I think ""paper"" was one, but E is excluded. Others? ""gaper"" has E and G; but E excluded.

Perhaps ""ramps""? But ""ramps"" is R A M P S → positions: R(1), A(2), M(3), P(4), S(5). But that has P in position 4, but we know P must be in position 3. So no.

So maybe the pattern with R in position 4 is uncommon? Perhaps I should look for the other pattern.

Second pattern: R in position 5 → _ A P _ R
- Then, the word is: (letter1) A P (letter4) R
- Position 4 is unknown, and position 1 is unknown.

We need to find words of the form ? A P ? R

For example:
- ""paper"" → P A P E R → but repetition of P? And E excluded. Also, position 1 is P, but P is already in position 3? The word has two P's? But in our previous feedback, we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed. However, in ""rapid"" we guessed only one P and it was correct in position 3, so if the secret word has two P's, we might have got additional feedback? In ""rapid"", we had P in position 3 correct and we got P(✓), but if there was another P elsewhere, it might have been indicated? Actually, no: the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. If a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will reflect each occurrence. In ""rapid"", since we only guessed one P and it was in position 3 and marked correct, it tells us that there is at least one P, and it's correctly placed. If there was another P in position 1 or 4, it might not be revealed because we didn't guess it. So duplicates are possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Back to ? A P ? R

Words of form ? A P ? R:
- ""vapor"": V A P O R → fits ? A P ? R with V in position 1, O in position 4, R in 5. And avoids excluded letters: V and O are allowed. So ""vapor"" is a candidate.

Other words:
- ""taper"": T A P E R → has T (excluded) and E (excluded). So invalid.
- ""caper"": C (excluded) and E.
- ""paper"": has E and duplicate P? P A P E R → positions: P in 1 and 3? But we have P in position 3? So if we have another P in position 1, it might be marked. But E excluded.
- ""sapor"": S A P O R → S, A, P, O, R. No excluded letters? S, O, R are allowed? S is new, O is new. And it's a word? Yes, ""sapor"" means flavor.

So ""vapor"" and ""sapor"" are both candidates? But ""sapor"" vs ""vapor"": ""vapor"" is more common.

Also, ""capri"" was excluded because of C.

Another word: ""haply""? H A P L Y → but Y excluded.

Or ""ampul""? Not fitting pattern.

So main candidate is ""vapor"": V A P O R.

We can also consider: ""maple"" but E excluded.

What about the pattern with R in position 4? _ A P R _

We couldn't find common words. Let me try again:
- Possible: ""sabra""? But that's S A B R A → which is _ A _ _ _, not _ A P R _.

Perhaps it's not possible? Then R must be in position 5.

So ? A P _ R

And we have ""vapor"".

But there might be other words: for example, ""bakra""? Not a word? Or ""daper"" has E? ""kapor"" not a word? ""lapel"" has E? Etc.

Therefore, the only common word seems to be ""vapor"".

Now, position 1: unknown letter. In ""vapor"", it's V.

We haven't tested V before, so it's good to test.

We also know the word has no duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but ""vapor"" has no duplicates: V, A, P, O, R.

And it fits: R is in position 5 (allowed, since we haven't tested it there).

Thus, we can guess ""vapor"".

But note: we know P is in position 3, which is fixed, and in ""vapor"" P is in position 3? Let's check:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: R

Yes, so P is in position 3, which we know is correct.

And R is in position 5, which is an allowed position.

Also, avoids all excluded letters: C, N, E, T, Y, I, D.

Therefore, I choose ""vapor"".

But we have another possibility? What about ""gapor""? Not a word.

Or ""tapor"" has T, excluded.

So ""vapor"" seems the best.

Alternatively, we could guess a word with S? But ""sapor"" is an alternative, but ""vapor"" is more common.

We need to make sure. Another word: ""jazzy"" but Y and multiple Z, doesn't fit pattern? Pattern requires A P and R in 4 or 5.

""vapor"" is the safest.

Perhaps we can test R in position 5 and also include S? But in ""vapor"" we have O, which is common.

We are running out of guesses? We are on guess 4 of 6, so we have two more.

But if ""vapor"" is correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

So I'll go with ""vapor"".After analyzing the cumulative feedback:

- **Confirmed Positions:**  
  - 2nd letter: **A**  
  - 3rd letter: **P**  

- **R Constraints:**  
  - Must be in position 4 or 5 (excluded from positions 1, 2, 3).  

- **Excluded Letters:** C, E, N, T, Y, I, D  

- **Known-Letters in Word:** A, P, R  

- **Pattern:** `_ A P ? ?`, with `? ?` including R in position 4 or 5 and one additional letter.  

Only the pattern `_ A P _ R` fits common words (e.g., **""vapor""**), given that alternatives with R in position 4 are uncommon or invalid. ""Vapor"" (V A P O R):  
- Avoids excluded letters.  
- Tests R in position 5.  
- Introduces new letters (V, O) for feedback if incorrect.  
- Fills the known positions accurately.  

<guess>vapor</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**  
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
     - R is in the word (wrong position, not 2).  
     - A is in the word (wrong position, not 3).  
     - C, N, E are **not** in the word.  
   - **Guess 2 (""party""):**  
     - A is **correct** in position 2.  
     - P is in the word (wrong position, not 1).  
     - R is in the word (wrong position, not 3).  
     - T, Y are **not** in the word.  
   - **Guess 3 (""rapid""):**  
     - A is **correct** in position 2 (reconfirmed).  
     - P is **correct** in position 3.  
     - R is in the word (wrong position, not 1).  
     - I, D are **not** in the word.  

2. **Key Deductions:**  
   - **Confirmed Positions:**  
     - Position 2 **= A**  
     - Position 3 **= P**  
   - **R Placement Constraints:**  
     - R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback). Only positions 4 or 5 are possible.  
   - **Excluded Letters:** C, E, N, T, Y, I, D (absolutely NOT in the word).  
   - **Known Letters in Word:** A, P, R (all must appear).  
   - **Pattern:** The word follows `_ A P ? ?`, where:  
     - One `?` is R (position 4 or 5).  
     - The other `?` is an unknown letter (not excluded).  
     - Position 1 is also unknown (not excluded).  

3. **Pattern Exploration:**  
   - **Pattern with R in Position 4 (`_ A P R _`):**  
     - Rare in English (e.g., ""apron"" invalid due to N, ""April"" has I at start and L, but I excluded). No common valid words found.  
   - **Pattern with R in Position 5 (`_ A P _ R`):**  
     - Fits common words like **""vapor""** (V A P O R):  
       - Position 5 = R (allowed).  
       - Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, N, T, Y, I, D).  
       - Uses new letters (V, O) for testing.  
     - Other options (e.g., ""sapor"") less common; ""paper"" invalid (E excluded).  

4. **Decision:**  
   - **""vapor""** is optimal:  
     - Tests R in position 5 (last untested position).  
     - Confirms P in position 3 (already known, safe reuse).  
     - Tests two new common letters (V, O) if incorrect.  
     - High likelihood of being correct or providing critical feedback.  

<guess>vapor</guess>",vapor,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""party"" → Feedback: P(-), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)
Interpretation:
- A is correct and in position 2.
- P is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong position).
- T and Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""rapid"" → Feedback: R(-), A(✓), P(✓), I(x), D(x)
Interpretation:
- A and P are correct: A in position 2 (as before) and P in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked wrong position).
- I and D are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

Known letters and positions:
- Position 2: A (from guess 2, confirmed again in guess 3)
- Position 3: P (confirmed in guess 3)

R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from three guesses: not in 2 from ""crane"", not in 3 from ""party"", and not in 1 from ""rapid""). Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5.

Additionally, we know:
- The word contains P (position 3 fixed) and R (somewhere in 4 or 5), and A (position 2).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, T, Y, I, D (from all feedback)
- The word does not contain any of: C, E, N, T, Y, I, D

We need to find a word that fits: _ A P ? ? 
- The last two positions must include R in either the 4th or 5th position, and the remaining position is an unknown letter.
- Since R must be in the word and can only be in 4 or 5, one of the last two letters is R, and the other is a new letter that isn't excluded.

Also, note that in the pattern, position 1 is still unknown (it must not be any of the excluded letters).

We must avoid: C, E, N, T, Y, I, D

Therefore, the remaining letters are from: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word with:
- Position 1: any letter not excluded
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: either R or another letter
- Position 5: if position 4 is R, then another letter; else R

But note: we know the word has R, and it must be in position 4 or 5.

So possible patterns:
1. The R is in position 4: pattern becomes _ A P R _
2. The R is in position 5: pattern becomes _ A P _ R

We need to find valid words for each case.

First, for pattern _ A P R _ 
- We have a letter in position 1 and position 5 (both unknown but not excluded).
- Without knowing the word, we can try to think of words that end with R? But the pattern is _APR_

For example: 
- ""paper"" but E is excluded.
- ""vapor"" has O and R, but position: V A P O R → that puts R in position 5, not position 4! So for _APR_, it must be like ""mapri"" which isn't a word? 

Let me think of words ending with APR? Actually, _ A P R _ could be like:
- ""capri"" but C is excluded.
- ""tapri"" not a word.

Common words:
- ""apron"" but N is excluded and O is allowed? Let's see: A P R O N → but N is excluded, so invalid.
- ""April""? But ""April"" is 5 letters: A P R I L → but I is excluded. And also, position 2 is A, position 3 is P? In ""April"", position 1 is A, which would be wrong because we need position 2 to be A. So ""April"" doesn't fit the pattern because we have _ A P R _.

For the pattern _ A P R _, we require the first letter to be something and the last letter to be something, with the middle ""APR"". 

But ""APR"" at positions 2-4: that means position 1 is one letter, position 5 is one letter.

Is there such a word? For example:
- ""vapor"" is V A P O R → which is _ A P _ R, so R in position 5. That's the other pattern.

I'm having trouble finding words for _ A P R _. Let me list:

Actually, I think ""paper"" was one, but E is excluded. Others? ""gaper"" has E and G; but E excluded.

Perhaps ""ramps""? But ""ramps"" is R A M P S → positions: R(1), A(2), M(3), P(4), S(5). But that has P in position 4, but we know P must be in position 3. So no.

So maybe the pattern with R in position 4 is uncommon? Perhaps I should look for the other pattern.

Second pattern: R in position 5 → _ A P _ R
- Then, the word is: (letter1) A P (letter4) R
- Position 4 is unknown, and position 1 is unknown.

We need to find words of the form ? A P ? R

For example:
- ""paper"" → P A P E R → but repetition of P? And E excluded. Also, position 1 is P, but P is already in position 3? The word has two P's? But in our previous feedback, we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed. However, in ""rapid"" we guessed only one P and it was correct in position 3, so if the secret word has two P's, we might have got additional feedback? In ""rapid"", we had P in position 3 correct and we got P(✓), but if there was another P elsewhere, it might have been indicated? Actually, no: the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. If a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will reflect each occurrence. In ""rapid"", since we only guessed one P and it was in position 3 and marked correct, it tells us that there is at least one P, and it's correctly placed. If there was another P in position 1 or 4, it might not be revealed because we didn't guess it. So duplicates are possible.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Back to ? A P ? R

Words of form ? A P ? R:
- ""vapor"": V A P O R → fits ? A P ? R with V in position 1, O in position 4, R in 5. And avoids excluded letters: V and O are allowed. So ""vapor"" is a candidate.

Other words:
- ""taper"": T A P E R → has T (excluded) and E (excluded). So invalid.
- ""caper"": C (excluded) and E.
- ""paper"": has E and duplicate P? P A P E R → positions: P in 1 and 3? But we have P in position 3? So if we have another P in position 1, it might be marked. But E excluded.
- ""sapor"": S A P O R → S, A, P, O, R. No excluded letters? S, O, R are allowed? S is new, O is new. And it's a word? Yes, ""sapor"" means flavor.

So ""vapor"" and ""sapor"" are both candidates? But ""sapor"" vs ""vapor"": ""vapor"" is more common.

Also, ""capri"" was excluded because of C.

Another word: ""haply""? H A P L Y → but Y excluded.

Or ""ampul""? Not fitting pattern.

So main candidate is ""vapor"": V A P O R.

We can also consider: ""maple"" but E excluded.

What about the pattern with R in position 4? _ A P R _

We couldn't find common words. Let me try again:
- Possible: ""sabra""? But that's S A B R A → which is _ A _ _ _, not _ A P R _.

Perhaps it's not possible? Then R must be in position 5.

So ? A P _ R

And we have ""vapor"".

But there might be other words: for example, ""bakra""? Not a word? Or ""daper"" has E? ""kapor"" not a word? ""lapel"" has E? Etc.

Therefore, the only common word seems to be ""vapor"".

Now, position 1: unknown letter. In ""vapor"", it's V.

We haven't tested V before, so it's good to test.

We also know the word has no duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but ""vapor"" has no duplicates: V, A, P, O, R.

And it fits: R is in position 5 (allowed, since we haven't tested it there).

Thus, we can guess ""vapor"".

But note: we know P is in position 3, which is fixed, and in ""vapor"" P is in position 3? Let's check:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: R

Yes, so P is in position 3, which we know is correct.

And R is in position 5, which is an allowed position.

Also, avoids all excluded letters: C, N, E, T, Y, I, D.

Therefore, I choose ""vapor"".

But we have another possibility? What about ""gapor""? Not a word.

Or ""tapor"" has T, excluded.

So ""vapor"" seems the best.
