We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the properties:
 - We want to cover as many common letters as possible.
 - The word should have 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 According to various sources, one of the best starting words is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 Since we are allowed only 5-letter words, I'll choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the problem says: ""return your guessed word in the format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So, for the first guess, I will use ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for Guess 3: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter must be N
 - E is not in the word (x)

 So the secret word has:
   - The letter R, but not in the 2nd position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2).
   - The letter N in the 4th position (so _ _ _ N _)
   - Letters that are not C, A, E. Also, R is present but not at position 2.

 We know the word does not contain C, A, E (from the x's). But note: R is in the word.

 We need to make a second valid guess (this is the fourth guess overall, but the first valid one was CRANE, and now we are on our second valid guess).

 Let's think of words that:
   - Have N in the 4th position.
   - Contain the letter R, but not in the 2nd position.
   - Avoid the letters C, A, E.

 Also, since we only got one correct (N) and one misplaced (R), we want to test other common letters.

 The remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 5.

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, or 5.

 Let's list possible common letters to try: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, U, I, etc.

 We can try a word that has:
   - Position 4: N (fixed)
   - Includes R in either position 1, 3, or 5.
   - Avoids C, A, E.

 Some possibilities:

 To get more information, we can try a word that has R in a new position and includes other common letters.

 Example words with N in the 4th position:

   ...N*

 Since position 4 is N, the word is ? ? ? N ?

 Let me brainstorm:

   Possible words: 
     SIREN -> but E is not allowed (we have E as x) so skip.
     BORNS -> not a word? not valid.
     HORNS -> H O R N S: let's check: 
        H in position 1, O in 2, R in 3, N in 4, S in 5.
        But we have R in the word? Yes. And R is at position 3 (not 2) so that's a possibility.

   However, we must avoid C, A, E. HORNS has no C, A, E. So it's okay.

   But note: HORNS is a valid word.

   Let's see if we can do better. We also want to test other common letters.

   Another possibility: BURNT -> B U R N T: 
        Position: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5). 
        Avoids C, A, E.

   Or: TURNS -> T U R N S.

   But note: in CRANE, we have R at position 2. In TURNS, R is at position 3. That's acceptable.

 However, we want to maximize information. In HORNS, we would be testing H, O, S. In TURNS, we test T, U, S.

 Another word: BIRTH? -> but position 4 is H, not N. Wrong.

 ORNIS? -> not a common word.

 We need valid words. Also, we haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Consider: STERN -> but E is forbidden. So skip.

 How about: STORK? -> but position 4 is K, not N. Not matching.

 So let's look for words ending with 'N' in the 4th position? Actually, the pattern is _ _ _ N _

 Words: 
  ...N.

 Common words: URN, but wait 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Let me use a dictionary:

   Possible words: 
     BORNS -> not valid? Actually, ""born"" is a word, but ""borns"" is not. So skip.
     CORNS -> has C, which is forbidden? C was x so avoid. Also, A and E forbidden.

   Alternatives:
     HORNS -> valid (horn + s)
     TORNS -> valid (tear past tense? but ""torn"" is the past participle, but ""torns"" is third person of tear? Not common, but acceptable? Actually, Wordle usually takes plurals? Yes, if in the word list.)

   However, Wordle word list accepts plurals? Typically yes.

   Other words: 
     WARNS -> has A? Wait, A is forbidden. No: W-A-R-N-S? But A is at position 2? We have A forbidden? In CRANE, A was at position 3 and we got x. So A is not in the word. So WARNS has A? Actually, W-A-R-N-S: yes, but A is not allowed. So skip.

     YARNS -> has A? Y-A-R-N-S -> A at position 2 -> forbidden.

     The vowel A is forbidden, so we need words without A and without E, and without C.

     Words without A, E, C and with R and N at 4th.

     Let me think: with vowels O, I, U?

     Words: 
        HORNS: H O R N S -> no A, E, C -> valid.
        TORNS: T O R N S -> same.
        BURNT: B U R N T -> no A, E, C -> valid.
        TURNS: T U R N S -> valid.
        FURNS? not a word? Furn is a root? Furnace. Skip.
        GURNS? Not common.

     Other?: 
        LORNS? Not common.
        KURNS? Not common.

     So common words: HORNS, TORNS, BURNT, TURNS, etc.

 Now, to decide: 

   We also haven't tested whether the word has O or U? We don't know.

   We can also consider: if we use HORNS, we test H, O, S (and R again, and N is fixed).

   With BURNT, we test B, U, R, N, T.

   Let me look at common letters.

   Alternatively, we can try to reuse the information: we know R is somewhere. We can try to put R at different positions.

   But note: we have N fixed at position 4. So:

   Pattern: _ _ R N _ -> then R is at position 3. 
   Pattern: R _ _ N _ -> R at 1.
   Pattern: _ _ _ N R -> R at 5.

   We can make a guess that tries R at one of these positions and introduces new letters.

   Since we have only one misplaced letter (R), we should try to include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

   We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus C, A, E).

   We should prioritize common letters: like S, T, L, O, U, I.

   Let me form a word:

      Option: Using R at position 1: 
        R _ _ N _ : avoid C, A, E -> e.g., ROMAN -> has A (forbidden) -> skip.
                   ROBIN -> has B and I, but B and I not tested. However, ROMAN is invalid because of A.

        With R at 1: e.g., ROSIN -> R O S I N: but that would have two Ns? N is at position 5? Then position 4 is I? But we need position 4 to be N? Wait no: in ROSIN, pattern: R(1),O(2),S(3),I(4),N(5). But in our case, the 4th letter is N. So that word has the 5th as N? Not matching. 

        Correct pattern: R _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and the last letter is unknown.

        Example: ROUND: has U and D, but also O? But R O U N D -> that has O, U, N, D. But U is new. However, note: we have N at 4th? In ROUND: O is at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5 -> yes.

        But we must avoid A, E, C. ROUND: R, O, U, N, D -> no A, E, C? Yes. 

        However, we already have R in the word? Yes, but we are testing R at position 1? That's acceptable because we know R is in the word. And by placing it at position 1, we can check if it belongs there.

        But note: we are also testing O, U, D.

        However, the word ROUND: 
          - R at 1: if the secret word has R at 1, we'll get ✓, else if R is elsewhere we might get - or x? But we already know R is present (from earlier feedback) so if at position 1 it's not R, we'll get -? Unless the secret word has two R's? But we don't know that.

        We don't have information on duplicate letters.

        Alternatively, we can avoid repeating R? But we know it's present so we can reuse it to try to locate the position.

      But wait: the feedback for R in CRANE was ""-"" meaning it's present but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1 in ROUND, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get ✓. If the secret word has R at position 3 or 5, then we'll get R at position 1 as - (if R is at another position) or x? But the rules: the feedback gives ""-"" if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. And since we know R is in the word, putting R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1: ✓; else: -.

        Actually, the feedback always considers occurrences: 
          - First, mark the exact matches. 
          - Then, for letters that are present in the word but in wrong positions, mark them with ""-"", but only for the remaining available ones.

        So if we put R at position 1 and the secret word has R only at position 3, then we'll get a ""-"" for the R at position 1? And then the R at the secret word's position 3 will be consumed? Then if we have another R? That's complex.

        To avoid confusion, and since we know R is present, we can try to put R in a new position to see if we can pin it down.

      Our goal is to maximize information. So we can try a word with R in a new position and new letters.

      Options:

        Put R at position 1: R _ _ N _
        Words: ROUND, RUBIN? (but RUBIN has U, B, I; and I at 4? Wait, RUBIN: R U B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> not matching.

        How about: RUSIN? -> not a word.

        How about: ROUT -> 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: ROUTS? But N is at 4th? No.

        We must have the pattern: ? ? ? N ? and with R at 1: R ? ? N ?

        Another word: ROBIN? -> R O B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> skip.

        Actually, for position 4 to be N, the word must be ? ? ? N ?.

        R followed by two letters then N and then one letter: R a b N c.

        Valid words: 
          RAHNS? Not valid.
          ROINS? -> ROINS is not common? But R O I N S -> pattern R O I N S -> position 4 is N? Actually: 
            position1: R, pos2: O, pos3: I, pos4: N?, but then S at 5. So that is ROINS? Not a standard word? Skip.

        RATIONS? But that's 7 letters.

        I think I'm stuck with words like ROUND? But ROUND: 
          R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches the pattern.

        And ROUND has no A, E, C -> so it's acceptable.

        Put R at position 3: 
          Pattern: _ _ R N _
          Example: BURNT: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5)
          Or TURNS: T(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), S(5)

        Put R at position 5:
          Pattern: _ _ _ N R
          Example: MINER? But E is forbidden -> skip.
                   LINER? E forbidden.
                   How about: BUNKR? Not valid. Or DOWNR? No.

          There are few words with R at the end and N in the middle? 

          Example: TENOR: T E N O R -> has E? forbidden. Skip.
                   MANOR: M A N O R -> has A? forbidden. Skip.
                   VAN?R: not valid.

          It's hard. Let me try: 
          Words ending in R: with N at position 4: then the word is ? ? ? N R.
          But the letter at position 3 must be a letter that combines with N to form ...NR.

          Common words: MINER? forbidden. DINER? forbidden. WINNER? double N? Not N at position 4: 
            W I N N E R: position 4 is N? Actually, WINNER: position1:W,2:I,3:N,4:N? Then E and R. But two Ns? 
            We don't have feedback about double letters? But also has E -> forbidden.

          Another: DONOR? D O N O R -> position 4 is the second O? And N is at position 3 -> so not matching? 
          We need N at 4: DONOR: D(1), O(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> so N is at position 3 -> skip.

          So R at position 5 seems difficult.

   Therefore, it's easier to try R at position 3: BURNT or TURNS? Or HORNS (with R at position 3: H O R N S).

   Now, comparing:

   Option 1: ROUND (R at position 1): 
        Tests letters: R (at 1), O (2), U (3), N (4) fixed, D (5). 
        We know N is fixed so we don't learn new about position 4. 
        We test new letters: O, U, D.

   Option 2: BURNT (R at position 3):
        Tests letters: B (1), U (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, T (5). 
        Tests new: B, U, T.

   Option 3: HORNS (R at position 3):
        Tests: H (1), O (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, S (5). 
        Tests new: H, O, S.

   All are valid.

   We want to cover common letters. Common letters: S, T, L, ... We haven't tested S or T.

   So TURNS: T (1), U (2), R (3), N (4), S (5) -> tests T, U, S. That covers T and S, both common.

   Also, note: with TURNS, we test T at position 1, U at 2, R at 3, S at 5.

   This seems efficient because we test two very common consonants: T and S.

   But note: we also get U tested.

   Alternatively, BURNT: tests B (less common), U, T. T is common.

   Due to the commonality of T and S, I prefer TURNS.

   However, we also must consider: if the secret word is TURNS, then we would get:

      T? U? R? N? S? 
      But we know N is correct at position 4.

   Given the feedback, we have:

      Previous feedback: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A) N(✓) E(x)

      Now, if we guess TURNS:

         T: if present? we don't know.
         U: if present?
         R: we know it is present, but at position 3? it might be correct or incorrect?
         N: at position 4: correct.
         S: if present.

      But if we get:

         T(?) U(?) R(?) N(✓) S(?) 

      If R is indeed at position 3, then we'll get R(✓). Otherwise, if R is at position 1 or 5, we'll get R(-) for position 3? But wait, if R is at position 1, then in TURNS the R at position 3 is an extra? Then we might get feedback:

        If the word has R only at position 1, then in TURNS the first letter T is compared: 
          - If T is the first letter? If not, T might be x or -.
          - Then U: same.
          - Then R at position 3: compared to secret position 3 -> if not R, then we would mark it as - (since there is an R at position 1) but we already matched?

      The feedback rules: 
        - First, mark exact matches: if the letter in the guess is exactly in the secret word at that position: mark ✓ and remove that occurrence from the secret.
        - Then, mark letters that are in the secret word but not at guessed position: mark - (using the remaining occurrences).

      So if the secret word has two R's? we don't know.

   Given the complexity, we stick to TURNS because it tests T and S, which are common.

   Therefore, I choose TURNS as the next guess.

   But note: TURNS has two letters we haven't tested: T, U, S (and R we know, and N we know).

   This will give us good information.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid reusing R? But we have to include R because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include it? 

   We could ignore R for this guess? But then we may miss the chance to pin its position.

   But we know R is present and we have limited guesses. So we should try to pin R.

   Since putting R at position 3 (as in TURNS) might tell us immediately if R is at position 3: 
        If we get ✓ for R, then we know R is at position 3.
        If we get -, then R is at position 1 or 5? 
        If we get x, but wait: we know R is in the word so it cannot be x? So we should get either ✓ or -.

        But note: if we get x for R in TURNS? That would be impossible because we know R is in the word. So either ✓ or -.

        So actually, if we get ✓ for R, then position 3 is R. 
        If we get -, then R is not at position 3 (but still present) so it must be at 1 or 5.

   So TURNS will help us locate R.

   Therefore, we choose TURNS.

   Guess: TURNS

   Format: <guess>TURNS</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guess (CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(✓), E(x)), we know the following:
- The 4th letter is **N** (correct position).
- The letter **R** is in the secret word but not in the 2nd position.
- The letters C, A, and E are **not** in the word.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Words with **N** in the 4th position.
- Including **R** (but avoiding the 2nd position).
- Excluding C, A, E.
- Testing new common letters (like T, S, U) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **TURNS**:
- **T**, **U**, **R**, **N**, **S** – all valid letters.
- Positions: R is placed at 3rd position (testing if R belongs here).
- Tests T (position 1), U (position 2), S (position 5) – covering common consonants and a vowel.

If R is in the 3rd position, TURNS will confirm with a ✓ (correct) or reveal R’s true position with a - (misplaced).  
New feedback will help narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.

<guess>TURNS</guess>",TURNS,"We are given feedback for Guess 3: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter must be N
 - E is not in the word (x)

 So the secret word has:
   - The letter R, but not in the 2nd position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2).
   - The letter N in the 4th position (so _ _ _ N _)
   - Letters that are not C, A, E. Also, R is present but not at position 2.

 We know the word does not contain C, A, E (from the x's). But note: R is in the word.

 We need to make a second valid guess (this is the fourth guess overall, but the first valid one was CRANE, and now we are on our second valid guess).

 Let's think of words that:
   - Have N in the 4th position.
   - Contain the letter R, but not in the 2nd position.
   - Avoid the letters C, A, E.

 Also, since we only got one correct (N) and one misplaced (R), we want to test other common letters.

 The remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 5.

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, or 5.

 Let's list possible common letters to try: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, U, I, etc.

 We can try a word that has:
   - Position 4: N (fixed)
   - Includes R in either position 1, 3, or 5.
   - Avoids C, A, E.

 Some possibilities:

 To get more information, we can try a word that has R in a new position and includes other common letters.

 Example words with N in the 4th position:

   ...N*

 Since position 4 is N, the word is ? ? ? N ?

 Let me brainstorm:

     SIREN -> but E is not allowed (we have E as x) so skip.
     BORNS -> not a word? not valid.
     HORNS -> H O R N S: let's check: 
        H in position 1, O in 2, R in 3, N in 4, S in 5.
        But we have R in the word? Yes. And R is at position 3 (not 2) so that's a possibility.

   However, we must avoid C, A, E. HORNS has no C, A, E. So it's okay.

   But note: HORNS is a valid word.

   Let's see if we can do better. We also want to test other common letters.

   Another possibility: BURNT -> B U R N T: 
        Position: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5). 
        Avoids C, A, E.

   Or: TURNS -> T U R N S.

   But note: in CRANE, we have R at position 2. In TURNS, R is at position 3. That's acceptable.

 However, we want to maximize information. In HORNS, we would be testing H, O, S. In TURNS, we test T, U, S.

 Another word: BIRTH? -> but position 4 is H, not N. Wrong.

 ORNIS? -> not a common word.

 We need valid words. Also, we haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Consider: STERN -> but E is forbidden. So skip.

 How about: STORK? -> but position 4 is K, not N. Not matching.

 So let's look for words ending with 'N' in the 4th position? Actually, the pattern is _ _ _ N _

 Words: 
  ...N.

 Common words: URN, but wait 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Let me use a dictionary:

   Possible words: 
     BORNS -> not valid? Actually, ""born"" is a word, but ""borns"" is not. So skip.
     CORNS -> has C, which is forbidden? C was x so avoid. Also, A and E forbidden.

   Alternatives:
     HORNS -> valid (horn + s)
     TORNS -> valid (tear past tense? but ""torn"" is the past participle, but ""torns"" is third person of tear? Not common, but acceptable? Actually, Wordle usually takes plurals? Yes, if in the word list.)

   However, Wordle word list accepts plurals? Typically yes.

   Other words: 
     WARNS -> has A? Wait, A is forbidden. No: W-A-R-N-S? But A is at position 2? We have A forbidden? In CRANE, A was at position 3 and we got x. So A is not in the word. So WARNS has A? Actually, W-A-R-N-S: yes, but A is not allowed. So skip.

     YARNS -> has A? Y-A-R-N-S -> A at position 2 -> forbidden.

     The vowel A is forbidden, so we need words without A and without E, and without C.

     Words without A, E, C and with R and N at 4th.

     Let me think: with vowels O, I, U?

     Words: 
        HORNS: H O R N S -> no A, E, C -> valid.
        TORNS: T O R N S -> same.
        BURNT: B U R N T -> no A, E, C -> valid.
        TURNS: T U R N S -> valid.
        FURNS? not a word? Furn is a root? Furnace. Skip.
        GURNS? Not common.

     Other?: 
        LORNS? Not common.
        KURNS? Not common.

     So common words: HORNS, TORNS, BURNT, TURNS, etc.

 Now, to decide: 

   We also haven't tested whether the word has O or U? We don't know.

   We can also consider: if we use HORNS, we test H, O, S (and R again, and N is fixed).

   With BURNT, we test B, U, R, N, T.

   Let me look at common letters.

   Alternatively, we can try to reuse the information: we know R is somewhere. We can try to put R at different positions.

   But note: we have N fixed at position 4. So:

   Pattern: _ _ R N _ -> then R is at position 3. 
   Pattern: R _ _ N _ -> R at 1.
   Pattern: _ _ _ N R -> R at 5.

   We can make a guess that tries R at one of these positions and introduces new letters.

   Since we have only one misplaced letter (R), we should try to include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

   We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus C, A, E).

   We should prioritize common letters: like S, T, L, O, U, I.

   Let me form a word:

      Option: Using R at position 1: 
        R _ _ N _ : avoid C, A, E -> e.g., ROMAN -> has A (forbidden) -> skip.
                   ROBIN -> has B and I, but B and I not tested. However, ROMAN is invalid because of A.

        With R at 1: e.g., ROSIN -> R O S I N: but that would have two Ns? N is at position 5? Then position 4 is I? But we need position 4 to be N? Wait no: in ROSIN, pattern: R(1),O(2),S(3),I(4),N(5). But in our case, the 4th letter is N. So that word has the 5th as N? Not matching. 

        Correct pattern: R _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and the last letter is unknown.

        Example: ROUND: has U and D, but also O? But R O U N D -> that has O, U, N, D. But U is new. However, note: we have N at 4th? In ROUND: O is at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5 -> yes.

        But we must avoid A, E, C. ROUND: R, O, U, N, D -> no A, E, C? Yes. 

        However, we already have R in the word? Yes, but we are testing R at position 1? That's acceptable because we know R is in the word. And by placing it at position 1, we can check if it belongs there.

        But note: we are also testing O, U, D.

        However, the word ROUND: 
          - R at 1: if the secret word has R at 1, we'll get ✓, else if R is elsewhere we might get - or x? But we already know R is present (from earlier feedback) so if at position 1 it's not R, we'll get -? Unless the secret word has two R's? But we don't know that.

        We don't have information on duplicate letters.

        Alternatively, we can avoid repeating R? But we know it's present so we can reuse it to try to locate the position.

      But wait: the feedback for R in CRANE was ""-"" meaning it's present but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1 in ROUND, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get ✓. If the secret word has R at position 3 or 5, then we'll get R at position 1 as - (if R is at another position) or x? But the rules: the feedback gives ""-"" if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. And since we know R is in the word, putting R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1: ✓; else: -.

        Actually, the feedback always considers occurrences: 
          - First, mark the exact matches. 
          - Then, for letters that are present in the word but in wrong positions, mark them with ""-"", but only for the remaining available ones.

        So if we put R at position 1 and the secret word has R only at position 3, then we'll get a ""-"" for the R at position 1? And then the R at the secret word's position 3 will be consumed? Then if we have another R? That's complex.

        To avoid confusion, and since we know R is present, we can try to put R in a new position to see if we can pin it down.

      Our goal is to maximize information. So we can try a word with R in a new position and new letters.

      Options:

        Put R at position 1: R _ _ N _
        Words: ROUND, RUBIN? (but RUBIN has U, B, I; and I at 4? Wait, RUBIN: R U B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> not matching.

        How about: RUSIN? -> not a word.

        How about: ROUT -> 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: ROUTS? But N is at 4th? No.

        We must have the pattern: ? ? ? N ? and with R at 1: R ? ? N ?

        Another word: ROBIN? -> R O B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> skip.

        Actually, for position 4 to be N, the word must be ? ? ? N ?.

        R followed by two letters then N and then one letter: R a b N c.

        Valid words: 
          RAHNS? Not valid.
          ROINS? -> ROINS is not common? But R O I N S -> pattern R O I N S -> position 4 is N? Actually: 
            position1: R, pos2: O, pos3: I, pos4: N?, but then S at 5. So that is ROINS? Not a standard word? Skip.

        RATIONS? But that's 7 letters.

        I think I'm stuck with words like ROUND? But ROUND: 
          R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches the pattern.

        And ROUND has no A, E, C -> so it's acceptable.

        Put R at position 3: 
          Pattern: _ _ R N _
          Example: BURNT: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5)
          Or TURNS: T(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), S(5)

        Put R at position 5:
          Pattern: _ _ _ N R
          Example: MINER? But E is forbidden -> skip.
                   LINER? E forbidden.
                   How about: BUNKR? Not valid. Or DOWNR? No.

          There are few words with R at the end and N in the middle? 

          Example: TENOR: T E N O R -> has E? forbidden. Skip.
                   MANOR: M A N O R -> has A? forbidden. Skip.
                   VAN?R: not valid.

          It's hard. Let me try: 
          Words ending in R: with N at position 4: then the word is ? ? ? N R.
          But the letter at position 3 must be a letter that combines with N to form ...NR.

          Common words: MINER? forbidden. DINER? forbidden. WINNER? double N? Not N at position 4: 
            W I N N E R: position 4 is N? Actually, WINNER: position1:W,2:I,3:N,4:N? Then E and R. But two Ns? 
            We don't have feedback about double letters? But also has E -> forbidden.

          Another: DONOR? D O N O R -> position 4 is the second O? And N is at position 3 -> so not matching? 
          We need N at 4: DONOR: D(1), O(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> so N is at position 3 -> skip.

          So R at position 5 seems difficult.

   Therefore, it's easier to try R at position 3: BURNT or TURNS? Or HORNS (with R at position 3: H O R N S).

   Now, comparing:

   Option 1: ROUND (R at position 1): 
        Tests letters: R (at 1), O (2), U (3), N (4) fixed, D (5). 
        We know N is fixed so we don't learn new about position 4. 
        We test new letters: O, U, D.

   Option 2: BURNT (R at position 3):
        Tests letters: B (1), U (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, T (5). 
        Tests new: B, U, T.

   Option 3: HORNS (R at position 3):
        Tests: H (1), O (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, S (5). 
        Tests new: H, O, S.

   All are valid.

   We want to cover common letters. Common letters: S, T, L, ... We haven't tested S or T.

   So TURNS: T (1), U (2), R (3), N (4), S (5) -> tests T, U, S. That covers T and S, both common.

   Also, note: with TURNS, we test T at position 1, U at 2, R at 3, S at 5.

   This seems efficient because we test two very common consonants: T and S.

   But note: we also get U tested.

   Alternatively, BURNT: tests B (less common), U, T. T is common.

   Due to the commonality of T and S, I prefer TURNS.

   However, we also must consider: if the secret word is TURNS, then we would get:

      T? U? R? N? S? 
      But we know N is correct at position 4.

   Given the feedback, we have:

      Previous feedback: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A) N(✓) E(x)

      Now, if we guess TURNS:

         T: if present? we don't know.
         U: if present?
         R: we know it is present, but at position 3? it might be correct or incorrect?
         N: at position 4: correct.
         S: if present.

      But if we get:

         T(?) U(?) R(?) N(✓) S(?) 

      If R is indeed at position 3, then we'll get R(✓). Otherwise, if R is at position 1 or 5, we'll get R(-) for position 3? But wait, if R is at position 1, then in TURNS the R at position 3 is an extra? Then we might get feedback:

        If the word has R only at position 1, then in TURNS the first letter T is compared: 
          - If T is the first letter? If not, T might be x or -.
          - Then U: same.
          - Then R at position 3: compared to secret position 3 -> if not R, then we would mark it as - (since there is an R at position 1) but we already matched?

      The feedback rules: 
        - First, mark exact matches: if the letter in the guess is exactly in the secret word at that position: mark ✓ and remove that occurrence from the secret.
        - Then, mark letters that are in the secret word but not at guessed position: mark - (using the remaining occurrences).

      So if the secret word has two R's? we don't know.

   Given the complexity, we stick to TURNS because it tests T and S, which are common.

   Therefore, I choose TURNS as the next guess.

   But note: TURNS has two letters we haven't tested: T, U, S (and R we know, and N we know).

   This will give us good information.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid reusing R? But we have to include R because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include it? 

   We could ignore R for this guess? But then we may miss the chance to pin its position.

   But we know R is present and we have limited guesses. So we should try to pin R.

   Since putting R at position 3 (as in TURNS) might tell us immediately if R is at position 3: 
        If we get ✓ for R, then we know R is at position 3.
        If we get -, then R is at position 1 or 5? 
        If we get x, but wait: we know R is in the word so it cannot be x? So we should get either ✓ or -.

        But note: if we get x for R in TURNS? That would be impossible because we know R is in the word. So either ✓ or -.

        So actually, if we get ✓ for R, then position 3 is R. 
        If we get -, then R is not at position 3 (but still present) so it must be at 1 or 5.

   So TURNS will help us locate R.

   Therefore, we choose TURNS.

   Guess: TURNS

   Format: <guess>TURNS</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guess (CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(✓), E(x)), we know the following:
- The 4th letter is **N** (correct position).
- The letter **R** is in the secret word but not in the 2nd position.
- The letters C, A, and E are **not** in the word.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Words with **N** in the 4th position.
- Including **R** (but avoiding the 2nd position).
- Excluding C, A, E.
- Testing new common letters (like T, S, U) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **TURNS**:
- **T**, **U**, **R**, **N**, **S** – all valid letters.
- Positions: R is placed at 3rd position (testing if R belongs here).
- Tests T (position 1), U (position 2), S (position 5) – covering common consonants and a vowel.

If R is in the 3rd position, TURNS will confirm with a ✓ (correct) or reveal R’s true position with a - (misplaced).  
New feedback will help narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.",Guess 4: TURNS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(x) R(-) N(✓) S(x),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the properties:
 - We want to cover as many common letters as possible.
 - The word should have 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 According to various sources, one of the best starting words is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 Since we are allowed only 5-letter words, I'll choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the problem says: ""return your guessed word in the format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So, for the first guess, I will use ""CRANE"".

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user made a first guess of ""guessed-word"", but that is not a 5-letter word. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the response format.

 The user's instruction: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.""

 However, in the example, the word to be guessed should be a valid 5-letter word. The placeholder ""guessed-word"" should be replaced by an actual word.

 Since the first guess was invalid, I need to make a valid first guess.

 Let me choose a valid 5-letter word for the first guess.

 Common starting words in Wordle include:
 - CRANE
 - SLATE
 - TRACE
 - ROAST
 - ADIEU

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular and effective starting word.

 Important: The response must be in the exact format: <guess>CRANE</guess>

 But note: the user said ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"", so this is the first guess.

 However, the previous feedback says: ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters."" 
 This indicates that my previous response was invalid because I used the placeholder ""guessed-word"" instead of an actual word.

 Therefore, I must output a valid 5-letter word in the <guess> tags.

 Let me correct that and use ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess>

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user has indicated that my first two attempts were invalid because I used the placeholder ""guessed-word"" instead of an actual 5-letter word.
 I need to make a valid first guess. Since the previous two were invalid, this is effectively the first guess.

 I will choose a common starting word that is known to be effective in Wordle. A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants, and ideally no repeated letters.

 Some of the best starting words include:
 - CRANE: uses C, R, A, N, E (covers common letters)
 - SLATE: uses S, L, A, T, E (also very common)
 - ROAST: uses R, O, A, S, T

 I will go with ""CRANE"" for this guess.

 However, note that the user's feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" for the previous guesses. So I must ensure that the word I choose is exactly 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is 5 letters and is a valid English word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CRANE"".

 But the response format must be: <guess>CRANE</guess>

 However, the instruction says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"". 
 But in the example, the word is placed without spaces. So it should be <guess>CRANE</guess> without the word ""guessed-word"".

 I think the placeholder ""guessed-word"" was meant to be replaced by the actual word.

 So for this guess, I will output: <guess>CRANE</guess>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 3: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter must be N
 - E is not in the word (x)

 So the secret word has:
   - The letter R, but not in the 2nd position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2).
   - The letter N in the 4th position (so _ _ _ N _)
   - Letters that are not C, A, E. Also, R is present but not at position 2.

 We know the word does not contain C, A, E (from the x's). But note: R is in the word.

 We need to make a second valid guess (this is the fourth guess overall, but the first valid one was CRANE, and now we are on our second valid guess).

 Let's think of words that:
   - Have N in the 4th position.
   - Contain the letter R, but not in the 2nd position.
   - Avoid the letters C, A, E.

 Also, since we only got one correct (N) and one misplaced (R), we want to test other common letters.

 The remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 5.

 We know R is in the word but not at position 2. So R could be at positions 1, 3, or 5.

 Let's list possible common letters to try: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, U, I, etc.

 We can try a word that has:
   - Position 4: N (fixed)
   - Includes R in either position 1, 3, or 5.
   - Avoids C, A, E.

 Some possibilities:

 To get more information, we can try a word that has R in a new position and includes other common letters.

 Example words with N in the 4th position:

   ...N*

 Since position 4 is N, the word is ? ? ? N ?

 Let me brainstorm:

   Possible words: 
     SIREN -> but E is not allowed (we have E as x) so skip.
     BORNS -> not a word? not valid.
     HORNS -> H O R N S: let's check: 
        H in position 1, O in 2, R in 3, N in 4, S in 5.
        But we have R in the word? Yes. And R is at position 3 (not 2) so that's a possibility.

   However, we must avoid C, A, E. HORNS has no C, A, E. So it's okay.

   But note: HORNS is a valid word.

   Let's see if we can do better. We also want to test other common letters.

   Another possibility: BURNT -> B U R N T: 
        Position: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5). 
        Avoids C, A, E.

   Or: TURNS -> T U R N S.

   But note: in CRANE, we have R at position 2. In TURNS, R is at position 3. That's acceptable.

 However, we want to maximize information. In HORNS, we would be testing H, O, S. In TURNS, we test T, U, S.

 Another word: BIRTH? -> but position 4 is H, not N. Wrong.

 ORNIS? -> not a common word.

 We need valid words. Also, we haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Consider: STERN -> but E is forbidden. So skip.

 How about: STORK? -> but position 4 is K, not N. Not matching.

 So let's look for words ending with 'N' in the 4th position? Actually, the pattern is _ _ _ N _

 Words: 
  ...N.

 Common words: URN, but wait 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Let me use a dictionary:

   Possible words: 
     BORNS -> not valid? Actually, ""born"" is a word, but ""borns"" is not. So skip.
     CORNS -> has C, which is forbidden? C was x so avoid. Also, A and E forbidden.

   Alternatives:
     HORNS -> valid (horn + s)
     TORNS -> valid (tear past tense? but ""torn"" is the past participle, but ""torns"" is third person of tear? Not common, but acceptable? Actually, Wordle usually takes plurals? Yes, if in the word list.)

   However, Wordle word list accepts plurals? Typically yes.

   Other words: 
     WARNS -> has A? Wait, A is forbidden. No: W-A-R-N-S? But A is at position 2? We have A forbidden? In CRANE, A was at position 3 and we got x. So A is not in the word. So WARNS has A? Actually, W-A-R-N-S: yes, but A is not allowed. So skip.

     YARNS -> has A? Y-A-R-N-S -> A at position 2 -> forbidden.

     The vowel A is forbidden, so we need words without A and without E, and without C.

     Words without A, E, C and with R and N at 4th.

     Let me think: with vowels O, I, U?

     Words: 
        HORNS: H O R N S -> no A, E, C -> valid.
        TORNS: T O R N S -> same.
        BURNT: B U R N T -> no A, E, C -> valid.
        TURNS: T U R N S -> valid.
        FURNS? not a word? Furn is a root? Furnace. Skip.
        GURNS? Not common.

     Other?: 
        LORNS? Not common.
        KURNS? Not common.

     So common words: HORNS, TORNS, BURNT, TURNS, etc.

 Now, to decide: 

   We also haven't tested whether the word has O or U? We don't know.

   We can also consider: if we use HORNS, we test H, O, S (and R again, and N is fixed).

   With BURNT, we test B, U, R, N, T.

   Let me look at common letters.

   Alternatively, we can try to reuse the information: we know R is somewhere. We can try to put R at different positions.

   But note: we have N fixed at position 4. So:

   Pattern: _ _ R N _ -> then R is at position 3. 
   Pattern: R _ _ N _ -> R at 1.
   Pattern: _ _ _ N R -> R at 5.

   We can make a guess that tries R at one of these positions and introduces new letters.

   Since we have only one misplaced letter (R), we should try to include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

   We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus C, A, E).

   We should prioritize common letters: like S, T, L, O, U, I.

   Let me form a word:

      Option: Using R at position 1: 
        R _ _ N _ : avoid C, A, E -> e.g., ROMAN -> has A (forbidden) -> skip.
                   ROBIN -> has B and I, but B and I not tested. However, ROMAN is invalid because of A.

        With R at 1: e.g., ROSIN -> R O S I N: but that would have two Ns? N is at position 5? Then position 4 is I? But we need position 4 to be N? Wait no: in ROSIN, pattern: R(1),O(2),S(3),I(4),N(5). But in our case, the 4th letter is N. So that word has the 5th as N? Not matching. 

        Correct pattern: R _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and the last letter is unknown.

        Example: ROUND: has U and D, but also O? But R O U N D -> that has O, U, N, D. But U is new. However, note: we have N at 4th? In ROUND: O is at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5 -> yes.

        But we must avoid A, E, C. ROUND: R, O, U, N, D -> no A, E, C? Yes. 

        However, we already have R in the word? Yes, but we are testing R at position 1? That's acceptable because we know R is in the word. And by placing it at position 1, we can check if it belongs there.

        But note: we are also testing O, U, D.

        However, the word ROUND: 
          - R at 1: if the secret word has R at 1, we'll get ✓, else if R is elsewhere we might get - or x? But we already know R is present (from earlier feedback) so if at position 1 it's not R, we'll get -? Unless the secret word has two R's? But we don't know that.

        We don't have information on duplicate letters.

        Alternatively, we can avoid repeating R? But we know it's present so we can reuse it to try to locate the position.

      But wait: the feedback for R in CRANE was ""-"" meaning it's present but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1 in ROUND, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get ✓. If the secret word has R at position 3 or 5, then we'll get R at position 1 as - (if R is at another position) or x? But the rules: the feedback gives ""-"" if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. And since we know R is in the word, putting R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1: ✓; else: -.

        Actually, the feedback always considers occurrences: 
          - First, mark the exact matches. 
          - Then, for letters that are present in the word but in wrong positions, mark them with ""-"", but only for the remaining available ones.

        So if we put R at position 1 and the secret word has R only at position 3, then we'll get a ""-"" for the R at position 1? And then the R at the secret word's position 3 will be consumed? Then if we have another R? That's complex.

        To avoid confusion, and since we know R is present, we can try to put R in a new position to see if we can pin it down.

      Our goal is to maximize information. So we can try a word with R in a new position and new letters.

      Options:

        Put R at position 1: R _ _ N _
        Words: ROUND, RUBIN? (but RUBIN has U, B, I; and I at 4? Wait, RUBIN: R U B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> not matching.

        How about: RUSIN? -> not a word.

        How about: ROUT -> 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: ROUTS? But N is at 4th? No.

        We must have the pattern: ? ? ? N ? and with R at 1: R ? ? N ?

        Another word: ROBIN? -> R O B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> skip.

        Actually, for position 4 to be N, the word must be ? ? ? N ?.

        R followed by two letters then N and then one letter: R a b N c.

        Valid words: 
          RAHNS? Not valid.
          ROINS? -> ROINS is not common? But R O I N S -> pattern R O I N S -> position 4 is N? Actually: 
            position1: R, pos2: O, pos3: I, pos4: N?, but then S at 5. So that is ROINS? Not a standard word? Skip.

        RATIONS? But that's 7 letters.

        I think I'm stuck with words like ROUND? But ROUND: 
          R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches the pattern.

        And ROUND has no A, E, C -> so it's acceptable.

        Put R at position 3: 
          Pattern: _ _ R N _
          Example: BURNT: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5)
          Or TURNS: T(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), S(5)

        Put R at position 5:
          Pattern: _ _ _ N R
          Example: MINER? But E is forbidden -> skip.
                   LINER? E forbidden.
                   How about: BUNKR? Not valid. Or DOWNR? No.

          There are few words with R at the end and N in the middle? 

          Example: TENOR: T E N O R -> has E? forbidden. Skip.
                   MANOR: M A N O R -> has A? forbidden. Skip.
                   VAN?R: not valid.

          It's hard. Let me try: 
          Words ending in R: with N at position 4: then the word is ? ? ? N R.
          But the letter at position 3 must be a letter that combines with N to form ...NR.

          Common words: MINER? forbidden. DINER? forbidden. WINNER? double N? Not N at position 4: 
            W I N N E R: position 4 is N? Actually, WINNER: position1:W,2:I,3:N,4:N? Then E and R. But two Ns? 
            We don't have feedback about double letters? But also has E -> forbidden.

          Another: DONOR? D O N O R -> position 4 is the second O? And N is at position 3 -> so not matching? 
          We need N at 4: DONOR: D(1), O(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> so N is at position 3 -> skip.

          So R at position 5 seems difficult.

   Therefore, it's easier to try R at position 3: BURNT or TURNS? Or HORNS (with R at position 3: H O R N S).

   Now, comparing:

   Option 1: ROUND (R at position 1): 
        Tests letters: R (at 1), O (2), U (3), N (4) fixed, D (5). 
        We know N is fixed so we don't learn new about position 4. 
        We test new letters: O, U, D.

   Option 2: BURNT (R at position 3):
        Tests letters: B (1), U (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, T (5). 
        Tests new: B, U, T.

   Option 3: HORNS (R at position 3):
        Tests: H (1), O (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, S (5). 
        Tests new: H, O, S.

   All are valid.

   We want to cover common letters. Common letters: S, T, L, ... We haven't tested S or T.

   So TURNS: T (1), U (2), R (3), N (4), S (5) -> tests T, U, S. That covers T and S, both common.

   Also, note: with TURNS, we test T at position 1, U at 2, R at 3, S at 5.

   This seems efficient because we test two very common consonants: T and S.

   But note: we also get U tested.

   Alternatively, BURNT: tests B (less common), U, T. T is common.

   Due to the commonality of T and S, I prefer TURNS.

   However, we also must consider: if the secret word is TURNS, then we would get:

      T? U? R? N? S? 
      But we know N is correct at position 4.

   Given the feedback, we have:

      Previous feedback: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A) N(✓) E(x)

      Now, if we guess TURNS:

         T: if present? we don't know.
         U: if present?
         R: we know it is present, but at position 3? it might be correct or incorrect?
         N: at position 4: correct.
         S: if present.

      But if we get:

         T(?) U(?) R(?) N(✓) S(?) 

      If R is indeed at position 3, then we'll get R(✓). Otherwise, if R is at position 1 or 5, we'll get R(-) for position 3? But wait, if R is at position 1, then in TURNS the R at position 3 is an extra? Then we might get feedback:

        If the word has R only at position 1, then in TURNS the first letter T is compared: 
          - If T is the first letter? If not, T might be x or -.
          - Then U: same.
          - Then R at position 3: compared to secret position 3 -> if not R, then we would mark it as - (since there is an R at position 1) but we already matched?

      The feedback rules: 
        - First, mark exact matches: if the letter in the guess is exactly in the secret word at that position: mark ✓ and remove that occurrence from the secret.
        - Then, mark letters that are in the secret word but not at guessed position: mark - (using the remaining occurrences).

      So if the secret word has two R's? we don't know.

   Given the complexity, we stick to TURNS because it tests T and S, which are common.

   Therefore, I choose TURNS as the next guess.

   But note: TURNS has two letters we haven't tested: T, U, S (and R we know, and N we know).

   This will give us good information.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid reusing R? But we have to include R because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include it? 

   We could ignore R for this guess? But then we may miss the chance to pin its position.

   But we know R is present and we have limited guesses. So we should try to pin R.

   Since putting R at position 3 (as in TURNS) might tell us immediately if R is at position 3: 
        If we get ✓ for R, then we know R is at position 3.
        If we get -, then R is at position 1 or 5? 
        If we get x, but wait: we know R is in the word so it cannot be x? So we should get either ✓ or -.

        But note: if we get x for R in TURNS? That would be impossible because we know R is in the word. So either ✓ or -.

        So actually, if we get ✓ for R, then position 3 is R. 
        If we get -, then R is not at position 3 (but still present) so it must be at 1 or 5.

   So TURNS will help us locate R.

   Therefore, we choose TURNS.

   Guess: TURNS

   Format: <guess>TURNS</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guess (CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(✓), E(x)), we know the following:
- The 4th letter is **N** (correct position).
- The letter **R** is in the secret word but not in the 2nd position.
- The letters C, A, and E are **not** in the word.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Words with **N** in the 4th position.
- Including **R** (but avoiding the 2nd position).
- Excluding C, A, E.
- Testing new common letters (like T, S, U) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **TURNS**:
- **T**, **U**, **R**, **N**, **S** – all valid letters.
- Positions: R is placed at 3rd position (testing if R belongs here).
- Tests T (position 1), U (position 2), S (position 5) – covering common consonants and a vowel.

If R is in the 3rd position, TURNS will confirm with a ✓ (correct) or reveal R’s true position with a - (misplaced).  
New feedback will help narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.

Y-A-R-N-S -> A at position 2 -> forbidden.\n\n     The vowel A is forbidden, so we need words without A and without E, and without C.\n\n     Words without A, E, C and with R and N at 4th.\n\n     Let me think: with vowels O, I, U?\n\n     Words: \n        HORNS: H O R N S -> no A, E, C -> valid.\n        TORNS: T O R N S -> same.\n        BURNT: B U R N T -> no A, E, C -> valid.\n        TURNS: T U R N S -> valid.\n        FURNS? not a word? Furn is a root? Furnace. Skip.\n        GURNS? Not common.\n\n     Other?: \n        LORNS? Not common.\n        KURNS? Not common.\n\n     So common words: HORNS, TORNS, BURNT, TURNS, etc.\n\n Now, to decide: \n\n   We also haven\'t tested whether the word has O or U? We don\'t know.\n\n   We can also consider: if we use HORNS, we test H, O, S (and R again, and N is fixed).\n\n   With BURNT, we test B, U, R, N, T.\n\n   Let me look at common letters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to reuse the information: we know R is somewhere. We can try to put R at different positions.\n\n   But note: we have N fixed at position 4. So:\n\n   Pattern: _ _ R N _ -> then R is at position 3. \n   Pattern: R _ _ N _ -> R at 1.\n   Pattern: _ _ _ N R -> R at 5.\n\n   We can make a guess that tries R at one of these positions and introduces new letters.\n\n   Since we have only one misplaced letter (R), we should try to include other vowels or consonants that haven\'t been tested.\n\n   We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus C, A, E).\n\n   We should prioritize common letters: like S, T, L, O, U, I.\n\n   Let me form a word:\n\n      Option: Using R at position 1: \n        R _ _ N _ : avoid C, A, E -> e.g., ROMAN -> has A (forbidden) -> skip.\n                   ROBIN -> has B and I, but B and I not tested. However, ROMAN is invalid because of A.\n\n        With R at 1: e.g., ROSIN -> R O S I N: but that would have two Ns? N is at position 5? Then position 4 is I? But we need position 4 to be N? Wait no: in ROSIN, pattern: R(1),O(2),S(3),I(4),N(5). But in our case, the 4th letter is N. So that word has the 5th as N? Not matching. \n\n        Correct pattern: R _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and the last letter is unknown.\n\n        Example: ROUND: has U and D, but also O? But R O U N D -> that has O, U, N, D. But U is new. However, note: we have N at 4th? In ROUND: O is at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5 -> yes.\n\n        But we must avoid A, E, C. ROUND: R, O, U, N, D -> no A, E, C? Yes. \n\n        However, we already have R in the word? Yes, but we are testing R at position 1? That\'s acceptable because we know R is in the word. And by placing it at position 1, we can check if it belongs there.\n\n        But note: we are also testing O, U, D.\n\n        However, the word ROUND: \n          - R at 1: if the secret word has R at 1, we\'ll get ✓, else if R is elsewhere we might get - or x? But we already know R is present (from earlier feedback) so if at position 1 it\'s not R, we\'ll get -? Unless the secret word has two R\'s? But we don\'t know that.\n\n        We don\'t have information on duplicate letters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid repeating R? But we know it\'s present so we can reuse it to try to locate the position.\n\n      But wait: the feedback for R in CRANE was ""-"" meaning it\'s present but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1 in ROUND, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we\'ll get ✓. If the secret word has R at position 3 or 5, then we\'ll get R at position 1 as - (if R is at another position) or x? But the rules: the feedback gives ""-"" if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. And since we know R is in the word, putting R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1: ✓; else: -.\n\n        Actually, the feedback always considers occurrences: \n          - First, mark the exact matches. \n          - Then, for letters that are present in the word but in wrong positions, mark them with ""-"", but only for the remaining available ones.\n\n        So if we put R at position 1 and the secret word has R only at position 3, then we\'ll get a ""-"" for the R at position 1? And then the R at the secret word\'s position 3 will be consumed? Then if we have another R? That\'s complex.\n\n        To avoid confusion, and since we know R is present, we can try to put R in a new position to see if we can pin it down.\n\n      Our goal is to maximize information. So we can try a word with R in a new position and new letters.\n\n      Options:\n\n        Put R at position 1: R _ _ N _\n        Words: ROUND, RUBIN? (but RUBIN has U, B, I; and I at 4? Wait, RUBIN: R U B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> not matching.\n\n        How about: RUSIN? -> not a word.\n\n        How about: ROUT -> 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: ROUTS? But N is at 4th? No.\n\n        We must have the pattern: ? ? ? N ? and with R at 1: R ? ? N ?\n\n        Another word: ROBIN? -> R O B I N -> position 4 is I, not N -> skip.\n\n        Actually, for position 4 to be N, the word must be ? ? ? N ?.\n\n        R followed by two letters then N and then one letter: R a b N c.\n\n        Valid words: \n          RAHNS? Not valid.\n          ROINS? -> ROINS is not common? But R O I N S -> pattern R O I N S -> position 4 is N? Actually: \n            position1: R, pos2: O, pos3: I, pos4: N?, but then S at 5. So that is ROINS? Not a standard word? Skip.\n\n        RATIONS? But that\'s 7 letters.\n\n        I think I\'m stuck with words like ROUND? But ROUND: \n          R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches the pattern.\n\n        And ROUND has no A, E, C -> so it\'s acceptable.\n\n        Put R at position 3: \n          Pattern: _ _ R N _\n          Example: BURNT: B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5)\n          Or TURNS: T(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), S(5)\n\n        Put R at position 5:\n          Pattern: _ _ _ N R\n          Example: MINER? But E is forbidden -> skip.\n                   LINER? E forbidden.\n                   How about: BUNKR? Not valid. Or DOWNR? No.\n\n          There are few words with R at the end and N in the middle? \n\n          Example: TENOR: T E N O R -> has E? forbidden. Skip.\n                   MANOR: M A N O R -> has A? forbidden. Skip.\n                   VAN?R: not valid.\n\n          It\'s hard. Let me try: \n          Words ending in R: with N at position 4: then the word is ? ? ? N R.\n          But the letter at position 3 must be a letter that combines with N to form ...NR.\n\n          Common words: MINER? forbidden. DINER? forbidden. WINNER? double N? Not N at position 4: \n            W I N N E R: position 4 is N? Actually, WINNER: position1:W,2:I,3:N,4:N? Then E and R. But two Ns? \n            We don\'t have feedback about double letters? But also has E -> forbidden.\n\n          Another: DONOR? D O N O R -> position 4 is the second O? And N is at position 3 -> so not matching? \n          We need N at 4: DONOR: D(1), O(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> so N is at position 3 -> skip.\n\n          So R at position 5 seems difficult.\n\n   Therefore, it\'s easier to try R at position 3: BURNT or TURNS? Or HORNS (with R at position 3: H O R N S).\n\n   Now, comparing:\n\n   Option 1: ROUND (R at position 1): \n        Tests letters: R (at 1), O (2), U (3), N (4) fixed, D (5). \n        We know N is fixed so we don\'t learn new about position 4. \n        We test new letters: O, U, D.\n\n   Option 2: BURNT (R at position 3):\n        Tests letters: B (1), U (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, T (5). \n        Tests new: B, U, T.\n\n   Option 3: HORNS (R at position 3):\n        Tests: H (1), O (2), R (3), N (4) fixed, S (5). \n        Tests new: H, O, S.\n\n   All are valid.\n\n   We want to cover common letters. Common letters: S, T, L, ... We haven\'t tested S or T.\n\n   So TURNS: T (1), U (2), R (3), N (4), S (5) -> tests T, U, S. That covers T and S, both common.\n\n   Also, note: with TURNS, we test T at position 1, U at 2, R at 3, S at 5.\n\n   This seems efficient because we test two very common consonants: T and S.\n\n   But note: we also get U tested.\n\n   Alternatively, BURNT: tests B (less common), U, T. T is common.\n\n   Due to the commonality of T and S, I prefer TURNS.\n\n   However, we also must consider: if the secret word is TURNS, then we would get:\n\n      T? U? R? N? S? \n      But we know N is correct at position 4.\n\n   Given the feedback, we have:\n\n      Previous feedback: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A) N(✓) E(x)\n\n      Now, if we guess TURNS:\n\n         T: if present? we don\'t know.\n         U: if present?\n         R: we know it is present, but at position 3? it might be correct or incorrect?\n         N: at position 4: correct.\n         S: if present.\n\n      But if we get:\n\n         T(?) U(?) R(?) N(✓) S(?) \n\n      If R is indeed at position 3, then we\'ll get R(✓). Otherwise, if R is at position 1 or 5, we\'ll get R(-) for position 3? But wait, if R is at position 1, then in TURNS the R at position 3 is an extra? Then we might get feedback:\n\n        If the word has R only at position 1, then in TURNS the first letter T is compared: \n          - If T is the first letter? If not, T might be x or -.\n          - Then U: same.\n          - Then R at position 3: compared to secret position 3 -> if not R, then we would mark it as - (since there is an R at position 1) but we already matched?\n\n      The feedback rules: \n        - First, mark exact matches: if the letter in the guess is exactly in the secret word at that position: mark ✓ and remove that occurrence from the secret.\n        - Then, mark letters that are in the secret word but not at guessed position: mark - (using the remaining occurrences).\n\n      So if the secret word has two R\'s? we don\'t know.\n\n   Given the complexity, we stick to TURNS because it tests T and S, which are common.\n\n   Therefore, I choose TURNS as the next guess.\n\n   But note: TURNS has two letters we haven\'t tested: T, U, S (and R we know, and N we know).\n\n   This will give us good information.\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid reusing R? But we have to include R because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include it? \n\n   We could ignore R for this guess? But then we may miss the chance to pin its position.\n\n   But we know R is present and we have limited guesses. So we should try to pin R.\n\n   Since putting R at position 3 (as in TURNS) might tell us immediately if R is at position 3: \n        If we get ✓ for R, then we know R is at position 3.\n        If we get -, then R is at position 1 or 5? \n        If we get x, but wait: we know R is in the word so it cannot be x? So we should get either ✓ or -.\n\n        But note: if we get x for R in TURNS? That would be impossible because we know R is in the word. So either ✓ or -.\n\n        So actually, if we get ✓ for R, then position 3 is R. \n        If we get -, then R is not at position 3 (but still present) so it must be at 1 or 5.\n\n   So TURNS will help us locate R.\n\n   Therefore, we choose TURNS.\n\n   Guess: TURNS\n\n   Format: <guess>TURNS</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guess (CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(✓), E(x)), we know the following:\n- The 4th letter is **N** (correct position).\n- The letter **R** is in the secret word but not in the 2nd position.\n- The letters C, A, and E are **not** in the word.\n\nFor the next guess, we prioritize:\n- Words with **N** in the 4th position.\n- Including **R** (but avoiding the 2nd position).\n- Excluding C, A, E.\n- Testing new common letters (like T, S, U) to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **TURNS**:\n- **T**, **U**, **R**, **N**, **S** – all valid letters.\n- Positions: R is placed at 3rd position (testing if R belongs here).\n- Tests T (position 1), U (position 2), S (position 5) – covering common consonants and a vowel.\n\nIf R is in the 3rd position, TURNS will confirm with a ✓ (correct) or reveal R’s true position with a - (misplaced).  \nNew feedback will help narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.\n\n<guess>TURNS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 3: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 4: TURNS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(x) R(-) N(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 4: TURNS -> T(x) U(x) R(-) N(✓) S(x)

 This means:
 - T is not in the word (x)
 - U is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) -> but note: we already knew R was in the word from the previous guess (CRANE). However, now we know that R is not at position 3 (since in TURNS, R is at position 3 and we got a - meaning it's not there). 
 - N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> 4th letter is N (we already knew this)
 - S is not in the word (x)

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has the 4th letter as N: _ _ _ N _
   - The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from TURNS). Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.
   - The word does not contain: C, A, E, T, U, S (from the x's in both guesses). Also, we have tested and excluded T, U, S in this guess.

 We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, S (excluding the ones we know are in: R and N)

 The remaining letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that:
   - Has N at position 4.
   - Contains R, which must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).
   - Does not contain C, A, E, T, U, S.

 Let's consider the two cases:

 Case 1: R at position 1 -> R _ _ N _
 Case 2: R at position 5 -> _ _ _ N R

 We also need to fill the other positions with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the excluded letters.

 We should choose a word that tests as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to find words for each case:

 Case 1: R at position 1: R ? ? N ?
   We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters not in {C, A, E, T, U, S} and not R (unless duplicate allowed? but we don't know if there are duplicates, so avoid for now to be safe?).

   Possible words:
     R O ? N ? 
        R O M A N -> has A -> invalid.
        R O B I N -> has I and B, but position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be N. So R O B I N: 
            R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need N at 4, so this has N at 5 -> skip.
        R O W N ? -> R O W N D? (not a word) or R O W N S? (S excluded) -> skip.

     R I ? N ? 
        R I D G N? -> not 5 letters? R I D G E -> has E -> invalid.

     R H ? N ? 
        R H Y M N? -> R H Y M N: not a common word? and Y is at position 3? But we need 5 letters: R, H, Y, M, N -> but that's 5: R(1), H(2), Y(3), M(4)? -> but we need N at 4 -> skip.

     R O I N ? -> but that would be 4 letters? 

     How about: R O M N ? -> not a word.

     Another: R A N K S -> but A and S excluded.

     Without A and E, it's hard. Let me think of common words.

     R O U N D -> but U is excluded.

     R O B N ? -> not a word.

     R I N G ? -> but R I N G is 4 letters.

     Actually, we need 5 letters. How about: 
        R O W N Y? -> not a word.

     This case is difficult. Let me try Case 2.

 Case 2: R at position 5: _ _ _ N R
   Pattern: ? ? ? N R

   We need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters not in {C, A, E, T, U, S} and not R (unless duplicate).

   Possible words:
     ? ? ? N R -> 
        M I N O R -> M(1), I(2), N(3)? -> but we need N at position 4? 
          Actually, M I N O R: 
            position1: M, 2: I, 3: N, 4: O, 5: R -> so position 4 is O, not N -> skip.

        How about: D O N O R -> D(1), O(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 4 is O -> skip.

        We need position 4 to be N: so the word must have the 4th letter as N and the 5th as R.

        So the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, R.

        Example: 
          WINNER? -> W I N N E R -> has E and two Ns? Also, position 4 is the second N? 
          But we have: W(1), I(2), N(3), N(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded -> skip.

        Other: 
          BANNER? -> has A and E -> skip.
          DINNER? -> has D, I, N, N, E -> E excluded -> skip.

        How about: MINER? -> M I N E R -> has E -> skip.

        Without E, what words end with ""NR""? 

        Let me think: 
          There's ""DINR"" not a word. 
          ""LINR"" not a word.

        Perhaps: 
          DOWNR? -> not a word.

        I'm struggling. Maybe we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? 

        But we haven't encountered any duplicates so far.

        Another idea: 
          The word might be: H O N K R? -> not a word.

        Or: B O N K R? -> not a word.

        How about: J O N K R? -> not a word.

        This case seems difficult.

 Given the difficulty, let's reconsider Case 1: R at position 1.

 We need words: R ? ? N ? 

 Without A, E, T, U, S, C.

 Let me list possible words:

   R O M N ? -> not a word.

   R I P E N -> has E -> skip.

   R O P E N -> has E -> skip.

   R A K I N -> has A -> skip.

   R H I N O -> R(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), O(5) -> this matches: 
        Position 4 is N? In RHINO: 
          R(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), O(5) -> yes, position 4 is N.

        And the letters: R, H, I, N, O -> no A, E, T, U, S, C? 
          H, I, O are new.

        This is a valid word: RHINO.

        Also, R is at position 1: we are testing if R is at position 1? We know R is in the word, but if it is at position 1, we'll get ✓. If not, we'll get -? But we have two possibilities: R at 1 or R at 5. 

        If we guess RHINO and R is at position 1, then we get R(✓). 
        If R is actually at position 5, then in RHINO the R at position 1 would be marked as - (because R is present but at a different position). 

        But note: the secret word has only one R? We don't know. But if it has two R's, then we might get - for R at 1 and then later we find R at 5? 

        However, we are trying to test position 1 for R.

        Also, we test H at 2, I at 3, O at 5.

        This seems a good candidate.

   Another word: R O B I N -> but that has N at position 5? 
        R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> so position 4 is I, not N -> skip.

   Another: R A N C H -> has A and C -> skip.

   So RHINO is a good candidate.

   But note: we are not sure if R is at position 1. But by guessing RHINO, we can get information about R's position.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the excluded letters.

   Another candidate for R at position 5: 
        ? ? ? N R -> 
        How about: W H I N R? -> not a word.
                 D W I N R? -> not a word.

        But there is ""DINAR"" -> but has A -> skip.

        ""MINOR"" -> M I N O R: 
            M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 4 is O, not N -> skip.

        ""MANOR"" -> has A -> skip.

        ""TENOR"" -> has E -> skip.

        So I think RHINO is a good choice.

   Therefore, we guess RHINO.

   But note: we are testing R at position 1. If we get R(✓) then we know R is at 1. If we get R(-) then R must be at 5 (since we know it's not at 2,3, and now not at 1).

   Also, we test H, I, O.

   So let's go with RHINO.

   Format: <guess>RHINO</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **N is confirmed at position 4**: The secret word is `_ _ _ N _`.
- **R is in the word but misplaced**: It cannot be at positions 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from TURNS), so it must be at position 1 or 5.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, E, T, U, S are not in the word.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Testing **R at position 1** (to check if it belongs there).
- Using new common letters (**H, I, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoiding excluded letters.

**RHINO** fits perfectly:
- **R** at position 1 (tests if R is correctly placed at 1).
- **H, I, O** are new common letters (not tested before).
- **N** at position 4 (confirmed).
- No excluded letters (C, A, E, T, U, S).

This guess will:
- Confirm if R is at position 1 (✓ or -).
- Reveal if H, I, or O are in the word and their positions.

<guess>RHINO</guess>",RHINO,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: TURNS -> T(x) U(x) R(-) N(✓) S(x)

 This means:
 - T is not in the word (x)
 - U is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) -> but note: we already knew R was in the word from the previous guess (CRANE). However, now we know that R is not at position 3 (since in TURNS, R is at position 3 and we got a - meaning it's not there). 
 - N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> 4th letter is N (we already knew this)
 - S is not in the word (x)

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has the 4th letter as N: _ _ _ N _
   - The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from TURNS). Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.
   - The word does not contain: C, A, E, T, U, S (from the x's in both guesses). Also, we have tested and excluded T, U, S in this guess.

 We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, S (excluding the ones we know are in: R and N)

 The remaining letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that:
   - Has N at position 4.
   - Contains R, which must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).
   - Does not contain C, A, E, T, U, S.

 Let's consider the two cases:

 Case 1: R at position 1 -> R _ _ N _
 Case 2: R at position 5 -> _ _ _ N R

 We also need to fill the other positions with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the excluded letters.

 We should choose a word that tests as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to find words for each case:

 Case 1: R at position 1: R ? ? N ?
   We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters not in {C, A, E, T, U, S} and not R (unless duplicate allowed? but we don't know if there are duplicates, so avoid for now to be safe?).

   Possible words:
     R O ? N ? 
        R O M A N -> has A -> invalid.
        R O B I N -> has I and B, but position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be N. So R O B I N: 
            R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need N at 4, so this has N at 5 -> skip.
        R O W N ? -> R O W N D? (not a word) or R O W N S? (S excluded) -> skip.

     R I ? N ? 
        R I D G N? -> not 5 letters? R I D G E -> has E -> invalid.

     R H ? N ? 
        R H Y M N? -> R H Y M N: not a common word? and Y is at position 3? But we need 5 letters: R, H, Y, M, N -> but that's 5: R(1), H(2), Y(3), M(4)? -> but we need N at 4 -> skip.

     R O I N ? -> but that would be 4 letters? 

     How about: R O M N ? -> not a word.

     Another: R A N K S -> but A and S excluded.

     Without A and E, it's hard. Let me think of common words.

     R O U N D -> but U is excluded.

     R O B N ? -> not a word.

     R I N G ? -> but R I N G is 4 letters.

     Actually, we need 5 letters. How about: 
        R O W N Y? -> not a word.

     This case is difficult. Let me try Case 2.

 Case 2: R at position 5: _ _ _ N R
   Pattern: ? ? ? N R

   We need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters not in {C, A, E, T, U, S} and not R (unless duplicate).

   Possible words:
     ? ? ? N R -> 
        M I N O R -> M(1), I(2), N(3)? -> but we need N at position 4? 
          Actually, M I N O R: 
            position1: M, 2: I, 3: N, 4: O, 5: R -> so position 4 is O, not N -> skip.

        How about: D O N O R -> D(1), O(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 4 is O -> skip.

        We need position 4 to be N: so the word must have the 4th letter as N and the 5th as R.

        So the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, R.

        Example: 
          WINNER? -> W I N N E R -> has E and two Ns? Also, position 4 is the second N? 
          But we have: W(1), I(2), N(3), N(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded -> skip.

        Other: 
          BANNER? -> has A and E -> skip.
          DINNER? -> has D, I, N, N, E -> E excluded -> skip.

        How about: MINER? -> M I N E R -> has E -> skip.

        Without E, what words end with ""NR""? 

        Let me think: 
          There's ""DINR"" not a word. 
          ""LINR"" not a word.

        Perhaps: 
          DOWNR? -> not a word.

        I'm struggling. Maybe we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? 

        But we haven't encountered any duplicates so far.

        Another idea: 
          The word might be: H O N K R? -> not a word.

        Or: B O N K R? -> not a word.

        How about: J O N K R? -> not a word.

        This case seems difficult.

 Given the difficulty, let's reconsider Case 1: R at position 1.

 We need words: R ? ? N ? 

 Without A, E, T, U, S, C.

 Let me list possible words:

   R O M N ? -> not a word.

   R I P E N -> has E -> skip.

   R O P E N -> has E -> skip.

   R A K I N -> has A -> skip.

   R H I N O -> R(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), O(5) -> this matches: 
        Position 4 is N? In RHINO: 
          R(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), O(5) -> yes, position 4 is N.

        And the letters: R, H, I, N, O -> no A, E, T, U, S, C? 
          H, I, O are new.

        This is a valid word: RHINO.

        Also, R is at position 1: we are testing if R is at position 1? We know R is in the word, but if it is at position 1, we'll get ✓. If not, we'll get -? But we have two possibilities: R at 1 or R at 5. 

        If we guess RHINO and R is at position 1, then we get R(✓). 
        If R is actually at position 5, then in RHINO the R at position 1 would be marked as - (because R is present but at a different position). 

        But note: the secret word has only one R? We don't know. But if it has two R's, then we might get - for R at 1 and then later we find R at 5? 

        However, we are trying to test position 1 for R.

        Also, we test H at 2, I at 3, O at 5.

        This seems a good candidate.

   Another word: R O B I N -> but that has N at position 5? 
        R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> so position 4 is I, not N -> skip.

   Another: R A N C H -> has A and C -> skip.

   So RHINO is a good candidate.

   But note: we are not sure if R is at position 1. But by guessing RHINO, we can get information about R's position.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the excluded letters.

   Another candidate for R at position 5: 
        ? ? ? N R -> 
        How about: W H I N R? -> not a word.
                 D W I N R? -> not a word.

        But there is ""DINAR"" -> but has A -> skip.

        ""MINOR"" -> M I N O R: 
            M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 4 is O, not N -> skip.

        ""MANOR"" -> has A -> skip.

        ""TENOR"" -> has E -> skip.

        So I think RHINO is a good choice.

   Therefore, we guess RHINO.

   But note: we are testing R at position 1. If we get R(✓) then we know R is at 1. If we get R(-) then R must be at 5 (since we know it's not at 2,3, and now not at 1).

   Also, we test H, I, O.

   So let's go with RHINO.

   Format: <guess>RHINO</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **N is confirmed at position 4**: The secret word is `_ _ _ N _`.
- **R is in the word but misplaced**: It cannot be at positions 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from TURNS), so it must be at position 1 or 5.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, E, T, U, S are not in the word.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Testing **R at position 1** (to check if it belongs there).
- Using new common letters (**H, I, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoiding excluded letters.

**RHINO** fits perfectly:
- **R** at position 1 (tests if R is correctly placed at 1).
- **H, I, O** are new common letters (not tested before).
- **N** at position 4 (confirmed).
- No excluded letters (C, A, E, T, U, S).

This guess will:
- Confirm if R is at position 1 (✓ or -).
- Reveal if H, I, or O are in the word and their positions.",Guess 5: RHINO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
