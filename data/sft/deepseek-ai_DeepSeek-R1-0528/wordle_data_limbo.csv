We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are still available. We can consider other vowels (like I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, L, D, etc.).

 Since we have eliminated 5 common letters, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Some good starting words without C, R, A, N, E might be:
   - ""SLOTH"": contains S, L, O, T, H
   - ""PIOUS"": contains P, I, O, U, S
   - ""BUILD"": contains B, U, I, L, D

 However, we want to maximize the information. Let's try to include more common letters.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might be: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, P, M, etc.

 We can try ""OUIJA"" but that might be too rare. Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word that uses M, O, I, S, T.

 But note: we must avoid E, so ""MOIST"" is acceptable.

 Another option: ""PULPS"" but that has duplicate P. We should avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

 Let's list some words without the banned letters and without duplicates:

   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T
   - ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y
   - ""LUCKY"": but L, U, C, K, Y -> C is banned? Wait, C is banned because in the first guess C was x. So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, for ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> none of these are in the banned list. This is a good candidate.

 Another candidate: ""GHOUL"": G, H, O, U, L -> also acceptable.

 But ""MOIST"" is more common and has very common letters.

 Alternatively, ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T -> also acceptable.

 However, we want to include a vowel? We have O and I in ""MOIST"", which are vowels.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So, the next guess is ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. My goal is to test other common letters to gather more information. 

I considered words like ""pudgy"" or ""ghoul"" but settled on **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the banned set (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes two vowels (O, I) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, M).
- The word is common in English, maximizing the chance of hitting relevant letters.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> M(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"" tells us:
- M, O, I are in the word but in the wrong positions. So the secret word contains M, O, and I.
- S and T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains M, O, I, and does not contain S, T, or any of C,R,A,N,E.
- Since M, O, I are in the word but not in the positions we guessed (positions 1,2,3 respectively).

From ""moist"":
- M was in position 1 but is wrong position -> so M is not in position 1, but is somewhere else.
- O was in position 2 but wrong -> not position 2.
- I was in position 3 but wrong -> not position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so M, O, I must appear in other positions (4,5 or rearranged).

Additionally, we must avoid the letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Now, we need a word that includes M, O, I, and two new letters that are not in the banned set.

Banned letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Available letters: all except C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

We also know M, O, I must be present, so we must include them, but in positions different from the previous guess.

Structure of the word:
- We know M cannot be in position 1 (because in ""moist"" it was in pos1 and marked wrong position, meaning it must be in another position). Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, and I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for M: 2,3,4,5 -> but note: if M is in position 2, that would be good? But wait: the feedback says M is in the word but not in pos1, but it could be in 2,3,4,5. Similarly for O (cannot be in pos2) and I (cannot be in pos3).

Additionally, since O is in the word but not in pos2, and M not in pos1, I not in pos3.

We have two more letters to fill.

We want to consider common words that have M, O, I and two other letters that are not banned.

List possible words: 

The word must be 5 letters and contain M,O,I, and exclude C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. (Note: vowels: we have O,I, but we might include U or Y as well?).

But the word must include exactly M,O,I and two more letters.

Possible words:

One common word might be ""MOULD"" but we cannot use D? D is allowed because it's not banned. But let's see:

Wait: We don't know the frequency. We might try ""OIL"" but that's 3 letters. Need 5-letter words.

Think of words with M,O,I in them.

Some possibilities:
- ""DEMO"" is 4 letters. Not 5.
- ""MODEL"" -> contains E? E is banned. No.
- ""MOLAR"" -> contains A and R? Banned. No.
- ""GUILD"" -> contains U, I, L, D -> but no M? Doesn't have M.

We must have M,O,I all present.

Another word: ""MUSIC"" -> contains S and C? S and C are banned. No.

""LOGIC"" -> same issue.

""IMP"" is short.

Longer: How about ""MOIST"" we already tried? And it had S,T which are banned now.

We need a word with M,O,I and two other letters. How about ""MOUTH""? But T is banned? T is banned because in ""moist"" we had T as absent.

T is banned, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, S is banned.

So, what about ""MOURN""? But R and N are banned? Yes, R and N are in banned list (from first guess). So forbidden.

""MOVIE"" -> contains V and E? E is banned.

So, E is banned. Avoid E.

Another word: ""BOOMY"" -> not a word? Not valid.

""DOLLY"" -> no M,O,I? We need M,O,I.

Perhaps ""MILKO""? But K and O? O is already included? But ""milko"" isn't a valid word. 

We need valid English words.

Think: words ending with M and containing O,I.

For example: 
- ""IDIOM"" -> contains I,D,I,O,M -> but two I's? And D. Also, the positions?

But note: ""IDIOM"" has letters: I,D,I,O,M -> duplicates I? But that's allowed if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we don't know. The feedback doesn't prohibit duplicates.

Is ""idiom"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have duplicate I: however, in our guess, we can use duplicates even if the secret might not. But to be safe, we should only use it if we must.

But let's see the letters: I, D, I, O, M -> the second I might not be necessary? But we must have I, O, M.

Also, banned letters: we are using I,D,O,M -> D is not banned, I and O and M are required.

Check banned: C,R,A,N,E,S,T -> none of I,D,O,M are banned? M, O, I are required and not banned? Wait: M,O,I are not banned, they are present. D is not banned.

So ""IDIOM"" could be a candidate.

But let's check the positions we know:

In ""idiom"":
- Position 1: I -> but remember, in the word ""moist"", the I was at position 3 and was marked wrong position. That doesn't mean I can't be in position 1 now? The feedback only says I is in the word but not at pos3. It can be at pos1,2,4,5. Similarly, M cannot be at pos1? And O cannot be at pos2.

In ""idiom"":
Pos1: I
Pos2: D
Pos3: I -> but wait, duplicate I? 
Pos4: O
Pos5: M

Now, for I: it appears at pos1 and pos3. But the secret word has I somewhere? From ""moist"", we know I is not at pos3. So if we place I at pos3 again? We might get the same feedback? But note: if the secret word has I, but only one, then we should avoid putting it at pos3 if known wrong.

But the secret could have two I's? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's think of another word without duplicates.

Consider ""MIGHT"" -> but H,G are available? But T is banned? T is banned, so we cannot use T. Similarly, S is banned.

Another word: ""DOING"" -> D,O,I,N,G -> but N is banned? Yes, N is banned from first guess (crane had N absent). So forbidden.

""GOING"" -> same, N banned.

""CHAIN"" -> has C and A and N? banned.

""BUILD"" -> no M or O.

Perhaps ""FRUIT"" -> has R and T? banned.

""BLIMP"" -> B,L,I,M,P. Contains I and M, but not O? We need O too.

We need all three: M,O,I.

Perhaps ""FOIST"" -> but S and T banned? Yes, forbidden.

""VOICE"" -> V,O,I,C,E -> C banned? Yes, C is banned and E banned? Also, two vowels? But C and E are banned.

What about ""MOUND"" -> contains O,U,N,D -> N banned and no I? Doesn't have I.

""POUND"" -> same.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C banned? Yes.

Valid words containing M,O,I and avoiding banned letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

So letters available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Some possibilities:

- ""GUIDO"" -> G,U,I,D,O -> but no M? Doesn't have M.

- ""MOVIE"" -> E banned? Yes.

- ""BIOME"" -> E banned? Yes.

- ""MILOR"" -> not a word and R banned.

Perhaps ""MUSKO"" not real.

""LIMBO"" -> L,I,M,B,O -> letters L,I,M,B,O -> has I,M,O? Yes! And B and L.

Banned letters? L and B are not banned.

So ""LIMBO"" is a valid word.

Letters: L,I,M,B,O -> and avoids C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Now, positions: in ""LIMBO"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I -> but note: previously I was not allowed in position 3? It can be in position 2? Because only pos3 is forbidden by previous feedback? Yes.
- Position 3: M -> but previously M was in pos1 and wrong? So M cannot be in pos1? But it can be in pos3? Yes, because the feedback only forbade pos1 for M. Similarly, O cannot be in pos2? In ""LIMBO"" O is at position 5, which is not 2? Okay.
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: O -> for O: previously was at pos2, so not allowed there? Here at pos5? Okay.

So ""LIMBO"" might be good.

But we need to compare with other options.

Another word: ""MOLLY"" -> contains O,L,M,Y -> no I? Doesn't have I.

""JUMBO"" -> J,U,M,B,O -> missing I? Doesn't have I.

""BUXOM"" -> B,U,X,O,M -> again, no I.

""DOILY"" -> D,O,I,L,Y -> has O,I but no M? Doesn't have M.

Therefore, ""LIMBO"" is a candidate.

But wait: does ""LIMBO"" have any banned letters? No.

Another word: ""DORMY"" -> D,O,R,M,Y -> R banned? Yes! R is banned from the first guess (C,R,A,N,E all absent). So R is banned. Can't use.

""LIMED"" -> E is banned.

So ""LIMBO"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""BIJOU"" -> B,I,J,O,U -> contains U, but no M? Doesn't have M.

""OBIIT"" ? not valid.

Therefore, ""LIMBO"" is a valid word that contains M,O,I (but note: in ""LIMBO"", M and O are present, and I is present) and avoids banned letters.

So guess: ""LIMBO"".

But let's confirm the positions: if we guess ""LIMBO"", we can see where M,O,I are and if they match.

But note: in the secret word, M cannot be in position 1 (from prev), O not in position 2, I not in position 3.

In ""LIMBO"":
- M is in position 3 -> is that okay? Previous feedback said M is in the word but not in pos1. It could be in pos3? Yes.
- O is in position 5 -> not pos2? Okay.
- I is in position 2 -> not pos3? Okay, since position 3 is forbidden but 2 is not.

Therefore, this guess is valid.

We must also ensure that we don't use more than the required letters? No, we are including M,O,I and L,B.

So let's go with ""LIMBO"".

<guess>limbo</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → all x**: Eliminated C, R, A, N, E (not in the word).
- **Guess 2: moist → M(-) O(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)**: 
  - M, O, I are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
  - S and T are eliminated (not in the word).
- **Banned letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (cannot be used).

For the next guess:
- Must include M, O, I (confirmed present) but in positions different from Guess 2 (so M not in position 1, O not in position 2, I not in position 3).
- Add two new, non-banned letters to test (remaining letters like B, D, F, G, H, etc.).

After evaluating options, **LIMBO** is a valid word:
- Contains M, O, I (as required).
- Positions: M (pos 3 → not pos 1), O (pos 5 → not pos 2), I (pos 2 → not pos 3).
- New letters: L and B (not banned).
- Avoids banned letters (C,R,A,N,E,S,T).

This guess efficiently tests M/O/I placements and covers new consonants (L/B) for information.

<guess>limbo</guess>",limbo,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> M(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"" tells us:
- M, O, I are in the word but in the wrong positions. So the secret word contains M, O, and I.
- S and T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains M, O, I, and does not contain S, T, or any of C,R,A,N,E.
- Since M, O, I are in the word but not in the positions we guessed (positions 1,2,3 respectively).

From ""moist"":
- M was in position 1 but is wrong position -> so M is not in position 1, but is somewhere else.
- O was in position 2 but wrong -> not position 2.
- I was in position 3 but wrong -> not position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so M, O, I must appear in other positions (4,5 or rearranged).

Additionally, we must avoid the letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Now, we need a word that includes M, O, I, and two new letters that are not in the banned set.

Banned letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Available letters: all except C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

We also know M, O, I must be present, so we must include them, but in positions different from the previous guess.

Structure of the word:
- We know M cannot be in position 1 (because in ""moist"" it was in pos1 and marked wrong position, meaning it must be in another position). Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, and I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for M: 2,3,4,5 -> but note: if M is in position 2, that would be good? But wait: the feedback says M is in the word but not in pos1, but it could be in 2,3,4,5. Similarly for O (cannot be in pos2) and I (cannot be in pos3).

Additionally, since O is in the word but not in pos2, and M not in pos1, I not in pos3.

We have two more letters to fill.

We want to consider common words that have M, O, I and two other letters that are not banned.

List possible words: 

The word must be 5 letters and contain M,O,I, and exclude C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. (Note: vowels: we have O,I, but we might include U or Y as well?).

But the word must include exactly M,O,I and two more letters.

Possible words:

One common word might be ""MOULD"" but we cannot use D? D is allowed because it's not banned. But let's see:

Wait: We don't know the frequency. We might try ""OIL"" but that's 3 letters. Need 5-letter words.

Think of words with M,O,I in them.

Some possibilities:
- ""DEMO"" is 4 letters. Not 5.
- ""MODEL"" -> contains E? E is banned. No.
- ""MOLAR"" -> contains A and R? Banned. No.
- ""GUILD"" -> contains U, I, L, D -> but no M? Doesn't have M.

We must have M,O,I all present.

Another word: ""MUSIC"" -> contains S and C? S and C are banned. No.

""LOGIC"" -> same issue.

""IMP"" is short.

Longer: How about ""MOIST"" we already tried? And it had S,T which are banned now.

We need a word with M,O,I and two other letters. How about ""MOUTH""? But T is banned? T is banned because in ""moist"" we had T as absent.

T is banned, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, S is banned.

So, what about ""MOURN""? But R and N are banned? Yes, R and N are in banned list (from first guess). So forbidden.

""MOVIE"" -> contains V and E? E is banned.

So, E is banned. Avoid E.

Another word: ""BOOMY"" -> not a word? Not valid.

""DOLLY"" -> no M,O,I? We need M,O,I.

Perhaps ""MILKO""? But K and O? O is already included? But ""milko"" isn't a valid word. 

We need valid English words.

Think: words ending with M and containing O,I.

For example: 
- ""IDIOM"" -> contains I,D,I,O,M -> but two I's? And D. Also, the positions?

But note: ""IDIOM"" has letters: I,D,I,O,M -> duplicates I? But that's allowed if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we don't know. The feedback doesn't prohibit duplicates.

Is ""idiom"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have duplicate I: however, in our guess, we can use duplicates even if the secret might not. But to be safe, we should only use it if we must.

But let's see the letters: I, D, I, O, M -> the second I might not be necessary? But we must have I, O, M.

Also, banned letters: we are using I,D,O,M -> D is not banned, I and O and M are required.

Check banned: C,R,A,N,E,S,T -> none of I,D,O,M are banned? M, O, I are required and not banned? Wait: M,O,I are not banned, they are present. D is not banned.

So ""IDIOM"" could be a candidate.

But let's check the positions we know:

In ""idiom"":
- Position 1: I -> but remember, in the word ""moist"", the I was at position 3 and was marked wrong position. That doesn't mean I can't be in position 1 now? The feedback only says I is in the word but not at pos3. It can be at pos1,2,4,5. Similarly, M cannot be at pos1? And O cannot be at pos2.

In ""idiom"":
Pos1: I
Pos2: D
Pos3: I -> but wait, duplicate I? 
Pos4: O
Pos5: M

Now, for I: it appears at pos1 and pos3. But the secret word has I somewhere? From ""moist"", we know I is not at pos3. So if we place I at pos3 again? We might get the same feedback? But note: if the secret word has I, but only one, then we should avoid putting it at pos3 if known wrong.

But the secret could have two I's? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's think of another word without duplicates.

Consider ""MIGHT"" -> but H,G are available? But T is banned? T is banned, so we cannot use T. Similarly, S is banned.

Another word: ""DOING"" -> D,O,I,N,G -> but N is banned? Yes, N is banned from first guess (crane had N absent). So forbidden.

""GOING"" -> same, N banned.

""CHAIN"" -> has C and A and N? banned.

""BUILD"" -> no M or O.

Perhaps ""FRUIT"" -> has R and T? banned.

""BLIMP"" -> B,L,I,M,P. Contains I and M, but not O? We need O too.

We need all three: M,O,I.

Perhaps ""FOIST"" -> but S and T banned? Yes, forbidden.

""VOICE"" -> V,O,I,C,E -> C banned? Yes, C is banned and E banned? Also, two vowels? But C and E are banned.

What about ""MOUND"" -> contains O,U,N,D -> N banned and no I? Doesn't have I.

""POUND"" -> same.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C banned? Yes.

Valid words containing M,O,I and avoiding banned letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

So letters available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Some possibilities:

- ""GUIDO"" -> G,U,I,D,O -> but no M? Doesn't have M.

- ""MOVIE"" -> E banned? Yes.

- ""BIOME"" -> E banned? Yes.

- ""MILOR"" -> not a word and R banned.

Perhaps ""MUSKO"" not real.

""LIMBO"" -> L,I,M,B,O -> letters L,I,M,B,O -> has I,M,O? Yes! And B and L.

Banned letters? L and B are not banned.

So ""LIMBO"" is a valid word.

Letters: L,I,M,B,O -> and avoids C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

Now, positions: in ""LIMBO"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I -> but note: previously I was not allowed in position 3? It can be in position 2? Because only pos3 is forbidden by previous feedback? Yes.
- Position 3: M -> but previously M was in pos1 and wrong? So M cannot be in pos1? But it can be in pos3? Yes, because the feedback only forbade pos1 for M. Similarly, O cannot be in pos2? In ""LIMBO"" O is at position 5, which is not 2? Okay.
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: O -> for O: previously was at pos2, so not allowed there? Here at pos5? Okay.

So ""LIMBO"" might be good.

But we need to compare with other options.

Another word: ""MOLLY"" -> contains O,L,M,Y -> no I? Doesn't have I.

""JUMBO"" -> J,U,M,B,O -> missing I? Doesn't have I.

""BUXOM"" -> B,U,X,O,M -> again, no I.

""DOILY"" -> D,O,I,L,Y -> has O,I but no M? Doesn't have M.

Therefore, ""LIMBO"" is a candidate.

But wait: does ""LIMBO"" have any banned letters? No.

Another word: ""DORMY"" -> D,O,R,M,Y -> R banned? Yes! R is banned from the first guess (C,R,A,N,E all absent). So R is banned. Can't use.

""LIMED"" -> E is banned.

So ""LIMBO"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""BIJOU"" -> B,I,J,O,U -> contains U, but no M? Doesn't have M.

""OBIIT"" ? not valid.

Therefore, ""LIMBO"" is a valid word that contains M,O,I (but note: in ""LIMBO"", M and O are present, and I is present) and avoids banned letters.

So guess: ""LIMBO"".

But let's confirm the positions: if we guess ""LIMBO"", we can see where M,O,I are and if they match.

But note: in the secret word, M cannot be in position 1 (from prev), O not in position 2, I not in position 3.

In ""LIMBO"":
- M is in position 3 -> is that okay? Previous feedback said M is in the word but not in pos1. It could be in pos3? Yes.
- O is in position 5 -> not pos2? Okay.
- I is in position 2 -> not pos3? Okay, since position 3 is forbidden but 2 is not.

Therefore, this guess is valid.

We must also ensure that we don't use more than the required letters? No, we are including M,O,I and L,B.

So let's go with ""LIMBO"".

<guess>limbo</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → all x**: Eliminated C, R, A, N, E (not in the word).
- **Guess 2: moist → M(-) O(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)**: 
  - M, O, I are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
  - S and T are eliminated (not in the word).
- **Banned letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (cannot be used).

For the next guess:
